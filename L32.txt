L32|The Unfinished Business of State-owned Enterprise Reform in the People’s Republic of China|This paper examines the progress of state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform in the People’s Republic of China. After defining SOEs and considering their scope of operation within the PRC economy, the focus of the paper is on the major reform waves that followed the deterioration of SOE profitability in the early 1990s. The oil industry serves to illustrate industry-specific SOE reform trends as well as the latest reform developments. Until today, a stable, successful, long-term arrangement of state ownership has remained elusive. SOE reform is incomplete as long as a number of fundamental governance issues are not resolved. But these are difficult to resolve in the context of Party-controlled state-owned enterprises.
L32|Effects of Market Structure and Patient Choice on Hospital Quality for Planned Patients|We investigate the change in the effect of market structure on planned hospital quality for three high-volume treatments, using a quasi difference-in-differences approach based on the relaxation of patient constraints on hospital choice in England. We employ control functions to allow for time-varying endogeneity from unobserved patient characteristics. We find that the choice reforms reduced quality for hip and knee replacement but not for coronary bypass, This is likely due to hospitals making a larger loss on hip and knee replacements, since robustness checks rule out changes in length of stay, new competitors’ entry and hospital-level mortality as possible confounders.
L32|The Impact of CEOs in the Public Sector: Evidence from the English NHS|We investigate whether top managers affect the performance of large and complex public sector organizations, using as a case study CEOs of English public hospitals (large, complex organizations with multi-million turnover). We study the extent to which CEOs are differentiated in terms of their pay, as well as a wide range of hospital production measures including inputs, intermediate operational outcomes and clinical outcomes. Pay differentials suggest that the market perceives CEOs to be differentiated. However, we find little evidence of CEOs’ impact on hospital production. These results question the effectiveness of leadership changes to improve performance in the public sector.
L32|International City Network and Public-Private Cooperation Japanese Public Water Services’ Overseas Expansion|Urbanization has progressed in parallel with rapid economic development in Asia, and people living in the region’s megacities face severe urban environmental problems, with the water-environment problem being especially serious. Such cities must develop the infrastructure to provide clean water and process sewage in densely populated areas. Meanwhile, water-supply and sewerage services in Japan are conducted by municipalities as a public service, but their revenues are shrinking in response to a decreasing birthrate, an aging population, and the waterconservation movement. In this study, we investigated the overseas expansion of Japanese public water services as an effort to improve the living environment in developing Asian countries and to advance the sustainability of public water services. The research methods included scrutinizing preliminary research, conducting case studies through text analysis of materials issued by national and local governments, and conducting interviews with municipalities. We examined four urban municipal water services, including ones in Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, and Kitakyushu, that developed publicprivate cooperative platform associations for expanding abroad. As a result of the research, we first identified the overseas expansion of public water services as a collaborative model—based on an international inter-city network—for solving urban problems. Japan’s water-related public and private sectors have a motivation to share their technologies and experiences of solving urban waterrelated environmental problems with the growing cities of Asia, but it is difficult for Japanese public water services to sustain a unilateral contribution to developing countries because their business environment is becoming less hospitable in a shrinking domestic market. Therefore, with national governmental support, major municipal water services in Japan have aimed to expand their business abroad to achieve regional economic development, relying on trust based on the solidarity and cooperation of the international cities to reduce the transaction cost of international water-related project development. Second, we clarify that the public-private cooperative platform established by the leadership of municipalities enhances the accountability and transparency of the overseas expansion projects of public water services. Municipalities hold themselves accountable to be fair to citizens and stakeholders. The Public and private cooperative platform established by Japanese public water service, as an intermediate organization, not only develops the implementation capacity but also strengthens accountability and transparency of the international public water service 5 expansion projects’ sharing information about the water-environment problems of each cities and selecting project partner companies. Third, we find that the international city networks that municipalities build are evolving from one-to-one mutual networks to multilateral networks. To date, municipalities have developed international sister-city networks that centered more on cultural and educational administrative exchanges. Recent years, however, have witnessed the rise of more pragmatic city networks that focus on problem-solving city liaisons. Municipalities are realizing the efficiency of mutual project-making and of participating in international associations or organizations of cities for specific purposes. They even organize international meetings or conferences at which they seek business partner cities, promote their environment technologies to their region, and enhance their brand images as regional technology hubs.
L32|Russia’s public sector and privatization policy in 2018|From 2016, statistical data began to be published in the framework of the System of Public Property Management Efficiency Estimates. It was approved by Decree of the RF Government No 72 dated January 29, 2015, and introduced by way of replacing the public sector monitoring data, collected and released by the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) since the early 2000s in accordance with the provisions stipulated in RF Government Decree No 1 dated January 4, 1999 (as amended on December 30, 2002). Among other things, the System contains data on the number of federal state unitary enterprises (FSUEs) and joint-stock companies (JSCs) with RF stakes in their capital. Previously, such data were usually published as part of government privatization programs (from 2011 – for three-year period, and prior to 2011 – for one-year period). In the current Forecast Plan (Program) of Federal Property Privatization and the Main Directions of Federal Property Privatization for 2017–2019, relevant data are available only as of early 2016 (Table 1), and so in order to describe the processes taking place over the period 2016–2018, one must rely on data in the System of Public Property Management Efficiency Estimates.
L32|The housing market in Russian cities in 2018|The preliminary results of the Russian economy’s development in 2018 appear to be rather controversial. On the one hand, the growth rate of GDP gained 2.3 percent; on the other, the consumer inflation index increased significantly, to 4.3 percent, from its record low of the entire period since the onset of market reforms (2.5 percent), achieved in 2017. The movement pattern of personal disposable income, which is a much more significant factor determining the situation in the real estate market, was quite volatile throughout the course of last year, with multiple trend reversals. In spite of the positive results of the first two quarters, probably achieved thanks to the current electoral cycle, in the end the personal disposable income index stayed roughly at the same level as in 2017. The RF Central Bank twice reduced its key rate over the course of H1 2018, to 7.25 percent per annum in early autumn. However, over the next few months it was once again hiked twice, and so returned to its level of late 2017 (7.75 percent). The tricky movement pattern of the key rate pushed down the interest rates on bank loans and notably improved the position of borrowers.
L32|Smart Development Banks|The conventional paradigm about development banks is that these institutions exist to target well-identified market failures. However, market failures are not directly observable and can only be ascertained with a suitable learning process. Hence, the question is how do the policymakers know what activities should be promoted, how do they learn about the obstacles to the creation of new activities? Rather than assuming that the government has arrived at the right list of market failures and uses development banks to close some well-identified market gaps, we suggest that development banks can be in charge of identifying these market failures through their loan-screening and lending activities to guide their operations and provide critical inputs for the design of productive development policies. In fact, they can also identify government failures that stand in the way of development and call for needed public inputs. This intelligence role of development banks is similar to the role that modern theories of financial intermediation assign to banks as institutions with a comparative advantage in producing and processing information. However, while private banks focus on information on private returns, development banks would potentially produce and organize information about social returns.
L32|Mission-oriented Public Organizations for Knowledge Creation|The purpose of this paper is to investigate and discuss the role played by the state in enhancing technological progress, creating knowledge and fostering radical innovation. This catalyst function may take place in different ways. Specifically, we focus on three channels: (a) R&D of traditional state-owned or state-invested enterprises; (b) funding of organizations such as public agencies, research universities and large research infrastructures (e.g. CERN, NASA, etc.); (c) indirect intervention through public procurement for innovation. We critically review existing contributions, summarize their main findings and discuss the benefits and costs entailed by these policies. We claim that research, development, and innovation should be supported by governments not simply to pursue generic growth objectives but also to meet societal challenges like energy transition, sustainable mobility, the digital society, the demographic transition and climate change. Mission-oriented organizations can be powerful tools for achieving the technological breakthroughs needed to tackle these challenges.
L32|The Impact of CEOs in the Public Sector: Evidence from the English NHS|We investigate whether top managers affect the performance of large and complex public sector organizations, using as a case study CEOs of English public hospitals (large, complex organizations with multi-million turnover). We study the extent to which CEOs are differentiated in terms of their pay, as well as a wide range of hospital production measures including inputs, intermediate operational outcomes and clinical outcomes. Pay differentials suggest that the market perceives CEOs to be differentiated. However, we find little evidence of CEOs' impact on hospital production. These results question the effectiveness of leadership changes to improve performance in the public sector.
L32|State-owned firms behind China’s corporate debt|While China’s overall debt-to-GDP ratio is not particularly high, its non-financial corporate debt relative to GDP is higher than in other major economies. State-owned enterprises account for over three quarters of that debt with a size exceeding GDP. This paper provides insights into the size of debt, leverage and debt service burden by various non-financial SOE groupings including by size, extent of state ownership, level of the owner, broad and detailed sector and region. Although the debt stock of local SOEs increased the fastest, firms under government agencies leveraged up more quickly and their debt service burden also grew most rapidly. SOEs in services industries increased their debt fastest, in particular in social services, transportation, real estate and construction. In turn, warehousing and real estate firms have the highest leverage. Firms in the three provinces of Xinjiang, Shanxi and Qinghai rank among the top five in all the three indicators of debt to revenues, leverage and debt service burden. Large SOEs owe most debt and leveraged up, while small and medium-size ones reduced their leverage. The surge in the debt service burden of small SOEs coincided with an increase in state assets in this group of firms. Sector-wise, state assets increased most in competitive industries. Empirical analysis shows that higher leverage and labour productivity are more conducive to a surge in SOE debt. Such surges appear to be triggered by falling interest costs, pointing to the role for easy monetary conditions in the rapid SOE debt accumulation. Recent corporate governance reforms of SOEs will likely act as disciplining device on SOE borrowing.
L32|Timing of R&D Decisions and Output Subsidies in a Mixed Duopoly with Spillovers|This study considers a mixed duopoly with research spillovers and examines the interplay between firms’ R&D decisions and government’s output subsidies. We investigate and compare the timing of the game between ex-ante R&D and ex-post R&D decisions where the R&D decisions are chosen before the output subsidy is determined in the former case while the order is reversed in the latter case. We show that the equilibrium outcomes can be opposite between the two cases because both public and private firms have different objectives in choosing R&D investments, but the spillovers rate is a key factor that determines their incentives. In particular, we show that the output subsidy is smaller (larger) and the welfare is larger (smaller) under the ex-ante R&D decisions for a higher (lower) degree of spillovers rate. Finally, privatization increases the welfare in both cases only when spillovers rate is weak.
L32|Public Service and Micro-Small Enterprise Developments in Indonesia|This study aims to analyze the influence of public service on the Micro-Small Enterprise (MSE) developments in Indonesia. The study method used was regression analysis panel data with fixed effect approach; because of the limited data availability, the data was only taken from 2013-2015. The study findings show that public service and education projected by gross participation data have a positive influence on the development of MSE, while the economic growth and minimum wage policy have a negative influence on the development of MSE in Indonesia. Based on those findings, this study concludes that the public service in the form of government spending allocation policy, especially on the service and economic functions, will stimulate the increase of MSE numbers.
L32|Assessing the impact of tourism on hospitals’ performance in a coastal destination|Tourism represents one the most relevant industries in promoting the development of a destination, but tourism and its seasonality can produce negative outcomes. The additional demand caused by tourism can strongly affect public service providers which cannot adapt their supply to seasonal variations as a result of organisational, financial and institutional limitations. This work focuses on hospital services in an Italian coastal destination and it aims to explain the impact tourism and its related seasonality have on the performance of hospitals in a coastal destination. The activity of three hospitals located in Gallura, a region in the north-east of Sardinia, Italy, has been analysed. The analysis has been carried out using data on hospitals admission from 2014 and 2015.The study highlights the critical impact tourism can have on the activity of healthcare providers in a coastal destination, identifying the reduction of hospital performance and a potential cause of bed crises.
L32|Sovereign exposures in the Portuguese banking system: evidence from an original dataset|We present an original dataset on exposures of banks operating in Portugal to the domestic public sector, and document the main dynamics of those exposures against the broader backdrop of public sector indebtedness and financing needs. Built from granular information, our dataset takes account of both bond holdings and loans, and ensures comprehensive coverage of both the banking system and public sector entities, either classified inside or outside general government. Domestic banks, unlike those mostly owned by foreigners, played a key role in financing public sector entities in the most acute stages of the sovereign debt crisis, when access to international capital markets was virtually lost. We present evidence of this role in the cases of the Treasury and of state-owned enterprises.
L32|The timing of environmental policies with excess burden of taxation in free-entry mixed markets|This study investigates the timing of environmental policies in free-entry mixed markets with excess burden of taxation. We consider two scenarios in which the government chooses the optimal tax before or after firms enter the market, and compare these ex-ante and ex-post taxations. When the excess burden of taxation is small (large), we find that ex-post taxation imposes a lower (higher) tax level than ex-ante taxation, which induces a larger (smaller) number of firms and a higher (lower) environmental damage. Finally, the effect of excess burden of taxation can increase the welfare, but ex-ante taxation always yields higher welfare than ex-post taxation.
L32|A new irrelevance result in an endogenous timing with a consumer-friendly public firm|This study considers a mixed duopoly with a consumer-friendly public firm and analyzes an endogenous timing game in the presence of output subsidy and emission tax. We provide a new irrelevance result concerning the choice of government policy in which regardless of the policy mix, the equilibrium of endogenous market structure is determined by the public firm’s concern on consumer surplus. We also show that the optimal policy mix can attain the first-best allocation for social welfare only when both firms have symmetric payoffs, which results in simultaneous-move outcome.
L32|Challenges of Rural Economy and Women Economic Empowerment in Afghanistan: A Concept Note|This research paper has been developed with the intention of shedding light over the major challenges and remedies of rural economy in Afghanistan and also discussing explicitly about the women economic empowerment considering Afghanistan’s context. This paper has been prepared in two parts, where part one will be specifically and thoroughly encompassing the major challenges and remedies of rural economy in Afghanistan, however, the second part will be explicitly covering the issues related to women economic empowerment in Afghanistan. General topics and contents under each part of this paper are based on author’s findings and does not preferably follow a report or other person’s view, except secondary data sources which are quoted properly. Objective of this concept papers was to briefly discuss about the major and pivotal issues related to rural economy and how women economic empowerment can aid to it. Indeed, women contribution to economic activities in the rural area of Afghanistan is very rare, and thus, a great chunk of the human capital is not used toward inclusive growth. Author has given a thoughtful attention to women economic empowerment and thus discussed this issue on a separate section with respect to Afghanistan’s ground level realities as per common social norms and practices. This concept paper will be entirely based on academic and nonacademic secondary data from authentic sources. Moreover, at the end of each part, researcher’s recommendations and solutions will also be added for corrective action taking by the government and competent organizations in Afghanistan. As a whole, issues discussed in this paper will be concise and direct to the point. It’s very welcome by the author of this paper that any prospective researcher or an organization can expand the scope of this topic and discusses the major challenges and remedies with a vast set of knowledge, information, and ground level presence.
L32|A treatise on socioeconomic roles of waqf|Promotion of socioeconomic security peaks as state policy drive especially in developing and emerging economies. Waqf as a socioeconomic tool emphatically forms part of the ethical values of Islam and is seen as a primary vehicle for financing Islam as a society. This paper analyses the socioeconomic roles that Waqf institution in tackling social security challenges for upliftment of the Muslim Ummah. The paper employs a non-experimental qualitative research methodology based on deductive method of analysis of jurisprudential and literature based-evidences. A socioeconomic framework was intuitively developed by the paper for logical analysis. It was found that socioeconomically, Waqf institutions across the Islamic world have played immeasurable roles in the areas of provision of social and economic infrastructures, lessening the burden of tax and budget deficits, closing the short fall in tax revenues, tackling poverty and income inequality, boosting economic growth, promoting independent provision of public goods and development of active civil society bonded by spirit of compassion and communalism as against that apathy and individualism. The paper strongly urges the Muslim Ummah to reestablish and reassert the roles Waqf institutions to free itself from socioeconomic misadventures.
L32|Political Turnover and the Performance of Local Public Enterprises|We study how political party turnover at the municipal level affects the economic performance of Italian Local Public Enterprises. To this end, we match data on municipal elections in Italy to the budget data of firms whose shares are owned by Italian municipalities. As political turnover and performance are likely to be jointly endogenous, we exploit the quasi-experimental nature of close electoral races to estimate the causal treatment effect. We find evidence that municipal party turnover disrupts investment and slows down productivity growth. At the same time, the probability of observing financial distress is larger. No significant effect can be established, on the other hand, in terms of profitability and employment growth. We link the effect of municipal party turnover to three mechanisms: first, the nature of close electoral races alters the incumbent party’s incentives to invest; second, turnover makes the appointment of new, less-experienced, board directors more likely; third, the new political leadership directly reduces the amount of resources transferred in order to signal its commitment to curb wasteful municipal expenditure. We finally set up a survival analysis, whose results show that municipal party turnover is associated to an increase in the likelihood to observe bankruptcy.
L32|The Well-being Transition: Measuring what counts to protect what matters|"In this article we provide an analytical framework for a collective effort that we label ""the well-being transition"" away from growth and GDP towards human well-being and offer some insights as to what is needed to accelerate this dynamic, insisting on the need for a new positive narrative and institutional reforms. We first present the achievements and challenges of the well-being transition first by outlying why and how we can go beyond growth and GDP not just to see the world differently but to change it. We then spell out a possible narrative able to engage citizens and transform these new visions into social realities, linking sustainability and justice in a social-ecological approach of 21st century challenges. We finally propose specific institutional reforms to ground the well-being transition in public policy."
L32|A Scoping Study of PPP Guidelines|The Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third Conference on Financing for Development underscores sustainable and resilient infrastructure as a pre-requisite to sustainable development. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are expected to deliver infrastructure in furtherance of this Agenda. In view of this expectation, twelve prominent PPP guidelines were reviewed for alignment with the Addis Agenda and key public governance factors. The research found that the PPP guidelines are not sufficiently aligned with the Addis Agenda, have insufficient sustainability content, and do not acknowledge the role of the public in PPPs. It recommends that the next generation of the guidelines address these aspects. This paper is an updated version of the draft paper presented to the expert group meeting of the Inter-agency Task Force in December 2016. The author is grateful for discussion and comments received on the earlier versions of this paper. Some are reflected in the paper without attribution, owing to the Chatham House rule followed at the meeting. The author takes full responsibility for the contents of this report.

L32|Der Einfluss sozioökonomischer Faktoren auf die Nutzung des digitalen Zugangs zu Finanzdienstleistungen: Risikopotenzial für eine informationelle Kluft in den Geschäftsgebieten der Sparkassen|Bisherige Studien haben den digitalen Zugang zu Finanzdienstleistungen untersucht und gut versorgte sowie unterversorgte Regionen in Deutschland identifiziert. Das Vorhandensein eines hinreichend guten digitalen Zugangs sagt aber nichts darüber aus, ob dieser auch genutzt wird, um damit Finanzdienstleistungen nachzufragen. Dieses Papier stellt die Kunden in den Mittelpunkt und untersucht, welche sozioökonomischen Faktoren Einfluss auf die Nutzung des digitalen Zugangs für die Nachfrage nach Finanzdienstleistungen haben. Als Ergebnis können auch jene Attribute benannt werden, die eine sogenannte informationelle Kluft befördern. Ein regionaler Vergleich ermöglicht schließlich eine Aussage dazu, in welchen Gebieten (hier Geschäftsgebiete der Sparkassen) Deutschlands die Gefahr einer informationellen Kluft besonders groß ist. Es zeigt sich, dass dieses Risiko in ländlichen, dünn besiedelten Gebieten, mit einem hohen Durchschnittsalter der Bevölkerung und in Regionen mit einem relativ geringen durchschnittlichen Ausbildungsgrad vergleichsweise hoch ist. Hier droht insofern ein besonders hohes Risiko, dass Menschen infolge der voranschreitenden Digitalisierung von Bankdienstleistungen abgehängt werden und den Zugang zu grundlegenden Finanzdienstleistungen als Basis gesellschaftlicher Teilhabe verlieren.
L32|Öffentliche Betriebe<BR>[Public Firms]|Öffentliche Betriebe weisen einige Besonderheiten gegenüber privaten Betrieben auf. Dazu werden nach dem Zweck öffentlicher Betriebe und ihren unterschiedlichen Rechtsformen in Deutschland die betrieblichen Teilfunktionen Beschaffung, Produktion, Absatz, Personal, Finanzierung und Rechnungswesen näher betrachtet. Außerdem werden die Besteuerung und Reformen von öffentlichen Betrieben sowie Hybridformen zwischen öffentlichen und privaten Betrieben untersucht.
L32|Does Political Affiliation Matter On Post-Parliamentary Careers In The Boards Of Public Enterprises?|Research on post-parliamentary careers has so far neglected the effect of political affiliation on the appointment of ex-members of Parliament to public firms boards of director. This article intends to fill this gap by conducting an empirical analysis on a sample of 1,419 deputies of Italian Parliament elected over the period 1994-2001. The regression discontinuity estimates show that the probability of being appointed to the board of public enterprises of center-left ex-deputies is about 15 percentage points higher than that of center-right ex-deputies. This result brings to light the politicization of Italian public firms, put in place through the appointment of ex-deputies in managerial positions.
L32|State-Owned Enterprises: Rationales for Mergers and Acquisitions|The paper contributes to the empirical literature on M&A deals performed by SOEs with a detailed analysis of the reported rationales from a sample of SOE-led acquisitions over the last decade. The sample includes 355 worldwide M&A deals performed by SOEs as acquirers over the period 2002-2012. The data set was obtained by combining firm-level information from two sources, Zephyr and Orbis (Bureau Van Dijk). The analysis is on a case-by-case basis for the rationales of the sample. Overall, the most important message arising from our analysis is that rescue of firms in financial distress is a relatively minor one role played by contemporary SOEs in spite of the Great Recession, while shareholder value maximization and long term strategic goals are more frequently the objective of the observed deals.
L32|Offrir des biens publics et des communs et revitaliser l’action publique dans le cadre d’un processus de « destruction créatrice »|"Recent developments in the economic analysis about public goods and commons, initiated notably in relation to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and to the work of Elinor Ostrom, have highlighted the social utility of their production to meet societal expectations of democracy and of sustainable development. The production of public and social economy organisations is in this perspective of crucial importance for the future, as is the outline of public policies that help develop coproduction or joint production of public goods and services. Thus, Public and Social and Solidarity Economy Partnerships (PSSEP) are the subject of analyzes in the CIRIEC book Providing public goods and commons. Towards coproduction and new forms of governance for a revival of public action that highlights: the importance of these partnerships within the framework of the current paradigm of public action; the induced behavioral transformations of the organizations; the scope that these new forms of partnership can have in terms of co-construction of public action and of responses to expectations on the territories; and the place of these partnerships in a process called here ""creative destruction of public action""."
L32|Disciplines on State-Owned Enterprises under the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement: Overview and Assessment|This paper analyses the disciplines of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) stipulated in Chapter 17 of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP). The introduction of the extensive disciplines on SOEs was led by the concern that SOEs are likely to disturb fair international competition regime by conducting business activities not depending on economic rationality and anticompetitive activities. Major provision of this chapter includes definitions and the scope of application, commercial considerations and non-discriminatory treatment, non-commercial assistance, and transparency. While Chapter 17 can be appreciated as the first comprehensive and detailed discipline on SOEs including that of the WTO-plus, it still has problems and remaining issues concerning the disciplines. Nevertheless, the very fact that the TPP includes specific rules for SOEs is appreciated as a first step towards disciplining them in the future.
L32|The public sector of the Russian economy: it’s size and dynamics|Two main channels can be pointed out whereby the state participates in value added chains: through the operation of companies with state stakes, and through the services (in a broader sense of the work) produced by enterprises with state stakes and budget-funded organizations. Consequently, the assessment of the state sector scope inside the national economy consists, as a rule, of two components: an analysis of the relative share of biggest companies with state stakes – state-owned enterprises (SOE) in a country's aggregate economic statistics (the scope of state ownership); and an estimation of the input of the general government sector (GGS) in GDP.
L32|Federal property and privatization policy|2016 saw first publication of data from a performance measures framework for federal property management that was adopted on January 29, 2015 by Russian Government’s executive order No. 72 in lieu of performance measures for a public sector monitoring conducted by Rosstat in the early 2000s in pursuance of the Russian Government’s executive order No. 1 dated January 4, 1999 (as further amended on December 30, 2002). The performance measures framework contains data for the number of federal state unitary enterprises (FSUEs) and joint-stock companies (JSCs) with government equity participation that were previously published in privatization programs over a 3-year period (since 2011) and one-year period (prior to 2011). A new Forecast Plan (Program) for Federal Property Privatization and Guidelines for Federal Property Privatization for 2017–2019 adopted early in 2017[1] contains data dated only as of early 2016 (Table 1). As of early 2017, according to the Report of the Federal Agency for State Property Management (hereinafter Rosimushchestvo) on the implementation of privatization program for 2017–2019, the Russian Federation owned 1108 FSUEs and held an interest of 11 and 17 percent in 1416 JSCs and LLCs, respectively, marking a decline from the previous year’s number of economic agents with the same legal form of business. However, developments and processes that took place in 2017 only can be described using data from the performance measures framework for federal property management.
L32|The housing market in Russia's cities in 2017|The actual development pattern displayed by the Russian economy in 2017 only in part answered the expectations voiced by the expert community in late 2016. First of all, last year there was no sustainable recovery at the macroeconomic level. Although the year-end GDP growth rate amounted to 1.5 percent, it still demonstrated rather strong volatility of its index over the course of the year. However, the professional participants of the real estate market, as well as Russian businesses in general, usually look not at GDP or industrial output indices, but at the exchange rate of the national currency, the movement of wages and salaries, and consumer demand, because the latter better describe the existing risks, while the movement pattern of GDP serves only as a background indicator.
L32|Conceptualizing ASEAN Tourism Brand: Towards A Coopetition Framework|Objective - This paper proposes an integrative framework in an attempt to conceptualize the branding of ASEAN tourism in a sustainable and unified approach based on the results collected from a sample of travellers visiting ASEAN destinations and tourism insights from NTOs or DMOs. Methodology/Technique - A mixed method is used to combine the quantitative and qualitative phases. A survey of travellers visiting ASEAN destinations (n=480) is conducted with a mix of Asian travellers and Western travellers, as well as 10 in-depth interviews with NTOs or DMOs to obtain tourism insights. Findings - The findings suggest that authenticity of the destination image is an integral part of ASEAN tourism. National Tourism Organizations (NTOs), Destination Marketing Organization (DMO) and other stakeholders of ASEAN tourism should adopt a coopetition framework and co-create a consistent and coherent positioning of the destination, while maintaining a competitive positioning of the nation, to achieve a sustainable brand of ASEAN tourism. Novelty - The paper highlights the needs for ASEAN NTOs and DMOs to enable coopetition for all tourism stakeholders for the promotion of the ASEAN brand. The proposed framework is seen as transformative in its ability to bring about collaborative and sustainable efforts to ultimately achieve an authentic ASEAN brand.
L32|Virtuous or Vicious? Development Banks in Europe|In the aftermath of the economic and financial crises, European policy makers have manifested a renewed interest on the role played by development banks in mitigating market failure by supporting financial programs set up to reverse the low level of investment by EU firms and stimulating innovation paths. This interest is coupled with an increasing awareness of the need to ensure the financial sustainability of these institutions, by securing reasonable levels of efficiency. In this paper, we analyze the performance and self-sustainability of European development banks with the aim of assessing whether they pursue their mandate retaining financial soundness without entailing an undesirable absorption of public resources. The empirical analysis leverages on a unique manually collected dataset including all the development banks headquartered in Europe. We introduce specific regression models aimed at quantifying the difference in financial performances between development banks and the banking industry, also investigating their different responses across the business and political cycles. Our main finding is that the profitability of development banks over the period 2000-2015 is only slightly lower than that of their benchmark. However, the difference is not statistically significant when focusing on Western Europe or on the period after the 2008 crisis. Besides, development banks appear to be more resilient when the economy slows down, while in Eastern Europe they also play a countercyclical role. During election years, differences exist between development banks in Western and Eastern Europe, with the former virtuous and the latter still accommodating. A battery of robustness tests confirms our results. These new findings point to the characteristics of contemporary development banks in Europe and provide insights to member states that are evaluating to provide additional financial funds to development banks or to promote the setting up of new promotional banks.
L32|Patient and impatient capital: time horizons as market boundaries|Since the 1980s privatisation and outsourcing have been promoted on grounds of efficiency and fiscal convenience. The argument here is that the appropriate choice between business and public enterprise is determined by the interaction between two time horizons, a financial time horizon and a project time horizon. The prevailing interest rate defines a credit time horizon. Among project appraisal methods, the payback period defines a unique temporal outer bound for private sector break-even. Net present value break-evens (and other forms of business credit) are always shorter. Any project which has a break-even longer than the payback period cannot be funded by business alone. Long-term projects encounter uncertainty and attempt to control it by means of rigid contracts, which also lead to inferior outcomes. This analysis accounts for historical patterns of enterprise. It also provides normative guidance. Public-private partnerships for infrastructure development intended to overcome credit time boundaries. They have given rise to inefficiency and corruption and are currently in decline. It is possible to overcome the temporal boundary with a â€˜franchiseâ€™ i.e. protection from uncertainty provided by social and government agencies. This allows longer credit break-evens, but at a cost in competitive efficiency. It is also prone to corruption. The time-horizon model undermines the standard argument for market superiority. It turns Hayek on his head: it is financial markets that require certainty, whereas social and public agencies manage in its absence.
L32|Capitalism and Socialism: A Review of Kornai's Dynamism, Rivalry, and the Surplus Economy|Understanding the nature of capitalism has been a central theme of economics. The collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the global financial crisis spurred the reemergence of the political economy as a new frontier and the revival of interest in the nature of capitalism. Janos Kornai's book Dynamism, Rivalry, and the Surplus Economy: Two Essays on the Nature of Capitalism fills an important intellectual gap in understanding the dynamic nature of capitalism by comparing it with its mirror image, socialism. To further develop the themes contained in the book, serious challenges are posed theoretically and empirically, as well as in subjects, such as hybrid capitalism.
L32|Hidden and non measurable trade policies: the case of state controlled firms|A hot issue in trade negotiations concerns the existence of stateowned firms and state subsidies. Disputes between the US and the EU and the issue of the recognition of the status of a market economy to China are often the epitome of that. In Germany the giant Volkswagen is state controlled, in China almost 1/3 of firms are state controlled and loom in almost all industries often with relevant or even dominant market shares. State enterprises maximize home social welfare. When they export or compete with foreign producers at home their specific objective function make them a useful vehicle for disguised trade policies. We investigate trade cases with oligopoly and state or quasi state owned firms. Increasing returns to scale come into the picture in some instances. Dumping and foreclosure of the domestic market emerge explaining both the possibility of having home prices higher or lower than export prices. Possible counteracting policies can be devised and an example of a production subsidy is presented.
L32|Trends in the Department of Defenseâ€™s Support Costs|From the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, the Department of Defenseâ€™s (DoDâ€™s) funding for support functions rose substantially relative to funding for forces. Four types of support functions experienced the largest increases: health care, DoD-wide management, communications and information infrastructure, and DoDâ€™s science and technology program. Increased spending in some of these areas may have improved efficiency (by helping meet military needs, boosting productivity, or reducing costs in other areas) but some increases may not have done so.
L32|The Hospital as a Multi-Product Firm: The Effect of Hospital Competition on Value-Added Indicators of Clinical Quality|There is increasing international interest in using Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) to assess health care provider performance. PROMs are a fundamental advance on existing indicators of health care quality in two respects: they equate outcomes with value added (i.e. health gain) from treatment rather than post-treatment health status, and they allow clinical quality to be measured at the level of the individual medical intervention to a far greater extent than existing failure-based indicators of quality such as mortality or readmissions. Most existing econometric studies of hospital competition and quality equate outcomes with post-treatment health status, and use mortality rates of various kinds as indicators of overall hospital performance, in spite of the fact that mortality is a relatively uncommon outcome in the spheres of hospital activity - such as elective surgery - in which competition for patients does occur. This paper contributes to the development of a value-added, multi-product conception of hospital quality by studying the impact of a major competition-promoting reform to the English NHS in 2006, in which patients were allowed to choose which hospital they attended for elective surgery, on PROMs of health gain from hip and knee replacement, groin hernia repair, and varicose vein surgery. In contrast to the existing literature, I find that the competition brought about by the introduction of patient choice of hospital may have had a negative effect on clinical quality. I put forward a theoretical framework that explains these findings, and conclude by arguing that future research should model the hospital as a multi-product firm, and capture clinical quality using value-added outcome measures.
L32|Can Outsourcing Improve Liberia’s Schools? Preliminary Results from Year One of a Three-Year Randomized Evaluation of Partnership Schools for Liberia|After one year, public schools managed by private contractors in Liberia raised student learning by 60 percent, compared to standard public schools. But costs were high, performance varied across contractors, and contracts authorized the largest contractor to push excess pupils and underperforming teachers onto other government schools.
L32|Market Power and the Laffer Curve|We study commodity taxation and characterize the Laffer curve, a trade‐off between tax rates and revenue, in noncompetitive markets. Pricing in these markets leads to incomplete tax pass‐through and agents re optimize their purchase and pricing decisions in response to any tax change. We use detailed data from Pennsylvania, a state that monopolizes retail sales of alcoholic beverages, to estimate a model of demand for horizontally differentiated products that ties consumers' demographic characteristics to heterogeneous preferences for spirits. We find that under the state's current tax policy, spirits are overpriced. Distillers respond to decreases in the tax rate by increasing wholesale prices, which limits the state's revenue gain to only 13% of the incremental tax revenue predicted under the common assumption of perfect competition. The strategic response of noncompetitive firms to changes in taxation therefore flattens the Laffer curve significantly.
L32|Top Decision-Making Bodies in Large Companies: Gender Quota Shows Initial Impact on Supervisory Boards ; Executive Board Remains a Male Bastion|The gender quota for supervisory boards that has been mandatory since January 2016 has shown an initial impact. According to DIW Berlin’s Women Executives Barometer, at the end of 2016, there were more women on the supervisory boards of the 106 companies subject to the statutory quota than one year before. Their proportion increased by a solid four percentage points to more than 27 percent. And in the other groups of companies studied, the number of female supervisory board members also rose. However, the calculations based on the top 200 companies also showed that in companies in which the supervisory board already consisted of one-third women, the proportion hardly increased or did not increase at all. The gap between supervisory and executive boards has also widened because growth in the latter has flattened. Women represent only 6,5 percent of the executives at companies subject to the quota — even fewer than in the DAX 30 (11 percent) and the average of the 200 highest performing companies in Germany (eight percent). In companies with government-owned shares, the momentum has decreased significantly — they run the risk of losing their function as role models. To forestall a tightening of the law, companies should ensure more balanced gender representation on all executive levels.
L32|Financial Sector: Banks Fall behind and Now Have a Lower Proportion of Women on Executive and Advisory Boards than Insurance Companies|Women are still in the clear minority among the financial sector’s top decision-making bodies. According to DIW Berlin’s Women Executives Barometer, at the end of 2016, 21 percent of the supervisory and administrative board members of the 100 largest banks were female. The number has stagnated compared to last year. Since 2010, when the discussion about the gender quota for supervisory boards gained momentum, growth has been relatively flat — particularly in comparison to the top 100 companies outside the financial sector. At insurance companies, the proportion of women on supervisory boards was a solid 22 percent (an increase of around three percentage points). This puts insurance companies ahead of banks for the first time since 2006. Also of note: companies whose supervisory boards contained one-third women were not able to increase this number in 2016. Extrapolating from the past decade, supervisory boards of banks would need 50 years for the ratio of women to men to be equal. Gender parity in executive boards would be reached in 80 years. The proportion of women on executive boards remained very low overall as it reached roughly ten percent at insurance companies and eight percent at banks.
L32|Spitzengremien großer Unternehmen: Geschlechterquote zeigt erste Wirkung in Aufsichtsräten – Vorstände bleiben Männerdomänen|The gender quota for supervisory boards that has been mandatory since January 2016 has shown an initial impact.

Their proportion increased by a solid four percentage points to more than 27 percent. And in the other groups of companies studied, the number of female supervisory board members also rose. However, the calculations based on the top 200 companies also showed that in companies in which the supervisory board already consisted of one-third women, the proportion hardly increased or did not increase at all. The gap between supervisory and executive boards has also widened because growth in the latter has flattened. Women represent only six percent of the executives at companies subject to the quota – even fewer than in the DAX 30 (11 percent) and the average of the 200 highest performing companies in Germany (eight percent). In companies with government-owned shares, the momentum has decreased significantly – they run the risk of losing their function as role models. To forestall a tightening of the law, companies should ensure more balanced gender representation on all executive levels. Die seit Januar 2016 verbindliche Geschlechterquote für Aufsichtsräte in Deutschland zeigt eine erste Wirkung: Dem Managerinnen- Barometer des DIW Berlin zufolge waren in den unter die Quotenregelung fallenden 106 Unternehmen Ende 2016 deutlich mehr Frauen in den Kontrollgremien vertreten als ein Jahr zuvor. Ihr Anteil stieg um gut vier Prozentpunkte auf mehr als 27 Prozent. Auch in den anderen Unternehmensgruppen legte der Anteil der Aufsichtsrätinnen zu. Die Berechnungen auf Basis der Top-200-Unternehmen zeigen zudem, dass in Unternehmen, in denen der Aufsichtsrat bereits zu einem Drittel mit Frauen besetzt ist, der Anteil anschließend kaum bis gar nicht mehr steigt. Die Schere zwischen den Aufsichtsräten und Vorständen öffnet sich indes weiter, denn in letzteren ist die Dynamik nach wie vor sehr schwach: In den unter die Quote fallenden Unternehmen sind im Durchschnitt nur 6,5 Prozent Frauen in den Vorstandsetagen vertreten – noch weniger als in den DAX-30 (gut elf Prozent) und den 200 umsatzstärksten Unternehmen (acht Prozent). In den Unternehmen mit Bundesbeteiligung hat sich die Dynamik deutlich abgeschwächt – sie drohen ihre Vorbildfunktion einzubüßen. Um möglichen Gesetzesverschärfungen zuvorzukommen, sollten Unternehmen auf allen Führungsebenen für ein ausgeglicheneres Geschlechterverhältnis sorgen.
L32|Finanzsektor: Banken fallen zurück: Frauenanteil jetzt auch in Aufsichtsräten geringer als bei Versicherungen|Women are still in the clear minority among the financial sector’s top decision-making bodies. According to DIW Berlin’s Women Executive Barometer, at the end of 2016, 21 percent of the supervisory and administrative board members of the 100 largest banks were female. The number has stagnated compared to last year. Since 2010, when the discussion about the gender quota for supervisory boards gained momentum, growth has been relatively flat – particularly in comparison to the top 100 companies outside the financial sector. At insurance companies, the proportion of women on supervisory boards was a solid 22 percent (an increase of around three percentage points). This puts insurance companies aheadof banks for the first time since 2006. The proportion of women on executive boards is almost ten percent at insurance companies and eight percent at banks. Overall, these levels areextremely low, and at the end of 2016 none of the corporate groups in the study had reached the ten-percent mark. Also of note: companies whose supervisory boards contained one-third women were not able to increase this number in 2016. Extrapolating from the past decade, supervisory boards of banks would need 50 years for the ratio of women to men to be equal. Gender parity in executive boards would be reached in 80 years. Nach wie vor sind Frauen in Spitzengremien des Finanzsektors deutlich in der Minderheit. Dem Managerinnen-Barometer des DIW Berlin zufolge waren die Aufsichts- und Verwaltungsräte der 100 größten Banken Ende des Jahres 2016 zu gut 21 Prozent mit Frauen besetzt. Damit stagnierte der Anteil gegenüber dem vorangegangenen Jahr. Auffallend ist die geringere Dynamik nach dem Jahr 2010 im Vergleich zu den Top-100-Unternehmen außerhalb der Finanzbranche – damals nahm die Diskussion um die Frauenquote in Aufsichtsräten Fahrt auf. Bei den Versicherungen betrug der Frauenanteil in den Aufsichtsgremien gut 22 Prozent – ein Anstieg um rund drei Prozentpunkte. Erstmals seit Beginn der Erhebung des DIW Berlin im Jahr 2006 lagen die Versicherungen damit vor den Banken. Auffallend ist, dass sich Unternehmen, deren Aufsichtsräte bereits zuvor zu einem Drittel mit Frauen besetzt waren, diesbezüglich im Jahr 2016 tendenziell nicht mehr steigern konnten. Schreibt man die Entwicklung der vergangenen zehn Jahre linear fort, würde es in den Aufsichtsräten der Banken noch ein halbes Jahrhundert dauern, bis Frauen und Männer gleichermaßen vertreten sind. In den Vorständen wäre das sogar erst in über 80 Jahren der Fall. Der Frauenanteil blieb mit fast zehn Prozent bei den Versicherungen und gut acht Prozent bei den Banken insgesamt sehr niedrig.
L32|Modern Public Enterprises: Organisational Innovation and Productivity|In advanced economies, state-owned enterprises play an important role in sectors of general interest such as energy and water supply. The conditions under which they operate have changed fundamentally since 1998, with new strategies required for firms to preserve market shares in the face of liberalisation and technological innovation. This paper investigates the productivity effect of three strategies in new public management: corporatisation, outsourcing, and partial privatisation. Firm-level productivity is estimated from production data using a control function approach. As most of the firms are typically multiproduct firms, we suggest a method for modelling differences in the product mix and to account for heterogeneous production environments. Using a newly constructed and unique dataset from the German Federal Statistical Office, we find that outsourcing and corporatisation positively impact productivity, while partial privatisation does not increase productivity.
L32|Quasi-fiscal deficits in the electricity sector of the Middle East and North Africa : sources and size|The annual electricity investments needed in the Middle East and North Africa region to keep up with demand have been estimated at about 3 percent of the region's projected gross domestic product. However, in most economies of the region, the ability to make those investments is limited by fiscal and macroeconomic constraints. This paper demonstrates that the solution is readily available: by improving the management and performance of the region's utilities, more than enough resources could be freed up to make the investments needed. The paper presents the first evaluation of the size and composition of the quasi-fiscal deficit associated with the management of the electricity sector in 14 economies in the Middle East and North Africa region. The estimations are for 2013. They show that the average quasi-fiscal deficit is 4.4 percent of gross domestic product (but goes down to 2.9 percent if Lebanon, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Jordan are excluded). Only five economies have a quasi-fiscal deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar, and the West Bank), and hence would not be able to finance the average investment requirement through elimination of inefficiencies. For most economies, the main driver of the quasi-fiscal deficit is the underpricing of electricity, which costs on average 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (but 2.2 percent without Lebanon, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Jordan). Commercial inefficiency comes next, at an average cost of 0.6 percent of gross domestic product. Technical and labor inefficiencies represent, respectively, 0.4 and 0.2 percent of gross domestic product.
L32|Public-private partnerships from budget constraints: Looking for debt hiding?|The use of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to realize and operate public infrastructures is often associated with fiscal-circumventing motivations. Using data at the municipal level, this paper investigates whether budget-constrained public authorities adopt PPPs in order to hide public debt. The results show that financial difficulties often lead to a preference for PPPs instead of traditional forms of public procurement, but this behavior is not explained by the possibility of debt-hiding. Explanations for these findings are discussed.
L32|Governments in the market for corporate control: Evidence from M&A deals involving state-owned enterprises|Recent evidence suggests that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are increasingly taking over other firms. Such domestic or transborder acquisitions are the reverse of privatizations, where SOEs are the target of private investors. The question we ask is whether, because of the specific objectives and risks faced by governments, SOEs deviate from the benchmark of deals involving private firms on both sides of the merger and acquisition (M&A) transaction. To answer this new research question, we focus on a set of firm-level characteristics of the targets and acquirers involved in the deals. We built an original dataset of 31,479 deals in 138 countries drawing from Zephyr and Orbis (Bureau Van Dijk) data. Empirical results of multinomial logit and OLS models show that deals involving SOEs are clearly different from the benchmark of private–private deals. This is mainly due to the greater assets, higher solvency ratios, broader experience of deals, and closer proximity to targets of the acquirers (both public and private) under public–private, public–public, and private–public deals compared to private–private deals.
L32|The targets of state capitalism: evidence from M&A deals|Over the last decade, particularly after the Great Recession, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been expanding their role in the global economy, including through merger & acquisitions (M&As). What are the characteristics of the firms targeted by SOEs? Are they different from firms controlled by private investors? By looking at a unique sample of around 25,000 M&As occurred over the period 2005–2012, we find that only SOEs controlled by means of minority of stakes (state-invested enterprises, SIEs) do not show any statistically significant difference in their targeting strategy compared to private enterprises. Conversely, majority-owned SOEs, and in particular financial SOEs buy lower performing firms compared to private acquirers. We interpret this fact as evidence of the internalization of political objectives by fully controlled and financial SOEs, but not by SIEs.
L32|Privatization in an International Mixed Oligopoly: the Role of Product Differentiation under Price Competition|By developing a linear model in a two-country framework of international price competition, we show how the degree of product differentiation and the cross-country distribution of private firms affect the strategic privatization choices made by governments concerned with their own country’s welfare. More particularly, the work points out that sufficiently low product differentiation may lead public ownership to be optimally chosen to restrict competition in the country with the larger number of firms, and privatization to be global welfare enhancing in this case.

L32|The public sector and privatization policy|In 2016, statistical data began to be published in the framework of the newly introduced System of Public Property Management Efficiency Estimates. It was approved by Decree of the RF Government of 29 January 2015, No 72 and introduced by way of replacing the public sector monitoring data, collected and released by the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) since the late 1990s in accordance with the provisions stipulated in Decree of the RF Government of January 4, 1999, No 1 (as amended as of December 30, 2002). Among other things, the System of Public Property Management Efficiency Estimates contains data on the number of federal state unitary enterprises (FSUEs) and joint-stock companies (JSCs) with RF stakes in their capital, which previously were published as part of government privatization programs (from 2011 – for three-year period, and prior to 2011- for one-year period.
L32|Coercive state, resisting society, political and economic development in Iran|In my studies, I have explored the political economy of Iran and particularly the relationship between the state and socio-economic development in this country. The importance of the oil revenue in economic development of contemporary Iran has been underlined since the early seventies and a vast literature on the rentier state and authoritarian modernization has scrutinized the specificities of the political and economic natural resource ‘curse’ in Iran. A new critical social history of the oil industry has recently endeavored to reconsider the spread effects of this industry on the emergence of new cities and labor activities. In this sense, the impact of oil revenue on economic development should be mitigated: it has not been only a ‘curse’ but also a ‘blessing’. The precious results of natural resource curse or blessing notwithstanding, this approach is insufficient to explain why some predatory states reliant on natural resources could contribute to economic development while others hinder such development. Two recent examples provide a salient illustration: why did the Shah’s regime which was dependent on oil revenues enhance economic development during 1962-1974, while Ahmadinjead’s two terms presidency (2005-2013) imped economic growth despite the quadrupling of oil revenues? In this essay, I will first introduce my theoretical framework and distinguish two types of predatory states, i.e. inclusive and exclusive (section 1). I will then apply this framework to explain oil and economic development (section 2). Section 3 will be devoted to the Shah’s regime as an inclusive predatory state, and section 4 to Ahmadinjead’s presidency as an illustration of an exclusive predatory state. A short conclusion will follow.
L32|ICT-Enabled Social Innovation for Active and Healthy Ageing: Redesigning long-term care and independent living in Europe|This issue of JRC Insights presents results from the analysis of initiatives and case studies on ICT-enabled social innovations promoting social investment in the field of Active and Healthy Ageing (AHA) conducted as part of the JRC-led IESI research, in collaboration with DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. It highlights how over 70% of the initiatives in the field of AHA promote social investment by supporting the modernisation of social protection systems as well as by supporting investment in people throughout their lives. It also reveals that AHA initiatives are frequently characterised by radical innovation potential and higher integration at the service level, often combining funding, administrative and service delivery systems. Finally, the article illustrates how ICTs drive the organizational transformation of service delivery, by reducing overlaps and strengthening integration among service providers. In addition, they increase efficiency and reduce costs by improve targeting and personalisation of services.
L32|Mixed duopoly: Differential game approach|This study formulates a dynamic mixed oligopoly model, in which a state‐owned public firm competes against a private firm over multiple periods. We adopt a differential game formulated by Fershtman and Kamien [Econometrica 55 (1987), pp. 1151–1164] and investigate how the dynamic competition affects the optimal privatization policy. We characterize the open‐loop Nash equilibrium (OLNE) and Markov‐perfect Nash equilibrium (MPNE). We show that in the MPNE, an increase in the degree of privatization has a nonmonotonic effect on the price, increasing it in a wide range of parameter spaces, which is in sharp contrast to the result in the OLNE or static analyses. We also find that the optimal degree of privatization is higher in the MPNE than that in the OLNE and static equilibrium. These results suggest that intertemporal strategic behavior changes the optimal privatization policy.
L32|The European Railway Sectors: Understanding and Assessing Change|This paper aims at explaining and assessing the process of change that European railway sectors have experienced over the last decades. It has been organized in two parts: the first part (section 2) explains change and the second part (section 3) empirically assesses change. In the first part we argue that the roots of this change process date back to the 1950s when, because of competitiveness reasons, the market share of most European railways began to decrease compared to other transport modes. Since national reformers ascribed these performance shortcomings to the traditional organization of the railway sector which was that of vertically-integrated state- owned monopoly. Therefore, between the 1970s and 1980s many governments in Europe adopted reforms that tried to inject competition in national railway sectors by supporting liberalization policies. Then, since early-1990s the European Commission has released a number of regulatory instruments aimed at pursuing three main goals: 1) liberalization of the rail services; 2) unbundling of infrastructure and service level, and 3) creation of the common transport market. The empirical analysis conducted in the second part of this paper suggests that state-controlled structures still play a crucial role in the management and performance of national railway industries as lower service prices are associated with greater presence of the state in the sector. Results show that liberalization-friendly regulation does not necessarily benefit railway service consumers since increased levels of market access, unbundling and privatization are not necessarily associated with lower prices. Our analysis shows that the long-lasting transition from state-owned monopolies to competitive market arrangements in the railway sectors provided mitigated results. We conclude this paper by launching a reflection on the future developments of railways in Europe.
L32|Public Enterprises – Objectives and Performance|Public ownership is a way to provide goods and services where market performance is not satisfactory, or when the economy would otherwise be stagnant, provided that its costs do not overshadow its benefits. We provide a brief review of the existing theoretical and empirical literature. While far from exhaustive, the review suggests that there is no unanimous body of research showing that public ownership is inefficient to such an extent that private ownership is always socially superior. More research is needed on the costs and benefits of different forms of ownership, and we emphasise the need of analysing potential intrinsic motivation, service quality and the impact of international competition. Moreover, the fact that privatisation has often been implemented through outsourcing suggests a need of analysing renationalisation through buyer power.
L32|State Owned Enterprises as Knowledge Explorer Agents|This paper deals with the role of the State Owned enterprises (SOEs) in innovation processes. Only a few studies focus on the contribution SOEs as companies might give to produce new knowledge and technological innovation. We argue, however, that SOEs are a pillar of the innovation process and we explore conditions that can make SOEs very effective. Through two in-depth case studies in two different industries (STMicroelectronics in the semiconductor and Thales Alenia Space in the space industry) we illustrate how SOEs can contribute to innovation by exploring new opportunities and recombining different sources of knowledge. We highlight the conditions that can make exploration and recombination possible. We also highlight the ability of the two companies to change their boundaries through a continuous wave of agreements, mergers and acquisitions. This way, they were able to expand beyond their domains in a way that matched the evolution of their original industries.
L32|Healthy business? Managerial education and management in healthcare|We investigate the link between hospital performance and managerial education by collecting a large database of management practices and skills in hospitals across nine countries. We find that hospitals that are closer to universities offering both medical education and business education have higher management quality, more MBA trained managers and lower mortality rates. This is true compared to the distance to universities that offer only business or medical education (or neither). We argue that supplying joint MBA-healthcare courses may be a channel through which universities increase medical business skills and raise clinical performance
L32|Public Sector Undertakings: Bharat's Other Ratnas|"This paper analyzes the performance of India's 235 public sector undertakings (PSUs) - India'ssocialistic legacy from the Nehru-Gandhi days. Of these 7 largest PSUs are called Maha Ratnas, 17 are called Nav Ratnas and some 73 are given the title of Mini Ratnas. The economic reforms of 1991 dismantled the ""license-raj"" but left the PSUs intact. Attempts were made to improve their performance through performance contracts called Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs) with some success but with still a large number of loss makers. A brief attempt was made under the NDA-1 government from 1999-2004 to begin dismantling this legacy with strategic disinvestment (privatization) but met with considerable opposition from vested interests and labour unions. Subsequent UPA governments tried to further improve the performance of these companies through better performance contracts and bringing more PSUs into the Ratna classification. Under UPA-2 more aggressive disinvestment (partial privatization) was also pursued to raise more revenue and hopefully improve firm performance. Using firm-level data over the period 1990-2015 from the Public Enterprise Survey now collated in the Capitaline Data Base, this paper looks into factors that explain the performance of these PSUs. The results show that MoUs have had a positive impact on PSU performance by increasing their return on capital (ROC) by almost 8-9 percentage points. This result holds mainly for the non-service sector (manufacturing, mining) but less so for service sector firms. In the case of service sector firms, partial privatization (share sales) has a significant impact on performance, making them ideal candidates for more aggressive disinvestment. The results also show that larger PSU-Maharatnas appear to perform better than smaller PSUs and even better than private firms of similar size. But smaller PSU-Navratnas and MiniRatnas perform worse than private companies and should be good candidates for strategic disinvestment (privatization). PSUs that do not have Ratna status, and are loss makers should be disposed of for their real estate and scrap value. We concludes that India should raise capital through strategic disinvestment (privatization), disinvestment and liquidation of up to $ 250 billion which can be re-invested in public infrastructure through the National Infrastructure Investment Fund and not into the budget as a revenue raising measure."
L32|Bolder Disinvestment or Better Performance Contracts? Which Way Forward for India's State-Owned Enterprises|This paper analyses the performance of India's Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) us-ing measures of labour and overall efficiency and productivity indicators as opposed to finan-cial returns. Using methods that correct for selection bias, the results show that performance contracts do not improve firm efficiency but disinvestment has a very strong positive effect on firm efficiency. Disinvestment improves labour productivity and efficiency, which is not surprising, but it also improves overall efficiency. India should pursue much bolder privati-zation even of PSUs which claim to be making operational profits - such as Air India, because privatization improves overall firm efficiency and unlocks capital for use elsewhere, espe-cially in public infrastructure, and reduces the possibility of political interference in their functioning in future.
L32|Does Experience Exert Impact on a PPP Performance?|Researchers traditionally assume that learning is a product of experience. In general it means that learning can only take place through the attempt to solve a problem and therefore only takes place during activity (Arrow, 1962). On the ground of organizational theory it has two implications. First we can agree that repeated activity requires less effort. Second we can argue that firms undertake activities, with which they have been the most successful in the past and that they expect to be the most successful in the future. The aim of the research is twofold. Firstly, this article aims to investigate if we can identify a relationship between the experience in PPP projects and the performance of initiatives of this kind. Secondly, the article aims to provide an interpretation of the relationship between experience and PPP performance. This research investigates factors influencing the survival of PPP projects in Poland over the period 2009-2015. Cox proportional hazard model is utilized to distinguish between PPPs that succeeded to the operation phase and those that were cancelled on the procurement stage. The research confirms the existence of a positive relationship between experience in PPP and the outcome of a PPP development.

L32|Comparing welfare and profit in quantity and price competition within Stackelberg mixed duopolies|Abstract We compare welfare and profits under price and quantity competition in Stackelberg mixed duopolies. Under public leadership, price competition always yields greater profits and welfare than quantity competition. By contrast, under private leadership, the result depends on the nationality of the private firm. When the private firm is domestic (foreign), welfare is greater under quantity (price) competition. However, private firms always earn more under price competition. Introducing the nonnegative profit constraint affects welfare ranking but not profit ranking. These results indicate that profit ranking is fairly robust to the time structure in Stackelberg mixed duopolies, but welfare ranking is not.
L32|Corporate social responsibility and privatization policy in a mixed oligopoly|Abstract This article formulates a mixed oligopoly in which a public firm competes with two private firms that may adopt corporate social responsibility (CSR). We then determine the optimal privatization policy and find that, depending on CSR level and cost differences among firms, either nationalization or full privatization can be optimal. For identical cost functions, we also show the optimal degree of privatization is decreasing with the level of CSR if private firms are homogeneous, while it is non-monotone with the CSR level in a significant heterogeneity of objectives among the firms. Our analysis suggests that CSR activities that affect the magnitude of heterogeneity among firms are crucial in choosing an optimal privatization policy in a mixed oligopoly.
L32|Strategic Trade and Privatization Policies in Bilateral Mixed Markets|We consider strategic trade and privatization policies in international bilateral mixed markets where a domestic state-owned enterprise competes with both domestic and foreign private enterprises in each country. We examine the strategic interaction of two countries’ optimal choices of privatization and trade policies with different combinations of production subsidy and import tariff, and find some interesting policy implications. First, a higher social welfare can be achieved with the appropriate degree of privatization when both governments adopt a production subsidy only. Second, FTA can work as a coordination device to solve the prisoner’s dilemma problem. Third, the maximum-revenue privatization, combined with zero subsidy and higher tariff, is higher than optimum-welfare privatization. Finally, the international bilateral equilibrium needs less degree of privatization and lower subsidy rate, even though it is jointly suboptimal from the viewpoint of global welfare.
L32|R&D Output Sharing in a Mixed Duopoly and Incentive Subsidy Policy|This study investigates the incentives for R&D output sharing in a mixed duopoly and shows that public firm chooses full sharing of their R&D output, whereas private firm enjoys free-riding. We then devise an agreement-based incentive R&D subsidy scheme, which can internalize R&D spillovers and induce both firms to earn higher payoffs through full sharing of their R&D output. We also show that an R&D subsidy policy is welfare-superior to a production subsidy policy.
L32|Applying Competition Policy to Optimize International Trade Rules|"This paper delves into the relationship between trade and competition, which has long been a subject largely untouched since the issue had been dropped from the multilateral trade agenda in 2003. The need to incorporate elements of competition policy into international trade rules has long been discussed in the context of making the international trade regime more effective. The issue has gained more attention as state-owned enterprises (SOEs) began to emerge as new influential players in the international market, competing with private enterprises on an unequal footing. A growing number of bilateral trade agreements have included chapters on competition policy, albeit with rules that do not have sufficient binding force for disciplining the business practices of state-owned enterprises. The recently concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), however, has introduced innovative rules for disciplining the competitive practices of SOEs by integrating the existing WTO disciplines on subsidies with competition rules. In this article, ""competitive neutrality"", the fundamental principle underlying the SOE disciplines, is used as a framework of analysis for understanding the new disciplines and obligations in the SOE rules. Several legal issues and challenges are identified that are relevant for applying the new rules in the real world, and implications are derived for future rule-making involving other new trade issues."
L32|An analytics framework for improving public service operations and processes towards transparency issues|It is critical for a public sector to raise awareness and fight against the corruption. Among many government projects, enhancing transparency through improving public service operations and processes can be seen as one of the solutions. This study presents the lesson learnt from the transparency project performed by government agencies including selection process and criteria, selected processes, attitudes towards the project, and various obstacles and limitations in deriving the right process. These findings are synthesized and an analytics framework of public service process selection for transparency is then proposed. Such framework incorporates data analytics methodologies and techniques so that it can be further developed to build transparency in today?s digital age.
L32|A comment on mixed oligopoly spatial model: the non-uniform consumer distribution|Abstract We allow a general (non-uniform) consumer distribution in a mixed duopoly Hotelling model. We characterize respective conditions under which socially optimal pricing and location are achieved. We find that, while the condition for socially optimal pricing is fairly general, that for a socially optimal location is much more restrictive. Consequently, using a public firm to regulate a market may continue to yield a socially optimal price, but not the socially optimal location. This implies that privatization of the public firm may be desirable.
L32|Building bridges or deepening divides: Resources and formal volunteering in post-apartheid South Africa|This study investigates volunteering in a highly unequal society. It uses post-apartheid South Africa as a case study: the enduring apartheid legacy has left deep divides between classes and races in the country. The research asks if formal volunteering serves to enhance social cohesion or reinforces such social divides. Logistic analysis is applied to the 2001 South African World Values Survey, to measure the strength of the relationship between the likelihood to volunteer, and selected human, social and cultural capital variables. The analysis shows that volunteering tends to align with existing social divides. Individuals are more likely to volunteer if they are educated and affluent, supporting the dominant status theory. Prejudice and not valuing sharing are also associated with a higher proclivity for volunteering. Broadly, we find that the available evidence suggests that volunteering is associated with bonding, rather than bridging, social capital. Although hardly uncontentious, broad-based support for and involvement in religious volunteering suggest that religious communities and congregations could in the future provide a bridge to help heal the rifts if links between such communities are strengthened.
L32|Coercive state, resisting society, political and economic development in Iran|In my studies, I have explored the political economy of Iran and particularly the relationship between the state and socioeconomic development in this country. The importance of the oil revenue in economic development of contemporary Iran has been underlined since the early seventies and a vast literature on the rentier state and authoritarian modernization has scrutinized the specificities of the political and economic natural resource 'curse' in Iran. A new critical social history of the oil industry has recently endeavored to reconsider the spread effects of this industry on the emergence of new cities and labor activities. In this sense, the impact of oil revenue on economic development should be mitigated: it has not been only a 'curse' but also a 'blessing'. The precious results of natural resource curse or blessing notwithstanding, this approach is insufficient to explain why some predatory states reliant on natural resources could contribute to economic development while others hinder such development. Two recent examples provide a salient illustration: why did the Shah's regime which was dependent on oil revenues enhance economic development during 1962-1974, while Ahmadinjead's two terms presidency (2005-2013) imped economic growth despite the quadrupling of oil revenues? In this essay, I will first introduce my theoretical framework and distinguish two types of predatory states, i.e. inclusive and exclusive (section 1). I will then apply this framework to explain oil and economic development (section 2). Section 3 will be devoted to the Shah's regime as an inclusive predatory state, and section 4 to Ahmadinjead's presidency as an illustration of an exclusive predatory state. A short conclusion will follow.
L32|Quasi-fiscal Deficits in the Electricity Sector of the Middle East and North Africa: Sources and Size|The annual electricity investments needed in the Middle East and North Africa region to keep up with demand have been estimated at about 3 percent of the region’s projected gross domestic product. However, in most economies of the region, the ability to make those investments is limited by fiscal and macroeconomic constraints. This paper demonstrates that the solution is readily available: by improving the management and performance of the region’s utilities, more than enough resources could be freed up to make the investments needed. The paper presents the first evaluation of the size and composition of the quasi-fiscal deficit associated with the management of the electricity sector in 14 economies in the Middle East and North Africa region. The estimations are for 2013. They show that the average quasi-fiscal deficit is 4.4 percent of gross domestic product (but goes down to 2.9 percent if Lebanon, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Jordan are excluded). Only five economies have a quasi-fiscal deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar, and the West Bank), and hence would not be able to finance the average investment requirement through elimination of inefficiencies. For most economies, the main driver of the quasi-fiscal deficit is the underpricing of electricity, which costs on average 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (but 2.2 percent without Lebanon, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Jordan). Commercial inefficiency comes next, at an average cost of 0.6 percent of gross domestic product. Technical and labor inefficiencies represent, respectively, 0.4 and 0.2 percent of gross domestic product.
L32|Public-private partnerships, incomplete contracts, and distributional fairness – when payments matter|The German energy sector’s transition toward the more distributed production of energy has given rise to various forms of decentralized energy production. Within the framework of decentralized infrastructure, the relation between the involved agents is often characterized by a high degree of social proximity. Thus, the spatial and social closeness usually emphasizes aspects of decision-making such as pro-social behavior that can have significant effects on the involved parties’ response to agency problems and their investment incentives. This essay applies behavioral economics’ finding on so-called social preferences to fundamental insights from incomplete contract theory regarding economic agents’ investment behavior. Specifically, it will be analyzed how a contractor’s investment incentives develop in a public-private partnership setting given incomplete contracts when the contractor disposes of preferences for distributional fairness. It will be shown that the investment incentives of the contractor are significantly different from those of the standard model assuming neoclassical preferences. Another important finding is that in contrast to the standard model in which only the allocation of property rights can set different investment incentives, payments can also influence an economic agent’s behavior when social preferences apply as the distribution of payments determines whether the psychological influences of envy or a sense of guilt are affecting the contractor.

L32|Governance Innovation for SOEs in Bulgaria: Based on Korean Experience|The recent financial performances of many Bulgarian SOEs have revealed the shortcomings in the management of its SOEs. The main direction of Bulgarian reforms should be improving transparency, better selection and appraisal of management, sustainable dividend policy, strengthening financial discipline and coherent ways to reduce the debt burden. The institutional status quo is clearly inefficient and needs to be replaced. The direction of SOE governance reforms in Korea and Bulgaria are substantially different. Korea has maintained a very centralized grip over SOEs for an extended period of time, and it needs to reduce government intervention by guaranteeing more autonomy for SOEs. On the other hand, Bulgaria needs more centralized control over SOEs, which is expected to improve their performance. The Korean experience in reforming its SOE management system is highly relevant for Bulgaria and it complies with the OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises. This paper asks 31 questions regarding a system of good governance and presents options for each question regarding positive and negative aspects, followed by specific recommendations for the Bulgarian government. It is recommended that a centralized authority responsible for the management of SOEs be established which is composed of line vice-ministers and experts from academia and the private sector. Major tasks and responsibilities should be transferred gradually from line ministries to this new setting. Among these include increasing transparency, the introduction of an evaluation system with strict consequences and related open competitive procedures for the selection, the appointment and appraisal of CEOs, as well as an annual bonus system. SOE governance reform in Bulgaria will touch off strong resistance from both line ministries and their SOEs. Therefore, it will require a good deal of effort and strategy to accomplish the task. It is important to win the minds of the people and the political leadership in that the current system is subject to a number of problems, and that reform of the system is critical to a more efficient economy and provision of better public services to its citizens.

L32|An Analysis of the New Trade Regime for State-Owned Enterprises under the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement|This paper analyses the new discipline on state-owned enterprises contained in the recently concluded Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement, and evaluates various factors that influenced the shaping of its specific rules. The new discipline consolidates and strengthens related provisions in current trade regimes, reflects various aspects of trade disputes between China and the US, and adopts, as its general underlying rationale, the principle of competitive neutrality. The new discipline contains elements that may challenge the multilateral trade regime, and may serve as a role model in regulating state-owned enterprises, including subsidies in services trade in other on-going trade negotiations. The new regime makes us think hard about fundamental issues regarding enforcement of competition policy against state-owned enterprises, treatment of non-market economies, and how to deal with effects of subsidies in international trade, bringing competition issues back on the trade agenda.
L32|Public sector accounting in the Czech Republic and Slovakia|This paper briefly outlines the actual situation of accounting reform of public finance. Nowadays, most countries use the accrual principle in various stages of development to ensure the reliability and accuracy of output data and improve the performance of public sector. The paper should identify some main problems in the implementation of accrual basis in accounting at the municipal level in the Czech Republic and compare with Slovak municipalities. Aim of the research is to present outcomes of analysis focused on currently discussed topics which are related to introducing the accrual principle into accounting of local government, especially small municipalities. First part of the paper summarize current situation, the second part discuss the benefits of accounting reform process and quality accounting information for public finance and performance measurements in this area. Finally the paper includes main findings from the questionnaire survey.
L32|Sensitivity and vulnerability of European countries in time of crisis based on a new approach to data clustering and curvilinear analysis|In this paper we inquire into the way the global crisis during the period 2008- 2012 reflected in some macroeconomic and social indicators of the EU member states. Applying Curvilinear Component Analysis (CCA) on a dataset representing these social indicators, a classification of EU countries is obtained. Comparing this classification with the one resulted from a previous study with self organizing maps (SOM) it was noticed that the clusters are almost identical, CCA having the advantage of dimensionality reduction over SOM. CCA shows the detailed distances between the countries/year, dismissing outliers. This allows for a case by case study both in terms of clustering and in terms of temporal analysis. The research findings prove the sensitivity and vulnerability of European countries during the crisis and could help the policy makers to identify effective measures for strengthening the protective capacity of their states in the event of a future economic and social crisis.
L32|Glimpses into Private Dimension of the Health System: Entrepreneurial Solutions and Statistical Insights|The objective of this paper is to emphasize the link between entrepreneurial spirit and the wellbeing of the healthcare system. Based on a model constructed on empirical observations and built around the concept of entrepreneurial spirit, this paper aims to show that this spirit needs stimulate both the private and the public components of a healthcare system. The paper presents the dynamic of the healthcare market, private practices and private hospitals in Romania, starting from the early ‘90s and up until the present, showing the problems that have been encountered and a short analysis of some key indicators relevant to entrepreneurial initiatives in the private healthcare system. A special section is dedicated to the comparison between the scale of the activity in private and public Romanian hospitals, as shown by contracts and payments made by the National Health Insurance House. At the same time, the article postulates a potential practical impact that entrepreneurial activities might have on the future development of the public healthcare system.

This article aims to analyse the state-of-play in relation to professionalization of vocational roles of PES employees in Europe, on the basis of research conducted by the author in the years 2012–2014 for the European Commission. These studies included literature review, analysis of available research and structured survey conducted among representatives of the Public Employment Services in 22 EU countries, complemented by in-depth interviews and analysis of solutions used in PES. On the basis of this research a European reference competence profile for PES and EURES counsellors has been created by the author for the purposes of increasing professionalization of roles within these specific public services.
L32|Public-Private Partnerships and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: Fit for purpose?|In light of a cautious emphasis given to public-private partnerships (PPPs) as a mechanism to finance infrastructure projects and highlighting the need for capacity building and knowledge sharing at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa, this paper reviews the extant literature on the subject and identifies areas requiring better understanding and institutional innovation for ensuring value for money, minimizing contingent fiscal risk and improving accountability. An institutional capacity to create, manage and evaluate PPPs is essential to ensure that they become an effective instrument of delivery of important services, such as infrastructure. There is also a need for a common definition of PPPs and internationally accepted guidelines, including uniform accounting and reporting standards.
L32|No country for neoliberalism: a topic modeling approach to protean discourses to resist privatizations in Italy|This paper analyzes the resistance to the neoliberal discourse supporting privatizations in the Italian sociopolitical field: we address the change from a state control over economy to a situation where most of the state owned enterprises are sold and neoliberal principles are widely adopted and accepted. We focus on resistance, which builds on two frames that differ according to the period when they arise, the words they are composed of, the meanings they bear upon. The first one, which is more prevalent in the period 1984-2000, and that we called Òvalues of developmental stateÓ, opposes privatizations from a technical point of view: it is used in quotes that rationally support state intervention in economy. The second frame, that we called Òstigma privatizationsÓ, becomes prevalent starting in 2000 and appears mainly in articles that deal with societal issues, literature, movies and the wider sociocultural debate. Here influential speakers blame privatizations as something that eroded societal cohesion. To explain the transformation, we mobilize the concept of capital as described by Bourdieu: as economic capital attached to delegitimized institutions erode, discourse on resistance does not disappear but is framed within the fields that are less dependent on economic capital. As a connected contribution, the key role played by cultural capital in preserving areas of resistances revives the debate on the role of intellectuals within power dynamics as described by Antonio Gramsci. From a technical point of view, we study the evolution of the vocabulary of privatizations by analyzing almost 70.000 articles in the period 1984-2014. we use Topic Modeling, that is an automated text analysis technique that elicits topics, which are the sets of words that constitute discourses. We then reconstruct frames starting from these topics.
L32|How To Design Infrastructure Contracts In A Warming World: A Critical Appraisal Of Public–Private Partnerships| We analyze how long‐term uncertainty, for example, regarding future climate conditions, affects the design of concession contracts and organizational forms in a principal–agent context, with dynamic moral hazard, limited liability, and irreversibility constraints. The prospect of future, uncertain productivity shocks on the returns on the firm's effort creates an option value of delaying efforts, a course that exacerbates agency costs. Contracts and organizational forms are drafted to control this cost of delegated flexibility. The possibility for the agent to delay investment in response to uncertainty and irreversibility also elicits preference for unbundling different stages of the project through short‐term contracts. Our analysis is relevant to infrastructure sectors that are sensitive to changing weather conditions and sheds a pessimistic light on the relevance of public–private partnerships in this context.
L32|Persistent and transient efficiency on the stochastic production and cost frontiers – an application to the motorway sector|This paper implements both stochastic production and cost frontier analyses to estimate the efficiency of toll motorway companies in Spain, the country with the largest number of private concessionaires in this economic sector. Our dataset includes 32 concessionaires with different features for a time span of 26 years (1988-2014). The results support the existence of scale and density economies, showing that an increase in vehicle-kilometers is more important for cost efficiency than extending the motorway. The differences between transient and persistent efficiency are significant, so that we can test for regulatory and ownership differences. The price cap regulation seems to increase management technical efficiency. Regional governments grant better projects than central governments and, as shareholders, they also perform better. However, their performance is not significantly differently from that of full private concessionaires. We also find limited evidence of efficiency gains from privatization. These results help us provide new insights to evaluate policy and regulatory reforms aimed at enhancing technical efficiency in the sector.
L32|Dynamic reform of public institutions: A model of motivated agents and collective reputation|State capacity is optimized when public institutions are staffed by individuals with public-service motivation. However, when motivated agents value the collective reputation of their place of employment, steady-state equilibria with both high and low aggregate motivation (reputation) in the mission-oriented sector exist. Reforming a low-motivation institution requires a non-monotonic wage path: since the effect of higher wages on motivation is negative for a highreputation institution, but positive for a low-reputation institution, a transition to a high-reputation steady state requires an initial wage increase to crowd motivated workers in, followed by a wage decrease to crowd non-motivated workers out.
L32|Uniform Service, Uniform Productivity? Regional Efficiency of the Imperial German Postal, Telegraph, and Telephone Service|Using the regional productivity of the Reichspost, the postal service of the German Empire, I investigate whether a public monopolist operates with uniform regional productivity. Using DEA efficiency scores we derive the relative productivity of the post, telegraph and telephone sectors from 1891 to 1908. Results show a fairly stable system with substantial raw productivity differences between postal districts and that the expansion of the service offset technological productivity increases for the mail service.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L32|Regional Redistribution through the US Mortgage Market|Regional shocks are an important feature of the US economy. Households' ability to self-insure against these shocks depends on how they affect local interest rates. In the United States, most borrowing occurs through the mortgage market and is influenced by the presence of government-sponsored enterprises (GSE). We establish that despite large regional variation in predictable default risk, GSE mortgage rates for otherwise identical loans do not vary spatially. In contrast, the private market does set interest rates which vary with local risk. We use a spatial model of collateralized borrowing to show that the national interest rate policy substantially affects welfare by redistributing resources across regions.
L32|Labour, Profit and Housing Rent Shares in Italian GDP: Long-Run Trends and Recent Patterns|The share of labour increased in the first half of the 1970s, declined slowly to its 1960s level in 2001, and since then has been rising. Between 1975 and 2001, the decline in the labour share was due in part to the recovery in profits, and in part to a steady increase in housing rents on GDP, to 13% of value added (5% in 1975) and almost 40% of capital income (20% in the mid-1970s). Net of housing rents, the share of profits fell to a historical low during the great recession. In the business sector net of housing, recovery of the labour share, magnified by the recent recession, was evident in manufacturing and industries other than regulated sectors (energy, transport, communications and finance), where privatizations and changes to regulation provoked a marked drop in the labour share in the late 1990s. I tentatively explain the trend reversal in the labour share, which started well before the onset of the crises, as due to a compression in the mark-ups on marginal costs and the difficulty experienced by Italian firms to be rewarded for their innovation efforts (product quality upgrading)in a more competitive environment.

Pored procene osnovnih oblika sive ekonomije, identifikuju se kategorije privrednih subjekata koje su najviše uključene u aktivnosti sive ekonomije, kao i specifični faktori koji su statistički značajni za odluku preduzeća da učestvuje u sivoj ekonomiji, a takođe i njihov neto uticaj. Rezultati ukazuju da se 38,4% privrednih subjekata (preduzeća i preduzetnika) u Crnoj Gori bavilo aktivnostima sive ekonomije 2014. godine. Nešto više od jedne trećine privrednih subjekata imalo je neformalno zaposlene, a 17,4% PDV obveznika više od 10% plaćanja obavljalo je gotovinski. Privredni subjekti sa domaćim kapitalom, sa manjim brojem zaposlenih i oni koji se nisu registrovali kada su počeli sa radom imaju veću verovatnoću da obavljaju aktivnosti sive ekonomije, pod pretpostavkom ostalih istih karakteristika. Rezultati takođe ukazuju da stav o opravdanosti sive ekonomije značajno utiče na odluku pojedinca da učestvuje u sivoj ekonomiji.
L32|Dividend Policy In Regulated Network Industries: Evidence From The Eu|" type=""main"" xml:id=""ecin12238-abs-0001""> We study the dividend policy of firms in regulated network industries, focusing on the impact of different regulatory regimes and government control. We link payout and smoothing decisions to different regulatory mechanisms (cost-based vs. incentive regulation) and state versus private ownership. We test our predictions on a panel of listed European electric utilities, accounting for potential endogeneity of the choice of regulatory and ownership patterns. We find that incentive-regulated firms smooth their dividends less than cost-based regulated firms and that they report higher target payout ratios. Consistent with the interest group theory of regulation, we find that incentive regulation schemes are less likely when the state is still an important shareholder in the sector. Additionally, our results show that government control undermines the efficiency-enhancing effects of incentive regulation on dividend policy, for example, lower smoothing is only due to private firms.

L32|Particularities Companies With Locally Activity|In our view, companies operating locally engine should be both balanced territorial development, and sustainable development. In this regard, our research focused on finding mechanisms, means, techniques, methods by which financial side asymmetry territorial development plan can be reduced, consistent with the objectives of sustainable development at national and regional level. In our country, just administrative doctrine is the biggest obstacle to territorial development plan of these types of companies. Although there is a favourable legal framework that allows private provision in the form of public services, there are many cases when they are made by local government, but at a level determined predominantly by sources and appropriate level of financial resources. An alternative to the current state is the economic development zone, a concept proposed by us and trying to solve problems of interconnecting various locations (sized entities with different socio-economic structures) but which have in common a particular purpose. Public - private partnership thus becomes another dimension, the territorial level, the ultimate goal of meeting the needs of the population in the area.
L32|Corporate Governance of SOEs and performance in transition countries. Evidence from Lithuania|This paper investigates whether and to what extent corporate governance mechanisms affect the efficiency of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) operating in transition economies. Furthermore, it examines the relationship between corporate governance practice and its impact on both wholly state run SOEs and majority state run SOEs. We employed a unique dataset of corporate governance ratings (related to quality of transparency, quality of board, and quality of strategic planning, implementation and control) of commercial Lithuanian SOEs relating to the period following the introduction of the corporate governance reforms in the years 2012-2013. In order to investigate our research hypotheses, we set-up a two stage empirical research strategy that combined a non-parametric efficiency estimator (i.e., Data Envelopment Analysis) with a bootstrapped truncated regression. We built two aggregate indexes of corporate governance ratings to represent one dimension of corporate governance quality. We then ran a battery of regressions using both the aggregated and the single corporate governance indexes as independent variables. First, the paper finds that the wholly state ownership model of SOEs is positively correlated to efficiency (i.e., wholly SOEs are more efficient than majority SOEs). Moreover, overall corporate governance practices are efficiency-enhancing; more specifically, board quality and strategic planning seem to be effective internal governance mechanisms in promoting overall organizational efficiency. Interestingly, we uncovered that there exists a relationship between concentration of ownership and corporate governance practices, but this mitigated efficiency enhancement in wholly state run SOEs compared to majority state run SOEs. This effect was driven by the lower quality of the board. Overall, our findings illustrate that corporate governance reforms have enhanced efficiency, but wholly SOEs require a better implementation in order to achieve full efficiency gains.
L32|Market structure, patient choice and hospital quality for elective patients|We examine the change in the effect of market structure on hospital quality for elective procedures (hip and knee replacements, and coronary artery bypass grafts) following the 2006 loosening of restrictions on patient choice of hospital in England. We allow for time-varying endogeneity due to the effect of unobserved patient characteristics on patient choice of hospital using Two Stage Residual Inclusion. We find that the change in the effect of market structure due to the 2006 choice reforms was to reduce quality by increasing the probability of a post-operative emergency readmission for hip and knee replacement patients. There was no effect of the choice reform on hospital quality for coronary bypass patients. We find no evidence of self-selection of patients into hospitals, suggesting that a rich set of patient-level covariates controls for differences in casemix.

Some of the evidence is particularly pronounced in localities where the incumbent politicians face significant competition for reelection.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L32|A (Re)Municipalization Trend among Energy Utilities: Truth or Myth?|In the 1990s, a number of municipalities started privatizing their energy utilities; in recent years, there has been an intensive debate about whether a paradigm shift has taken place since then. Cities and municipalities have considered putting the energy, water, gas and heat supply back into the hands of public companies; Berlin and Hamburg are two prominent examples. But is there really an overarching trend toward (re)municipalization? According to the present study, which evaluates newly available microdata from official statistics, there is no evidence of a comprehensive (re)municipalization. The increase in public enterprises appears to have more to do with general restructuring in the energy sector, and has in fact been less pronounced than has growth in the private sector.
L32|No Differences in Efficiency Between Public and Private Utilities|The increase in municipal economic activity in the utilities sector frequently comes under scrutiny. It is presumed that public utilities have less incentive to provide efficient service than private companies. This could result in excessive costs and prices for end users. New microdata on German energy supply companies allow to conduct an empirical analysis for the whole of Germany for the first time. The findings indicate that there is no difference in efficiency between public and private utilities. This applies to both the competitively structured electricity retail sector and regulated electricity distribution sector. General restructuring in the energy sector such as the increased competitive pressure or the introduction of a more stringent regulatory regime have led to changes in the efficiency of all energy supply companies. The dichotomy between public and private utilities that has been suggested in the (re)municipalization debate therefore appears to be exaggerated.

L32|Corporate Boards of Large Companies: More Momentum Needed for Gender Parity|Germany’s large corporations still have a long way to go before achieving balanced representation of men and women on their boards. At the end of 2015, the share of women on the executive boards of the top 200 companies in Germany was a good six percent, an increase of less than one percentage point over 2014. The share of women on the supervisory boards of these top 200 companies was almost 20 percent although growth there has slowed. The DAX 30 performed slightly better in terms of women’s representation: the proportion of women on the executive boards of these companies was just under ten percent at the close of 2015 and the equivalent figure for supervisory boards was almost 27 percent. (In both cases, this represented an increase of more than two percentage points). Of the over 100 companies obliged to comply with a statutory 30-percent share of women for all new supervisory board appointments from January 2016, almost 28 percent had already met this quota by the end of 2015. Just under one-third of the companies had achieved a share of at least 20 percent but still less than 30 percent of female supervisory board members and were therefore well on their way to fulfilling the quota. Almost half of all DAX 30 companies met the quota. However, it is highly unlikely that the lion’s share of the remaining companies will follow these trailblazers voluntarily in the near future since 22 percent of the top 200 and 24 percent of TecDAX companies, as well as over one-third of SDAX companies, currently either have no female supervisory board members at all or at most one in ten. Moreover, the share of women on executive boards is extremely low in all the companies analyzed in the present study. Germany’s companies still have a long and difficult path ahead of them in order to achieve increased representation of women on their corporate boards. This makes it all the more imperative to adopt a coordinated approach to improve the career prospects of women by means of stringent framework conditions, also encompassing fiscal and family policy.

L32|Financial Sector: Share of Women on Corporate Boards Increases Slightly but Men Still Call the Shots|In 2015, the share of women in the top decision-making bodies of the financial sector increased once again but men remain in the overwhelming majority and thus continue to call the shots. At the end of 2015, women made up just under eight percent of executive board members of the 100 largest banks in Germany. The corresponding figure for the 59 largest insurance companies was a good nine percent. In both cases, this is less than a percentage point more than in 2014. Even on supervisory boards where the share of women is traditionally higher, both banks (with just over 21 percent women on supervisory boards) and insurance companies (with just over 19 percent) have a long way to go before achieving gender parity. The proportion of women on the supervisory boards of cooperative banks was particularly low (under 16 percent) despite the fact that these institutions are, in principle, based on a participatory business model. Overall, many more women than men are employed in the financial sector. As is generally known, the presence of women in senior management in particular is a prerequisite for their promotion to top management bodies. The companies would therefore be well advised to improve the career opportunities of their most talented female employees by promoting them more frequently and appointing them to managerial positions. This would be a wise move in anticipation of a possible expansion of the statutory gender quota and a tightening of the sanctions set out in the new law on equality for women and men in managerial positions, both in the private and public sectors, which was enacted in Germany in May 2015.
L32|Women's Likelihood of Holding a Senior Management Position Is Considerably Lower than Men's - Especially in the Financial Sector|Women remain grossly underrepresented in management positions in Germany. However, what has been dubbed the gender leadership gap, i.e., the difference between the share of all employees who are women and the share of women in senior management positions, varies considerably across different industries. The present report shows that the largest gender gap in the likelihood of holding a senior management position is to be found in the financial sector. Possible explanations include an exceptionally masculine culture and the specific legal requirements of CEOs in the financial sector that are implicitly biased toward men. Furthermore part-time work generally has an adverse effect on women’s career prospects: for many management positions, being able to work full-time is a prerequisite that often excludes women from taking on these positions due to the traditional division of household and family labor. Policy-makers and the business community should therefore adopt measures to increase gender equality when it comes to working hours. The “family working-time benefits model” and improvements in the quality of child day care proposed by DIW Berlin would be steps in the right direction.

L32|Spitzengremien großer Unternehmen: mehr Schubkraft für eine ausgewogene Repräsentation von Frauen und Männern nötig|Germany’s large corporations still have a long way to go before achieving balanced representation of men and women on their boards. At the end of 2015, the share of women on the executive boards of the top 200 companies in Germany was a good six percent, an increase of less than one percentage point over 2014. The share of women on the supervisory boards of these top 200 companies was almost 20 percent although growth there has slowed. The DAX 30 performed slightly better in terms of women’s representation: the proportion of women on the executive boards of these companies was just under ten percent at the close of 2015 and the equivalent figure for supervisory boards was almost 27 percent. (In both cases, this represented an increase of more than two percentage points). Of the over 100 companies obliged to comply with a statutory 30-percent share of women for all new supervisory board appointments from January 2016, almost 28 percent had already met this quota by the end of 2015. Just under one-third of the companies had achieved a share of at least 20 percent but still less than 30 percent of female supervisory board members and were therefore well on their way to fulfilling the quota. Almost half of all DAX 30 companies met the quota. However, it is highly unlikely that the lion’s share of the remaining companies will follow these trailblazers voluntarily in the near future since 22 percent of the top 200 and 24 percent of TecDAX companies, as well as over one-third of SDAX companies, currently either have no female supervisory board members at all or at most one in ten. Moreover, the share of women on executive boards is extremely low in all the companies analyzed in the present study. Germany’s companies still have a long and difficult path ahead of them in order to achieve increased representation of women on their corporate boards. This makes it all the more imperative to adopt a coordinated approach to improve the career prospects of women by means of stringent framework conditions, also encompassing fiscal and family policy. Eine ausgewogene Repräsentation von Männern und Frauen in den Spitzengremien großer Unternehmen in Deutschland bleibt in weiter Ferne. In den Vorständen der 200 umsatzstärksten Unternehmen lag der Frauenanteil Ende vergangenen Jahres bei gut sechs Prozent – ein Anstieg von weniger als einem Prozentpunkt gegenüber dem Vorjahr. Die Aufsichtsräte waren zu fast 20 Prozent mit Frauen besetzt, allerdings hat sich die Dynamik abgeschwächt. Etwas besser war die Situation in den 30 größten börsennotierten Unternehmen: Im DAX-30 lag der Frauenanteil Ende 2015 in Vorständen bei knapp zehn Prozent (plus gut zwei Prozentpunkte) und in Aufsichtsräten bei fast 27 Prozent (plus gut zwei Prozentpunkte). Von den gut 100 Unternehmen, die ab 2016 bei Neubesetzungen ihres Aufsichtsrats Frauen bis zu einem Anteil von mindestens 30 Prozent berücksichtigen müssen, hatten fast 28 Prozent diese Quote Ende des Jahres 2015 bereits erfüllt. Knapp ein Drittel der Unternehmen waren mit einem Anteil von 20 bis unter 30 Prozent Aufsichtsrätinnen auf dem Weg dorthin. In der DAX-30-Gruppe erreichte nahezu die Hälfte der Unternehmen die Zielgröße. Dass die Masse der anderen Unternehmen den Vorreitern in absehbarer Zeit auf freiwilliger Basis folgt, ist unwahrscheinlich: Denn in 22 Prozent der Top-200- und 24 Prozent der TecDAX- sowie über einem Drittel der SDAX-Unternehmen ist derzeit entweder gar kein Aufsichtsratsmitglied oder höchstens jedes zehnte eine Frau. Der Anteil von Frauen in Vorständen ist zudem in allen untersuchten Unternehmensgruppen extrem gering. Der Weg zu mehr Frauen in Spitzengremien bleibt also lang und mühsam. Umso dringender ist eine Politik aus einem Guss, die durch stringente Rahmenbedingungen, auch in der Steuer- und Familienpolitik, die Karrierechancen von Frauen verbessert.

L32|Finanzsektor: Frauenanteile in Spitzengremien nehmen etwas zu – Männer geben den Ton an|In 2015, the share of women in the top decision-making bodies of the financial sector increased once again but men remain in the overwhelming majority and thus continue to call the shots. At the end of 2015, women made up just under eight percent of executive board members of the 100 largest banks in Germany, and the corresponding figure for the 59 largest insurance companies was a good nine percent (in both cases this is less than a percentage point more than in 2014). Even on supervisory boards where the share of women is traditionally higher, both banks (with just over 21 percent women on supervisory boards) and insurance companies (with just over 19 percent) have a long way to go before achieving gender parity. The proportion of women on the supervisory boards of cooperative banks was particularly low (just under 16 percent) despite the fact that these institutions are, in principle, based on a participatory business model. Overall, many more women than men are employed in the financial sector. It is well known that the presence of women in senior management is a prerequisite for their promotion to corporate boards. Therefore, these financial enterprises would be well advised to improve the career opportunities of their most talented female employees by promoting them more frequently and appointing them to managerial positions. This would be a wise move in anticipation of a possible expansion of the statutory gender quota and a tightening of the sanctions set out in the new law on equality for women and men in managerial positions, both in the private and public sectors, which came into force in Germany in May 2015. Der Anteil von Frauen in Spitzengremien im Finanzsektor hat im Jahr 2015 erneut zugenommen, Männer geben aber mit überwältigender Mehrheit den Ton an. In den 100 größten Banken in Deutschland lag der Frauenanteil in Vorständen Ende 2015 bei knapp acht Prozent und in den 59 größten Versicherungen bei gut neun Prozent – das war jeweils weniger als ein Prozentpunkt mehr als im Jahr zuvor. In den Aufsichtsräten ist der Frauenanteil zwar traditionell höher. Allerdings waren sowohl die Geldhäuser (gut 21 Prozent Frauen in den Kontrollgremien) als auch die Versicherungen (gut 19 Prozent) noch weit von einer ausgeglichenen Repräsentation der Geschlechter entfernt. Besonders gering war der Frauenanteil in den Aufsichtsräten von Genossenschaftsbanken (knapp 16 Prozent), obwohl diese im Grundsatz ein partizipatives Geschäftsmodell verfolgen. Insgesamt sind weit mehr Frauen als Männer im Finanzsektor beschäftigt. Bekanntlich ist das Vorhandensein von Frauen insbesondere im oberen Management eine Voraussetzung für deren Beförderung in die Spitzengremien. Die Unternehmen sind daher gut beraten, ihre weiblichen Talente verstärkt in die Karrierepfade zu integrieren, sie also häufiger in höhere Führungspositionen zu befördern und einzustellen – auch, um einer möglichen Ausweitung der verbindlichen Geschlechterquote und einer Verschärfung der Sanktionen im seit Mai 2015 geltenden Gesetz für die gleichberechtigte Teilhabe von Frauen und Männern an Führungspositionen in der Privatwirtschaft und im öffentlichen Dienst zuvorzukommen.
L32|Trend zur (Re-)Kommunalisierung in der Energieversorgung: ein Mythos?|In the 1990s, a number of municipalities started privatizing their energy utilities; in recent years, there has been an intensive debate about whether a paradigm shift has taken place since then. Cities and municipalities have considered putting the energy, water, gas and heat supply networks back into the hands of public companies; Berlin and Hamburg are two prominent examples. But is there really an overarching trend toward (re)municipalization? According to the present study, which evaluates newly available microdata from official statistics, there is no evidence of a comprehensive (re)municipalization. The increase in public enterprises appears to have more to do with general restructuring in the energy sector, and has in fact been less pronounced than has growth in the private sector. Nachdem in den 90er Jahren viele Kommunen ihre Energieversorgungsunternehmen privatisiert hatten, ist mittlerweile oft von einem Paradigmenwechsel die Rede. Städte und Gemeinden ziehen demnach in Betracht, die Versorgung mit Strom, Wasser, Gas und Wärme wieder in die Hände öffentlicher Unternehmen zu legen. Die Städte Berlin und Hamburg sind zwei prominente Beispiele dafür. Doch gibt es einen allgemeinen (Re-)Kommunalisierungstrend? Die vorliegende Studie wertet erstmalig verfügbare Mikrodaten der amtlichen Statistik aus und kommt zu dem Schluss: Anhaltspunkte für einen umfassenden (Re-)Kommunalisierungstrend gibt es nicht. Die Zunahme öffentlicher Unternehmen scheint vielmehr auf generelle Umstrukturierungen im Energiesektor zurückzugehen und fällt relativ zum Zuwachs der Privaten geringer aus.
L32|Hohe Führungspositionen: in der Finanzbranche haben Frauen im Vergleich zu Männern besonders geringe Chancen|Overall, women are still grossly underrepresented in management positions in Germany. However, what has been dubbed the gender leadership gap, i.e., the difference between the share of all employees who are women and the share of women in senior management positions, varies considerably across the different sectors. The present report shows that women have the lowest odds of occupying a senior management position in the financial sector although—measured against the total number of employees in the sector—the industry has a particularly large number of senior management positions. Possible explanations for this are the exceptionally masculine culture and the specific legal requirements of CEOs in the financial sector which are implicitly biased toward men. Generally, part-time work also has an adverse effect on women’s career prospects: for many management positions, being able to work full-time is a prerequisite which often excludes women from taking on these roles due to the traditional division of household and family labor—the same obviously does not apply to men. Policy-makers and the business community should therefore adopt measures to increase gender equality in terms of working hours. The “family working-time benefits model” and improvements in the quality of child day care proposed by DIW Berlin would be steps in the right direction. Frauen sind in Führungspositionen insgesamt noch immer deutlich unterrepräsentiert. Der sogenannte Gender Leadership Gap, also die Differenz zwischen dem Anteil von Frauen an allen abhängig Beschäftigten und dem Anteil von Frauen in hohen Führungspositionen, variiert zwischen einzelnen Branchen allerdings erheblich. Der vorliegende Bericht zeigt, dass die Chancen von Frauen in der Finanzbranche am geringsten sind, obwohl es dort – gemessen an allen Beschäftigten in der Branche – besonders viele hohe Führungspositionen gibt. Gründe dafür könnten eine besonders maskuline Kultur sowie die speziellen gesetzlichen Anforderungen an GeschäftsleiterInnen im Finanzsektor sein, die implizit Männern stärker zugutekommen. Generell schmälert auch Teilzeitarbeit die Karrierechancen von Frauen: Für viele Führungspositionen ist eine Vollzeittätigkeit Voraussetzung, der Frauen aufgrund der nach wie vor tradierten Aufgabenteilung in Familie und Haushalt aber oft nicht nachgehen können – im Gegensatz zu Männern. Politik und Wirtschaft sollten daher Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Erwerbsumfang von Männern und Frauen angleichen. Die vom DIW Berlin vorgeschlagene Familienarbeitszeit und der qualitative Ausbau der Kinderbetreuung wären wichtige Schritte auf diesem Weg.

For most applications data for â€˜state owned and state-holding companiesâ€™ based on the control concept is appropriate, as this includes coverage of SOEsâ€™ listed- and unlisted-subsidiaries. These data show that less than a third of Chinese industrial output, fixed asset investment, and less than twenty per cent of Chinese real estate investment is carried on by companies that are controlled by the state. A broader definition to cover all state ownership would include enterprises that are not â€˜state controlledâ€™ but nevertheless include state capital or investment from SOEs. This would capture some additional proportion of the limited liability companies, joint-ventures and shareholding corporations that are in mixed ownership.

L32|Editorial statement: Switching costs in the European postal service. Are there any solutions?|This article examines the costs of switching that may exist in the European postal sector, where it is carried out an ambitious process of opening to competition since 1997. Inadequate regulation of the access to some elements of postal infrastructure or services within the scope of the universal postal service exists. This article proposes adaptations to ensure transparent and non-discriminatory access conditions to elements of postal infrastructure in line with the sectorial directives aimed at strengthening competition in the long term in the postal market. The proposed adaptations focus on services such as postcode systems, address databases, post office boxes, delivery boxes, re-direction and return to sender services. All of them can help reduce the switching cost and thus strengthen competition.
L32|Sales Territory Management and Distributor Performance in the Telecommunications Industry in Ghana|The mobile telecommunications in Ghana is a highly competitive market which faces a problem of retaining their customers due to low switching cost. The purpose of this study was to investigate sales territory management and distributor performance of Vodafone in Sunyani. The population for the study was staff and retailers of Vodafone product and services. Multi-Stage sampling approach was employed for the study. A well-structured questionnaire and interview guide were used in collecting data from the respondents. Descriptive statistics, One Sample t-test, Kendall’s Coefficient of Concordance and Pearson Correlation Matrix were used to analyse the data. Results revealed that there was effective supervision of the sales territory representatives by the sales managers. The retailer’s confirmed the receipt of their requested orders from the distributor when the need arose. The sales territory representatives confirmed that sales managers involved them in developing new or adjusted territory plans for effective distribution. This study suggests that the key distributor should restructure their distribution strategy for better market penetration. Vodafone should do more to support the distributor in terms of logistics and intensify sales training for the sales territory representatives. Furthermore, the study prescribed five generic factors to serve as best practices for distributor management of any organisation.
L32|Per una comparative political economy dell’impresa pubblica: alcuni contributi recenti (2013-2015)|Questo articolo discute recenti contributi e propone alcuni temi di ricerca per una ‘comparative political economy’ dell’impresa pubblica. Si argomenta l’opportunità di mettere al centro dell’indagine la relazione fra politiche e organizzazioni, andando oltre il tradizionale confronto di performance fra controllo pubblico e privato. In questa prospettiva, si segnalano contributi sulla fase formativa dell’intervento pubblico nell’economia di sei grandi potenze con un metodo di analisi storica comparata; sull’evoluzione dell’impresa pubblica nelle economie emergenti, particolarmente in America Latina; sulla ‘societarizzazione’ delle imprese pubbliche nel Sud del mondo; sulla rivalutazione della missione di imprese pubbliche locali e nazionali in economie sviluppate. In questa ottica si sostiene che la storia della liquidazione dell’ IRI, il maggiore gruppo industriale italiano andrebbe considerata come parte della crisi di un assetto politico-economico e non prevalentemente come una operazione finanziaria. L’articolo è concluso da considerazioni sull’agenda di ricerca futura.
L32|Major public enterprises in Switzerland|There are six major public enterprises that provide universal services on the Swiss federal level: Swisscom, Swiss Post, Swiss Federal Railways, Swissgrid, Skyguide, and RUAG. Except for Swissgrid, their governance is very much alike: the state as policymaker defines the framework conditions such as market and enterprise laws and universal service obligations; as owner the state sets strategic objectives, and as regulator it monitors universal service provision and effective competition. In this article, the governance, the strategy, the universal service obligation and the performance of each enterprise are described in detail. Additionally, the authors report on the public discourses about the public enterprises. They conclude that the public enterprises perform on a high level and formulate possible explanations for this finding.
L32|"State-owned private equity funds investing in ""national champions"": The case of Italy"|"Despite the recent upsurge of scientific work on the Sovereign Wealth Funds’ (SWFs) phenomenon, little is known on the role played in a country’s economy by a subcategory of SWFs: Strategic Funds (""SFs""). As an explicit form of governmental intervention in the economic system associated with a new model of State capitalism, SFs acquire strategic (equity) stakes in enterprises of national interest with the purpose of enhancing the home country’s growth and competitiveness. The aim of this article is to investigate the rationale, public policy objectives and investment strategies pursued by SFs, thus contributing to the SWF literature in three ways. First, we provide a definition of State-Owned Private Equity (SOPE) as referred to the activity of SFs and develop a conceptual framework to strategically position them within the PE industry. Second, we conduct a peer analysis of SFs operated by European national governments on the basis of which we propose a taxonomy of such PE entities classified into competitive and defensive ones. Third, we discuss how a SF can contribute to enhancing the competitiveness of the home country through amelioration of its macroeconomic fundamentals (e.g., value added, employment) associated with the adequate management of portfolio companies. To do so, we illustrate the case study of the SF operated by the Italian government, named as Fondo Strategico Italiano (FSI)."

L32|Bank ownership, board characteristics and performance: Evidence from commercial banks in India|The role of governance mechanisms in determining bank outcomes has been studied mostly in the context of developed economies and focused mainly on private banks. In this paper we examine the importance of board size and board composition in determining bank outcomes using data from an emerging economy, India, and using a sample that includes both public and private banks. Relatedly, we also examine the effect of CEO tenure in influencing bank outcomes, a topic that acquires particular importance in context of public sector banks where the tenure of the CEO is relatively short. Using data that spans over ten years from 2003-2012 that witnessed a large number of governance reforms in India, the results of our empirical analysis suggest that while board size plays an insignificant role in determining bank outcomes, board independence plays a significant role. There is a strong ownership effect with board independence having a significant effect on performance of private sector banks and negatively impacting the performance of private sector banks. The analysis also reveals that longer tenure of the CEO has significant effects in improving bank outcomes both in terms of financial performance and asset quality. These positive effects strengthen in the later years of CEO tenure. Our results have governance implications for strengthening the composition of board of directors and CEO tenure, especially in publicly owned banks.
L32|The effects of privatization on exports and jobs|The privatization of state-owned enterprises (SOE) in transition economies has often been found to improve employment and productivity of privatized SOEs, despite policymakers’ fears regarding possible job cuts. This positive effect can be enhanced if privatization also promotes firms’ exports. A recent firm-level analysis of China reveals that privatization has indeed a positive effect on export propensity, employment, and productivity in both the short and long term. The effect mostly stems from changes in firms’ attitudes about profits and risks due to competitive pressure.

The article analyses the opinion of the Brasov city citizens, in the framework of a marketing research performed in 2015, as regards the possibility that legal instruments should influence a socially responsible behavior for public or private business operators. The aspects analysed for business operators in Romania can represent a model for other European Union states as well.
L32|Environmental Regulation in a Mixed Economy|Abstract Many developing countries are mixed economies in which public and private firms engage in Cournot competition. We show that some fundamental results in environmental economics fail to hold in these economies: more stringent environmental regulation does not necessarily reduce pollution levels, the equivalence between environmental taxes and standards breaks down, and not every emission level can be induced by emission taxes. These results are due to the endogeneity of the public firm CEO’s career choices. Instruments that can induce the CEO to choose a public career are most effective in reducing emissions and improving social welfare.
L32|State ownership and corruption|Abstract We test two interesting results that can be obtained from a simplified version of the theoretical model of Shleifer and Vishny (Q J Econ 109(4):995–1025, 1994) that studies bargaining between politicians and managers of state-owned firms. The model suggests that firms with more state ownership tend to pay less in bribes but not have a different experience of costly obstacles imposed on them by politicians. In our full sample, the results suggest that a one percentage increase in state ownership is associated with a $125 reduction in the total annual informal payment of the firm and with a 0.5 % decrease in the probability that a firm will consider corruption to be an obstacle to their current operations. We refine these average relationships by splitting the sample by global region. Only in our Europe and Central Asia sample do we find strong evidence in support of the first result and again we find a significant effect of state ownership on obstacles.
L32|Nationalization as Credible Threat Against Collusion|Within a simple model of differentiated oligopoly, we show that tacit collusion may be prevented by the threat of nationalising a private firm coupled with the appropriate choice of the weight given to private profits in the maximand of the nationalised company. This happens because the threat of nationalization eliminates the prisoners’ dilemma usually associated with a Cournot game among profit-seekers. We characterise the properties of such a threat and prove that it may allow the policy maker to credibly deter collusion. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016

L32|At the frontiers of scientific advancement: the factors that influence scientists to become or choose to become publicly funded principal investigators|Abstract This paper aims to unearth the factors that influence scientists in becoming and choosing to become publicly funded principal investigators (PIs). PIs are the linchpins of knowledge transformation and bridging triple helix actors, particularly academia-industry. At a micro level, PIs are at the nexus of engaging and interacting with other triple helix actors. No study to date has specifically focused on the factors that influence scientists to become or choose to become publicly funded PIs. For scientists taking on the role of a PI represents an important landmark in their research career. Set in an Irish research system we found two main categories of influencing factors—push and pull. Pull factors are where the PI has more choice in choosing to become a PI, where as push factors is where the PI has less choice in choosing to become a PI. Pull factors we identified were control, career ambition and advancement, personal drive and ambition. Pull factors we identified were project dependencies and institutional pressures.
L32|Regulatory design and technical efficiency: public transport in France|Abstract The provision of local public transport in France involves private and public firms and the use of incentive contracts to regulate them. We study the effect of these institutional features on the sector’s efficiency using a long panel data of firms, with a two-stage estimation procedure. First, we use nonparametric data envelopment analysis techniques to estimate input usage efficiency, following a conditional approach that controls for differences in the environments in which the firms operate. Second, we estimate semiparametric censored regressions, using fixed effects to control for unobserved sources of heterogeneity. Our results point to a differential effect of private and mixed public-private companies. In particular, having the performance of public operators as the benchmark, efficiency is relatively higher for private firms, but lower when the service is delegated to a mixed public-private firm. In the latter case, the effects diverge by contract type: when the contract is of the cost reimbursement type, performance is lower than the public firm benchmark, while for other contract types, there are no statistically significant differences.

L32|The Economics of Infrastructure Provisioning: The Changing Role of the State|Infrastructures—tangible, intangible, and institutional public facilities, from bridges to health care—are a vital precondition for economic and societal wellbeing. There has been an increasing awareness that we cannot rely on market forces for infrastructure investment and maintenance. In this volume, experts from Europe, North and South America, and Asia examine the complexities of financing, installing, implementing, and regulating public infrastructures. Their contributions span a range of methodological approaches, including historical and empirical research, analytical models, theoretical analysis, and sector and regional case studies; they consider the economics of infrastructure provisioning by government, through private-public partnerships, and privatization arrangements. The book first treats general investment, growth, and policy issues, and then offers sector-specific analyses of transportation, energy, telecommunications, and water infrastructures. The chapters cover topics that include the evolution of historical infrastructure; the relationships between the state and private finance in funding and financing infrastructure; and the relevance of infrastructure for economic growth.

Therefore, it requires a sustained effort to overcome these gaps and realistic development strategies of the SME sector in Romania and Moldova, proposed by the specialized agencies of the two countries. Following a process of critical analysis and interpretation of national and international databases, we investigated the small and medium enterprises sector in Romania and Moldova in order to identify solutions to support the SME sector in the two countries
L32|UIDAI's Public Policy Innovations|The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) was mandated to issue unique identification numbers to every resident of India. The Authority has largely accomplished this mandate in a short time and within budget because it took many innovative and bold decisions. The first innovative decision we consider, in this paper, is the UIDAI's decision to add iris images to the set of biometrics collected by it. Another innovation of the UIDAI was its practice of conducting on-field trials. The last innovation we consider relates to how the UIDAI promoted competition and standardisation. The success of the UIDAI offers lessons for other government projects. Government processes need not prevent it from taking innovative decisions. High-quality procurement and project management skills can help the government outsource many functions that are currently housed within it. Testing major hypotheses through field trials before launching projects at scale can help ensure best use of public resources.

L32|Concerns Related to the Internationalisation of State-Owned Enterprises: Perspectives from regulators, government owners and the broader business community|The rise in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as growing actors in international trade and investment has received renewed attention in recent years, not least due to controversy that has arisen over SOE foreign investments. This has raised the profile of these issues with policy makers and tilted much of the public debate in one direction. Some concerns revolve around the intentions of these companies, or any potential competitive distortions that could be caused by them which would differentiate them from privately-owned enterprises operating under like circumstances. With a view to keeping the trade and investment environment open, this paper draws attention to particular perceptions of concerns or challenges that arise when SOEs internationalise. Although perceptions are not verifiable facts, they reveal important trends that may inform the debate and shape future government policies towards foreign trade and investment by SOEs. The information in the report is primarily drawn from findings emerging from a three-part perception-based OECD survey addressed to public officials responsible for enterprise ownership, competition enforcement, investment regulation and trade policy in addition to departments of government with broader responsibility for the enterprise and competition landscape, and/or cross-border trade and investment regulation.
L32|Do generic strategies impact performance in higher educational institutions? A SEM-based investigation|This study set out to initiate an investigation into the linkage between generic strategy and performance in higher educational institutions and the moderating effect of institution-type. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), it examined the responses of a stratified sample of academics and administrative staff (n= 333) randomly selected from eight universities in northern Cyprus. Findings suggest that while there is a weak effect of differentiation strategy on performance, a strong effect was recorded for focus strategy on performance. However, no significant relationship was found between cost leadership strategy and performance in higher educational institutions. Findings further indicated that respondents from public-private universities perceived the strongest generic strategy-performance effect for their institution, followed by those from the public sector. Respondents from private institutions perceived the weakest strategy-performance effect for their institutions.
L32|Contract-farming in Staple Food Chains: The Case of Rice in Benin|In this paper, we analyze the impact of smallholder participation in a contract-farming scheme in the rice sector in Benin. We use data from a cross-sectional farm-household survey and different propensity score matching estimations to reveal how participation in a contract-farming scheme affects smallholder rice production. We find that contract-farming results in expansion of the rice area, intensification of rice production, increased commercialization of rice, and higher farm-gate prices, and ultimately contributes to rice output growth and increased income. Our findings imply that contract-farming can contribute to upgrading the rice supply chain and the development of the rice sector in Benin. Promoting and supporting the spread of contract-farming schemes in the sector might be an effective way to contribute to reaching the government goals of expanding rice production to become self-sufficient and improving rice quality to compete with imported rice. While there is a large empirical literature on contract-farming in high-value and commodity export sectors, studies on contract-farming in staple food sectors are very scarce. Our results document that contract-farming for staple food crops can be sustainable and benefit smallholder farmers; which is against theoretical expectations that contracting for staple food crops is not feasible because of contract-enforcement problems that stem from a low value of produce, low storage and transport costs, and a larger number of buyers in the chain. Our study contributes to understanding the role that contract-farming might play in the much needed upgrading of domestic and staple food crop sectors in developing countries.
L32|A Normative Analysis of Local Public Utilities: Investments in Water Networks|We analyze rehabilitation investments in a regulated water industry with perfectly inelastic demand. We compare alternative organizational solutions for local provision (municipalization, corporatization and privatization), though subject to a common regulatory mechanism. We can then assess the effects of incentive regulation in public firms and find that even benvolent politicians always stick to the price-cap, in order to save on distortionary taxation. However, incentives to invest result to be excessive only in private firms, as the cost of capital is accounted differently by public and private undertakings. We also provide a theory of mixed firms, based on strategic interaction between politicians and managers, which contributes to endogenously explain partial privatization and minority participation by private stockholders. In this last case incentives to invest appear to be driven just by governance and ownership reasons.
L32|Hospital Competition with Soft Budgets|" type=""main""> We study the incentives for quality provision and cost efficiency for hospitals with soft budgets, where the payer can cover deficits or confiscate surpluses. While a higher bailout probability reduces cost efficiency, the effect on quality is ambiguous. Profit confiscation reduces both quality and cost efficiency. First-best is achieved by a strict no-bailout and no-profit-confiscation policy when the regulated price is optimally set. However, for suboptimal prices, a more lenient bailout policy can be welfare-improving. When we allow for heterogeneity in costs and qualities, we also show that a softer budget can raise quality for high-cost patients."
L32|Business Models and Institutional Complexity: Understanding Value Creation in Healthcare Sector Public-Private Partnerships|Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), as novel hybrid organizations, combine different institutional logics to generate innovative solutions to complex problems. Their growth and survival depends largely on the creation of value for stakeholders and society. Using data from a comparative case study of two PPPs in the healthcare sector, we focus on the fact that the business model design is a means through which the successful or unsuccessful management of institutional complexity can occur inside hybrid organizations, with a subsequent generation or destruction of value. We are able to link the literature on institutional complexity and hybrid organizations with the one on business models, by looking at the organizational mechanisms and processes that are implemented in the definition of partnership governance, content and structure. We provide a process model of the way the business model design can help to bridge different logics and finally create value for stakeholders.
L32|Reforming an Institutional Culture of Corruption: A Model of Motivated Agents and Collective Reputation|Recent research has highlighted social image and identity concerns as factors that influence economic decisions. Given that an individual’s choice of employment may be important for their social image, we consider a model of worker sorting into the mission-oriented or private sector with motivated agents who also value the collective reputation of their place of employment. The initial insight of the analysis is that, from the institution’s perspective, there may exist both a high-reputation, low-wage equilibrium and a low-reputation, high-wage equilibrium, which raises the question of how an institution can transition between equilibria. Our main contribution is to characterize a dynamic wage path that will transition from a low-reputation to a high-reputation steady state: Importantly, the effect of wages on motivation depend on the initial reputation - starting from low-reputation, higher wages crowd in motivation, while starting from high-reputation, higher wages crowd out motivation. Therefore, a non-monotonic wage path is required to achieve a transition to the low-wage, high-reputation equilibrium - an initial wage increase to crowd in motivated workers, followed by a wage decrease to crowd out non-motivated workers. These results provide a novel explanation for empirical findings in developing nations that - in direct contrast to evidence from developed nations - public sector workers are less prosocial and higher wages weakly increase motivation. Lastly, we discuss the implication of our results for policy measures aimed at reforming an institutional culture of corruption.

L32|The Economics of Television and Online Video Markets|Television is the dominant entertainment medium for hundreds of millions. This chapter surveys the economic forces that determine the production and consumption of this content. It presents recent trends in television and online video markets, both in the US and internationally, and describes the state of theoretical and empirical research on these industries. A number of distinct themes emerge, including the growing importance of the pay-television sector, the role played by content providers (channels), distributors, and negotiations between them in determining market outcomes, and concerns about the effects of market power throughout this vertical structure. It also covers important but unsettled topics including the purpose for and effects of both the old (Public Service Broadcasters) and the new (online video markets). Open theoretical and empirical research questions are highlighted throughout.
L32|State-Owned Banks: Acquirers in M&A deals|Between 2003 and 2013, according to Zephyr (BvD) data, 22% of M&A deals between banks have involved state-owned banks, either as targets (12%) or as acquirers (10%). The behavior of state-owned banks in the market control is, however, underresearched.The standard Inefficient Management Hypothesis suggests that more efficient managerial teams target less performing firms. The IMH, however, has never been tested for deals involving state-owned banks, nor the pre-deal operating characteristics of state-owned banks involved as acquirers in M&A deals. We build up a unique dataset of 3,682 deals between banks that allows us to classify M&As into four categories, depending on the ownership of the acquirer and the target: 1) public re-organization (deals between two state-owned banks), 2) publicization (a stateowned bank acquiring a private bank), 3) privatization and 4) private re-organization (deals between two private banks). Our findings confirms for the first time the IMH also for state-owned banks. We also find that state-owned banks active as acquirers in the market for corporate control have a better pre-deal performance compared to the private benchmark; this evidence is stronger for development banks.
L32|Major Public Enterprises in Turkey: 2005-2013|This paper presents an analysis of the roles and performances of the major public enterprises (MPEs) from the energy, transportation, communication and construction sectors in Turkey between 2005 and 2013. The recent governmental policy towards the PEs presents differences based on sectors. The state is intentionally quitting agriculture, service and non-strategic manufacturing businesses, passing production to private sector. On the other hand, energy, transportation, communication and construction sectors are of great importance to the state: MPEs in these sectors are growing and among the biggest corporations in Turkey. This paper analyzes all PEs in these critical sectors, especially pays more attention to energy sector PEs due to sector’s rising importance over the economic development. The sectors to be quitted by the state are kept out of this study. There are common reasons assigning importance to energy, transportation, telecommunication, and energy sector MPEs. First, volatility in energy prices makes energy and transportation MPEs highly risky. Since energy sector is highly strategic and MPEs are exposed to exchange rate risk, there are problems in privatizing activities. Transportation and communication sectors are other important ones for the government, mostly because of strategic reasons: railways, airlines, coastal security services, broadcasting, governmental news agency, posting, satellite communications and cable TV systems, state TV and radio are operated by MPEs. The fraction of these MPEs contribution in GDP is increasing in the last years. Lastly, construction is a very special sector for Turkey: high growth rates are caught up by the growth in construction sector. Therefore, it is a strategic sector and government supports PEs in order to both expand the sector and also to provide lowbudget housing for lower income groups.
L32|Executive Board and Supervisory Board Members in Germany’s Large Corporations Remain Predominantly Male|The executive boards of large corporations in Germany continue to be in men’s hands: at the close of 2014, a good five percent of executive board members at the top 200 companies in Germany were women. This is equivalent to an increase of one percentage point over 2013, which is evidence of the rather sluggish development in this area. DAX 30 companies recorded the largest proportion of female board members at a good seven percent, while the lowest share was recorded for MDAX companies (less than three percent). The representation of women on supervisory boards was better: at the end of 2014, a good 18 percent of board members were women in the top 200 companies; DAX 30 companies displayed above-average results for female board members at just below 25 percent. At a little under 14 percent, SDAX companies displayed not only the lowest percentage of women, but also the lowest increase over 2013 (0.6 percentage points). Both on executive and supervisory boards, female chairpersons remain the exception. Following the law passed by the federal government cabinet last year on equality for women and men in managerial positions, both at private companies and in the civil service, female representation, at least on supervisory boards, is likely to improve. The gender quota introduced in this legislation will come into effect on January 1, 2016. Companies with government-owned shares will also be affected by the quota regulation. Here, female representation on the supervisory boards and executive boards at the end of 2014 was just under 24 and just under 15 percent, respectively.
L32|Financial Sector: Share of Women in Top Decision-Making Bodies Remains Low|At the end of 2014, women were no better represented on the top decision-making bodies of enterprises in the financial sector than the previous year. The share of women on the executive boards of the 100 largest banks and savings banks remained at an average of almost seven percent and on the executive boards of the 60 largest insurance companies at 8.5 percent. On supervisory boards, change was slow at best: Although the share of women in financial institutions was almost 18 percent and a good 17 percent among insurance companies, only decimal point increases could be observed. In public sector banks and savings banks, however, female representation on supervisory boards was greater than in the previous year: at almost 19 percent, the financial institutions in this sector are roughly on a par with private banks (a good 18 percent). Overall, the majority of women on supervisory boards are still employee representatives but shareholders have appointed considerably more women to supervisory boards in recent years. At European level, relatively few women were represented on the Council of the European Central Bank and on decision-making bodies of the national central banks, although there are significant differences across countries. Planned legislation on the equal participation of women and men in leadership positions in the private and public sectors aims to increase the proportion of women on supervisory boards of listed companies subject to codetermination regulations in Germany. The persistence of current structures could be greater in the financial sector than in the top 200 companies: Even though over half of financial sector employees are women, the share of women on the supervisory boards of financial institutions increased on average by less than 0.4 percentage points per year in the period 2006 to 2014, compared to 1.3 percentage points in the top 200 companies.

Die Vorstände großer Unternehmen in Deutschland befinden sich nach wie vor fest in Männerhand: Ende 2014 lag der Frauenanteil in den Vorständen der Top-200-Unternehmen in Deutschland bei gut fünf Prozent. Das entspricht einem Plus von einem Prozentpunkt gegenüber dem Vorjahr und damit einer sehr geringen Dynamik. Die DAX-30-Unternehmen konnten mit gut sieben Prozent den höchsten Frauenanteil verzeichnen, am geringsten war er mit noch nicht einmal drei Prozent bei den MDAX-Unternehmen. Häufiger sind Frauen in den Aufsichtsräten vertreten: In den Top-200-Unternehmen waren Ende des Jahres 2014 gut 18 Prozent Frauen; die DAX-30-Unternehmen schnitten mit einem Frauenanteil von knapp 25 Prozent überdurchschnittlich ab. Die SDAX-Unternehmen wiesen mit knapp 14 Prozent nicht nur den kleinsten Frauenanteil auf, sondern mit 0,6 Prozentpunkten auch den geringsten Zuwachs gegenüber dem Vorjahr. Wie in den Vorständen haben Frauen auch in Aufsichtsräten nur in Ausnahmefällen den Vorsitz inne. Mit dem vom Bundeskabinett im vergangenen Jahr verabschiedeten Gesetz für die gleichberechtigte Teilhabe von Frauen und Männern an Führungspositionen in der Privatwirtschaft und im öffentlichen Dienst dürfte sich die Besetzung zumindest von Aufsichtsratsposten durch Frauen beschleunigen. Die Quotenregelung soll ab 1. Januar 2016 gelten. Vom Gesetz betroffen wären auch Unternehmen mit Bundesbeteiligung. Hier lag der Frauenanteil im Aufsichtsrat Ende 2014 bei knapp 24 Prozent und in den Vorständen bei knapp 15 Prozent.
L32|Finanzsektor: Frauenanteile in Spitzengremien bleiben gering|At the end of 2014, women were no better represented on the top decision-making bodies of enterprises in the financial sector than the previous year.

In den Spitzengremien von Unternehmen des Finanzsektors waren Frauen Ende des Jahres 2014 kaum häufiger vertreten als ein Jahr zuvor. In den Vorständen der 100 größten Banken und Sparkassen verharrte der Frauenanteil bei durchschnittlich knapp sieben Prozent und in den Vorständen der 60 größten Versicherungen bei 8,5 Prozent. In den Aufsichtsräten verlief die Entwicklung bestenfalls schleppend: Der Frauenanteil betrug 18 Prozent bei den Geldinstituten und gut 17 Prozent bei den Versicherungen – die Zuwächse gegenüber dem Vorjahr lagen lediglich im Nachkommabereich. In den öffentlich-rechtlichen Banken und Sparkassen waren Frauen indes häufiger in den Aufsichtsgremien vertreten als im Jahr zuvor: Mit einem Frauenanteil von knapp 19 Prozent liegen die Geldinstitute dieses Bereichs ungefähr gleichauf mit den privaten Banken (gut 18 Prozent). Insgesamt stellen die Arbeitnehmervertreterinnen nach wie vor die Mehrheit der Aufsichtsrätinnen, allerdings hat die Kapitalseite in den vergangenen Jahren deutlich aufgeholt. Auf europäischer Ebene waren im Rat der Europäischen Zentralbank und in den Entscheidungsgremien der nationalen Zentralbanken ebenfalls vergleichsweise wenige Frauen vertreten, wobei es im Ländervergleich deutliche Unterschiede gibt. Das geplante „Gesetz für die gleichberechtigte Teilhabe von Frauen und Männern an Führungspositionen in der Privatwirtschaft und im öffentlichen Dienst“ soll die Frauenanteile insbesondere in den Aufsichtsräten börsennotierter und mitbestimmungspflichtiger Unternehmen in Deutschland erhöhen. Die Hartnäckigkeit der Strukturen könnte im Finanzsektor noch größer sein als etwa in den Top-200- Unternehmen: Obwohl mehr als die Hälfte der Beschäftigten im Finanzsektor Frauen sind, nahm der Anteil der Aufsichtsrätinnen in den Banken zwischen 2006 und 2014 jahresdurchschnittlich um weniger als 0,4 Prozentpunkte zu - gegenüber 1,3 Prozentpunkten in den Top-200-Unternehmen.
L32|Total factor productivity analysis of the UK airport industry: A Hicks-Moorsteen index method|This study examines the total factor productivity (TFP) change of the UK airport industry from 2001 to 2009 using a Hicks-Moorsteen index method. The results show that the industry experienced an average annual growth in TFP of 0.32 per cent with efficiency change being the main contributor to the TFP growth. We find that private UK airports enjoy slightly higher TFP growth than those in public or mixed ownership. Regulation and airport size are found to have statistically significant effects on the airport productivity level.
L32|An analysis of policy harmonization on privatization and trade liberalization|This paper investigates optimal privatization and trade policies in an international mixed oligopoly model. When both policies are available, the optimal policy combination is partial privatization and a positive tariff. Moreover, if one of the two policies is not available, the optimal trade liberalization and optimal privatization would be equivalent in welfare as long as the demand is linear. Implementing privatization and/or trade policies obtains the win–win situation for two countries. Besides, the effect of full privatization on welfare is ambiguous and depends crucially on the difference between firms' marginal cost. Lastly, by adopting a low degree of privatization block trade may increase domestic welfare.
L32|Neutralising the Advantages of State-Owned Enterprises for a Fair Playing Field|Despite Vietnamese competition authorities’ attempts to control state monopolies in domestic markets during the last 10 year of establishment, this appears to be the key challenge of Vietnamese competition regime. In the process of transitioning from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, the State-owned enterprises (SOEs) sector is perceived as a means to ensure the socialist orientation of the economy as well as preserve national economic goals. For these purposes, SOEs have been offered several advantages ranging from tangible incentives to latent conveniences over the privately owned enterprises. In this context, competition laws and policies should be able to neutralise the advantages of SOEs to level the playing field or else it would be used a shield to protect SOEs from their private rivals. This paper looks into the issues with the SOE sector in the context of Viet Nam’s political economy and identifies the factors inhibiting the country’s effort to control State monopolies in the last 10 years of competition law enforcement. It provides commentaries on the implementation of competition laws and policies in Viet Nam from the perspective of economic integration, particularly the on-going negotiation Trans-Pacific Partnership.
L32|La Responsabilidad Social Empresarial Como Herramienta Para El Desarrollo Local|La responsabilidad social empresarial integrada a la gestiÃ³n de la calidad se vuelve una importante herramienta para potenciar el desarrollo local, en consecuencia una empresa responsable es la conjunciÃ³n de hacer operaciones empresariales responsables y acciones de responsabilidad social. Este enfoque de responsabilidad social empresarial deja a un lado la acciÃ³n voluntaria y de Ã³bolo con que se ha caracterizado, para volverse hechos de corresponsabilidad de las organizaciones pÃºblicas y privadas con fines de lucro o sin ello, para con la sociedad en su crecimiento y desarrollo transustancial. No se concibe el desarrollo local como una cuestiÃ³n aislada del Ã¡mbito social, tambiÃ©n por su dinÃ¡mica estÃ¡n los Ã³rganos polÃ­ticos administrativos, las fuerzas productivas de la regiÃ³n y otros entes o variables, en este sentido lo refiere estudios hechos por la ComisiÃ³n EconÃ³mica para AmÃ©rica Latina y el Caribe (CEPAL) y el Programa de la Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD). Este entramado de relaciones de producciÃ³n, de consumo, culturales, entre otras, hace que la gestiÃ³n directiva de las organizaciones adquiera relevancia en el sentido que, estas organizaciones pueden provocar y/o potenciar enlaces en el conglomerado social, con especial interÃ©s, la gestiÃ³n de la calidad es una prÃ¡ctica gerencial que promueve las asociaciones entre el entorno empresarial, con el objeto de producir un cambio estructural en las formas de producciÃ³n y convivencia social. Uno de los aspectos de un sistema de gestiÃ³n de la calidad debe ser el vÃ­nculo expedito de la empresa con las comunidades, al respecto, la responsabilidad social empresarial desde este enfoque es el vaso comunicante de la empresa con las comunidades, pero las acciones que acometa la empresa deben estar alineadas a los planes de desarrollo segÃºn sea el Ã¡mbito de actuaciÃ³n, por lo tanto se vuelve importante hacer una valoraciÃ³n del contexto en el cual se desenvuelve la empresa. Los gurÃºs de la calidad en su momento seÃ±alaron aspectos que hoy estÃ¡n contenido en la responsabilidad social empresarial como: la existencia de valores y comportamiento Ã©tico, satisfacciÃ³n del cliente y compromiso con los trabajadores para el Ã©xito de la organizaciÃ³n, de la misma manera, la evoluciÃ³n en el concepto de calidad y los distintos sistemas de gestiÃ³n, han venido incorporando aspectos que aparecen como fundamentales en la responsabilidad social empresarial. La valoraciÃ³n teÃ³rica realizada, indica que la filosofÃ­a de la calidad contiene elementos que pueden ayudar a desarrollar aspectos de la responsabilidad social empresarial, asÃ­ como hay elementos que se solapan entre ambos, las operaciones responsables de la empresa estÃ¡n contenidas en el marco filosÃ³fico de la gestiÃ³n de la calidad desde la perspectiva interna y, hay elementos de las acciones de responsabilidad social en la empresa que son compatibles y/o pueden ser elevadas por medio de la gestiÃ³n de la calidad desde su perspectiva externa. En el mismo sentido, las acciones de responsabilidad social empresarial alineadas con los planes de desarrollo local tienden a potenciarse con un modelo de gestiÃ³n de la calidad. Desde las concepciones esgrimidas y adoptadas en los temas responsabilidad social empresarial, gestiÃ³n de la calidad y, desarrollo local, la planeaciÃ³n estratÃ©gica de la gestiÃ³n de la calidad con acciones de responsabilidad social alineadas a los planes de desarrollo de una localidad, se pueden configurar estas variables desde un modelo de gestiÃ³n de la calidad para la empresa venezolana.

L32|Issues of RF State Treasury Property Management in Russia in 2014|Due to the radical character of market transformations that took place in the Russian economy in the 1990s, including reform of the ownership relations oriented to prompt privatization, for a long time there was no interest in the issues of public property management in Russia. Some progress in that sphere occurred after the crisis period of 1997–1998, when a certain shift in the government property policy priorities could be seen. The onset of a new phase in the ownership relations reform in Russia was triggered by the approval, by Decree of the RF Government No 1024 of 9 September 1999, of the Concept of State Property Management and Privatization in the Russian Federation (hereinafter – Concept). It was probably a symbolic event, in that for the first time since 1992 the issues of state property management were given priority over formal alterations to ownership forms.
L32|Governance of Non-Profit and Non-Governmental Organizations - Within- and Between- Organization Analyses: An Introduction|Despite the fact that nonprofit organizations play a large role in the production and distribution of goods and services in modern economies, and the rising role of non-governmental organizations in carrying out projects in developing countries, our knowledge of their governance, and of its’ implications for their behavior and performance, is limited. This special issue tries to uncover some of the mechanisms and institutions that characterize the governance of non-profits and NGOs, as well as its implications. In particular, the papers focus on: (i) the determinants of NGO governance and its implications for reducing poverty in developing countries, (ii) the governance of non-profit organizations, (iii) the impact of governance characteristics on the performance of non-profit organizations, and (iv) the effect of non-profit governance on the interaction between the non-profit and for-profit sectors.

The approach of this research was non-experimental research designed to diagnose the bibliographic heap of a public university library. We used a non-probabilistic sample of educational programs. The sample is composed by 19 of the 33 educational programs. Content was analyzed as the basis for their bibliographical analysis. The main results indicate that only 66.30% of the titles suggested by the evaluator of quality and efficiency of the curriculum are located at the library. This information will serve to enhance the development of the bibliography of the university library
L32|The public choice of university organization: a stylized story of a constitutional reform|The essay presents and explains a highly stylized story of the reactions of the structure of a university to a constitutional reform—in the university law—that radically changed the power structure from a bottom-up representative system to a top-down hierarchical system practically without checks and balances. It was meant as a more business-like system to increasing effectiveness. However, the result has been precisely the reverse. Both the (relative) size and the salaries of the bureaucracy have increased, while its effectiveness has fallen. The bureaucracy has grown particularly fast in the special service bureaus outside the normal structure and in the PR-department. It is shown that these outcomes correspond to the predictions of public choice theory, notably that of Niskanen’s theory of bureaucracy. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
L32|Competition and privatization policies revisited: the payoff interdependence approach|We investigate the relationship between competition and privatization policies. Existing studies measure the strength of competition based on the number of firms, and show that the optimal degree of privatization is higher in more competitive markets. We introduce an interdependent payoff structure into a mixed oligopoly and revisit this problem. Here, we assume that firms consider their own and other firms’ profits. In the model, competition increases when firms are negatively affected by rivals’ profits. We find that under the assumption of quadratic production costs, which is popular in mixed oligopolies, the optimal degree of privatization is higher when there is less market competition. This finding contrasts with those of prior studies. However, this result may be reversed when we adopt alternative model formulation. Furthermore, in the constant marginal cost case, the optimal degree of privatization is always lower when there is less market competition, which is opposite to the result in the quadratic cost case. Our results suggest that the relationship between an optimal privatization policy and the strength of competition crucially depends on the market structure, including the cost conditions.

L32|Privatization in the presence of patent licensing|This paper analyzes the licensing policy for a cost-reduction technology of a foreign R&D institution when it is faced with a domestic monopoly manufacturer. It is found that, due to objective differences, a public domestic manufacturer will be charged higher than a private domestic manufacturer for a certain licensed technology. Accordingly, to save on the licensing payment made to the foreign R&D institution, the domestic government is recommended to (partly) privatize the public manufacturer.

L32|Biased Managers as Strategic Commitment in a Mixed Duopoly with Relative Profit-Maximizers|This study analyzes a mixed duopoly composed of a social welfare-maximizing public firm and a relative profit-maximizing private firm wherein the owners of both firms hire relative profit-maximizing managers biased with respect to the market size they face. In particular, we explore the quantity competition that gives a result different from that obtained in a standard mixed duopoly that differentiates between ownership and management, as considered by (Nakamura, Theor Econ Lett 4(3), 889–896, 2014a ), which follows the approach of (Englmaier, and Reisinger, Manag Decis Econ 35(5), 350–356, 2013 ). More precisely, when we introduce the degree of importance of each firm’s relative performance into quantity competition, we see that the owner of the private firm reverts to a less aggressive manager when the degree of importance is relatively high, which is similar to how the classical strategic managerial delegation works. Furthermore, we consider the influence of an increase in degree of importance of each firm’s relative performance on the aggressiveness of managers hired by both the public and private firm. Moreover, we explore the case in which the owner hires his manager with salary based on social welfare. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
L32|Measuring the performance of university technology transfer using meta data approach: the case of Dutch universities|The objective o this study is to empirically measure the performance of Dutch university’s technology transfer. Dutch universities are ranked high on research output but there is scarce evidence about the commercialization of research-based innovation. We present a novel approach to measure the performance of university technology transfer using meta data analysis. We use data on research output as meta-data to estimates the potential for technology transfer, and data about the actual technology transfer projects as measured by patents, license agreements and spin-offs. We tested our model for Dutch universities and validated it using data from private and state universities in the US. Our results suggest that most Dutch research universities have poor performance while technical Dutch universities and academic medical center perform well. We pilot-tested our model for selected US universities and the result confirm the validity of our approach. Our approach contributes to the literature on university technology transfer by adding a novel approach for measuring performance of university technology transfer while taking into account university research as the potential for technology transfer.

L32|From mixed economy to entangled political economy: a Paretian social-theoretic orientation|This paper compares and contrasts two visions of political economy. These visions aren’t antagonistic, just different. The mixed economy vision associated with Ludwig von Mises and Sanford Ikeda treats politics as intervening into markets. The entangled political economy vision treats politics and markets as overlapping subsystems within a society. Entangled political economy thus descends from a theory of society and social processes. Similarly to quantum entanglement where the state of a particle cannot be described independently of that of other particles, entanglement in political economy means that rational market action cannot be defined independently of rational political action. The focal point of entangled political economy, moreover, is on individual actors and their search for gain within different action environments. Interaction among individuals across those environments generates societal tectonics, thereby adding insights from Vilfredo Pareto about social theory to those of Mises and Ikeda about interventionism.

L32|On the efficiency of Bertrand and Cournot equilibrium in the presence of asymmetric network compatibility effects|Based on a differentiated duopoly model, we consider the efficiency of Bertrand and Cournot equilibrium in the presence of network effects and product compatibility. In particular, we demonstrate that if an asymmetric product compatibility with a strong network effect between the firms arises, give certain conditions, Cournot equilibrium is more efficient than Bertrand equilibrium in terms of greater consumer, producer, and social surplus.
L32|Necessarily welfare-improving privatization|This paper examines the welfare effect of privatization in a mixed oligopoly model where multiple oligopolistic industries compete for a common factor. We find that privatization necessarily improves welfare in a benchmark case with symmetric costs across all oligopolistic industries. Moreover, we show that a production subsidy necessarily reduces welfare regardless of the level of privatization.
L32|Mixed Oligopoly and Privatization in General Equilibrium|Making use of a general oligopolistic equilibrium model with private and public firms, this paper examines the welfare effects of privatization. We show that in an exogenous market structure privatizing the public firm necessarily reduces welfare, which contrasts with the existing result that some degree of privatization is optimal. In contrast, we find that privatization has no effect on welfare in an endogenous market structure with free entry of private firms.
L32|Államosítás, privatizáció és gazdaságpolitika - a főirány széttöredezése<BR>[Nationalization and privatization - in the shadow of changing paradigms of economic policy]|Az állami tulajdon kiterjedésének módosítása a gazdasági válságok kezelésének mindig fontos - de nem kizárólagos - eszköze volt az elmúlt évszázad európai és egyesült államokbeli történetében. Az utóbbi évek ebből a szempontból nem kivételesek. Csakhogy míg korábban vagy a közkézbe vétel, vagy az eladás irányzata volt meghatározó, a közelmúlt folyamatai furcsa együttmozgást mutatnak. A tanulmány a nagy léptékű államosítási és privatizációs hullámok alapvonásainak fényében elemzi az elmúlt évek új fejleményét, a változási irányok széttöredezését. Bemutatja azokat az indokokat, amelyek alapján az állami tulajdon kiterjesztése és szűkítése egyaránt alkalmasnak látszott a válság enyhítésére, szoros kapcsolatban más válságkezelő intézkedésekkel. Amellett érvel, hogy a köztulajdonra vonatkozó felfogás elbizonytalanodása részben a korábbi hullámok tapasztalataival és ennek nyomán a közvélekedés változásával függ össze, részben az elméleti és gazdaságpolitikai paradigma elbizonytalanodására vezethető vissza: most sem az államosítás, sem a privatizáció mögött nem áll egységes, határozott nézetrendszer.* Journal of Economics Literature (JEL) kód: H82, L32, P26.
L32|Public Enterprises in a Global Perspective in the Last Decade|The issue of public enterprises, especially those operating on an international scale, is gaining increasing attention. This paper evaluates the performance of contemporary public enterprises. We first identify public enterprises according the OECD approach, when the control of the public owner is greater than 50% (Christianen 2011, Kowalski et al. 2013), and we analyze about 1,000 listed companies (private and public) extracted from the Forbes Global 2000 - which lists the largest companies in the world - considering some performance indicators (ROS, ROA, ROE); size indicators, and their sector and country of origin. Next, we move to analyze the behavior of public and private enterprises which are active in the market for corporate control (mergers and acquisitions, M&As). In this second step, we adopt a more flexible definition of public enterprise, as we consider to be public every firm where the top shareholder is a public institution. According to Musacchio and Lazzarini (2014), this approach allows to take into account different types of contemporary public enterprises. By combining data and information reported by Orbis and Zephyr (BVD) we select only the M&As for which it is possible to determine the proprietary nature of the acquirer in the year before the deal, and where pre-deal economic data on firm performance are simultaneously available for both the acquirer and the acquired company. Our final sample is composed of 25,322 deals, of which 2,488 are performed by a public acquirer. Both the analysis of the performance of large companies on a global scale, and the analysis of M&A deals, confirm that public enterprises are currently active in the global market arena, and they show a comparable performance with private ones, and even higher in some specific sectors. The concerns about market distortions determined by contemporary public enterprises do not seem to be supported by the empirical evidence.
L32|State-Owned Banks: Acquirers in M&A deals|Between 2003 and 2013, according to Zephyr (BvD) data, 22% of M&A deals between banks have involved state-owned banks, either as targets (12%) or as acquirers (10%). The behavior of state-owned banks in the market control is, however, under-researched. The standard Inefficient Management Hypothesis suggests that more efficient managerial teams target less performing firms. The IMH, however, has never been tested for deals involving state-owned banks, nor the pre-deal operating characteristics of state-owned banks involved as acquirers in M&A deals. We build up a unique dataset of 3,682 deals between banks that allows us to classify M&As into four categories, depending on the ownership of the acquirer and the target: 1) public re-organization (deals between two state-owned banks), 2) publicization (a state-owned bank acquiring a private bank) 3) privatization and 4) private re-organization (deals between two private banks). Our findings confirms for the first time the IMH also for state-owned banks. We also find that state-owned banks active as acquirers in the market for corporate control have a better pre-deal performance compared to the private benchmark; this evidence is stronger for development banks.
L32|Major Public Enterprises in Turkey: 2005-2013|This paper presents an analysis of the roles and performances of the major public enterprises (MPEs) from energy, transportation, communication and construction sectors in Turkey between 2005 and 2013. The recent governmental policy towards the PEs presents differences based on sectors. The state is intentionally quitting agriculture, service and non- strategic manufacturing businesses, passing production to private sector. On the other hand, energy, transportation, communication and construction sectors are of great importance to the state: MPEs in these sectors are growing and among the biggest corporations in Turkey. This paper analyzes all PEs in these critical sectors, especially pays more attention to energy sector PEs due to sector’s rising importance over the economic development. The sectors to be quitted by the state are kept out of this study. There are common reasons assigning importance to energy, transportation, telecommunication, and energy sector MPEs. First, volatility in energy prices makes energy and transportation MPEs highly risky. Since energy sector is highly strategic and MPEs are exposed to exchange rate risk, there are problems in privatization activities. Transportation and communication sectors are other important ones for the government, mostly because of strategic reasons: Railways, airlines, coastal security services, and energy industry, broadcasting, governmental news agency, posting, satellite communications and cable TV systems, state TV and radio are operated by MPEs. The fraction of these MPEs contribution in GDP is increasing in the last years. Lastly, construction is a very special sector for Turkey: High growth rates are caught up by the growth in construction sector. Therefore, it is a strategic sector and government supports PEs in order to both expand the sector and also to provide low- budget housing for lower income groups.

L32|Improving the Business Climate in Russia|Economic growth is below what would be needed to resume rapid convergence to average OECD living standards. On-going efforts to improve the business climate are laudable, but need to be widened and strengthened. Much progress has been achieved in reducing red tape, but it is only recently that the authorities have visibly become more energetic in fighting corruption. Adverse interactions between politics, business and law enforcement generate obstacles for the rule of law and remain a major risk for potential investors. High entry barriers lead to weak competition. Reducing the role of the state in the economy and WTO membership should be viewed as opportunities to strengthen competition, and hence provide incentives for productivity improvements, which are urgently required to ensure stronger growth in Russia because of a shrinking labour force. This Working Paper relates to the 2013 OECD Economic Survey of the Russian Federation (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-russian-federation.htm). Améliorer le climat des affaires en Russie La croissance économique est inférieure à ce qui serait nécessaire pour assurer une convergence rapide du niveau de vie vers ceux observés en moyenne dans les pays de l'OCDE. Les efforts en cours pour améliorer le climat des affaires sont louables, mais ils doivent être élargis et renforcés. Beaucoup de progrès ont été accomplis dans la réduction des formalités administratives, mais ce n'est que récemment que les autorités sont visiblement devenues plus énergiques dans la lutte contre la corruption. Des interactions indésirables entre la politique, les affaires et l'application de la loi génèrent des obstacles pour l'État de droit et constituent un risque majeur pour les investisseurs potentiels. Des barrières élevées à l'entrée conduisent à une faible concurrence. Une réduction du rôle de l'État dans l'économie et l’adhésion de la Russie à l'OMC devraient être considérée comme une occasion de renforcer la concurrence et d’inciter à améliorer la productivité. Ces incitations sont urgemment nécessaires en Russie afin d’assurer une croissance plus forte dans un contexte de contraction de la main-d'oeuvre.

L32|Managing Operations Improvement In Romanian Public Services|This paper aims to develop a pleading for the transfer of best practices to improving the operational activity in the Romanian public institutions. The practice of implementation demonstrates that the perception of many executives in the Romanian private enterprises regarding the set of tools to improve processes and assimilation of lean philosophy is not a very favorable and encouraging one. It can be said that only some large enterprises had successfully introduced in their daily practice and organization the improvement principles, the operational optimization and the elimination of waste sources. In the SMEs, and especially in the services the experiences are isolated, but they have demonstrated the usefulness (the frequency of saving goals indicate, indeed, the need for proliferation of continuous improvement principles). Regarding the public organizations, the implementation of the new management system of designing and operating the current practices is pretty unknown, accepted at declarative level, but becomes, when is planned and implemented rather a burden on managers who should take on this challenge. Both in public management and private management, today the focus is on people and relationships (processes and projects), starting of course with the work organization. The good practices successfully proved in the private management in the recent decades are transferred today to public institutions; and the Romanian public organizations tend to adapt, also in terms of processes optimization. The study aims to analyze the functioning of the hypothetical management system of processes improvements, respectively the applying of lean tools and principles within the public Romanian institution. They are treated some dysfunctions observed within the process of understanding the utility aspects and throughout the assuming of operational improvement goals within these organizations. The qualitative observations, the critical interpretations and the opinions expressed are strictly the views of the author and may differ from those of representatives of any public institutions. The entire investigative approach converges to a cynical conclusion: the adaptation and the implementation of process improvements principles in the public entities could be in short terms an objective determined by external incentives and not a consciously assumed solution. Finally, we expose some of the ideas for deepening and expanding our practical findings and conclusions.
L32|Investments in Water Networks: A Normative Analysis of Local Public Utilities|We analyze rehabilitation investments in a regulated water industry with perfectly inelastic demand. We compare alternative organizational solutions for local provision (municipalization, corporatization and privatization), though subject to a common regulatory mechanism. We can then assess the effects of incentive regulation in public firms and find that even benvolent politicians always stick to the price-cap, in order to save on distortionary taxation. How- ever, incentives to invest result to be excessive only in private firms, as the cost of capital is accounted differently by public and private undertakings. We also provide a theory of mixed firms, based on strategic interaction be- tween politicians and managers, which contributes to endogenously explain partial privatization and minority participation by private stockholders. In this last case incentives to invest appear to be driven just by governance and ownership reasons.
L32|Socially optimal Nash equilibrium locations and privatization in a model of spatial duopoly with price discrimination|We generalize Beladi et al. (2014) for any non-negative, increasing, continuous function of distance as transportation costs function. By doing so, we show that in a duopoly, partial privatization does not change the socially optimal character of the Nash equilibrium location. Our results call for further research on testing their robustness under the existence of more than two competing firms.
L32|A Unified Model of Spatial Price Discrimination|We present a general model of mixed oligopoly, where competing firms exercise spatial price discrimination. Our findings indicate that the Nash equilibrium locations of firms are always socially optimal irrespective of the number of competitors, the level of privatization, the form of the transportation costs and the number and/or the varieties of the produced goods. An immediate implication of this result is that this form of competition is preferable from a welfare point of view.
L32|Does Privatization Increase Firm Performance in Nigeria?: An Empirical Investigation|This paper examined the validity of the efficacy of privatization by investigating not only whether privatization has improved financial (profitability) performance of firms but also whether such improvement has impact on the operational efficiency of privatized firms for the period 1990-2001 in Nigeria. Using a panel data for a sample of 20 privatized firms obtained from the Nigerian Stock Exchange and Securities and Exchange Commission, the result showed an increase in all the profitability ratios after privatization. However, only the return on assets and return on sales were significant in explaining the difference between pre- and post-privatization performance of firms in Nigeria. The result of the operational efficiency showed a significant increase in the mean (median) values of sale efficiency and income efficiency. Interestingly, while output (real sales) and employee income of firms significantly increased after privatization, the number of employees decreased insignificantly after privatization. The paper concluded that privatization in Nigeria has worked in the sense that it improves the financial and operational efficiency performance of firms.
L32|Impact of Public-Private-Partnership Programmes on Students’ Learning Outcomes: Evidence from a Quasi-Experiment|Learning outcomes refer to the performance of the students in academic tests pertaining to the respective grade level. In Pakistan, survey evidences from Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) show a significant dispersion in learning outcomes of public schools as compared with private sector counterpart. The perceived results of learning outcomes in private schools very clear but less evidence is found for educational outcome of schools run under public-private partnership programs. This becomes especially relevant when status of curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular activities is compared between public school, private schools, and schools run under public private partnership. In recent literature, it is found that schools taken up by public-private partnership have been providing a better learning environment—Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Development, Administrative changes, Academic Innovation and Planning, Teacher Reform and Student Affairs—is perceived to have a positive impact on learning outcomes. It is to investigate and document that the investments in these areas are justifiable. To promote this fact, we conduct a quasi-experiment to examine the profiles of students in a public-private partnership school at Karachi (running under Zindagi Trust program) and a public school (as counterfactual) in the same neighbourhood. We also recorded the household and socioeconomic characteristics to create a good set of control variables. The propensity-score results show that public-private school is performing better than that of comparison group in attaining learning outcomes thus showing positive effects of PPP. Finally, the study probed into household and parental covariates of student's educational outcomes to enhance internal validity of results.
L32|Governance of non-profit and non-governmental organizations - within- and between- organization analyses: an introduction|Despite the fact that nonprofit organizations play a large role in the production and distribution of goods and services in modern economies, and the rising role of non-governmental organizations in carrying out projects in developing countries, our knowledge of their governance, and of its' implications for their behaviour and performance, is limited. This special issue tries to uncover some of the mechanisms and institutions that characterize the governance of non-profits and NGOs, as well as its implications. In particular, the papers focus on: (i) the determinants of NGO governance and its implications for reducing poverty in developing countries, (ii) the governance of non-profit organizations, (iii) the impact of governance characteristics on the performance of non-profit organizations, and (iv) the effect of non-profit governance on the interaction between the non-profit and for-profit sectors.
L32|Assessing the Role of PPPs in Addressing Proximity and Systemic Challenges in Regional Innovation Policy|Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are argued to be able to add greater value to innovation processes by fortifying the quality of innovation systems by linking regional public and private actors together and exploiting a wide range of sources of innovation. The effectiveness of interface management and resource allocation as well as the dynamics of multifaceted interactions, however, will strongly depend on the degree of proximity between innovation agents. While it is difficult to determine the optimal degree of proximity for multi-sector cooperation in addressing systemic challanges, there is little doubt that certain level of cognitive, organizational, institutional, social and geographical closeness is conductive to interaction and learning. This paper applies a partnership-based approach to investigate the interrelation between dimensions of proximity and systemic failures and observes potential regional and sectoral variations with respect to proximity dimensions and their implication for regional innovation system efficiency. A matrix linking five dimensions of proximity with four categories of systemic problems serves as a basis for analysis. Six PPPs from two regions in Sweden (i.e. Sydsverige and Övre Norrland) are selected for empirical study.
L32|Economics of State-owned Passenger Transport in Kolkata|In developing countries, rapid urbanisation has led to an increase in the demand for transport, aggravating problems of pollution, congestion and accidents. Increasing public transport availability is one way of addressing these problems. In the Indian city of Kolkata, buses cater to a large number of people in the metropolitan area and are run by private operators as well as by the state government. Corporations owned by the state, known as state transport undertakings, operate buses. There is, however, a general complaint that the state-run buses show poor performance in nearly every sphere, including inefficient staff, irregular service, ill-maintained fleet, etc. The objective of this study is to look at the physical, financial and manpower performance of the different state transport corporations to find out whether these corporations operate efficiently. The results indicate that there is underutilisation of fleet, defective employment policy, wrong purchase policy, poor revenue generation, etc. on the part of all the corporations.
L32|The proper factors that determine the risk|It appears that generally limitations in achieving objectives are caused by the next realities: (1)leader’s judgment in making decisions is not always the best, if there are not regarded all the circumstances; (2) risks can occur because of simple error or misconduct; (3) decisions on risks and internal controls implemented do not take account on costs and benefits; (4) in many cases the implementation of internal controls is ignored as a result of agreements between public enterprise management and some employees or third parties, which increases the risk and possibility of control.
L32|School district consolidation: Market concentration and the scale-efficiency tradeoff|Consolidation is often proposed as a strategy for increasing school district quality without increasing educational funding. However, if consolidation reduces competition in the local school market and reduces efficiency, any savings from exploiting economies of scale may be lost to increased inefficiency. We use a stochastic cost function to investigate these effects for districts in Texas. We find important economies of scale, but we also find that increased market concentration leads to increased cost inefficiency. Finally, we illustrate the practical importance of these two potentially offsetting factors in a simulation that considers consolidating Texas school districts to county-level districts. We find that failure to consider the effect on competition can lead to large overestimates of the benefits of consolidation.
L32|Privatization and merger in a mixed oligopoly with spatial price discrimination|This paper is the first to investigate the impact of the presence of a public firm on the profitability of two-firm mergers in a spatial price discrimination model. The presence of the public firm may increase the set of mergers for two private firms to profitably merge. Merger increases social welfare in the presence of a public follower alone. However, privatizing the public firm never increases social welfare. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
L32|Délégation stratégique dans un duopole mixte international|La littérature sur les incitations managériales met en évidence que l'utilisation des contrats incitatifs pour les gestionnaires permet d'augmenter le bien-être social. Ce papier considère l'impact des schémas de rémunération managériaux dans un duopole où une firme semi-publique est en concurrence avec une firme privée étrangère. Nous supposons que le contrat incitatif offert aux gestionnaires de la firme semi-publique tient compte d'une partie des objectifs sociaux de l'autorité publique. Contrairement au cas où la firme semi-publique est en concurrence avec une firme domestique, nous montrons Qu'il existe un équilibre où la firme semi-publique n'a pas intérêt à inciter son gestionnaire. De plus, dans le duopole international, l'introduction de ces contrats incitatifs managériaux peut être néfaste pour le bien-être social.
L32|L’opérateur de transport public à Bruxelles (STIB) et la Région de Bruxelles-Capitale :25 ans de vie commune|Since 1989 and the regionalization of public transports in Belgium, the Société des transports intercommunaux de Bruxelles (STIB), i.e. the public operator of urban transport in Brussels, has undergone many changes, both structural and organizational. Meanwhile, the company has managed to improve its financial health in accordance with the objectives set by the regulatory transport authority, the Region of Brussels-Capital. The analysis of the system of actors shows that, in a principal-agent relationship characterized by high information asymmetry, the convergence of interests between the supervisory authority and the public company is neither natural nor automatic: it is built. This construction takes place at several levels and materializes incrementally, particularly through the management contract. In this regulatory system, the process organizing the dialogue between the company and the authority produces the desired beneficial effects, more than the legal value of the contract does. The interdependence between the actions of the Region and those of the STIB implies practices that can be described as a partnership. Finally, the analysis shows that the contractualization is not inconsistent with an evolution of the roles of each actor.
L32|Welfare Effects of Water Pricing in Germany|The observed two-part tariff price structure (consisting of a lump-sum price and linear marginal price) for drinking water in Germany does not reflect the cost structure reported in the literature. Recovering marginal costs from a sample of 251 German counties, we see that there are positive price-cost margins, while lump-sum prices are too low. A price structure readjustment along welfare economic principles (marginal cost pricing, lump-sum price ensures cost-recovery) would increase the mean consumer surplus by 0.037% of the local GDP or €2.129 million per county, assuming a share of 15% variable costs in total costs.
L32|Determinants of manager pay in German state-owned enterprises and international public policy implications: 3-year study for sectors, performance and gender|Empirical studies have shown that state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and especially the compensation of topmanagers, are very relevant to the performance and sustainable provision of public services. Whereas there are numerous studies on the compensation of top-management of private sector organizations, almost no empirical studies have been conducted for SOEs. This paper examines the determinants and disclosure of top-management compensation from 176 SOEs in eleven sectors over three financial years by assessing 498 annual statements. As a methodological contribution, the paper demonstrates the relevance for adjusting raw data from financial statements to obtain meaningful performance figures in order to represent the real economic situation. This provides perspectives for research on organizational success for several disciplines. In contrast to the transparency requirements 75.2% of the companies do not disclose information about compensation in their annual financial statements. For the 233 annual financial statements with disclosed pay, firm size has a significant influence on the level of compensation. The number of employees, an important indicator for the relevance of the public service, has lower influence than balance sheet total and turnover. Furthermore, managers earn more in profitable sectors than in loss-making sectors; however loss-making sectors often have a special relevance of for society and for the sustainable provision of public services. With regard to laws which also formulate financial goals for SOEs, there appears to be no link between financial performance ratios and the level of compensation. However, a strong and highly significant correlation exists between the developments of return on equity (ROE) and performance-based components. Return on total assets (ROA), which seems to be a better figure in this context to link performance and pay, was found to have no association. Regarding the discussion about a bonus-malus-system the data show far more compensation rises than decreases. Women employed in top-management positions were found to earn, on average, notably less than men. This finding has special implications for the prevailing public policy discussion about the gender pay gap in which SOEs have a special responsibility. In the ongoing debate about the appropriateness of compensation, the findings indicate that the level of compensation is not particularly strongly determined by the indicators that were investigated in this study. The paper provides new empirical insights, research perspectives and concrete international implications for public policy making as well as for practitioners.
