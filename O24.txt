O24|Evaluating the Impact of Brexit on Natural Gas Trade between the UK and the EU – A Spatial Equilibrium Analysis|The United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union (EU) engage in significant natural gas trade through the Internal Energy Market (IEM). As the UK exits from the EU however, it is likely to also exit from the IEM given the seemingly intractable positions of both parties. Exit of the UK from the IEM would likely cause an increase in natural gas trade costs between the two. The increased trade costs result from a number of channels including (1) loss in trade efficiency arising from loss of EU financing previously aimed at improving efficiencies in trade between the two; (2) loss in trade efficiency arising from loss in the sophistication of financial instruments that are linked to the UK’s membership of the EU and the IEM; (3) rising costs of doing business in the UK for many EU energy companies due to the effects of possible regulatory divergence between the UK and the EU; etc. We use a spatial equilibrium model to examine the trade flow, price and welfare implications of these cost effects on global natural gas trade, with a focus on the UK and the EU. We find that cost increases in the UK-EU natural gas trade links would result significant trade flow changes, with the UK and the EU reducing overall exports and increasing internal trade. As a result, there would be significant underutilisation of existing pipelines linking both parties. The Republic of Ireland would also form a significant number of new trade links to compensate for its reduction in imports from the UK. Total welfare losses in the UK and the EU are in the order of $479million and $602million respectively, which is equivalent to about 3.69% and 0.59% of the total value of natural gas trade for the respective parties in 2017. In the UK, the producer welfare loss is significantly higher, highlighting the vulnerability of the UK natural gas industry to cost increases in trade with the EU.
O24|Corruption, productivity, and import liberalization in China : a firm-level analysis|Understanding whether and how corruption impacts firm productivity in China is crucial for promoting good governance of economic development. Based on our econometric model developed with China’s firm-level data, including detailed firm heterogeneity information and provincial records of government official-related corruption, we confirm that corruption acts as “sand” rather than “grease” in the wheels of firm productivity improvement. The hampering effect of corruption on firm productivity is not obvious for state-owned, relatively large-sized, and low productive firms, but it is quite significant for private, relatively small-sized, and high productive ones. More importantly, we find that a firm’s productivity gains from import liberalization are significantly inhibited by corruption. Therefore, if the institutional environment can be improved, firms in China possess great potential—especially private and small-sized firms—to be more efficient or be able to obtain more productivity gains from import liberalization.
O24|Potential for inward foreign direct investment in Japan|Promotion of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) into Japan has been an important policy in the Abenomics growth strategy. This paper examines if we observe positive impacts of the policy in the data. We first estimate a gravity model of bilateral FDIs using data for 35 OECD countries as destination countries. In estimating the model, we handle zero values for FDI stock explicitly. The model includes (origin and destination) country-specific effects as well as destination-country specific time trends. We take the model prediction as a reasonable counterfactual and compare that to the actual inward FDI stock for Japan. Although the actual inward FDI stock has been growing and is likely to achieve the goal of 35 trillion yen by 2020, the growth under the Abe administration has been comparable to or slightly lower than the counterfactual suggested by the estimated model. We also estimate the model without Japan as a destination country and use the estimated model to calculate the counterfactual level of Japan's inward FDI. Although we expect the gap between the counterfactual and the actual become narrower if Abenomics policy has been successful, we fail to find that. These results cast a doubt on the effectiveness of the Abenomics policies to encourage inward FDI at least as of 2015.

O24|Measuring trade in value added: How valid is the proportionality assumption?|The validity of the ‘proportionality assumption’ made in estimating value added in exports using aggregate input-output tables is tested using separately compiled domestic- and imported-input matrices for Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Australia. The results show that the use of the proportionality assumption results in overestimation of value-added exports, and that the magnitude of the bias becomes amplified when the export composition of a country shifts from primary products to manufactured goods through integration into global production networks.
O24|Temporary Trade Shocks, Spatial Reallocation, and Persistence in Developing Countries : Evidence from a Natural Experiment in West Africa|In response to rising inequality following decades of trade liberalization, many countries are adopting trade restrictions. Can temporary trade restrictions have long-lasting effects on the spatial distribution of employment and resource allocation? To analyze this, this paper exploits the civil war in Côte d'Ivoire (2002-07), which disrupted access to the world market for two neighboring landlocked countries: Mali and Burkina Faso. The Ivorian war forced rerouting of trade from the Abidjan route to non-Abidjan routes. This paper builds a general equilibrium model where a subsistence-based autarkic hinterland coexists with an integrated segment, and there are two alternative routes to international markets. A trade shock to one route affects resource allocation in both routes by shifting the spatial margins of market integration and sectoral specialization. The effects are heterogeneous, depending on the pre-war market access of a location. The empirical analysis takes advantage of panel data and estimates the effects on structural change in employment on the non-Abidjan route using a triple difference design with location fixed effects. The areas that remain in autarkic equilibrium before and after the trade shock provide plausible estimates of the changes arising from long-term factors unrelated to the trade shock. The estimates show that the temporary trade shock created divergence between the Abidjan and non-Abidjan routes, with accelerated structural change in favor of manufacturing and services employment in the non-Abidjan route. This paper finds evidence of persistence in the effects through higher sunk investment in built-up density, agglomeration through concentration of skilled labor and greater public investment in complementary inputs such as electricity infrastructure (measured by nightlights density).
O24|Rules of Origin Liberalization with Multi-Product Firms: Theory and Evidence from Bangladeshi Apparel Exporters|I study how rules of origin in potential export destinations influence firm- and industry-level export behavior in least-developed countries (LDCs). Rules of origin restrict LDCs from taking advantage of preferential tariff rates in export markets, and this undermines market access for LDCs and reduces the efficacy of export-oriented industrialization. I develop a model of multi-product firms in which rules of origin influence the product scope and export revenue of final goods producers through their effect on input sourcing decisions. I test the model's predictions using the 2011 revisions to the EU's rules of origin for apparel products from LDCs. To control for the potential endogeneity of the policy change I use a triple-difference approach, exploiting variation in the input-cost differentials across apparel products and export destination, before and after the EU policy change. Liberalizing rules of origin results in revenue gains, expansion of product scope, and firm entry into the export market. Within firms, incumbents upgrade product quality. Across firms, market share is reallocated toward more productive incumbents.
O24|Exchange Rate Pass-Through: A Competitive Search Approach|We develop an open economy monetary model with heterogeneous households which is characterized by incomplete pass-through of exchange rate movements to import prices. Partial pass-through arises in our environment due to the presence of competitive search in international goods' markets. Under competitive search, agents choose a sub-market in which to exchange goods, where different sub-markets are characterized by different price and trading probability combinations. Preference and policy shocks which induce exchange rate movements cause households to choose a different sub-market for their purchases of traded goods--an extensive margin response. These responses mitigate the direct effect of nominal exchange rate changes on equilibrium traded goods' prices, thereby generating incomplete exchange rate pass-through to goods' prices. In the calibrated model, exchange rate pass-through due to foreign shocks ranges between 19% and 62%, which is in the range of import price pass-through estimates for developed economies. Due to risk aversion by households, the magnitude of pass-through depends on the size and direction of the initial shock, making the model consistent with the observed phenomenon of asymmetric pass-through. Importantly, by incorporating household heterogeneity, we are able to examine the role of precautionary savings in affecting pass-through, characterize how pass-through varies across different types of households, and examine the distributional effects of exchange rate movements.
O24|FDI, multinationals and structural change in developing countries|Economic development can be defined as a process in which output growth is accompanied by qualitative changes in the structures of production and employment. Can FDI affect this process? This paper looks for answers in two ways. First, it reviews the extant knowledge about the relationship between MNE activity and economic development in developing countries. Core theoretical and conceptual issues are presented and the key findings of both microeconomic (FDI linkages and spillovers) and macroeconomic (FDI-growth nexus) empirical studies are discussed. The main message of both streams of literature is that FDI has the potential to catalyse development, but actual outcomes are contingent on several factors, such as the absorptive capacity of domestic firms and the level of development of local financial markets. Second, the paper addresses the relationship between FDI and structural change more directly, in a cross-country context, using a two-step estimation approach that is consistent with both theoretical arguments and previous empirical findings which suggest that the FDI-development nexus is highly country-specific. The results confirm such heterogeneity and suggest that the interaction between the sectoral concentration of FDI and the development stage of the country plays a role in determining the development impact of FDI.
O24|Italy’s Decline and the Balance-of-Payments Constraint: a Multicountry Analysis|According to the literature, the decline experienced by the Italian economy in the last two decades depends on a slowdown of its labor productivity, starting in the Nineties. The supply-side explanations of this slowdown are inconsistent with the major stylized facts. In this paper, we verify whether a better explanation is provided by the effect of a negative demand shock, through Italy’s external constraints, in the framework of Kaldor-Dixon-Thirlwall cumulative growth model. To this end, we use a multi-country generalization of Thirlwall’s balance-of-payments-constrained growth model, which allows us to investigate the contribution of Italy’s main trade partners to Italy’s long-run growth from 1970 to 2010. The trade partners are disaggregated into seven groups: Eurozone core, Eurozone periphery, United States, other European countries, OPEC countries, BRIC, and the rest of the world. The results show that Italy’s long-run growth has been consistent with the Bop-constraint, that its decline can be explained by a progressive tightening of this constraint, that the sudden slowdown of labor productivity in the Nineties corresponds with a major shock on Italy’s external constraint, and that the major contributions to this shock came, through different channels of transmission, from the core Eurozone countries and from OPEC countries.
O24|Intellectual Property Protection and Foreign Direct Investment into Less Developed Economies in the post-TRIPs Period|In this paper we study the relationship between the strength of intellectual property (IP) protection that less developed countries provide and foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into these countries, in the post-TRIPs period 2004-2015. Our sample period is highly appropriate insofar as it comes after the ten year period that the developing countries were allowed for implementing IP reforms in accordance with the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement. Further, it is long enough to permit the modelling of a delayed FDI response to the IP reform stimulus. Our modelling strategy attempts to capture the heterogeneity of the impact of the IP reform on the FDI inflows by estimating a conditional difference-in-differences specification. Thus, we allow for the fact that the impact of IP reform can vary significantly across countries depending on the magnitude of intellectual property that they own for which they seek such protection, for that would indicate the importance that they attach to IP protection. Estimating a varying coefficient model, our results do not provide evidence of a statistically significant effect of IP reform on FDI inflows into less developed countries, nor do we find that the effect of such reform is significantly stronger for countries that own relatively larger amounts of intellectual property. These results hold contemporaneously as well as with lags. Instead, FDI inflows appear to be driven by market size and domestic investment climate variables. Disaggregating our sample into the sub-groups of developing countries and least developed countries, we find that our overall results for less developed countries are driven by the sub-group of developing countries.
O24|Cross-border knowledge flows through R&D FDI: Implications for low- and middle-income countries|R&D related foreign direct investments represent a powerful mechanism for cross-border knowledge sharing that can stimulate the process of technological catch-up. However, low-income countries and smaller middle-income countries remain largely excluded from this kind of global flows of knowledge. In this chapter, we discuss the motivations and implications of this type of FDI for low and middle income countries, building on a critical review of the existing literature and analyse the trajectory of R&D FDI during the period 2003-2017 by region and industry. The data is used as a point of departure to discuss potential policies specially tailored for low and middle income countries and their capacity to attract and anchor R&D related FDI for technological catch up. The paper finalizes outlining a future research agenda.
O24|A Gravity Model Estimation of the Bi-Directional Relationship between International Trade and Migration|The relationships between migration and trade are a continuing source of debate in the academic literature. Some studies have found that migration and trade are complements, while other studies have found them to be substitutes. Still other studies have found that there is no statistically significant relationship between them. However, the majority of previous empirical studies have focused on the relationship between trade and migration in either a single country, a single region, or within a single trade agreement. This paper examines the bi-directional relationship between trade and migration using international bilateral trade and migration flows data for 248 countries over the period 1990-2010. We also account for other relevant covariates within a seemingly-unrelated regression gravity model framework. Our findings suggest that trade and migration are complements - larger migration flows are associated with larger trade flows, and vice versa. The relationships with other relevant covariates are as expected, with the exception that distance is positively and statistically significantly related to migration. Although our results do not definitively demonstrate causality, they suggest that, if world trade decreases due to countries acting on current protectionist sentiments, migration flows might also be expected to decline.
O24|Temporary Trade Shocks, Spatial Reallocation, and Persistence in Developing Countries: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in West Africa|In response to rising inequality following decades of trade liberalization, many countries are adopting trade restrictions. Can temporary trade restrictions have long-lasting effects on spatial distribution of employment and resource allocation? To analyze this, we exploit the civil war in Cote d'Ivoire (2002-2007) that disrupted access to world market for two neighboring land-locked countries: Mali and Burkina Faso. The Ivorian war forced rerouting of trade from the Abidjan route to the non-Abidjan routes. We build a general equilibrium model where a subsistence-based autarkic hinterland coexists with an integrated segment, and there are two alternative routes to the international market.

The estimates show that the temporary trade shock created divergence between the Abidjan and non-Abidjan routes with accelerated structural change in favor of manufacturing and services employment in the non-Abidjan route. We find evidence of persistence in the effects through higher sunk investment in built-up density, agglomeration through concentration of skilled labor, and more public investment in complementary inputs such as electricity infrastructure (measured by night-lights density).
O24|Georgia’s Economic Performance: Bright Spots and Remaining Challenges|Georgia has long been one of the most trade-open economies in the world. It joined WTO in 2000 and currently has a free trade agreement with the EU and EFTA, as well as with Turkey, the CIS and China. Georgia has been also one of the most business-friendly countries. The basic objectives of Georgia’s trade policy are integration, liberalisation, diversification and transparency. The Association Agreement (AA) with the EU signed in June 2014 and in force since July 2016 lays the foundations for far-reaching political and economic cooperation with the EU and serves as a backbone for reforms. The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) agreement that represents a part of AA envisages a gradual implementation of reforms in areas such as trade, environment, agriculture, tourism, energy, transport and education with the aim to bring Georgia in line with EU standards. The DCFTA sets a path for further reforms in trade-related policies, such as hygiene standards for agriculture products, the approximation of regulations for industrial products, enforcement of intellectual property rights at the border, rules on public procurement and approximation to EU rules in the services area. However, there is no prospect for EU membership in the Agreement. Georgia has been suffering from chronic goods trade and current account deficits; the export base has been very narrow. Foreign trade has been regionally focused on its neighbouring partners. Russia is the largest export market, ahead of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkey and China. Among the EU countries, the biggest markets for Georgian exports are Bulgaria and Romania. Exports are highly concentrated and there has not been much export diversification yet. The key exports to the EU include copper ores (39% of the total), nuts, nitrogen fertilisers and mineral oils. The DCFTA apparently has not had much positive effect on Georgian exports to the EU so far, despite some spectacular increases by individual products. Rather than in goods exports, Georgia has a competitive advantage in services, especially in tourism and transit transport. Georgia has been also relatively successful in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) cumulated inward FDI stocks amounted to about EUR 4,000 per capita as of mid-2018. A development strategy combining existing competitive advantages of tourism with domestic agriculture (using the excellent domestic wine and delicious local food), supported by structural reforms in the agricultural sector and targeted FDI policies, could be a viable option to foster inclusive economic growth and mitigate external vulnerabilities.
O24|Making America Great Again|Trump has promised to ‘make America great again’. As a self-proclaimed expert on everything of import, he knows exactly how to increase domestic investment and consumption, boost exports, reduce the country’s trade deficit, expand employment and bolster wages. And as America’s leader-and-policymaker-in-chief, he has taken the necessary steps to achieve every one of these goals, or so he says. Capitalists and pundits follow him like imprinted ducks. His tweets rattle markets, his announcements are dissected by academics and his utterances are analysed to exhaustion by various media. A visiting alien might infer that he actually runs the world. And the alien wouldn’t be alone. The earthly population too, conditioned by ivory-tower academics and popular opinion makers, tends to think of political figureheads as ‘leaders’ and ‘policymakers’. Situated at the ‘commanding heights’ of their respective nation states and international organizations, these ‘leaders’ supposedly set the rules, make policies, steer their societies and determine the course of history. Or at least that’s the belief. The reality, though, is quite different.
O24|Structural reforms and firms’ productivity: Evidence from developing countries|This paper assesses the effects of selected structural reforms on labor productivity growth for 37 developing countries over the 2006–14 period. It combines newly constructed reform indexes using the IMF Monitoring of Fund Arrangements dataset and firm-level productivity from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys. The paper highlights the following results. Structural reforms under consideration in this study, i.e., financial, fiscal, real sector, and trade reforms, significantly improve productivity at the firm level. Interestingly, real sector reforms have the most sizeable effects on firms’ productivity. The relationship between reforms and productivity is nonlinear and shaped by certain firms’ characteristics, including financial access, a distortionary environment, and firms’ size. The pace of reforms matters since being a “strong reformer” is associated with a clear productivity dividend for firms. Finally, except for financial and trade reforms, all macroeconomic reforms considered are bilaterally complementary in improving firms’ productivity. The findings are robust to several sensitivity checks including alternatives measure of productivity, and a counterfactual experiment based on unsuccessful reforms.
O24|Western Balkans EU Accession: Is the 2025 Target Date Realistic?|The European Commission has set a target date of 2025 for Western Balkan EU accession, while also outlining a broader new strategy which includes Brussels taking a more active role in solving political disputes in the region, and upgrading infrastructure as part of the Berlin Process. We welcome these moves economic underdevelopment in the region is closely tied to political fractures. Aside from resolving political conflicts, improved governance in the region will also be necessary. In terms of meeting economic accession criteria, the region faces a host of challenges, but we believe that a focus on upgrading infrastructure and developing a much bigger and more competitive industrial base should be the priorities. While the economic influence of third parties in the region is not as significant as often portrayed, this is not guaranteed to last, particularly in the case of China, which is set to increase its economic presence in the Western Balkans in the coming years. Even if the region takes a great leap forward towards the EU, there are other barriers in the way which could also hold back accession. Nevertheless, while the 2025 target represents a highly ambitious best-case scenario, it could serve as a powerful incentive for countries in the region to speed up their reform agendas. We do not completely rule out at least Montenegro and Serbia joining the bloc by 2025 or shortly thereafter.
O24|The EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement and its relevance for the Austrian Economy|Since the beginning of 2017, a paradigm change in international trade policy is observed. While the protectionist agendas are on the rise, the EU and Japan signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) on 17 July 2018. It is the most ambitious agreement of the EU with any Asian state. The study estimates the effect of the EU-Japan EPA for Austria based on qualitative analysis and a structural gravity model. The model predicts small but positive effects of around 0.01% of GDP for Austria. Highest gains are expected for manufactured goods, particularly in the medium- and high-tech sectors.

Abstract in German language Seit Anfang des Jahres 2017 vollzieht sich in der internationalen Handelspolitik ein Paradigmenwechsel. Während protektionistische Agenden an Fahrt gewinnen, unterzeichneten die EU und Japan am 17. Juli 2018 ein Wirtschaftspartnerschaftsabkommen (EPA). Es ist das ambitionierteste Abkommen der EU mit einem asiatischen Staat. Die Studie schätzt die Effekte des EU-Japan-EPA für Österreich mithilfe von qualitativen Analysen und einem strukturellen Gravitationsmodell ab. Für Österreich wurde ein kleiner, aber positiver Effekt von rund 0,01% des BIP errechnet. Es wird erwartet, dass vor allem der Fertigungsbereich in Mittel- und High-Tech-Sektoren von diesem Abkommen profitieren wird.
O24|How to intervene in foreign exchange market without buying/selling dollars?|The Emerging Market Economies are vulnerable to adverse external shocks. Such shocks cause excessive volatility in foreign exchange markets. Faced with high volatility, the central banks in EMEs often end up, in futility, depleting their foreign exchange reserves by selling dollars to restore stability. Few central banks use currency-options based intervention to contain volatility and anchor market expectations. In the Indian context, this paper demonstrates that such options-based intervention policies can be considered to contain excessive volatility and anchoring market expectations. Using the risk-neutral densities extracted from currency options data, it is demonstrated that certain options-trading strategy can be effective in stabilizing markets. Therefore, options-based intervention may be a viable policy alternative, which is more cost-effective than the conventional spot-market intervention.
O24|Attracting FDI in middle-skilled supply chains|While popular opinion often pictures FDI flowing in search of lowest-wage, lowest-skilled activities in emerging markets, actual FDI to such countries increasingly addresses medium to high-skilled manufacturing sectors. Such FDI might be called 'Quality FDI' that contributes to the creation of decent and value-adding jobs, enhancing the skill base of host economies, facilitating transfer of technology, knowledge and know-how, boosting competitiveness of domestic firms and enabling their access to world-wide markets, as well as operating in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. To attract such quality FDI, host countries need mindfully tailored policies. Recent research offers evidence for strategies in developing countries that successfully turned FDI into such quality FDI.
O24|Bilateral De-Jure Exchange Rate Regimes and Foreign Direct Investment: A Gravity Analysis|This paper uses a newly constructed dataset on bilateral de-jure exchange rate regimes to estimate the effect of expected exchange rate volatility on foreign direct investment (FDI). The new dataset accounts for the fact that officially pegging to one currency is uninfor- mative about the exchange rate regime prevailing vis-à-vis other currencies, and it allows characterizing bilateral exchange rate regimes based on countries' ex-ante announcements rather than ex-post observations. We present a simple model that suggests that announced exchange rate stability enhances bilateral FDI ows. The empirical evidence we provide o ers some support to this claim: countries that are linked by a non- oating exchange rate regime seem to attract significantly more FDI from each other. In particular, rela- tionships with no separate legal tender like currency unions are most favorable to FDI in both developed and developing countries. Moreover, we find substantial differences between developing and developed countries, with the effect of announced exchange rate stability being much stronger for the former group than for the latter.

O24|The KOF Globalisation Index â€“ Revisited|In this paper we present and describe the revised version of the KOF Globalisation Index, a composite index measuring globalisation for every country in the world along the economic, social and political dimension. The original index was introduced by Dreher (2006) and updated in Dreher et al. (2008). This second revision of the index introduces the differentiation between de facto and de jure measures along the different dimensions of globalisation, the differentiation between trade and financial globalisation within the economic dimension of globalisation and time-varying weighting of the variables entering the index. Finally, the revised version incorporates several additional variables in the construction process. At the aggregate level, we show that a bidirectional relationship between de facto and de jure globalisation exists.
O24|Absorptive capacity in New Zealand firms: Measurement and importance|To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports the first set of nationally representative results on the importance of ‘absorptive capacity’ (generally defined as a firm’s ability to internalise external knowledge) for firms. Using data principally from the Business Operations Survey 2005–15, we measure absorptive capacity in New Zealand (NZ) firms across a 10-year period and investigate if it remains stable in the long term. This is followed by considering how firms’ characteristics vary across levels of absorptive capacity and most importantly whether such capacity determines firms’ productivity performance across the primary, manufacturing and service sectors. Our results show that relative to other influences, absorptive capacity as measured here—net of the impact of, for example, foreign-ownership and human capital—has a substantial influence on exporting, innovation and undertaking R&D, and thus consequently firm-level productivity. Set against relatively poor productivity performance, the paper concludes with a discussion of how government should consider helping firms to boost their levels of absorptive capacity in NZ.
O24|The Industrialization of South America Revisited: Evidence from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia, 1890-2010|We use new manufacturing GDP time series to examine the industrialization in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia since the early twentieth century. We uncover variation across countries and over time that the literature on industrialization had overlooked. Rather than providing a single explanation of how specific shocks or policies shaped the industrialization of the region, our argument is that the timing of the industrial take off was linked to initial conditions, while external shocks and macroeconomic and trade policy explain the variation in the rates of industrialization after the 1930s and favorable terms of trade and liberalization explain de-industrialization after 1990.
O24|Explaining Thailand’s Automotive Manufacturing Success|We argue that the success of Thailand’s export-oriented automotive industry was based on three factors. First was the substantial public investment in productivity-raising port facilities and related infrastructure, beginning in the 1990s, that constituted the Eastern Seaboard economic corridor. The second was the exchange rate depreciation that accompanied the 1997-99 Asian Financial Crisis. Jointly, these two factors made manufacturing production for export more profitable. The third was two key policy changes adopted by the Thai government shortly after the crisis, and partly in response to it: (a) abolition of restrictions on foreign ownership, and (b) abolition of local content requirements.
O24|Global production networks and the evolution of industrial capabilities: Does production sharing warp the Product Space?|Do production capabilities of countries evolve from existing capabilities, or do they emerge de novo? The Product Space approach developed by Hidalgo, Klinger, Barabási & Hausmann (2007) postulates that a country’s existing industrial structure largely determines its opportunities for industrial upgrading. We advance the Product Space approach to accommodate the role of global production sharing. Using a newly constructed multi-country dataset of manufacturing exports that distinguishes between trade within global production networks and traditional horizontal trade we show that existing industrial structure has a lesser impact on industrial upgrading within vertically integrated global industries.
O24|Modeling and Forecasting Naira / USD Exchange Rate In Nigeria: a Box - Jenkins ARIMA approach|In the financial as well as managerial decision making process, forecasting is a crucial element (Majhi et al, 2009). Most research have been made on forecasting of financial and economic variables through the help of researchers in the last decades using series of fundamental and technical approaches yielding different results (Musa et al, 2014). The theory of forecasting exchange rate has been in existence for many centuries where different models yield different forecasting results either in the sample or out of sample (Onasanya & Adeniji, 2013). A country’s exchange rate is one of the most closely monitored indicators, as fluctuations in exchange rates can have far reaching economic consequences (Ribeiro, 2016). The recent financial turmoil all over the world demonstrates the urgency of perfect information of the exchange rates (Shim, 2000). Understanding the forecasting of exchange rate behaviour is important to monetary policy (Simwaka, 2007). One of the important variables that have considerable influence on other socio – economic variables in Nigeria is the Nigerian naira / dollar exchange rate (Ismail, 2009). Owing to the critical role played by exchange rate dynamics in international trade and overall economic performance of all countries in general, the need for a good forecasting tool cannot be ruled out. In this study, we model and forecast the Naira / USD exchange rates over the period 1960 – 2017. Our diagnostic tests such as the ADF test indicate that EXC time series data is I (1). Based on the minimum AIC value, the study presents the ARIMA (1, 1, 1) model as the optimal model. The ADF test further indicates that the residuals of the ARIMA (1, 1, 1) model are stationary and thus bear the characteristics of a white noise process. It is also important to note that our forecast evaluation statistics, namely ME, RMSE, MAE, MPE, MAPE and Theil’s U absolutely show that our forecast accuracy is quite good. Our forecast actually indicates that the Naira will continue to depreciate. The main policy implication from this study is that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), should devalue the Naira in order to not only restore exchange rate stability but also encourage local manufacturing and promote foreign capital inflows.
O24|Modification of the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) on Indonesia's trade, investment, and industrial incentive policies|This paper modifies the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) method and applies it on Indonesia's trade, investment, and industrial incentive policies. First, it analyses the Indonesian Bilateral Trade Agreements (BTAs) utilizing trade and investment agreement. Indonesia currently has two BTAs in force. One, Indonesia – Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (IJEPA) and two, Indonesia – Pakistan Preferential Trade Agreement (IP-PTA). This paper found that the outcome expectation for trading partner depends on its GNI per capita. If the trading partner has GNI per capita higher than Indonesia’s then the highest expected outcome would be on the increasing FDI inflows from the trading partner. If its GNI per capita is lower than Indonesia's, then the highest foreseeable result would be on the rising net trade balance of Indonesia. Second, industrial sector incentive analysis by comparing RIA scores on all possible incentive policies. In this paper, the modified RIA found that firms prefer supply-side incentives such as government support on the Research and Development, patent and copyright protection than fiscal incentives such as the import duty-free or tariff rate protection.
O24|Openness and Factor Shares: Is Globalization Always Bad for Labor?|The secular decline in the labor share since the 1980's is a global phenomenon, and a trend that is concurrent with large liberalization episodes worldwide. In this paper we investigate the liberalization episode in India during the 1990's, which has been characterized by large and unexpected changes in trade and foreign investment policies. Contrary to what might be expected given the reduction in the aggregate data, we uncover a trade channel that raises the labor-to-capital relative factor shares in India. A reduction in capital tariffs and liberalization of FDI raise the share of income paid to labor relative to capital. Our results reveal access to foreign capital as a new mechanism through which openness affects factor shares. An increasing share of foreign capital in the total capital stock provides a capital-augmenting technical change and potentially reduces rental rates, both of which raises the relative labor share. We find capital and R&D intensities, and the borrowing capacity of the firm, to be important determinants of the factor share response to openness. Finally, we identify domestic deregulation policies and credit expansion as potential determinants of the observed decline in the labor share.
O24|Determinants of real exchange rate misalignment: An empirical analysis for MENA region|The purpose of this paper is to explain the magnitude of the misalignment of the real exchange rate and its determinants for the MENA countries. Misalignment is defined as the deviation of the real exchange rate from its equilibrium level, unlike volatility which is defined as fluctuations that are very frequent but do not persist. Through this study, an attempt is made to broaden the traditional analysis, focusing mainly on the role of the exchange rate regimes on misalignment of the REER. On the same point of view, the roles of the persistence of misalignment, the quality of institutions, financial development and inflation in the misalignment of the real equilibrium exchange rate of the region. The results of the empirical analysis show that the most advantageous exchange rate regime for the MENA countries is the floating regime. Also, the quality of institutions, financial development and inflation are determinants of the shift of the REER from its equilibrium value.
O24|The “New Fiscal Plan for Puerto Rico” (April 19, 2018): An Unrealistic and Misleading Path to Nowhere|The New Fiscal Plan for Puerto Rico, issued by the Fiscal Oversight and Management Board on April 19, 2018, is deeply flawed. It is based on two incompatible goals: establishing a foundation for growth of the Puerto Rican economy and assuring that the Puerto Rican government will move quickly toward meeting its debt obligations. As result of this incompatibility, the Plan is deeply flawed and should be abandoned. The Plan imposes an austerity program, which will undermine possibilities for growth, harm the well-being of the populace, and likely undermine the government’s ability to meet debt obligations. Also, the plan makes unrealistically optimistic assumptions about positive impacts of the structural reforms it imposes on economic relations in Puerto Rico. This paper: (1) explains the austerity nature of the Plan and its negative impacts; and (2) discusses the Plan’s proposed structure reforms—labor reforms, tax reforms, education and human capital reforms, and government regulations and the organization of government agencies.
O24|Improving the developmental impact of multinational enterprises: policy and research challenges|Abstract We summarize the key empirical evidence on the nexus between MNEs and development, focusing on issues that are relevant for the formulation, implementation and assessment of policies by host developing countries. We also delve into what we do not know, as well as topics for which the evidence is still quite blurred. We discuss the reasons for the absence of clear evidence, and potential avenues for future research to improve policies. Although most countries rely on MNEs/FDI as a central plank of their development strategy, the collective weight of academic research has not led to a fine-tuning of policy implementation. Countries still rely on policies for which evidence is sparse, or no longer valid in an era of globalisation. Much of the literature has focused on externalities and spillovers, and has deemphasised the other ‘effects’ of MNE activity, implicitly assuming that MNEs are almost always beneficial for development. Few rents are costless when the opportunity costs of scarce resources are considered, especially in the longer term. Despite the abundance of empirical studies (of increasing sophistication), most ignore the significance of structural change. Growth and the interaction with MNE activity is not linear or monotonic over time, because the economy itself is in a constant state of flux.
O24|Exchange Rate Policy and External Vulnerabilities in Sub-Saharan Africa: Nominal, Real or Mixed Targeting?|This paper discusses the theoretical choice of exchange rate anchors in Sub-Saharan African countries that are facing external vulnerabilities. To reduce instability, policymakers choose among promoting external competitiveness using a real anchor, lowering the burden of external debt using a nominal anchor or using a policy mix of both anchors. We observe that these countries tend to adopt mixed anchor policies. We solve a state space model to explain the determinants of and the strategy behind this policy. We find that the choice of policy mix is a two-step strategy: First, authorities choose the degree of nominal exchange rate flexibility according to the velocity of money, trade openness, foreign debt, degree of exchange rate pass-through and exchange rate target zone. Second, authorities seek to stabilize the real exchange rate depending on the degree of trade integration with the rest of world and the degree of foreign exchange interventions. We conclude with regime-switching estimations to provide empirical evidence of how these economic fundamentals influence exchange rate policy in Sub-Saharan Africa.
O24|Within-firm spillovers of export promotion agencies|When export promotion agencies target specific products, they can crowd-out exports of other products, if firms focus on exporting the products for which they receive assistance, or foster them, if firms leverage the know-how and contacts acquired from the program. Thus, the net effect on total exports and export composition is theoretically ambiguous. We estimate the effects of Sierra Exportadora, one of Peru's flagship export promotion agencies, on its beneficiaries' exports of non-sponsored products. Using a comprehensive dataset of exporters we show that beneficiary firms exports of non-sponsored products increased by 20%, roughly as much as exports of sponsored products. We show that a large fraction of this change is due to changes in the extensive margins, suggesting that beneficiary firms leveraged contacts and know-how acquired from the program to export new non-sponsored products. We find that the effects are larger for firms with more pre-program experience exporting and higher pre-treatment exports.
O24|The not-so-generalized effects of the Generalized System of Preferences|We use an empirical gravity equation approach to study how nonreciprocal trade preferences (NRTPs), enacted mainly through the Generalized System of Preferences, affect the exports of the beneficiary nations. In line with existing studies, the average trade effect stemming from nonreciprocal preferences is highly unstable across specifications. However, once we allow for heterogeneous effects, results become robust and economically important. Specifically, NRTPs have a strong effect on the exports of beneficiaries when they are members of the World Trade Organization and are very poor. Not-so-poor beneficiaries also expand foreign sales, but only if they are not WTO members. For all others, the average export effects of NRTPs are mute.
O24|The KOF Globalisation Index – revisited|Abstract We introduce the revised version of the KOF Globalisation Index, a composite index measuring globalization for every country in the world along the economic, social and political dimension. The original index was introduced by Dreher (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091–1110, 2006) and updated in Dreher et al. (2008). This second revision of the index distinguishes between de facto and de jure measures along the different dimensions of globalization. We also disentangle trade and financial globalization within the economic dimension of globalization and use time-varying weighting of the variables. The new index is based on 43 instead of 23 variables in the previous version. Following Dreher (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091–1110, 2006), we use the new index to examine the effect of globalization on economic growth. The results suggest that de facto and de jure globalization influence economic growth differently. Future research should use the new KOF Globalisation Index to re-examine other important consequences of globalization and why globalization was proceeding rapidly in some countries, such as South Korea, but less so in others. The KOF Globalisation Index can be downloaded from http://www.kof.ethz.ch/globalisation/ .
O24|Tourism and Economic Development: Evidence from Mexico's Coastline|Tourism is a fast-growing services sector in developing countries. This paper combines a rich collection of Mexican microdata with a quantitative spatial equilibrium model and a new em- pirical strategy to study the long-term economic consequences of tourism both locally and in the aggregate. We find that tourism causes large and significant local economic gains relative to less touristic regions that are in part driven by significant positive spillovers on manufacturing. In the aggregate, however, these local spillovers are largely offset by reductions in agglomeration economies among less touristic regions, so that the national gains from trade in tourism are mainly driven by a classical market integration effect.
O24|Paths to Convergence: Stock Price Behavior After Donald Trump's Election|How do market prices adjust towards their equilibrium values? Donald Trump’s election, an aggregate surprise that shook up the prices of all stocks, provides an ideal setting to investigate this question. Indeed, the ratio of price spreads among stock returns relative to aggregate market volatility on the first post-election day was one of the greatest seen in this century. Markets assessed the correct direction of relative price moves by individual stocks impressively quickly: the vast majority of stocks moved in the appropriate direction on the first day. However, given the extreme shock, iterations were required to get relative prices back to the right levels. To illustrate, return continuation from day 1 to day 2 was extreme by historical standards. Momentum persisted for several days and was followed by a brief reversal before prices settled. Since little new information was released after the election – a fact that we confirm by analyzing both transition team announcements and news flows – these return patterns represented a movement toward a new equilibrium, and not a moving equilibrium. Stock return predictability was primarily driven by the part of first-day returns explained by firm characteristics, such as corporate taxes and foreign revenues, not by residual returns. The returns associated with a range of firm characteristics persisted for several days. Our results support prominent theories of slow but predictable diffusion of information into stock prices.
O24|Towards economically dynamic Special Economic Zones in emerging countries|Despite a massive recent proliferation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs), there is virtually no quantitative research on what drives their dynamism. The aim of this paper is to address this gap and analyse the factors influencing SEZ performance ? proxied by economic growth ? in emerging countries. The paper relies on two novel datasets, using night-lights data to proxy for SEZ performance and containing a wide range of SEZ policy variables and characteristics across a large number of countries. The main results of the analysis indicate that a) zone growth is difficult to sustain over time; that b) trying to upgrade the technological component or value-added of the economy through SEZ policies is often challenging; and that c) zone size matters: larger zones have an advantage in terms of growth potential. Furthermore, country context significantly determines SEZ performance. Firms look for low cost locations, but in close proximity to large cities. Proximity to large markets as well as pre-existing industrialization also increase SEZ performance. In contrast, incentives and other program specific variables are highly context-specific and not structurally correlated with SEZ performance.
O24|The real exchange rate, innovation and productivity : regional heterogeneity, asymmetries and hysteresis|We evaluate manufacturing firms' responses to changes in the real exchange rate (RER) using detailed firm-level data for a large set of countries for the period 2001-2010. We uncover the following stylized facts: In export-oriented emerging Asia, real depreciations are associated with faster growth of firm-level TFP, higher sales and cash-flow, and higher probabilities to engage in R&D and to export. We find negative effects for firms in other emerging economies, which are relatively more import dependent, and no significant effects for firms in industrialized economies. Motivated by these facts, we build a dynamic model in which real depreciations raise the cost of importing intermediates, affect demand, borrowing-constraints and the profitability of engaging in innovation (R&D). We decompose the effects of RER changes on productivity growth across regions into these channels. We estimate the model and quantitatively evaluate the different mechanisms by providing counterfactual simulations of temporary RER movements and conduct several robustness analyses. Effects on physical TFP growth, while different across regions, are non-linear and asymmetric.
O24|The not-so-generalized effects of the Generalized System of Preferences|We use an empirical gravity equation approach to study how nonreciprocal trade preferences (NRTPs), enacted mainly through the Generalized System of Preferences, affect the exports of the beneficiary nations.

Not-so-poor beneficiaries also expand foreign sales, but only if they are not WTO members. For all others, the average export effects of NRTPs are mute.
O24|Human Capital, Growth, and Asset Prices|Human capital investment is one of the most important drivers of growth. In this paper, I enhance the endogenous growth model of Kung and Schmid (2015) by an educational choice decision of the household. The engine of growth in the extended model is a composite of firm-side R&D capital stock and a household-side human capital stock. As households are able to allocate their time to labor, leisure and educational activities, the model allows to simultaneously study labor and education choices. The parameters of the non-linear model can be estimated by advanced Bayesian methods, allowing to study the return on human capital conditional on the data.
O24|Harmonization of Documents for International Transport: A study in the context of South and South-West Asia|Simplification of documentary requirements, an important aspect of international transport facilitation, can have substantial impacts in terms of reducing transport costs and improving trade competitiveness. This is especially so in the case of the South and South-West Asian countries, where procedural reforms for easing cross-border transport remain far behind advanced subregions of the Asia-Pacific region. Against an examination of the existing documentary requirements and legal arrangements in the subregion, this paper provides options for harmonization of road transport documents through a stepby- step approach. It outlines the key elements necessary for such harmonization based on modern electronic information systems. Among various options, the paper highlights solutions for dealing with transport permits and customs transit related documents. Employment of electronic vehicle/cargo tracking based on available models such as the UNESCAP Secure Cross Border Transport Model can strongly support implementation of a subregional road permit system and paperless customs transit system. The paper also provides recommendations for the special case of documentary reforms for transit, which applies to the landlocked countries of the subregion including Afghanistan, Bhutan and Nepal, based on lessons from international models such as the European New Computerized Transit System (NCTS) and ASEAN Customs Transit System (ACTS). Given the complexities of harmonization of cross-border transport documents, the paper calls for cooperation among all competent authorities and stakeholders, including customs and the private sector, at the national and regional levels.

O24|Trade protection and productivity differentials between multinationals and local firms in Vietnamese manufacturing| This paper investigates the how effective protection and firm ownership affected firm productivity in Vietnam during 2005-2010. In labour-intensive industries and industries with intermediate labour intensity, the level of effective protection in an industry had a significantly negative effect on firm productivity. Multinational enterprise (MNE) joint ventures (JVs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) had consistently higher productivity than private firms, with productivity usually being highest in JVs. Wholly-foreign MNEs (WOs) also had significantly higher productivity than private firms in 2005-2007, but lower productivity than JVs or SOEs, and in 2008-2010, WO-private differentials were insignificant. In capital-intensive industries, the pattern of productivity differentials (highest in JVs, followed by SOEs, WOs, and private firms) was similar in the earlier period, but not in the latter period or when all years were included in the sample. The level of effective protection also did not have a significant, independent effect on firm productivity in capital-intensive industries.
O24|Foreign Workers, Foreign Multinationals, and Wages after Controlling for Occupation and Sex in Malaysia’s Manufacturing Plants during the mid-1990s| This paper investigates the effects of foreign worker shares and MNE ownership on wages after controlling for worker sex and occupation in Malaysian manufacturing plants during 1994-1996, an important period during which use of foreign workers began to increase substantially. In a previous paper, I estimated similar wage equations separately for five occupation groups of both sexes in large heterogeneous samples of plants in many industries and more homogeneous samples of plants in seven industries. Results indicated that use of foreign workers generally had insignificant effects on plant wages for most occupation-sex-(and industry) combinations and that that MNE-local differentials were almost always insignificant in three industries and consistently significant in only one. Although separate estimation by sex and occupation has the strong advantage of accounting for worker characteristics relatively well, it has the disadvantages of complexity (10 results per sample) and being difficult to compare to more common approaches, which use sex and occupation as controls. The primary purpose of this paper is thus to see if using sex and occupation as independent variables generates results that differ from estimating wage equations separately for each sex-occupation cohort. Results suggest that the effects of foreign worker shares differ substantially among foreign worker occupations and among industries. Plants that have relatively large foreign manager shares tend to pay relatively high wages in most industries, but the effects of other foreign worker occupations are usually insignificant or inconsistent. Results that assume all foreign workers impart the same effects thus appear misleading, as do results assuming identical slope coefficients among industries. Similar to previous estimates, MNE-local wage differentials were consistently positive and significant in only two relatively small industries, chemicals and food, in marked contrast to previous results for 2000-2004, which did not account for the effects of foreign worker shares.
O24|Export tariffs combined with public investments as a forest conservation policy instrument|The forest conservation policy instrument REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) is designed to compensate governments of tropical countries for their efforts to conserve forests. Food insecure countries that are specialized in agriculture and have weak political institutions, are likely to face difficulties to enforce forest conservation. This article explores in how far export tariffs on agricultural goods combined with public investments, could be used as a forest conservation policy mix in such contexts. We first show empirically that structural constraints to forest conservation policies are particularly pronounced in one third of countries where REDD+ programs are planned to be rolled out. We then develop a two sector competing land use model with a domestic food producing and an exporting agricultural sector. We show that it is possible to combine export tariffs with public investments such that deforestation decreases, while agricultural production levels and food prices remain constant.
O24|Horizontal Crowding-Out Versus Vertical Synergies Under The Mne Presence|In this paper we provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the multinational enterprises (MNEs) and foreign direct investment (FDI) on domestic firms in Europe. We build on the theoretical model of Markusen and Venables (1999) and modify it to better reflect reality and to capture international industrial linkages. For empirical part we build a unique and large database that covers 30 European countries over 2001 - 2013. Rich data are combined from the Amadeus, UN Comtrade and BACI sources. Our results do not show evidence for a pure spillover effect when other channels are controlled for. However, on a more detailed level we show that MNE?s presence significantly affects domestic firms both in terms of changing market structure and productivity improvements. On other hand, change in sourcing patterns often results in that domestic firms are crowded-out. However, those domestic firms, that are able to withstand this double competition, receive additional benefits stemming from their interaction with downstream MNEs in form of productivity spillovers. We also document existence of trade (export) spillovers for both upstream and downstream levels. Despite that impact of the MNEs presence is not unambiguous the existence of positive production and trade spillovers is overwhelming.
O24|Politicized trade: What drives withdrawal of trade preferences?|While it is well understood that industrialized countries use aid to grant political favors, little research covers alternative channels such as trade policy towards developing countries. We analyze eligibility investigations and revoking of U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) benefits to see whether political friends of the U.S. receive favorable treatment. While countries politically aligned with the U.S. are equally likely to be investigated, they are significantly less likely to have their benefits suspended.
O24|Company Stock Reactions to the 2016 Election Shock: Trump, Taxes and Trade|The election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th President of the United States of America on 11/8/2016 came as a surprise. Markets responded swiftly and decisively. This note investigates both the initial stock market reaction to the election, and the longer-term reaction through the end of 2016. We find that the individual stock price reactions to the election – that is, the market’s vote – reflect investor expectations on economic growth, taxes, and trade policy. Heavy industry and banking were relative winners, whereas healthcare, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and apparel were among the relative losers. High-beta stocks and companies with a hitherto high tax burden benefited from the election. Although internationally-oriented companies may profit under some plans of the new administration, several other arguments suggest a more favorable climate for domestically-oriented companies. Investors have found the domestic-favoring arguments to be stronger. While investors incorporated the expected consequences of the election for US growth and tax policy into prices relatively quickly, it took them more time to digest the consequences of shifts in trade policy on firms’ prospects.
O24|The 'New Normal' of the Swiss Balance of Payments in a Global Perspective: Central Bank Intervention, Global Imbalances and the Rise of Sovereign Wealth Funds|Since the global financial crisis, the Swiss National Bank has been accumulating reserve assets amounting to the size of the Swiss GDP. Yet, the Swiss franc is still considered to be significantly over-valued. This paper analyzes the drivers behind the new situation and discusses challenges and opportunities for Swiss policy making, drawing on comparisons with other surplus countries. Our findings are fourfold. First, the recent upward pressure on the Swiss franc cannot be explained by safe haven effects alone, but has been driven by a pronounced decline in Swiss residents’ foreign investments. Second, other surplus countries typically purchase and manage significant amounts of foreign assets via central banks and sovereign wealth funds. Third, from a global perspective, such public intervention is subject to a mercantilist critique. Fourth, given the need to invest in the real economy to foster growth and avoid the present excess flushing of the financial system that boost asset prices in an insufficient productive way, we conclude that Switzerland should assess room for re-balancing and highlight the opportunity of building a Swiss sovereign wealth fund. This would be beneficial both for Swiss residents and for the world at large.
O24|A Sovereign Wealth Fund for Switzerland|Exchange rates are crucial variables for each economy as they affect the price at which a country can exchange goods and services with other currency areas. A strong domestic currency makes it relatively cheap to import goods and services, but at the same time renders domestic goods and services expensive for other currency holders. Export-oriented countries therefore tend to favour a relatively weak domestic currency. While exchange rates are usually market-determined, central banks have the possibility to weaken or strengthen them by purchasing or selling foreign currencies. Unsurprisingly, countries that export more than they import tend to witness interventions that weaken the domestic currency. Switzerland, a strongly export-oriented country, has seen such interventions since 2008 at a rapidly increasing pace. As a consequence, over the past 9 years, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has accumulated foreign reserves surpassing the value of the annual Swiss GDP. Despite this evolution lasting over almost a decade now, the SNB’s interventions were and are still continuing to be commonly perceived as a short-term measure to offset temporary upward pressures on the Swiss Franc. We challenge this ‘short-term’ view and argue that the pressures on the Swiss Franc are long-term in nature and hence require a long-term, optimised and sustainable intervention strategy: We propose to build a Swiss sovereign wealth fund.

O24|Trade diversification in Colombia, 1991-2011|In this paper we describe the evolution of international trade and the behaviour of export diversification in Colombia during the 1991-2011 period. In order to measure trade diversification and follow its behaviour throughout the period, we employ alternative ways of decomposing trade flows in their intensive and extensive margins, using the latter as a measure of diversification. The results indicate that trade diversification in Colombia is relatively limited, and seems to follow a pattern according to which exports are diversified mainly through increases in the number of products rather than in the number of partners. At the same time imports tend to diversify mainly by increases in the number of countries of origin rather than by the number of products. Furthermore, trade with upper middleincome countries seems to be an important driver of trade diversification. ***** En este artículo se describe la evolución del comercio internacional y el comportamiento de la diversificación de este en Colombia durante el período 1991-2011. Para la medición de la diversificación del comercio y su seguimiento, se emplean formas alternativas de descomponer el comercio en sus márgenes intensivo y extensivo, empleando estos últimos como medida de la diversificación. Los resultados indican que la diversificación del comercio es relativamente limitada y que parece seguir un patrón de acuerdo con el cual las exportaciones se diversifican principalmente mediante un mayor número de productos, mientras que las importaciones lo hacen principalmente a través de un mayor número de países de origen. Además, el crecimiento del comercio con países de ingresos medios altos parece ser un determinante de este patrón.
O24|Natural resource-seeking FDI inflows and current account deficits in commodity-producing developing economies|Natural resource-seeking foreign direct investment (FDI) rose substantially during the last two decades as global commodity prices soared. This type of FDI typically is expected to improve the current accounts of recipient countries. Notwithstanding the commodity boom, however, current account balances of many commodity-producing developing economies were negative during 1995–2013. Considering 31 commodity-producing countries, we find that the average net effect of a 1% increase in natural resource-seeking FDI was a 0.23% decline in the current account (measured as percentage of GDP). This surprising result can be explained by the repatriation of profits.
O24|Company stock price reactions to the 2016 election shock: Trump, taxes, and trade|Donald Trump's surprise election shifted expectations: corporate taxes would be lower and trade policies more restrictive. Relative stock prices responded appropriately. High-tax firms and those with large deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) gained; those with significant deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards (NOL DTAs) lost. Domestically focused companies fared better than internationally oriented firms. A price contribution analysis shows that easily assessed consequences (DTLs, NOL DTAs, tax rates) were priced faster than more complex issues (net DTLs, foreign exposure). In sum, the analysis demonstrates that expectations about tax rates greatly impact firm values.
O24|Trade policy and redistribution when preferences are non-homothetic|We compare redistribution through trade restrictions vs. domestic lump-sum transfers. When preferences are non-homothetic, even domestic lump-sum transfers affect relative prices. Thus, contrary to the conventional wisdom, domestic lump-sum transfers are not necessarily superior to distortionary trade policy. We develop this argument in the context of food export bans imposed by many developing countries in the late 2000s.
O24|Precaution Versus Mercantilism: Reserve Accumulation, Capital Controls, and the Real Exchange Rate|We document a new international stylized fact describing the relationship between real exchange rates and external asset holdings. Economists have long argued that the real exchange rate is associated with the net international investment position, appreciating as external wealth increases. This mechanism has been seen as central for international payments equilibrium and relative price adjustments. However, we argue that the effect of external assets held by the public sector—reserve accumulation—on real exchange rates may be quite different from that of privately held external assets, and that capital controls are a critical factor behind this difference. For 1975–2007, controlling for GDP per capita and the terms of trade, we find that a one percentage point increase in external assets relative to GDP (net of reserves) is related to an 0.24 percent real exchange rate appreciation. On the contrary, a one percentage point increase in reserve accumulation relative to GDP has virtually no effect on the real exchange rate in financially open countries (low capital controls), and is related to a 1.65 percent real exchange rate depreciation in financially closed countries (high capital controls). Results are stronger in developing countries and in more recent periods. Gross rather than net positions matter and we present a new theoretical model to account for the stylized fact. The framework encompasses so-called precautionary and mercantilist motives for reserve accumulation, and also explains how the optimal capital account policy—the mix of reserve accumulation and capital controls—is determined. Further empirical support arises from evidence that reserve accumulation is associated with a trade surplus, along with higher GDP and TFP growth in countries with high capital controls, findings that are consistent with the mechanisms of our model.
O24|Services trade policy and sustainable development|The realization of many of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) depends on bolstering the performance of services sectors and improving access to specific services in developing countries. We show that when the level of economic development or the quality of institutions is sufficiently high, openness to services trade and investment is positively related to access to financial, ICT and transport services – three activities that are inputs into several SDGs. An implication is that facilitating trade and investment in services may help realize SDGs that depend on the performance of services sectors. In the absence of comparable cross-country panel data on services trade policies, country-specific analyses are needed to better understand the specific channels through which services trade policies impact on SDGs.
O24|The Impact of Trade on Inequality in Developing Countries|This paper assesses the current state of evidence on how international trade shapes inequality and poverty through its influence on earnings and employment opportunities. While the focus is mainly on developing countries, in part because we have more evidence in that context, the discussion draws parallels to the empirical evidence from developed countries. The paper also discusses perceptions about international trade in over 40 countries at different levels of development, including perceptions on trade’s overall benefits for the economy, trade’s effect on the livelihood of workers through wages and jobs, and trade’s contribution to inequality. The paper concludes with a survey of evidence on several policies that could mitigate the adverse effects of import competition.
O24|FDI and inequality in Vietnam: An approach with census data|We investigate the effects of inward FDI on income distribution and absolute living standards in Vietnam using census data from 1989 to 2009. We compute the number of employees of foreign establishments in each of Vietnam's provinces for each year, and use that as a measure of local FDI. We estimate the effects of FDI on local households’ living standards as reported in the data, broken down by educational background to allow us to analyze effects on inequality. Estimates based on the repeated cross section indicate that rising FDI in a province is associated with a slight decline in living standards for households there if they do not have a member employed by the foreign enterprises, with only modest gains for households who do have a member employed by the foreign enterprises. These estimates may reflect composition effects, however, since we find large movements of people toward the provinces receiving the FDI. The findings show that measuring the effect of FDI on household welfare is more difficult than measuring the effect of trade policy, and may pose a difficulty for the view of FDI as a general anti-poverty strategy.
O24|Global Productions Sharing and Local Entrepreneurship in Developing Countries: Evidence from Penang Export Hub, Malaysia|This article examines opportunities and policy options for developing countries to promote engagement of local firms in global production networks. The article begins with a stage-setting overview of the ongoing process of global production sharing and the emerging opportunities local firm's engagement. It then undertakes an illustrative case study of the export hub in the state of Penang in Malaysia. Forging operational links between multinational enterprises, which set up assembly plants in Penang, and local firms was an integral part of the export-led development strategy of the state. This policy emphasis was instrumental in fostering a domestic supplier network around the operations of the multinational enterprise subsidiaries. A number of local firms, which emerged de novo through production sharing, have become global players in their own right, with production bases in a number of other countries.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O24|Crecimiento económico y productividad en Latinoamérica. El proyecto LA-KLEMS|Background: The purpose of this article is to analyze economic growth, productivity and its determinants in five countries in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico) during the period 1990-2010. This analysis applies to the aggregate economy as well as to nine economic sectors. Methods. A new database, LA-KLEMS, is used that will serve as a fundamental tool for empirical and theoretical research in the area of economic growth and productivity for Latin America. The variables are organized around the growth accounting methodology, which provides a clear conceptual framework for consistent analysis of interaction between the variables. The LA-KLEMS figures highlight discrepancies between countries and give a new perspective to understand how the series evolve over time. Results. Results show that the sluggish economic growth is basically driven by the negative contribution of total factor productivity (TFP) in all countries and in almost all sectors, despite the investment efforts made in the last 20 years. Latin American countries face a genuine problem of productivity, as the shift-share analysis shows. Conclusions. The problems of TFP are common to all industries and do not seem to be driven by structural change, that is the reallocation of resources from low to high productive industries.// Antecedentes. El objetivo de este artículo es analizar el crecimiento económico, la productividad y sus determinantes en cinco países de América Latina (Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Colombia y México) durante el periodo 1990-2010. Este análisis se aplica tanto a la economía agregada como a nueve sectores de actividad económica. Metodología. Se utiliza una nueva base de datos, LA-KLEMS, que servirá como herramienta fundamental para la investigación empírica y teórica en el área de crecimiento económico y productividad para América Latina. Las variables se organizan en torno a la metodología de contabilidad del crecimiento, que proporciona un marco conceptual claro para el análisis coherente de la interacción entre las variables. Las cifras de LA-KLEMS ponen de relieve las discrepancias entre los países y dan una nueva perspectiva para entender cómo evolucionan las series con el tiempo. Resultados. Los resultados muestran que el lento crecimiento económico se debe básicamente a la contribución negativa de la productividad total de los factores (PTF) en todos los países y en casi todos los sectores, a pesar de los esfuerzos de inversión realizados en los últimos 20 años. Los países latinoamericanos se enfrentan a un auténtico problema de productividad, como muestra el shift-share análisis. Conclusiones. Los problemas de la PTF son comunes a todos los sectores de actividad económica y no parecen estar impulsados por el cambio estructural, es decir, la reasignación de recursos de industrias de baja a alta productividad.
O24|Re-Opening the Silk Road to Transform Chinese Trade|Under anti-globalization and isolationism, China is seeking to portray itself as a new leader for globalization under the banner of the Silk Road initiative. Meanwhile, China’s traditional and comparatively advantaged industry, silk, has faced dire predicaments and challenges for long time, and needs a transformation in terms of initiatives. Throughout history, the prosperity arising from silk was supposed to represent a microcosm of Chinese society. This paper searches the breakthrough point to improve the current dilemma of Chinese silk enterprises; uses a Case Study for inductive reasoning that is feasible for marketing strategies; and provides a strategy to help Chinese silk enterprises to transform their market positioning and operating modes to obtain better development opportunities. The paper also analyzes the new external environment based on the “One Belt, One Road” principle, which is of crucial importance for the implementation of new marketing strategies..
O24|Differential impacts of currency undervaluation on growth and exports in natural resource vs. manufacturing exporting countries|In the existing literature, we find a huge debate on the impact of exchange rate undervaluation (depreciation) on growth and exports. Some argue that undervaluation has positive effects on growth, especially in the case of developing countries. However there is ample criticism against the undervaluation leads to growth argument as well. The critics argue that large undervaluation discourages investment and in fact may lead to negative economic growth. Our premise is that the impact of currency undervaluation (overvaluation) would be different in countries with different exports structure, particularly between manufacturing vs. mineral exporting countries. This paper aims to analyze the differential impact of exchange rate undervaluation on growth and exports in different countries. We consider two sets of countries in our dataset-18 countries are included in manufactures- exporting sample while 16 countries are included in the minerals-exporting sample; Countries included in the former group have at least 70 percent share of manufactured products in total exports in 2010; while those in the latter contribute to more than 40 percent in total exports. This paper uses a cross sectional panel analysis using both five years average data and one year average data; pooled OLS, panel fixed effects, random effects estimations. It controls for the endogeneity problem by using a system generalized method of moments estimations. Estimation results of our study suggest currency overvaluation is good for mineral resource exporting countries. Moreover, results show a negative impact of undervaluation on growth and exports in both the long-run and the short-run for mineral and manufacture exporting countries. At the same time, negative coefficients on share of mineral exports on growth and exports implies the need of export diversification in many Latin American countries and Africa.
O24|Trade liberalization and child mortality: A Synthetic Control Method|We study the effect of trade liberalization on child mortality using data from emerging and developing countries over the 1960–2010 period. To capture possible heterogeneity of effects, we use the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) for comparative case studies. The SCM allows to compare the trajectory of post-reform health outcomes of treated countries (those which experienced trade liberalization) with the trajectory of a combination of similar but untreated countries. On average, trade liberalization significantly reduced child mortality. The average reduction is around 9% ten years after the liberalization. But there is significant heterogeneity in the impact. For the cases for which the SCM could provide a reliable counterfactual, trade liberalization significantly reduced child mortality in approximately half the cases. In most other cases there was no significant effect. In the majority of the significant cases, the reduction in child mortality was more than 20%. On average, trade liberalization reduced child mortality more (a) in democracies compared to autocracies, (b) when incomes were higher and (c) when it reduced taxation of farmers.
O24|Trade Related Institutions and Development|The paper focuses on the role played by Trade Related Institutions (TRIs) in shaping trade flows and their development impact in low-income countries and how these TRIs are shaped by international trade. Three types of TRIs are examined: i) trade agreements; ii) trade promotion organizations; and iii) private TRIs, i.e. fair trade labelling, trading platforms and reputation mechanisms. Recent research reviewed for each type of TRI is then followed by suggestions for further work.

O24|Export Tax Rebates and Resource Misallocation: Evidence from a Large Developing Countr|The export tax rebate (ETR) policy is one of the most frequently used policy instruments by Chinese policy makers. This paper therefore provides a vital analysis of its allocation effects. To motivate our empirical analysis for the allocation effects of the ETR policy, we first add a tax rebate to the Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) model and examine the impact of this policy on firms' markup size and resource allocation between eligible and non-eligible firms for the rebates. We use customs transactions, tax administration, and firm-level data to measure the effect of variation in export tax rebates, taking advantage of the large policy change in 2004. A difference-indifference approach allows us to compare the production and pricing decisions of eligible versus non-eligible firms and the distributional implications. We find that an increase in tax rebates shifts production to eligible firms and that tax rebates increase allocative efficiency.
O24|Markups, Markets Imperfections, and Trade Openness: Evidence from Ghana|This paper investigates the impact of Ghanaâ€™s WTO accession on firm-level product and labour market imperfections. We exploit a rich dataset of firm-level information to estimate both markups and the degree of monopsony power enjoyed by manufacturing firms. Results suggest that price-cost margins declined, while the degree of monopsony power increased in the wake of WTO accession. These diverging dynamics suggests that firms compress real wages to offset loss of market power in the product market due to increased international competition. This results in an increase of the market imperfection gap, which gradually erodes the pro-competitive gains from trade. The paper contributes to the literature by identifying channels through which allocative inefficiencies and misallocation can persist even after trade liberalisation.
O24|Which Antidumping Cases Reach the WTO?|This article examines the distribution of antidumping (AD) disputes across countries and industries, and examines which AD cases reach the dispute settlement system of the WTO. Our general finding is that neither the country nor the industry distribution of AD cases remains constant across the different levels of disputes, as cases proceed from notifications to requests for consultations and third party adjudication at the WTO. The US is the main user of AD measures, as well as the main target for complaints at the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body. However, emerging markets have increasingly started using AD law to protect their domestic firms. We find that the typical AD notification is submitted by an upper middle-income country, and it focuses on a medium low-technology industry with differentiated products, but low relationship-specificity. The most typical complainant at the WTO is also an upper middle-income country, challenging a high-income country (most likely the US) that is allegedly giving unfair protection to an industry producing differentiated goods that are not very relationship-specific, using medium-low technologies. The analysis also reveals that when lower middle-income countries are challenged at the WTO, disputes are often resolved before third party adjudication is needed.
O24|Predicting exchange rates in Asia: New insights on the accuracy of survey forecasts|This paper evaluates aggregated survey forecasts with forecast horizons of 3, 12, and 24 months for the exchange rates of the Chinese yuan, the Hong Kong dollar, the Japanese yen, and the Singapore dollar vis-à-vis the US dollar using common forecast accuracy measures. Additionally, the rationality of the exchange rate predictions are assessed utilizing tests for unbiasedness and efficiency. All investigated forecasts are irrational in the sense that the predictions are biased. However, these results are inconsistent with an alternative measure of rationality based on methods of applied time series analysis. Investigating the order of integration of the time series and using cointegration analysis, empirical evidence supports the conclusion that the majority of forecasts are rational. Regarding forerunning properties of the predictions, the results are less convincing, with shorter term forecasts for the tightly managed USD/CNY FX regime being one exception. As one important evaluation result, it can be concluded, that the currency regime matters for the quality of exchange rate forecasts.
O24|Neocolonialism or Balanced Partnership? Reframing Agricultural Relations Between the EU and Africa|The media narratives with respect to EU external policies and their effects on developing countries generally paint a picture of unequal power dynamics and negative externalities, particularly with respect to international trade and land grabbing. In this paper, I use trade data to argue that reality is more nuanced and aim to provide a preliminary sketch of the institutional dynamics between the EU and Africa. I focus on agricultural relationships to highlight the interplay between historical path dependencies, colonialism, trade policy and domestic institutions on the EU and African side. While trade is often portrayed in an overly simplified manner as the main factor hindering agricultural development, African countries are often plagued by a long history of extractive institutions, both politically and economically, which lead to a vicious cycle of unequally distributed resources, exploitation, insecure human rights and a lack of incentives for innovation. This becomes apparent when examining phenomena such as land-grabbing, which often involve African elites partnering with foreign investors to conclude controversial deals. Overall, this paper aims to highlight the necessity of building institutional capacity particularly in countries with a long history of extractive institutional continuity, and to underline the importance of state centralisation for agricultural development, so that African partners can fully take advantage of the preferential trade regime with the EU and improve their position with respect to power dynamics.
O24|The revised WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA): Key design features and significance for global trade and development|"The WTO's plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement (""the GPA"" or ""the Agreement"") is an important ongoing success story for the Organization. In March 2012, the GPA Parties completed a comprehensive revision of the Agreement, encompassing both its text and coverage (market access commitments). The revised GPA, the negotiating processes that led to its adoption and coming into force, and the continuing gradual broadening of its membership are of therefore interest for the evolution of the international trading system. The GPA's successful renegotiation, the continuing growth of its membership and its vitality as an instrument of public policy were not achieved through happenstance. The paper discusses a number of specific design features of the GPA that clearly facilitated the successful conclusion of the renegotiation and that, as such, may in the future be relevant to other areas of global trade liberalization. In addition to the Agreement's plurilateral nature, of particular interest are the approach taken with respect to application of the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle in the Agreement; the GPA's continuing strong emphasis on principles of reciprocity in market access concessions; and its approach to special and differential treatment for developing countries, in all of which it differs from approaches that are widely used in other WTO Agreements. Apart from the above, the GPA revision is important for the merging of trade and good governance concerns that it exemplifies. As discussed in the paper, the themes of governance and the sound management of public resources that are treated in the revised Agreement were not afterthoughts to the renegotiation; rather, they permeated the revised text and received focused attention from the Parties in their own right. As well, the GPA has direct implications for investment policy and for domestic economic reforms, and is an important tool of e-commerce. And, the revision has made possible very significant synergies between the GPA and other international instruments and activities in reducing barriers to participation and strengthening governance in public procurement markets. For all these reasons, the revised Agreement is likely to have a wider impact than meets the eye, and well merits the support and attention that it has received from the participating WTO Member governments."
O24|Trade Facilitation And Customs Control: An Examination Of Main Customs Of Baja California, Facilitacion Comercial Y Control Aduanero En Las Principales Aduanas De Baja California|General Management Customs in Mexico plays a pivotal role in international trade, given the rise of globalization in which economies are increasingly interconnected. A balance between trade facilitation and customs control are essential for a good external performance. The Customs Modernization Plan 2007-2012, defined three strategies: more efficient customs operations, increase compliance with the obligations of trade and national security. The aim of this paper is to review implementation of the main customs of Baja California, according to “Customs Modernization Plan 2007-2012. We wish to understand the balance between the trade facilitation and the customs control. Nine interviews were completed, three experts in customs matters, three operating sub-managers and the three brokers associations in Ensenada, Tijuana and Mexicali. We conclude that the Customs Modernization Plan 2007-2012 has not yet fully developed, Continuous changes are required since offenders are continually updated so they can insert o removed smuggled items into the country
O24|Avian influenza, nontariff measures, and the poultry exports in the global value chain|This paper focuses on the direct impact of avian influenza outbreaks and the impact of the consequent nontariff measures on the international poultry trade in the Global Value Chain Context. Using monthly export data regarding China and its 122 poultry importing countries, a random-effect gravity model is adopted. The research analysis distinguishes between “agri-food goods” (mostly uncooked poultry products) and “processed goods” (mostly cooked poultry products) to understand the trade in global value chain. The results show that domestic avian influenza outbreaks have a large and significant negative impact on a country’s poultry imports compared with such outbreaks in exporting countries. Moreover, nontariff measures induced by avian influenza reduce the uncooked poultry trade but increase the cooked poultry trade temporarily. The results also imply that developing countries that attempt to participate in the global agri-food value chain to access developed countries’ markets should increase and enhance processed food production for more-value adding and competiveness.
O24|Current issues on the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)|The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) has successfully supported for the sub-Saharan countries to achieve trade-led economic development on one hand, it has been criticized for the limited method for selecting beneficiaries and its legal instability. After the AGOA was renewed for another ten years in 2015, African countries are facing the new challenges such as AGOA reciprocation and the out-of-cycle eligibility review. Based on the active discussions in the AGOA Forum in 2015 and 2016, this paper examines the future potential structures that are most appropriate for U.S.–African trade and investment relationship.
O24|Spatial price transmission and trade policies: new evidence for agricultural products from selected sub-Saharan African countries with high frequency data|We assess the conjunctural impact of price insulating policies on spatial price transmission of maize, rice and wheat in Cameroon, Kenya and Tanzania in the period 2005-2015. We therefore separately estimate the impact of trade policies within two regimes of behaviour of the domestic price series: the first regime with an increasing trend of domestic prices and the second regime with a decreasing trend. We find a significant impact of trade policies in both price regimes. This is however much larger if prices are increasing. Our results show that trade policies were able to insulate the three analyzed countries from the price shocks on international markets during the food price spike crisis 2007/2008. Although the impact of these policy instruments proved to be relevant as a counter-cyclical measure during the food price spike crisis, these policies cannot be regarded as structural long-term solutions. This paper extends the existing literature on spatial price transmission in agricultural markets by estimating the impact of tariff and non-tariff trade policies using monthly data. Employing monthly data allows for a more precise assessment of short-lived movements in the analysed series, which could disappear due to a time aggregation bias at lower yearly frequencies. While monthly price series are provided in the GIEWS database, we obtain monthly ad-valorem equivalent tariff rates by a time disaggregation of the yearly effectively applied weighted average tariff rate from the WITS/UNCTAD-TRAINS database through the monthly trade policies from the FAO-FADPA. By presenting high frequency analyses and techniques that are able to detect non-linearities in the Data Generating Process (DGP), this study provides results which differ from what is stated in the standard literature (Anderson and Nelgen, 2012a) (Anderson and Nelgen, 2012b) (Anderson and Nelgen, 2012c).
O24|Modeling the Volatility of Exchange Rates: GARCH Models|The modeling of the dynamics of the exchange rate at a long time remains a financial and economic research center. In our research we tried to study the relationship between the evolution of exchange rates and macroeconomic fundamentals. Our empirical study is based on a series of exchange rates for the Tunisian dinar against three currencies of major trading partners (dollar, euro, yen) and fundamentals (the terms of trade, the inflation rate, the interest rate differential), of monthly data, from jan 2000 to dec-2014, for the case of the Tunisia. We have adopted models of conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH, GARCH, EGARCH, TGARCH). The results indicate that there is a partial relationship between the evolution of the Tunisian dinar exchange rates and macroeconomic variables.
O24|Company Stock Reactions to the 2016 Election Shock: Trump, Taxes and Trade|The election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th President of the United States of America on 11/8/2016 came as a surprise. Markets responded swiftly and decisively. This note investigates both the initial stock market reaction to the election, and the longer-term reaction through the end of 2016. We find that the individual stock price reactions to the election--that is, the market's vote--reflect investor expectations on economic growth, taxes, and trade policy. Heavy industry and banking were relative winners, whereas healthcare, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and apparel were among the relative losers. High-beta stocks and companies with a hitherto high tax burden benefited from the election. Although internationally-oriented companies may profit under some plans of the new administration, several other arguments suggest a more favorable climate for domestically-oriented companies. Investors have found the domestic-favoring arguments to be stronger. While investors incorporated the expected consequences of the election for US growth and tax policy into prices relatively quickly, it took them more time to digest the consequences of shifts in trade policy on firms' prospects.
O24|Precaution Versus Mercantilism: Reserve Accumulation, Capital Controls, and the Real Exchange Rate|We document a new international stylized fact describing the relationship between real exchange rates and external asset holdings. Economists have long argued that the real exchange rate is associated with the net international investment position, appreciating as external wealth increases. This mechanism has been seen as central for international payments equilibrium and relative price adjustments. However, we argue that the effect of external assets held by the public sector -reserve accumulation- on real exchange rates may be quite different from that of privately held external assets, and that capital controls are a critical factor behind this difference. For 1975-2007, controlling for GDP per capita and the terms of trade, we find that a one percentage point increase in external assets relative to GDP (net of reserves) is related to an 0.24 percent real exchange rate appreciation. On the contrary, a one percentage point increase in reserve accumulation relative to GDP has virtually no effect on the real exchange rate in financially open countries (low capital controls), and is related to a 1.65 percent real exchange rate depreciation in financially closed countries (high capital controls). Results are stronger in developing countries and in more recent periods. Gross rather than net positions matter and we present a new theoretical model to account for the stylized fact. The framework encompasses so-called precautionary and mercantilist motives for reserve accumulation, and also explains how the optimal capital account policy -the mix of reserve accumulation and capital controls- is determined. Further empirical support arises from evidence that reserve accumulation is associated with a trade surplus, along with higher GDP and TFP growth in countries with high capital controls, findings that are consistent with the mechanisms of our model.
O24|Real exchange rate policies for economic development|This paper analyzes the role of real exchange rate (RER) policies in promoting economic development. Markets provide a suboptimal amount of investment in sectors characterized by learning spillovers. We show that a stable and competitive RER policy may correct for this externality and other related market failures. The resulting development of these sectors leads to overall faster economic growth. A system of effectively multiple exchange rates is required when spillovers across different tradable sectors differ. The impact of RER policies is increased when they are complemented by traditional industrial policies that increase the elasticity of the aggregate supply to the RER. Among the instruments required to implement a stable and competitive RER are interventions in the foreign exchange market and regulation of capital flows. We also discuss the trade-offs associated with alternative stable and competitive RER policies and the relationship between the use of exchange rate policies for macro-stability and for development.
O24|The Impact of Trade on Inequality in Developing Countries|This paper assesses the current state of evidence on how international trade shapes inequality and poverty through its influence on earnings and employment opportunities. While the focus is mainly on developing countries, in part because we have more evidence in that context, the discussion draws parallels to the empirical evidence from developed countries. The paper also discusses perceptions about international trade in over 40 countries at different levels of development, including perceptions on trade's overall benefits for the economy, trade's effect on the livelihood of workers through wages and jobs, and trade's contribution to inequality. The paper concludes with a survey of evidence on several policies that could mitigate the adverse effects of import competition.
O24|Exchange rate regime: Perspectives of transformation|The article deals with the issues of international monetary system reforming. The paper regards an adoption of a new exchange rate system as the key element of the reforming process. This adoption requires not only economic backgrounds but also political will in the countries involved.
O24|Exchange Rate Effects on Agricultural Exports: Firm-level Evidence from Pakistan|This article uses a novel dataset from Pakistan for the recent period (2000–2013) to examine the effects of domestic currency depreciation on agricultural exports and investigate various channels of influence. It conducts an integrated analysis of prices and quantities, together with firm-level trade flows, by using the exchange rates of the actual currencies of invoicing at the transaction level. The study finds that exchange rate movement positively affects both intensive and extensive margins (IM and EM). The increase in the IM operates mainly through the channel of prices, whereas the response of quantities is relatively smaller. Moreover, depreciation improves the EM of firms and products and expands the client base within existing markets. These responses vary widely across products, markets, exporting experience, exchange rate regimes and invoicing currencies.
O24|Emerging providers’ international co-operation for development|This paper shows that development co-operation from emerging providers – i.e. countries beyond the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) – significantly increased in recent years, reaching 17% of total global development co-operation in 2014. It also presents a rough estimate, of USD 300 billion, of broader international co-operation by emerging providers and it sets out what types of instruments are used to provide this broader international co-operation.Very little is known about broader international co-operation by emerging providers and the scarce information that is available on different countries cannot be compared. This paper concludes that more information on, and a global measure of, international co-operation for development are needed to enable developing countries to manage the external support they receive and to enable further analysis of the increasingly important role that emerging providers play in developing countries.
O24|Boosting productivity in Mexico through integration into global value chains|Mexico’s structural reforms are already boosting productivity, but more can be done. This paper focuses on issues that have led to the success of the “modern” Mexico, and have led to difficulties with the “traditional” Mexico. These include the success of Global Value Chains (GVCs) in advancing the trade integration and linkages of key sectors, as well as how competition problems, excessive local regulation, and weak legal institutions have led to misallocation across firms. This paper examines in particular Mexico’s successful integration into GVCs. OECD research suggests that GVC participation can bring economic benefits in terms of productivity, diversification and sophistication of production. Understanding what drives integration into GVCs provides policy guidance to support a wider integration.
O24|Financial Inclusion and Women Entrepreneurship: Evidence from Mexico|Financial inclusion and women entrepreneurship concern policymakers because of their impact on job creation, economic growth and women empowerment. Women in Mexico do engage in paid work but many of them work in the informal sector because they lack opportunities to work in the formal sector. Moreover, financial exclusion rate in Mexico remains the highest amongst OECD countries, affecting women in particular. This paper uses an individual-based panel dataset over the period 2009-2015 to examine the determinants of women entrepreneurship in Mexico and to determine the relationship between women entrepreneurship and financial inclusion across informal and formal work and across economic sectors. The results suggest that financial inclusion is positively linked with entrepreneurship and it can open up economic opportunities for women entrepreneurs. Various financial access points like banking branches, POS terminals, banking agents, ATMs and microfinance banks can be a gateway to the use of additional financial services which can allow businesses development through access to credit facilities. However, the positive relationship between women entrepreneurship and financial inclusion does not hold for women entrepreneurs working in the informal sector or women working in the commerce sector, highlighting lower entry barriers, including financial, in the informal sector and problems pertaining to financial illiteracy. Results also highlight that the probability of a women being an entrepreneur in the informal sector is higher than in the formal sector. Education, age, income, marital status (married or divorced), and income level at the municipality level are amongst other significant determinants which are positively linked with women entrepreneurship. The results also highlight the existence of gender disparity in the status of entrepreneurship across formal and informal work in Mexico. On average, women are about 56% less likely to be entrepreneurs in the formal sector and 63% more likely to be entrepreneurs in the informal sector, as compared to men, after taking into account other relevant individual and municipality level characteristics that are important in explaining entrepreneurship.
O24|Improving productivity in New Zealand's economy|New Zealand ranks highly on most indicators of well-being, but incomes are below the OECD average due to low labour productivity. Low labour productivity is only partly explained by the industry composition of the NZ economy and is primarily a consequence of sustained low multi-factor productivity growth within industries, as well as weak investment. Economic geography is an important factor in New Zealand’s poor productivity performance, as the small size and remoteness of the economy diminish its access to global markets, the scale and efficiency of domestic businesses, the level of competition, and the ability to benefit from innovation at the global frontier. Policy and institutions are generally supportive of productivity growth, but there are a number of areas where there is scope for reforms that would help offset the country’s geographical disadvantages and improve the welfare of New Zealanders over the coming decades. This includes promoting international connections, removing barriers to fixed capital investment (including taxation), accessing benefits from agglomeration by improving urban planning and infrastructure provision, enhancing competition and increasing investment in innovation and intangibles. This Working Paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of New Zealand (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-new-zealand.htm).
O24|Reigniting growth through productivity-enhancing reforms in Colombia|Over the past decade, sound macroeconomic policies and an improved business environment have helped generate relatively strong GDP growth. Investments in infrastructure are improving connectivity and trade integration has been facilitated by lower tariffs. Simplification in opening of businesses, getting construction permits, registering property and payment of taxes improved the ease of doing business. Nevertheless, labour productivity remains low with large differences between firms and regions, and the contribution of technological progress to growth has been negative in recent years. Low productivity growth reflects poor educational and managerial quality, still large infrastructure gaps, low investment in innovation and R&D and stringent regulations in some sectors. To raise productivity growth Colombia should focus on some key areas. First, reverse the drop in public investment and reduce high transport and logistics costs. Second, intensify trade links and participation in GVCs, by further improving trade facilitation, to encourage firms to adopt the best technologies and know how. Third, create better incentives for firms to invest on R&D, and strengthen the links between the business sector and research institutions to foster innovation. Fourth, increase competition and reduce regulation in specific sectors to promote investment and facilitate the allocation of resources towards most productive firms. And fifth, upgrade the quality of education to develop better skills and professional management to enhance the creation and diffusion of new technologies. In 2016, the government established the National Policy for Productive Development to address the impediments to increased productivity. This Working Paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of Colombia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-colombia.htm)
O24|Getting the most out of trade in Estonia|Estonia is highly integrated into the global trade system: it exports approximately 80% of GDP and around half of domestic employment is sustained by foreign demand. Given that international trade and foreign direct investment are considered as major channels of technology diffusion and productivity growth, this bodes well for reviving income convergence. To capitalize on the country’s high trade intensity, policymakers need to remove remaining trade barriers and improve policies fostering knowledge diffusion as well as talent retention and attraction. At the same time, to ensure that benefits of more trade are shared across the population, the social safety net should be bolstered, and participation in upskilling programmes and their labour-market relevance increased. This Working Paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of New Zealand (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-estonia.htm).
O24|Deepening regional integration within the Southern African development community|Deepening regional integration within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) will raise potential growth for all member countries. Integrated economies will increase market size, trade opportunities and improve resource allocation across member countries. Key pillars of functioning regional integration are the free circulation of goods and services, mobility of workers and interconnected infrastructure. To boost regional integration, remaining tariff barriers and non-tariffs barriers should be removed. Ensuring greater compliance to agreements by SADC members will also facilitate intra-regional trade and cross-investments. More co-operation between competition authorities should facilitate harmonisation of competition rules in particular in services and transport-related services which would ease circulation of good and services. The other key pillars of regional integration (industrial policy, infrastructure, investment, financial integration and tax) are also reviewed.
O24|Local content policies in mineral-exporting countries|Resource abundance does not always bring sustained economic growth and development. Moreover, the mining sector generally provides little direct employment in the regions where extraction occurs. In an attempt to derive greater benefits from their resource endowments, and increase linkages with other parts of the economy, some minerals-rich countries have instituted local content and procurement policies (LCPs). The benefits sought include employment generation, supply chain development and technological and knowledge transfers. Measures that aim to increase local content and procurement in the extractive industries are common, including in many OECD countries.This study examines local content policies in 10 minerals-rich countries and provides some observations about their efficacy and the desirability of their use. A wide range of measures are examined, from industry-wide, mandatory quantitative targets to voluntary initiatives undertaken at the firm level, encompassing diverse policy objectives and implementation strategies. The range of countries covered is broad including OECD countries, developing countries and least developed countries. The study does not recommend a “one size fits all” policy mix but guards against the distortions created by overly prescriptive, mandatory local content requirements.
O24|Measuring Trade Costs and Gains from Trade Facilitation in the Philippines|This paper provides estimates of trade costs of the Philippines with her key trading partners, and develops a framework for assessing their welfare cost. With tariff restrictions reduced significantly following several rounds of multilateral and regional trade negotiations, non-tariff barriers (NTBs) have emerged as key in slowing down trade flows. Given the proliferation of NTMs in the world today, chances are some of those are disguised NTBs. More importantly however, the inefficiencies associated with implementing legitimate NTMs such as the SPS on agricultural imports become unnecessary barriers to trade. This is the fat in trade costs that need to be eliminated through trade facilitation, while policy reforms would have to deal with redundant NTMs, whose claim to resources adds to the cost imposed by inefficient implementation of legitimate NTMs. This paper came up with a CGE model analytical structure for assessing the gains of lowering trade costs.
O24|On development paths minimizing the structural change costs in the three-sector framework and an application to structural policy|Structural change is associated with high costs for the economy and the society ranging from environmental pollution to unemployment. We focus on the three-sector framework (related to agriculture, manufacturing and services) and assume that the structural change costs increase with the strength of structural change. We show that monotonous structural change paths are minimizing the structural change costs in this framework. By using this result and the (qualitative) stylized facts of structural change based on the theoretical and empirical literature consensus, we derive the cost-minimizing strategy for a developing country. We use these results to discuss some well-known structural/trade strategies.
O24|Implications of Brexit to the Asia-Pacific region: with a focus on least developed countries|Brexit might affect exports of some countries in the Asia-Pacific region disproportionately more than others. Simulation results, under different Brexit scenarios, show that the potential reduction in trade faced by least developed countries (LDCs) of the region can range from 16% to 50% of their current export value to the UK in key sectors such as fish, clothes, textiles and footwear. Simulations also show that it is the larger developing countries from the region that would benefit from any trade diversion that ensues in these sectors. Countries with higher exposure to Brexit induced risks need to engage in deeper analyses of the extent of such impacts and brace themselves for proactive discussions with the UK in order to limit negative impacts.
O24|Indonesia towards 2030 and beyond: A Long-Run International Trade Foresight|One of the most important variables in the emerging economies like Indonesia is the stability of the exchange rate. Unstable exchange rates make it almost impossible for all business ventures to plan the business. The higher the depreciation of the Rupiah the higher the inflation rate and this will decrease people's purchasing power. In the balance of payments, the stability of the exchange rate and capital account are strongly influenced by the current account balance. A study found that in Indonesia, in the long run (Johansen Procedure) Indonesia current account balance affects the real exchange rate while in the short run (VECM) it affects the nominal exchange rate. The study also found that in the current account balance the one that affecting the exchange rate is the trade balance. Indonesia's trade balance relies on a surplus of trade in goods, especially agricultural products, petroleum and gas. The price of products in the primary sector is very vulnerable because of the volatility of primary products due to that of world’s oil and gas price. Indonesia's current account balance is highly dependent on manufacturing product trade. Another study found that in real-world, manufacturing trade influences more the capital flows than vice versa. Therefore, in order to maintain a positive long-term economic growth and stable exchange rate, Indonesia must increase its trade competitiveness, especially in the manufacturing sector. This paper will explore the challenges and opportunities of international trade in Indonesia towards 2030 and afterwards.
O24|Private and Public Health Investment Decisions|In recent years, there has been an explosive increase in the demand for health products and services by people all around the globe, and particularly in advanced economies. Aiming to enhance longevity but also improve quality of life, individual consumption of pharmaceutical products and services has risen exponentially since the early 1980s. This paper develops a model in which agents invest part of their resources in medical products and time in physical exercise to enhance their health status. In the first part of the paper, we study the steady state and transitional dynamics of the model with special emphasis on the effects of health decisions on aggregate outcomes. In the second part, we explore how public health policies may alter private economic decisions that promote healthier and more productive lives.
O24|Trade Openness and Political Distortions|In this paper we explore the relationship between international trade openness and two major political distortions, political polarization and political instability. We consider the extensive and intensive margins of trade as measured by the number of trade partners and trade volume, respectively. As political distortions and trade characteristics of the country are endogenously related, we instrument political instability by the age difference between the youngest and the oldest effective political leaders of a country and the average neighbors' neighbors political instability. We find that political instability reduces trade openness at the extensive and intensive margin while political polarization negatively affects the extensive margin of trade. We propose a simple model that provides intuition on our findings.
O24|Агропродовольственный Рынок Региона: Классификация Институтов, Административные Барьеры, Трансакционные Издержки, Неэффективные Посредники<BR>[The region's agro-food market: the classification of institutions, administrative barriers, transaction costs, ineffective intermediaries]|The paper examines the scientific basis for the development of the institutional structure at the national and regional levels. The materials of the region classified the market institutions, assessed their development, identified the main socio-economic problems that require solutions. The concept of improving the institutional structure of the regional agri-food market is proposed, which includes reduction of transaction costs due to administrative barriers and a reduction in the number of inefficient intermediaries. The possibility of using cluster formations of the region as tools through which state authorities and local self-government can regulate interaction between different groups of market institutions is considered. The specialty of economics and management at the enterprise (by branches), employees of regional government bodies, market research specialists, researchers, teachers and students of agrarian universities is addressed to teachers and students of universities.
O24|Neocolonialism or Balanced Partnership? Reframing Agricultural Relations Between the EU and Africa|The narratives in the media with respect to EU external policies and their effects on developing countries generally paint a picture of unequal power dynamics and negative externalities, particularly with respect to international trade and land grabbing. In this paper, I use trade data to argue that reality is more nuanced and aim to provide a preliminary sketch of the institutional dynamics between the EU and Africa. I focus on agricultural relationships to highlight the interplay between historical path dependencies, colonialism, trade policy and domestic institutions on the EU and African side. While trade is often portrayed in an overly simplified manner as the main factor hindering agricultural development, African countries are often plagued by a long history of extractive institutions, both politically and economically, which lead to a vicious cycle of unequally distributed resources, exploitation, insecure human rights and a lack of incentives for innovation. This becomes apparent when examining phenomena such as land-grabbing, which often involve African elites partnering with foreign investors to conclude controversial deals. Overall, this paper aims to highlight the necessity of building institutional capacity particularly in countries with a long history of extractive institutional continuity, and to underline the importance of state centralisation for agricultural development, so that African partners can fully take advantage of the preferential trade regime with the EU and improve their position with respect to power dynamics.
O24|Potencjał eksportowy przedsiębiorstw w Małopolsce<BR>[Export potential of enterprises in Małopolska]|Niniejszy raport stanowi diagnozę sytuacji w handlu zagranicznym w Małopolsce i Polsce w roku 2015. Jest on kontynuacją badań handlu zagranicznego, które były realizowane przez Małopolskie Obserwatorium Gospodarki, działające w ramach Urzędu Marszałkowskiego Województwa Małopolskiego. Opracowanie przedstawia wybrane obszary handlu zagranicznego Małopolski w porównaniu do innych województw Polski, jak również pogłębioną analizę wymiany handlowej. This report is a diagnosis of the situation in foreign trade in Małopolska and Poland in 2015. It is a continuation of foreign trade research, which were carried out by the Małopolska Obserwatorium Gospodarki, operating within the Marshal's Office of the Małopolska Voivodship. The study presents selected areas of foreign trade of Małopolska in comparison to other Polish voivodships, as well as an in-depth analysis of trade exchange.
O24|Инфраструктура Агропродовольственного Рынка Пригородной Зоны Столицы Казахстана: Институциональная Среда, Проблемы Развития При Вхождении В Вто<BR>[Infrastructure of the agro-food market of the suburban area of the capital of Kazakhstan: institutional environment, development problems when entering the WTO]|Purpose: to investigate methodological aspects and propose practical measures to develop the institutional environment of the agro-food market of the suburbs of the capital of Kazakhstan in Astana when entering the WTO. The object of the study are the institutions of infrastructure, the subject of research - the problems of the formation and development of the infrastructure of the agro-food complex of the metropolitan suburban area. To write the article, methods of economic research were used: abstract-logical, analytical, economic-statistical, expert. The agro-food market of the capital city is a system of economic relations between producers and consumers of food products, mediated by enterprises of the infrastructure complex. Its potential is formed from the resources of a suburban agricultural and food complex. The market infrastructure of the city economy in the food supply system of the capital city includes trade and intermediary, financial and credit, transport, information, economic, legal infrastructure designed to meet the needs of participants in the local food market. Opening its agricultural and food market for world food producers in the amount of its obligations to the WTO, Kazakhstan creates conditions for companies, the introduction of scientific and technological progress. One of the most important ways to increase the efficiency of production and sustainable development of the market infrastructure of the suburban area of Astana is the organization of an agrotechnical park designed to combine the scientific core, educational system and production complex into a single integrated research and production formation.
O24|Impact of PTA on Trade Margins of LDCs in Sub- Saharan Africa: Evidence from the EBA|This study investigates the impact of the EU preferential trade agreement of Everything but Arms on the extensive and intensive margins of exports of least developed countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The extensive margin is defined as the quantity of exported products while the intensive margin is defined as the value of exported products. The study employs the difference-indifference estimator together with fixed effects for a country bilateral product data defined at the HS 6-digit level to investigate the impact for the period 1995-2015. The findings are that the EBA has not had any impact on both trade margins of LDCs in SSA although it has impacted positively on some specific industries. The study goes further to explain how the LDCs in SSA could benefit from the EBA through complementary policies.
O24|An Economic General Equilibrium Model for Evaluation of Production Support Policies in Developing Countries|This paper introduces a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model for the evaluation of production support policies in developing countries. It is a multi-sector, multi-market, multi-household model appropriate for what-if policy analysis. We describe the main aspects of the model. The model assumes small open economy, imperfect capital mobility, imperfect substitution between imported and domestic commodity, nested CES structure in production, nested CES structure in consumption, and heterogeneity of domestic products in one category. We consider transport margin, wholesale margin, import tariffs, import subsidy, production tax, value added tax, goods and services tax, and other transfer payments. We calibrate the model based on the 2001 Micro Consistent Matrix of Iran. The initial validation tests approve the validity of the model.
O24|Thailand’s Automotive Manufacturing Corridor|Thailand’s export-oriented automotive industry is a recognized economic success story. How did it happen and what lessons might other countries draw? This paper argues that the success of the industry was based on three factors. First was the substantial public investment in port facilities and related infrastructure, beginning in the 1990s, that constituted the Eastern Seaboard economic corridor. Second was the exchange rate depreciation that followed the 1997–1999 Asian Financial Crisis, making manufacturing production for export more profitable. The third factor was two key policy changes adopted by the Thai government shortly after the crisis, and partly in response to it: (a) abolition of restrictions on foreign ownership and (b) abolition of local content requirements. Neighboring countries, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, also experienced the crisis and were potential competitors in attracting foreign investment in automotive production for export. But they did not adopt these two key reforms.
O24|Labels, Food Safety, and International Trade|Several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) suggest that improving well-being is achievable through trade. The free flow of goods and services internationally, which encourages efficient production and expansion of consumption, may support SDGs concerning inclusive and sustainable economic growth and sustainable consumption and production patterns. However, trade restrictions such as nontariff barriers (NTBs) may stymie potential gains from trade, which supports the SDGs. This chapter explores the trade effects of different NTBs, especially labeling and food safety regulations in food and agriculture. The upshot of this chapter is that trade can enhance economic growth and development. Standards such as labels and food safety regulations may contribute to or hamper this growth, which affects the capacity to attain the relevant SDGs. Thus, future analysis must provide careful assessments of industries, proposed standards, multiple outcomes, and power relationships to identify the effects of standards on trade and development.
O24|Empirical Assessment of Trade Engagements: Africa, China and the Maritime Belt and Road Initiative|Recent development economic literatures theorize that South-South trade and foreign investment may have a larger impact on economic growth in developing economies than North-South trade and investment, since investors from the South are more familiar with local developing markets and business practices, which increases their productivity spillovers (Aykut and Goldstein 2007). Amighini and Sanfilippo (2014) provided evidence that South-South trade and investments stimulate product diversification in light manufacturing industries such as agroprocessing, plastic, textile and leather production. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) launched in 2013, aims to create economic opportunities as well as improve and establish new trading routes between China and connected regions. This paper attempts to evaluate the degree of trade relations between China and selected African countries along the Maritime Silk Route (MSR) and further appraise the trade potentials and gains inherent for African economies through the initiative. To achieve our objective, we apply quantitative techniques in trade evaluation to enable us explore and estimate the degree and intensity of trade engagements amongst selected Sino-African silk route countries, identify the trade opportunities and potentials, which are critical for increased trade engagements between both parties along the route and to explore some of the channels through which the maritime route can impact on investment, trade and economic growth in Africa. Findings from the analysis indicate that while the degree of trade integration is unbalanced and favourable to China relative to Africa, the trade pattern and structure are observed to be more complementary than competitive, and this provides Africa with ample opportunity to engage in product upgrading and diversification, critical for structural transformation.
O24|Spatial price transmission and trade policies: new evidence for agricultural products from selected sub-Saharan African countries with high frequency data|We assess the conjunctural impact of price insulating policies on spatial price transmission of maize, rice and wheat in Cameroon, Kenya and Tanzania in the period 2005-2015. We therefore separately estimate the impact of trade policies within two regimes of behaviour of the domestic price series: the first regime with an increasing trend of domestic prices and the second regime with a decreasing trend. We find a significant impact of trade policies in both price regimes. This is however much larger if prices are increasing. Our results show that trade policies were able to insulate the three analyzed countries from the price shocks on international markets during the food price spike crisis 2007/2008. Although the impact of these policy instruments proved to be relevant as a counter-cyclical measure during the food price spike crisis, these policies cannot be regarded as structural long-term solutions. This paper extends the existing literature on spatial price transmission in agricultural markets by estimating the impact of tariff and non-tariff trade policies using monthly data. Employing monthly data allows for a more precise assessment of short-lived movements in the analysed series, which could disappear due to a time aggregation bias at lower yearly frequencies. While monthly price series are provided in the GIEWS database, we obtain monthly ad-valorem equivalent tariff rates by a time disaggregation of the yearly effectively applied weighted average tariff rate from the WITS/UNCTAD- TRAINS database through the monthly trade policies from the FAO-FADPA. By presenting high frequency analyses and techniques that are able to detect non-linearities in the Data Generating Process (DGP), this study provides results which differ from what is stated in the standard literature (Anderson and Nelgen, 2012a) (Anderson and Nelgen, 2012b) (Anderson and Nelgen, 2012c).
O24|The Effect of Import Competition on Employment in Canada: Evidence from the 'China Shock'|In this paper, we provide a quantitative assessment of the impact on Canadian employment of a recent shock to Canada’s import supply: the rapid rise of China as a manufacturing export superpower in the late 1990s and early 2000s
O24|Do subsidised export loans increase exports?|Turkey's export rediscount credit programme provides credit to exporting firms that is both easy to acquire and is offered at a low interest rate. We follow the performance of firms that first received the credit in 2012 when the amount of credit provided went up dramatically in 2012. We use propensity score matching to construct a control group of firms with which we compare the credit‐receiving firms before and after 2012 in a difference‐in‐differences framework. These firms have increased their exports substantially in the following years compared to the matched firms with similar propensities to receive the rediscount credit. We find that firms that received the rediscount credit increased their exports by 65% and total sales by 19% compared to matched firms. We find no statistically significant effects on domestic sales and profits. We also find suggestive evidence that the effects are larger for smaller firms and the effects fade away after a certain amount of credits.
O24|On the relationship between the breadth of PTAs and trade flows|This paper uses matching econometrics to extend the literature investigating the impact of Preferential Trading Arrangements (PTAs) on goods trade flows. Heterogeneity in PTAs is accounted for through a 'provision count index' derived from data provided in a recent World Bank study (Hofmann et al, 2017). PTA formation now involves two separate, sequential decisions - first, whether two trading partners should form a PTA and, second, if they do, how broad that agreement should be. We find that our explanatory variables are significant for both decisions, but often have opposing effects on each. Using our matched PTA and non-PTA groups of country-pairs, we estimate a dose response function which indicates that arrangements with few provisions and arrangements with many provisions do not appear to have a significant impact on goods trade flows between their members. PTAs in an intermediate range are shown to have a significant positive effect. We then relate these outcomes to the actual content of the PTAs using the concept of 'provision intensity'.
O24|Impact of Trade Liberalization on Poverty in Ethiopia: A Computable General Equilibrium Microsimulation|This study analyses the impact of trade liberalization on poverty in Ethiopia using a computable general equilibrium Microsimulation approach. Two scenarios (complete tariff cut and uniform tariff scheme) suggest that further liberalization of trade has a negative short-run effect on the overall economy. We find that the agriculture-based manufacturing sector (in particular, textile and leather) is likely to be strongly affected by tariff reductions. Poverty estimates show an increase in both scenarios. At the national level, complete tariff cut increases poverty by 2.8%, compared to 2.3% under a uniform tariff scheme. In both scenarios, poverty increases more among entrepreneur households (3.2% in the uniform tariff cut scenario), than farm and wage earner households (0.9% and 1.5%, respectively). This is consistent with the theoretical argument that previously-protected infant industries are highly affected by trade liberalization and may require compensatory policies.
O24|Upstreamness in the Global Value Chain: Manufacturing and Services|This paper investigates gupstreamness, h which measures the distance of an industry from the final use in terms of the number of production stages, using the WIOD global input-output tables, which cover 40 major countries. We find that global upstreamness increased in the mid -2000s. This trend is mainly due to developments in the manufacturing sector, but the service sector also contributed to the increase. In manufacturing, upstreamness has increased mainly in East Asian economies including Japan, which is consistent with the recent deepening of global value chains in this area. In services, the growing role of business services contributed to the deepening of value chains, such as outsourcing via leasing and staff agencies, and linkages to new businesses through mobile telecommunications. In further research, the concept of upstreamness can be applied to the analysis of industries f international competitiveness and of the influence of demand shocks across countries.
O24|Disentangling the Wage Impacts of Offshoring On a Developing Country: Theory and Policy|The various channels through which a reduction in the cost of offshoring can improve wages in a developed country are by now well understood. But does a similar reduction in the offshoring cost also benefit workers in the world's factories in developing countries? Using a parsimonious two-country model of offshoring we find very nuanced results. These include cases where wages monotonically improve or worsen as well as those where wages exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship in response to parametric reductions in the cost of offshoring. We identify qualitative conditions under which wages and welfare increase or decrease in the developing world as a result of a reduction in offshoring costs. Since global welfare always rises with an improvement in offshoring technology, we find that there is a role for a wage tax or a minimum wage in the developing country. We derive the optimal levels of such policies.
O24|Identifying export opportunities for Greece|Abstract A decision support model (DSM) is presented and implemented in order to identify probable and realistic export opportunities for Greece. The aim of the model is to select those combinations of products and countries of destination (markets) that are attractive based on widely recognized criteria (such as country risk indicators, macroeconomic data, market shares, accessibility of destination country, degree of market concentration, etc.). The DSM consists of a filtering process during which the less attractive export opportunities are successively eliminated in order to focus on those markets that have the desired characteristics. International trade data at the HS six-digit level up to 2011 where used. The results indicate that there exist significant export opportunities for Greece. Export opportunities are listed and categorized according to criteria such as the market characteristics of the destination country and Greece’s market share.
O24|Determinants of Trade: the Role of Innovation in Presence of Quality Standards|Abstract This paper analyses the role that quality standards and innovation play on trade volume, by using a gravity model. The role of innovative activity and quality standards in enhancing trade performance is widely accepted in the literature. However, in this paper, we argue that the net effect of quality standards on trade is affected by the exporter’s ability to innovate and comply with these requirements. In particular, by using a sample of 60 exporting countries and 57 importing countries, for a wide range of 26 manufacturing industries over the period 1995–2000, we show that the most innovative industries are more likely to enhance the overall quality of exports, and then gain a competitive advantage. We also find that this effect depends on the level of technology intensity at industry-level and on the level of economic development of exporting country.
O24|Estimation of the Impacts of Non-Oil Traditional and NonTraditional Export Sectors on Non-Oil Export of Azerbaijan|The significant share of oil sector of the Azerbaijan export portfolio necessitates promotion of non-oil exports. This study analyzes weather the commodities which contain the main share (more than 70%) in non-oil export are traditional or non-traditional areas, using the so-called Commodity-specific cumulative export experience function, for the 1995-2015 timeframe. Then, the impact of traditional and non-traditional exports on non-oil GDP investigated employing econometric model. The results of the study based on 16 non-oil commodities show that cotton, tobacco, and production of mechanic devices are traditional sectors in non-oil export. The estimation results of the model indicate that both, traditional and non-traditional non-oil export sectors have economically and statistically significant impact on non-oil GDP.
O24|On Behavioral Macroeconomics, Globalization, and Economic Growth|We assess theoretically the effect of forming a free trade union on the total production of a nation, where such effects are caused by the absorption of technologies through different channels. A popular metaphor describes the people as crabs in a bucket because when one crab tries to scape, the others pull it down avoiding a possible way out for all of them. Given this knowledge, posteriorly and independently of the income inequality levels, we extend our analyses to consider the effect of envy in a macroeconomic level on the total production, and draw the implications which this phenomenon has on the formation of free trade unions. We make strategic policy recommendations to allow the achievement of a globalization that benefits each member nation, where we show that the great trade union might have to start in certain order, with gradual and charitable subregional agreements, seasoned with education promotion and possibly a non restricted ideas employment.
O24|Effect of the Service Directive on Wholesale and Retail Companies: Diff in Diff in Diff Evidence|The Service Directive puts into motion the free movement of service, one of the milestones of the Single Market of the European Union. Though very ambitious at its draft, several adjustments have been made and it is argued whether the final Directive is helpful at all. This article aims to answer the question by focusing on productivity of affected companies with use of two distinct control groups and employing Difference-in-difference-in-difference design on firm-level data. The article finds that the Service Directive significantly increased productivity of companies though the results cannot be labelled as profoundly causal as is further discussed in the article.
O24|Harmonised Standards and Firm Productivity: Difference-in-Differences Evidence|One of the main objectives of the European Union is to enhance the competitiveness of companies within its Member States and that may be supported by further development of the Single Market. Introduction of harmonized standards for production of goods and services encourages companies to take advantage of the Single Market by reducing transaction costs. In other words, the EU is adjusting the economic and legal framework in which companies operate in order to remove existing barriers to its vision of a well-functioning Single Market. This paper researches the relationship between these changes and productivity of microeconomic agents â€“ firms. The analysis uses a panel data regression model with difference-in-differences research design built on a sample of affected and unaffected firms as control groups to be able to extract effect caused by the regulation. The article provides evaluation of individual standards and states the direction of effect at each of those. It can be said that while some standards (mostly those with wide applicability) have a positive relation with productivity and some are insignificant. There can be found also one that has a robust significant negative correlation with productivity.
O24|The interaction and sequencing of policy reforms|In what order should a developing country adopt policy reforms? Do some policies complement each other? Do others substitute for each other? To address these questions, we develop a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model with entry and exit of firms that are monopolistic competitors. Distortions in the model include barriers to entry of firms, barriers to international trade, and barriers to contract enforcement. We find that a reform that reduces one of these distortions has different effects depending on the other distortions present. In particular, reforms to trade barriers and barriers to the entry of new firms are substitutes, as are reforms to contract enforcement and trade barriers. In contrast, reforms to contract enforcement and the barriers to entry are complements. Finally, the optimal sequencing of reforms requires reforming trade barriers before contract enforcement.
O24|East Asian Economies and Financial Globalization In the Post-Crisis World|This paper assesses the East Asian Economies’ openness to cross-border capital flows and exchange rate arrangements in the past decades, with the main focus on emerging market economies. Using Mundell’s trilemma indexes, we note that the convergence of the three policy goals in East Asia toward a “middle ground” pre-dates the convergence of these indices in other regions. Another more recent development involves the high level of international reserve (IR) holdings–a feature that is known as the most distinct characteristic of Asian EMEs. Financial globalization seems to have made asset prices and interest rates in Asian EMEs more vulnerable to global movements of capital, that is, essentially to the monetary policy of the center country, the United-States. We document changing goods trade structure but rather stable reliance on the Dollar in East Asian Economies. That is, the U.S. presence in trade ties with Asian economies has been declining over the last two decades, whereas China’s has been on a rising trend, yet the share of trade among Asian economies with the dollar zone economies has been quite stable. That means that the dominant position of the dollar has been influential in the Asian region. One big dollar-zone economy that has been increasing its presence in Asia is China. However, China has been recently making efforts to “internationalize” its currency, the yuan (RMB). Hence, if China succeeds in its internationalization efforts and creates the RMB zone, the dynamics between the U.S. and Asia will most likely change; it is, however, uncertain to what extent the RMB will become an international currency. Recently, Chinese authorities have become more interventionist because of the slowdown of the economy and financial markets. For now, the Asian region’s international finance continues to be dollar-centric.
O24|Tourism and Economic Development: Evidence from Mexico's Coastline|Tourism is a fast-growing services sector in developing countries. This paper combines a rich collection of Mexican microdata with a quantitative spatial equilibrium model and a new empirical strategy to study the long-term economic consequences of tourism both locally and in the aggregate. We find that tourism causes large and significant local economic gains relative to less touristic regions that are in part driven by significant positive spillovers on manufacturing. In the aggregate, however, these local spillovers are largely offset by reductions in agglomeration economies among less touristic regions, so that the national gains from trade in tourism are mainly driven by a classical market integration effect.
O24|The surprising instability of export specializations|We study the instability of hyper-specialization of exports at the 4-digit level in 1998–2010. (1) Specializations are surprisingly un-stable. Export ranks are not persistent, and new top products and destinations replace old ones. Measurement error is unlikely to be the main or only determinant of this pattern. (2) Source country factors are not the main explanation of this instability. Only 16–20% of variation in export growth is accounted for by source country plus source country-product factors that do not vary across destinations. The high share of idiosyncratic variance (source-product-destination residual) of 41–55%, indicates the difficulty to predict export success using source country characteristics. While we are cautious in interpreting factors that are jointly determined in global general equilibrium, our results suggest that destination and product-specific factors importantly matter at least as much as source country factors.
O24|Exchange Rate, Inflation and Industrial Policy|"The dynamics of the exchange rate of the Russian ruble is considered in the context of the discussions on the optimal exchange rate regimes. It is shown that the dominant focus on the stability of the nominal exchange rate was erroneous. Since the prices in Russia grew faster than in the countries - its trading partners, this policy led to an overvaluation of the real exchange rate and caused the shock devaluations in 1998, 2008 and 2014-2015. It is argued that the best regime for Russia is the ""dirty float"" aimed at maintaining relatively low and stable real exchange rate. This implies the periodic devaluation of the nominal rate. This implies the periodic devaluation of the nominal exchange rate. The suggested policy entails accumulation of foreign exchange reserves that stimulates export oriented growth. These reserves can also become a source of investment in case of appropriate industrial policy."
O24|Bulgarian Exports In The Context Of Euro Area Debt Crisis|Granger causality test is used with variables Euro area GDP, GDP of Bulgaria and exports of the country. The testing is made with two samples of data to confirm the hypothesis in the paper that the Euro area debt crisis is affected negatively the economy of Bulgaria and limited the economic growth, due to violated relationships between Euro area GDP, GDP of Bulgaria and Bulgaria’s exports, as well as to confirm the thesis in the research - the need to diversify Bulgaria’s export markets.
O24|Unequal among equals: Why are developing countries less likely to win WTO disputes?|This article discusses the factors that affect the chances of a favorable resolution of claims to the WTO dispute settlement. Drawing on several hundreds of complaints received by the WTO since the establishment of the organization and till 2014, we demonstrate that the developing countries have a smaller probability of successful resolution in the dispute than the developed countries. This inequality can be explained by differences in the size of economies (GDP), but the paper shows that differences in the country’s experience of participation in WTO disputes have a higher predictive power.
O24|Mind the skills gap! Regional and industry patterns in emerging economies|Most emerging economies are characterised by lagging levels of productivity. While economic growth has been robust in much of the emerging world during the last two decades, it has generally been grounded on factor accumulation, with marginal contributions from productivity. With the economic literature pointing to human capital and skills as a key conduit of productivity, the inability of firms to find the skills they need appears as a key brake on development. This paper aims to identify the dimensions where this skill gap is more prevalent, particularly across emerging regions and industries. We devise an empirical analysis that uses two alternative specifications based on limited dependent variable analysis. The results place Latin America as the emerging region where firms have the greatest problems derived from the lack of adequate skills, well ahead of emerging Asia and Europe, but also of sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of sectors, two advanced manufacturing industries (machinery and motor vehicles) are particularly affected by this relative scarcity of adequately trained workers. Policy recommendations hinge on the need to solve the mismatch between the provision of skills by educational systems and the needs of the economy. La plupart des économies émergentes se caractérisent par des niveaux de productivité faibles. Même si la croissance économique a été robuste dans la plupart des pays émergents au cours des deux dernières décennies, elle a généralement été fondée sur l'accumulation des facteurs, avec une contribution marginale de la productivité. Alors que la littérature économique montre le capital humain et les compétences comme des composantes clés de la productivité, les difficultés des entreprises à trouver les compétences adéquates mettent un frein au développement. Ce document cherche à identifier où cet écart de compétences est le plus dominant, notamment parmi les régions émergentes et les secteurs. Pour ce faire, il élabore une analyse empirique à partir de deux spécifications basées sur des variables dépendantes limitées. Les résultats montrent l'Amérique latine comme la région émergente où les entreprises ont le plus de difficultés à trouver les compétences adéquates, bien avant l'Asie émergente et l’Europe, mais aussi l’Afrique sub-saharienne. Au niveau des secteurs, deux types d’industries manufacturières de pointe (machines et véhicules à moteur) sont particulièrement touchés par cette problématique. Les recommandations politiques reposent sur la nécessité de résoudre l’inadéquation entre offre de compétences des systèmes éducatifs et besoins de l'économie.
O24|Scaling New Heights: Achievements and Future Challenges for Productivity Convergence in Lithuania|GDP per capita in Lithuania rose from one third to two thirds of the OECD average level between 1995 and 2014, despite internal and external crises. Productivity catch-up was critical to this process, although the level of labour productivity also remains around one-third below the OECD average. Further productivity gains will partly rely on improvements in resource allocation. In particular, the Lithuanian government should promote better governance of state-owned enterprises, more effective bankruptcy procedures and new forms of business financing. However, convergence will also require policy settings that encourage advances in within-firm productivity growth. Improvements to the quality of education at all levels and increasing the role of workplace training will be important. So too will be further measures that support the innovation capacity of the business sector, including innovation policies that promote the absorptive capacity of firms and do not favour incumbents at the expense of young businesses. This Working Paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of Lithuania (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-lithuania.htm) Atteindre des nouveaux sommets : réalisations et défis futurs pour une convergence de la productivité en Lituanie Le produit intérieur brut (PIB) par habitant s'est hissé d'un tiers à deux tiers de la moyenne de l'OCDE entre 1995 et 2014, malgré des crises internes et externes. Le rattrapage du retard qu'avait accumulé la Lituanie en termes de productivité a joué un rôle essentiel dans ce processus, même si le niveau de la productivité du travail demeure inférieur d'un tiers environ à la moyenne de l'OCDE. La poursuite de cette convergence dépendra en partie d'une amélioration de la répartition des ressources. Le gouvernement devrait notamment favoriser une amélioration de la gouvernance des entreprises publiques, la mise en place de procédures de faillite efficaces et l'émergence de nouvelles formes de financement des entreprises. Cette convergence passera aussi par des politiques publiques propices à l'amélioration de la croissance de la productivité au sein des entreprises. Il sera également important d'améliorer la qualité de l'enseignement à tous les niveaux et de renforcer le rôle de la formation en entreprise. Néanmoins, il conviendra aussi de prendre de nouvelles mesures pour renforcer la capacité d'innovation du secteur des entreprises, notamment en mettant en oeuvre des politiques d'innovation qui permettent d'améliorer encore la capacité d'absorption des entreprises et ne favorisent pas les acteurs en place au détriment des jeunes entreprises. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE 2016 de la Lituanie (www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-lituanie.htm)
O24|The Role of Services for Economic Performance in Brazil|This paper highlights the large contribution of services to the Brazilian economy and the under-exploited potential of services to sustain productivity gains and international competitiveness. The areas with the largest potential for regulatory reform include improvements in the general business and trading environment as well as specific policies in transport sectors, telecoms and financial services. Reforms targeting services that add value by favouring productivity and quality enhancements, as well as services that increase efficiency by reducing production costs, have strong potential to unlock manufacturing performance. The set of proposed recommendations emerging from this analysis underlines the importance of streamlining sector-level regulatory frameworks to encourage foreign entry and competition, and the role that cross-cutting improvements in the trade and business environment would play to render services providers more competitive.
O24|The persistence of trade policy in China after WTO accession|Import tariffs have fallen steeply worldwide over the last several decades, but has trade policy persisted through a rise in the use of other instruments? I study this question in the context of China's 2001 accession to the World Trade Organization, using panel data on Chinese export policies. I find that after its entry into WTO, the distribution of China's export restrictions across industries increasingly resembles the inverse of its pre-WTO import tariff schedule. The evidence suggests that increases in export restrictions are likely to have partly restored China's pre-WTO trade policy.
O24|Structural change, the real exchange rate and the balance of payments in Mexico, 1960–2012|This paper estimates a structural model of the balance of payments, with disaggregated exports (manufactures and other) and imports (final and intermediate), and a reduced-form model of the trade balance for the Mexican economy. The analysis identifies structural changes in the composition of Mexico’s trade and the parameters that affect it across five subperiods marked by statistical breakpoints. The results indicate that a tightening of the balance-of-payments constraint may account for the post-liberalisation slowdown in Mexico’s growth only during certain subperiods and that the impact of real exchange rate changes on the trade balance has diminished, most likely as a result of the increasing integration of export industries into global supply chains. The results also suggest an asymmetry, whereby a country cannot sustain growth above the rate consistent with balance-of-payments equilibrium, as expected, but it can grow persistently below that rate when other constraints are more binding.
O24|The Destinations of State Trade Missions|From 1997 to 2006, US state governors led more than 500 trade missions to foreign countries. Trade missions are potentially a form of public investment in export promotion. I create a theory of public investment by introducing government to a Melitz (2003)–Chaney (2008) model. Controlling for state and country characteristics, the model accounts for the frequency and destination of trade missions and predicts a positive relationship between missions and exports by destination. By collecting data on trade mission origins and destinations, I estimate this relationship in the data and find that mission destinations are qualitatively consistent with the model. (JEL codes: F13, H76, O24)
O24|A Dynamic Relationship between Financial Development and Import Demand for Bangladesh: An Evidence from Combine Cointegration and Granger Causality Approach|This article has estimated the impact of financial development on import demand over the period of 1986: Q1â€“2014: Q4 in case of Bangladesh. The long-run relationship between financial development, import demand and economic growth are investigated by combine cointegration. Error Correction Method (ECM) is applied to examine short-run phenomena. The unit root properties of variables are tested by augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test (ADF) and Philipsâ€“Perron (Pâ€“P) unit root test. Perron (1997) single structural break unit root test is also applied. The results of Bayer and Hanck (2013) combine cointegration test that reveal the existence of long-run relationship between import demand, financial development and economic growth. Financial development and economic growth have a positive and significant impact on import demand in long run as well as in short run. The lagged value of error correction method (ECMt-1) is â€“0.08 that is negative and significant. This indicates that change from equilibrium level of import demand is corrected by 8 per cent per quarter in a year. The results of Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) Granger causality explain that bidirectional causality exists between import demand and financial development in long run as well as short run. Similarly, bidirectional causality exists between import demand and economic growth in short run. Policymakers should focus on financial sector development for import of technology through adoption of the import substitution policy.
O24|Trade Liberalization and Wage Inequality in the Indian Manufacturing Sector|This study analyzes the effect of reduction in input and output tariffs on the intra-plant wage inequality in India, which is one of the most unskilled labor abundant countries, for the period 2000 to 2007. We find that a reduction in output tariff increases the wage inequality, whereas a reduction in input tariff does not have any statistically significant effect on wage inequality. These results suggest that the Stolper-Samuelson effect works in the Indian manufacturing sector where unskilled labor-intensive industries were protected the most prior to trade liberalization. We also examine the effect of the increased demand for skilled workers by the modern service sector, which has been the driving force of recent economic growth in India. The increased demand raises the wage inequality in manufacturing implying that skill-biased technological change in modern service sector has an indirect effect on wage inequality in this sector.
O24|Unravelling the structure of Turkish exports: Impediments and policy|In this study we reveal the structure of exports in an emerging economy, Turkey, to shed light on the impediments not only this country but also other developing countries might face in pursuit of increasing exports to tackle their current account problems. We employ panel data econometrics for estimating exports, labour and imports market specifications simultaneously to address endogeneity issues. The data covers 13 manufacturing industry sectors, 25 main export markets over the period 2000–2011. Our findings reveal that unlike conventional assumptions, export supply is not infinitely elastic, and the supply side of the market plays a critical role in reviving export earnings in Turkey.
O24|Девизна Политика Југославије 1945–1990: Искуства И Поуке<BR>[Yugoslav Foreign Currency Policy in 1945–1990: Experiences and Lessons]|Serbian Abstract. У раду се разматра девизна политика Југославије у периоду социјалистичке изградње (1945–1990). Приказан је њен развој од строге централизације и монопола целе спољне трговине, с Егализационим фондом и централизацијом девиза у Централном девизном фонду, до почетка 1950-их, у правцу децентрализације и примене разноврсних инструмената монетарне, спољнотрговинске и девизне политике. Упоредо са стицањем пословне самосталности привредни субјекти су добијали и самосталност у спољнотрговинском пословању и у стицању и располагању девизним средствима. У оквиру тога, међутим, одвијали су се и процеси преношења значајних овлашћења федералних на републике и покрајине, укључујући и увођење њихових девизних и платнобилансних пројекција. Заједно са сличним процесима у другим сегментима привредног система и економске политике, све је то допринело развлашћивању федералне државе и припремало терен за њен распад. Сама спољнотрговинска и девизна политика заснивала се, уз то, нарочито током деценије 1980–1990 на погрешним концептима (теорија паритета куповних снага) и игнорисала је налазе економске науке (Дугорочни програм економске стабилизације). English Abstract. This paper deals with the foreign currency policy of Yugoslavia during its socialist construction period between 1945 and 1990. It presents its development from the strict centralization and state monopoly over the totality of foreign trade, marked by the Equalization Fund and the centralization of foreign currency in the Central Foreign Currency Fund, which were applied until the beginning of the 1950-ies, to a decentralization and application of a new set of different monetary, foreign trade and currency policies. Along with gaining business independence, enterprises were also gaining independence in foreign trade and in gaining and management of foreign currency assets. However, these processes brought about a transferal of important responsibilities from federal to republic and provincial levels, including the introduction of republic and provincial foreign currency projections and projections regarding the balance of payments. Together with similar processes taking place in other segments of industry and economic politics, it all contributed to depriving the federal state of responsibilities, thus providing a basis for its future disintegration. Moreover, the Yugoslav foreign trade and foreign currency policies were based on wrong concepts, such as the theory of purchasing power parity, and they ignored the findings of the economic science, such as the long-term program of economic stabilization, especially during the decade of the 1980-ies.
O24|Gender Gap and Trade Liberalization: An Analysis of some selected SAARC countries|Trade liberalization plays a significant role in the development of an economy as all countries have insufficient resources and depend on trade to grow and prosper. The key objective of this study is to explore the relationship of trade liberalization on women empowerment. It also aims to find out whether it is beneficial for gender gap or not. This study utilizes the sample of five SAARC countries for the time period of 15 years, that is, from 2000 to 2014. It emphasizes on tariffs and regulatory trade barriers, which are considered significant indicators of trade liberalization, along with the freedom of trade, that is a composite index. The gender gap is measured through the female to male participation rate, whereas, gender development index(GDI) is used as a relative measure of women empowerment after adjusting HDI for gender disparity in three dimensions. The other control variable incorporated in this study includes: gross domestic product growth, education of female, female unemployment rate and the hiring regulations & minimum wage standards. The econometric technique applied is the pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) method along with various diagnostic tests. When trade liberalization goes up, it increases the GDI, meaning lower gender disparity, which in turn refers to greater women empowerment. The research concludes that whenever the trade liberalization increases, it does not reduce the gender gap, which means the female to male participation rate goes down. It encourages women to actively participate in the labor market, but it does not play a role in reducing gender gap. Education of female is essential because it creates awareness among girls and enhances their skills, which leads to empowering women, making them self-sufficient and active participants in the economic activity, which can improve their standard of living.
O24|Trade Liberalization and Export Competitiveness: Evidence from the EU-ECOWAS Trade|This study investigates the impact of EU trade liberalisation on the export competitive ness of ECOWAS countries. Trade liberalisation is captured by import tariffs in the EU market whiles export competitiveness is captured by the export value of ECOWAS countries. The study uses the gravity model, fixed and random effects as well as the Hausman test for a country pair panel data of 15 ECOWAS and EU 15 countries for the period beginning 1995 to 2014. The study finds a positive impact of trade liberalisation on export competitiveness and estimates the export value of ECOWAS countries to increase by 0.487% for every 1% reduction of import tariffs in the EU.
O24|Does the choice of an exchange rate regime limits exchange rate misalignments? The example of sub-Saharan African countries|This article examines the incidence of exchange rate regime on the real exchange rate misalignments in Sub-Saharan African countries. To this end, we compare misalignments of 17 countries classified into two groups according to the exchange rate regime. For the equilibrium real exchange rate determination, we rely on a NATREX-based approach which we compare to the behavioral model (BEER), to prove results consistency. Relying on annual data between 1980 and 2011, our estimates made simultaneously by the Pooled Mean Group method (PMG), the Dynamic OLS (DOLS) and the Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS) show that misalignments do not differ in average from one group to another. Put another way, no exchange rate regime is going to bail an economy out of deviations of its exchange rate.
O24|Revisiting the Diverse Empirical Findings on the Impact of Exchange Rate Volatility on Trade: Some Comparable Evidences from Ghana and Two other Developing Economies|Although theories suggest that exchange rate volatility negatively affect international trade yet empirical studies on this relationship have produced mixed results. Guided by the growing consensus in the literature that empirical results may be sensitive to the class of countries considered as well as the proxy of exchange rate volatility used, this paper empirically examines this relationship for Ghana by augmenting a gravity model (that controls for fixed and events specific effects) with historical volatility forecasts (which are generated using three different estimation techniques). It was observed that between 1980 and 2005, exchange rate volatility did not impact on bilateral trade for Ghana and its trade partners considered. Comparable empirical experiments conducted on Mozambique and Tanzania showed similar relationship between exchange rate volatility and bilateral trade. Evidently these empirical findings present challenges to policymakers. The paper advocates that even though a number of reasons contributed to these observations, yet the overall potential consequences of exchange rate volatility on economic performances via volatility feedback effects, currency problems as well as persistent trade deficits should be of concern to policymakers. The useful policy lessons from the empirical findings may be obvious and debated widely but are relevant more than ever today since most sub-Saharan developing countries are still burdened with persistent external debts, deficits and currency problems even after enjoying a decade of stable and favourable commodity prices between 2000 and 2010.
O24|The Impact of Stop-Go Demand Management Policy on Britain's Consumer Durables Industries, 1952-1965|We examine the impacts of British government stop-go policy on domestic sales of consumer durables over 1952 - 1965, via hire purchase restrictions and punitive Purchase Tax rates. Our analysis includes a general review of contemporary evidence regarding the impacts of these measures, a more detailed study of the television sector, and time-series econometric analysis for both televisions and a representative high-ticket labour-saving consumer durable washing machines. We find that the restrictions had devastating impacts on Britain's consumer durables industries, preventing firms from fully exploiting economies of scale, reducing output growth and international competitiveness, and eroding industrial relations. Government officials were aware of these problems, but considered them a price worth paying to facilitate moves towards sterling convertibility and the re-establishment of the City as a leading financial and trading centre.
O24|Multinational enterprises and economic development in host countries: What we know and what we don't know|"The attraction of multinational enterprises (MNEs) has become a key component of development policies. Generous incentive packages are offered by governments to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), although few countries perform proper cost/benefit analyses. MNEs can have a decisive influence on the development path of countries, although the effectiveness of an FDI-assisted development strategy depends on a variety of factors. Net benefits depend not only on quantity, but also on the quality of FDI. Quality has to do with the MNE's investment motivations, the affiliates' mandate and autonomy, which in turn determine the potential for linkages and spillovers. These effects also depend on the capacity of domestic firms to absorb, internalise and upgrade their knowledge assets. A sound FDI policy must not be exclusively concerned with attracting capital investment, but must prioritise enhancing the local embeddedness of the MNEs. Globalisation and subsequent changes in economic organisation require both policy makers and scholars to reconsider their understanding of FDI and development. ""FDI"" and ""MNEs"" are no longer synonyms, as MNEs are increasingly able to control value chains without ownership through equity. Poor data and weak methodologies mean making realistic estimations of development effects is also increasingly fraught with difficulty. The tools to measure linkages and spillovers are increasingly outdated, as we cannot estimate non-equity engagements or knowledge flows, and this means we are unable to objectively judge if foreign investments have a net positive or negative effect, and whether such effects persist or attenuate over time."
O24|Modeling Dynamics of Exchange Rates Volatility: A Case of Pakistan from 1980-2010|The thesis aims to analyze the exchange rate volatility that exists in Pakistan. What threats does this volatility pose to various macroeconomic variables of the country? This is the main question that is being addressed in this thesis. The study also aims to look at the implications of the various exchange rate regimes followed in the country, upon some of the core variables such as inflation, trade, foreign direct investment etc. Both the official exchange rate and the real effective exchange rates are taken into account to look at the extent to which they get affected by different core variables, and vice versa. The paper also sheds light on the role of the State Bank of Pakistan, in reducing the fluctuations and the annual volatilities in the currency. How autonomous are its operations? How transparent is the State Bank of Pakistan? All such questions are addressed in this thesis. An OLS approach is being used to carry out a time series analysis, and the data is gathered for the 30 years from 1980 to 2010. The data was collected from various databases that were accessible. It is made sure that these sources were authentic and recognized. The findings of the paper mainly focus on the significance of their relation with the official and the real effective exchange rates. The study shows that the real effective exchange rate is more sensitive to current account balance, aid and foreign private investment as compared to the official exchange rate. It can also be seen that inflation and foreign direct investment are closely linked to the exchange rates.
O24|Trade, Poverty Eradication, and the Sustainable Development Goals|We investigate if trade can help achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of poverty eradication using microeconomic and macroeconomic mechanisms and the effects of trade and trade policy on consumer prices, producer prices, and wages. As these mechanisms affect the real income of households, they determine the likelihood that a household may be lifted out of or pushed into poverty. The impacts of trade on growth and longer-term consequences of trade liberalization were also analyzed using data from African countries. While there is sound evidence that trade can be pro-poor, there is significant heterogeneity in the poverty impacts of trade, both across households and countries. This highlights the importance of complementary policies such as infrastructure, trade facilitation, and social protection.
O24|Hidden protectionism? Evidence from non-tariff barriers to trade in the United States|Can the enforcement of product standards be protectionism in disguise? This paper estimates the costs of non-compliance with U.S. product standards, using a new database on U.S. import refusals from 2002 to 2014. We find that import refusals decrease exports to the United States. This trade reducing effect is driven by developing countries and by refusals without any product sample analysis, in particular during the Subprime Crisis and its aftermath. We also provide evidence that given product standards were enforced more strictly during the crisis while the quality of imported products did not deteriorate. These results are consistent with the existence of counter-cyclical, hidden protectionism due to non-tariff barriers to trade in the United States.
O24|Mega External Preferential Trade Agreements and Their Impacts on Indian Economy|This study examines the impacts on India of three mega external preferential trading agreements (PTAs) from which the country is excluded using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model combined with POVCAL poverty analysis tool. The simulation results show that each of these PTAs cause considerable trade diversion. However, the impacts on Indiaâ€™s trade flows, domestic output, returns to factors, aggregate welfare, inequality and poverty levels are rather small. In contrast, multilateral trade liberalization has significantly large and favourable impacts on all these variables. In particular, welfare improves by 1.7 per cent of GDP, inequality falls by over half percentage point and poverty head count lowers by 12.3 per cent over base levels under a multilateral free trade scenario. These results suggest that the country should continue with its efforts for achieving a multilateral trade agreement. At the same time, the country should hedge against the possibility that a global trade agreement does not materialize. One way to protect the countryâ€™s interest is to aggressively pursue preferential trading arrangements in parallel with key members of these three mega PTAs. This is likely to ensure that the country does not lose market share due to preference erosion.
O24|Living with Volatilities: Capital Flows and Policy Implications for SEACEN Central Banks| Economies with less developed financial markets might find their integration into global financial markets associated with volatility in capital flows. Such variability can prove to be disruptive to domestic economic and financial conditions, raising policy questions about how to realize the benefits from financial integration while minimizing adverse spillovers. In the first instance policy makers need to understand the dynamics of capital flows and the underlying sources of potential instabilities before enacting a response. We dissect the capital accounts of Asia-Pacific economies associated with SEACEN and explore some important trends and exposures. The region has been subject to several financial shocks mainly reflected in bank-related capital flows. This is useful in understanding past crises but not necessarily helpful in looking out for the next bout of instability. We discuss the possible implications of monetary policy normalization in the United States but based on past cycles see little cause for concern. Having said that, this is a unique juncture for the global financial system and uncertainty is higher than usual. The hierarchy of policy responses to concerns about capital movements ranges from longer-term structural economic and financial reforms to allow economies to accommodate volatility, to crisis responses which are more temporary in nature. All policy reactions have costs and benefits. Importantly, even in Asia Pacific there appear to be few regularities that would allow generalized policy advice other than to do what this paper attempts to do – dissect the capital account and exposures to make policy makers aware of looming vulnerabilities and appropriate responses.
O24|Effects of Patent Protection on Optimal Corporate Income and Consumption Taxes in an R&D-Based Growth Model|Does reducing the corporate income tax accompanied by an increase in the consumption tax to meet the government's budget constraint improve welfare? To respond, I examine the welfare maximizing corporate income tax and consumption tax rates in an R&D-based growth model under the constraint that the government's budget is balanced at each point of time. Further, I consider how welfare-maximizing tax rates change as patent protection becomes stronger, as seen in many countries. The results show that as patent protection becomes stronger, the corporate income tax rate should be higher and the consumption tax rate should be lower. This implies that under stronger patent protection, recovering production at the expense of innovation by raising corporate in come tax and reducing consumption tax improves welfare.
O24|Industrial policy and exchange rate skepticism|The aim of the present paper is to put in historical perspective the development thinking on the relationship between industrial and exchange rate policies. The first section focuses on the thought of the so-called pioneers of development economics, specifically their preference for protectionism and their belated recognition that an exchange-rate policy could act as a substitute to it. In the second one, we analyze the exchange rate skepticism that arises out of the theories that identify a foreign constraint to growth, in addition to the one revealed by the pioneers. The third section briefly complements the previous discussion with reference to macroeconomic formulations that allow for short-run contractionary effects of a devaluation, reinforcing the skepticism in question. In the fourth section, we discuss the revival of development thinking in the 1980s and its discussion about East Asian trajectories, a literature that placed great emphasis on industrial policy. Finally, in the fifth section we discuss the new historical facts and the new development macroeconomics’ models that are putting an end to exchange rate skepticism.
O24|Foreign direct investment, economic growth, and volatility: a useful model for policymakers|Abstract The explosion of hypotheses addressing empirical relationships between foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth is to say the least, confusing. There is the positive view whereby FDI positively affects growth, the negative view where FDI negatively affects growth, and the dependent view where FDI may or may not have an effect on growth at all, but is conditional upon whether certain economic and social conditions are met in the receiving country. In other words, to date, dozens of variables and modeling methods have been used to determine the effect FDI has on economic growth, and all with different results. Essentially, parsimony and ease of interpretation have been replaced with confusion. The central theses of the most important arguments focus on the broad dissemination of FDI, an economy’s absorptive capacity, and how injections tend to depend upon cyclical components. We use existing theory to justify a simpler model using a single determinant that encompasses these characteristics. By interacting past growth with current FDI, policymakers can more easily draw inference from the estimated marginal effect. We prove this by applying the model to pooled, high income, emerging, and developing economy samples in order to gain a clearer picture of exactly to what extent, FDI affects economic growth. And since policy not only takes growth into consideration, but economic stability as well, we also apply our model to volatility. While the results differ across income groups and growth rates, the inference drawn from them is unambiguous.
O24|The effects of input tariffs on productivity: panel data evidence for OECD countries|Abstract Based on a panel of 16 OECD countries and 10 manufacturing industries over 1996–2007, this paper investigates the impact of tariffs on foreign intermediate goods on productivity growth in downstream manufacturing industries. The results show that imposing tariffs on imported intermediate goods is particularly harmful for industries that operate close to the global technological frontier. We also consider the possibility that input-tariff liberalisation may have different effects depending on the technological content of imported intermediate goods. Our findings suggest that protecting imports of high-technological goods is more harmful for productivity improvements in industries that operate close to global best practice.
O24|Cross-Country Exposures to the Swiss Franc|This paper first documents the foreign currency exposures of Switzerland in the 2002-2012 period. We find that the large scale of the Swiss international balance sheet means that movements in the Swiss Franc generate large cross-border valuation effects. Second, we examine the Swiss Franc holdings of the rest of the world and highlight differences in exposures between advanced and emerging economies.
O24|Cost-benefit analysis for identifying institutional capacity building priorities in LDCs: an application to Uganda|Institutional constraints prevent the Least Developed Countries from fully utilizing the trade-related International Support Measures provided by development partners. A cost-benefit analysis has been developed as a methodology to identify institutional constraints and prioritize support measures comparing benefits with costs, based on survey data. Applied in Uganda, it identified critical institutional constraints: limited knowledge on how to access most of the assistance; inadequate institutional arrangements; ineffective communications regarding the use of support measures. International support measures related to sanitary and phytosanitary issues, among others, are expected to increase the trade value in Uganda.
O24|Productive capacity and trade in the Solomon Islands|Economic growth, environmental sustainability and human development in the Solomon Islands have lagged much of the Pacific region since independence in 1978. Trade contributes insufficiently to development, partly because of the dominance of the logging industry but also due to the lack of emphasis on building productive capacities with a view to economic transformation toward higher productivity activities. Targeted soft industrial policies may help address these shortcomings, in the form of sectoral prioritisation; linkages policies; joint government-donor support to build appropriate infrastructure; and the development of human resources in specific areas. Government institutional capacity will only be allowed to improve if policymakers are permitted true ownership over policies and if they are allowed to make mistakes.
O24|Applying the Growth Identification and Facilitation Framework to the Least Developed Countries: The Case of Uganda|This paper aims to draw insights from New Structural Economics by applying its practical policy tool – the Growth Identification and Facilitation Framework (GIFF) – to least-developed countries (LDCs) with a special focus on the case of Uganda. The GIFF offers practical development paths for enabling developing countries to follow comparative advantage in its industrial development and to tap into the potential of advantages of backwardness in industrial upgrading in an effort to achieve sustained and dynamic growth. After a brief introduction of the GIFF, we present an overview of Uganda’s recent economic and social performance and analyses Uganda’s factor endowments, i.e., land (or natural resources), labour and capital that can be used in the production process. After identifying tradable goods and services which would fit Uganda’s latent comparative advantage, we diagnose sector-specific binding constraints in starting and scaling up the selected subsectors and discuss how to remove or mitigate these key constraints. Finally, we conclude with main findings and policy recommendations. The take-home message is that developing countries should not focus on what they lack but what they have when formulating their development strategies.

O24|Corruption, Trade Costs, and Gains from Tariff Liberalization: Evidence from Southern Africa|This paper exploits quasi-experimental variation in tariffs in southern Africa to estimate trade elasticities. Traded quantities respond only weakly to a 30 percent reduction in the average nominal tariff rate. Trade flow data combined with primary data on firm behavior and bribe payments suggest that corruption is a potential explanation for the observed low elasticities. In contexts of pervasive corruption, even small bribes can significantly reduce tariffs, making tariff liberalization schemes less likely to affect the extensive and the intensive margins of firms' import behavior. The tariff liberalization scheme is, however, still associated with improved incentives to accurately report quantities of imported goods, and with a significant reduction in bribe transfers from importers to public officials.
O24|The Macroprudential Role of International Reserves|There has been a lot of interest since the global financial crisis in policies allowing emerging market economies to smooth the effects of the global financial cycle. Although the literature has focused mostly on capital controls emerging market governments have relied mostly on international reserves management. This paper discusses the role of reserves in capital flow management based on a simple welfare-based model of capital flows with international banking frictions.
O24|Domestic Value Added in Exports: Theory and Firm Evidence from China|China has defied the declining trend in domestic content in exports in many countries. This paper studies China's rising domestic content in exports using firm- and customs transaction-level data. The approach embraces firm heterogeneity and hence reduces aggregation bias. The study finds that the substitution of domestic for imported materials by individual processing exporters caused China's domestic content in exports to increase from 65 to 70 percent in the period 2000-2007. Such substitution was induced by the country's trade and investment liberalization, which deepened its engagement in global value chains and led to a greater variety of domestic materials becoming available at lower prices.
O24|Foreign Workers, Foreign Multinationals, and Wages by Occupation and Sex in Malaysia’s Manufacturing Plants during the mid-1990s| This paper investigates the effects of foreign worker shares and MNE ownership on wages paid to males and female in five occupation groups in Malaysian manufacturing plants during 1994-1996, an important period coinciding with the end of the decade-long economic boom that preceded the Asian financial crisis. Random effects estimates of Mincer-type equations by occupation group and sex in large samples of all industries and in seven industry-level samples both suggest that use of foreign workers generally had insignificant effects on plant wages for most occupation-sex-(and industry) combinations. When significant, these estimates suggested that plants with relatively large shares of same sex-same occupation foreign worker shares tended to pay relatively high wages to relatively high wages to high-wage workers but relatively low wages to low-wage workers. The few significant effects of foreign workers of the different sex and same occupation and in different occupations were less systematic. Conditional MNE-local wage differentials were almost always positive when significant. Results from large samples of all industries combined indicate a strong tendency for MNEs to pay relatively high wages. However, allowing all slope coefficients to vary among seven industry groups suggests that MNE-local differentials were almost always insignificant in three industries and consistently significant in only one.
O24|Poverty, Obesity, Diabetes: Are They the By-Products of Liberalization of Global Economy?|The paper briefly describes the causes of a global rise in obesity and diabetes. In so doing, it establishes links between (1) poverty and obesity, and (2) obesity and diabetes. The paper also presents data from a survey (N=147) conducted in a depressed economy in Texas where cases of obesity and diabetes are among the highest in the US. The paper argues for a paradigm shift in viewing the role of policymakers in regards to food and pharmaceutical industries, both locally and globally.
O24|Oligarchies And Development In A Global Economy: A Tale Of Two Elites|" type=""main"" xml:id=""ecin12284-abs-0001""> This paper studies how comparative advantage and the political elites' endowments shape long-run performance in economies with imperfect political institutions. The trade regime interacts with industrial policy and regulations on capital mobility in governing capital accumulation. In a capital-scarce economy, capitalist oligarchs striving for import substitution industrialization (ISI) initially shelter the economy from trade, while promoting industrial policies that promote total factor productivity growth in the manufacturing sector. This gradually shifts the comparative advantage toward manufacturing and renders the economy attractive to foreign investors. Allowing for trade and foreign capital inflows are thus complementary policies that spur growth in the capital oligarchy. By contrast, landed oligarchs in a capital-scarce economy favor openness to trade at an early stage of development, neglect industrial policies, and block foreign capital to maximize extractable rents. The policy mix causes the economy to stagnate. Consistent with the experiences of South Korea and Argentina in the postwar era, the model predicts that the success of ISI policies depends crucially on the conditions governing the incentives for capital accumulation.

O24|Predetermined exchange rate, monetary targeting, and inflation targeting regimes|Many works analyzing the Mundell-Fleming dictum compare the predetermined exchange rate regime and the monetary targeting regime under flexible exchange rates. Reflecting on the fact that many emerging market countries have shifted to the regime of inflation targeting, this paper aims to extend the literature to include the inflation targeting regime. The results of our analysis show that the interest rule with an inflation target is superior (or at least equal) to the two abovementioned regimes in absorbing both real and monetary shocks.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O24|EU Trade Preferences and Export Diversification|" type=""main"" xml:id=""twec12354-abs-0001""> Since at least the 1960s, the European Union (EU) has offered various kinds of non-reciprocal trade preferences for developing countries. Originally, these trade preferences had at least two policy goals: (i) to increase export volumes for developing countries and thereby boost their export earnings and (ii) to facilitate export diversification. While extensive research has confirmed that the first of these goals is typically met, the second goal seems to have been largely forgotten by researchers as well as in policy circles. The aim of this paper was therefore to analyse the impact of the EU's non-reciprocal trade preferences for developing countries on export diversification. Our estimation results suggest that some trade preference programmes, such as the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP), lead to increasing ranges of export products. By contrast, preferences offered to Mediterranean countries typically have no significant effects, and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) preferences actually have negative effects towards the end of our time period, suggesting that ACP countries may respond to preferences by specialising into fewer goods."
O24|Special and Differential Treatment for Developing Countries|Special and Differential Treatment for Developing Countries (SDT) constitutes a central feature of the GATT/WTO system. Its formal goal is to foster export-led growth in developing countries. Its theoretical foundations and empirical support are, however, weak at best. In particular, SDT conflicts with the GATT’s two key principles of reciprocity and nondiscrimination, compromising the efficiency of the multilateral trading system. Still, if SDT provisions help those who most need help, sacrificing economic efficiency may be justifiable. However, there are numerous criticisms, on theoretical and empirical grounds, to the premises and the achievements of SDT-based disciplines, casting serious doubt on its effectiveness in helping developing countries trade and grow. For researchers, the good news is that there is plenty of room for progress, with several important areas where our understanding remains unsatisfactory but progress is feasible–that is, where the expected return to research effort seems unusually high.
O24|Trends and Patterns of Growth, Development, Achievements of China and India: A Comparative Analysis|Even before the onset of the 2008 global financial crisis and ongoing European debt crisis, much attention has been given to the re-emergence of the Asian giants, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and India. Both countries have attained unprecedented growth and economic development—PRC and India became the second and fourth largest economies of the world, respectively. Moreover, these countries remarkably improved their per capita income as PRC increased its per capita GDP by 13-fold from US$341 in 1990 to US$4,421 in 2010 whereas India posted a four times growth from US$384 in 1990 to US$1,342 in 2010. This has resulted in a remarkable poverty reduction in the last two to three decades in the two economies. PRC and India share several common characteristics, prospects and challenges. However, their approaches to growth and development as well as growth models have been different. The major objective of this paper is to compare the policies, institutions, strategies, reforms and market conditions that contributed to the rapid growth and development of the PRC and India which can provide lessons to the developing world, particularly emerging economies, that are also struggling to improve their economic development and quality of life amidst economic growth. This paper attempts to examine the differences between PRC and India in terms of trends and patterns of growth and development, economic models, sources and drivers of growth; achievements, policies and institutions since last three decades.

O24|Una Nota sobre la Evolución de la Tasa de Protección Efectiva y la Tasa de Protección Nominal en Colombia (2002 – 2014)|El presente documento tiene como objetivo evaluar el impacto de la política arancelaria en la estructura de protección de 137 ramas industriales, 59 productos agrícolas y 10 productos pecuarios en Colombia para el periodo 2002 y 2014. El análisis se realiza a partir de la Matriz Insumo – Producto del Departamento Nacional de Planeación (2014) y el arancel ponderado por tiempo propuesto por Nieto (2015). Los resultados obtenidos muestran que la Tasa de Protección Efectiva (TPE) y Tasa de Protección Nominal (TPN) tuvieron una tendencia decreciente para el sector industrial a partir de 2009, año a partir del cual Colombia no tuvo la obligación de cumplir con el Arancel Externo Común (AEC) de la Comunidad Andina de Naciones (CAN). En los sectores agrícola y pecuario ambos indicadores mantienen o registran una tendencia creciente.
O24|International Trade and Economic Growth: Causality Relations Within NAFTA|This research explores empirically the causal link between international trade and economic growth within a free trade area. In particular, we use data from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to estimate the causal relationship between economic growth and trade flows, but isolating trade within the bloc from trade with the rest of the world. The period considered is 1960-2014. Our analysis follows three strategies: we investigate Granger causality on a one-country and two-countries basis and then we include the three countries in the same framework, following the identification strategy proposed by Arellano and Bover (1995). We find that both exports cause growth and growth drives exports. This goes in the same direction as that one followed in the literature. However, under the third strategy, we do not find conclusive evidence that supports the idea that trade within a trade bloc is more important for growth than trade with the rest of the world. Moreover, the long run effect is more significant for growth during the whole period than when NAFTA has been active. Regarding the impact of growth on exports, we find that production is important for enhancing exports within NAFTA in both short- and long-run but when the whole period is considered.
O24|Una nota sobre la evolución de la estructura arancelaria de Colombia 2002-2014|El presente documento tiene como objetivo presentar un panorama general sobre el desarrollo de la política arancelaria entre 2002 y 2014. Para ello, se revisó la evolución del Arancel Externo Común (AEC) de la Comunidad Andina de Naciones (CAN) y de las modificaciones normativas recomendadas por el Comité de Asuntos Aduaneros, Arancelarios y de Comercio Exterior. Se concluye que desde el momento en el que Colombia no tuvo la obligación de cumplir con el AEC, el Gobierno nacional pudo realizar una política arancelaria más activa. Además, mediante el cálculo del Arancel Nominal Ponderado por Tiempo, que capta las modificaciones normativas realizadas durante cada año, se muestra que el arancel nominal promedio anual ha tenido tendencia decreciente desde 2008 y que se ubicó en un nivel promedio de 6% en 2014. Finalmente, el inventario de modificaciones normativas elaborado muestra que el arancel nominal es un instrumento de política comercial de vital importancia, ya que permite al Gobierno nacional enfrentar cambios en la dinámica de crecimiento del país.
O24|The Politics of Partial Liberalization: Cronyism and Non-Tariff Protection in Mubarak's Egypt|This paper provides one of the first systematic empirical assessments of the impact of political connections on trade protection. Based on a unique compilation of sector-level data on non-tariff measures (NTMs) and politically connected businessmen in Mubarak-era Egypt, we explore the within-sector variation in NTMs over time, and show that sectors populated by politically connected businessmen witnessed systematically higher incidence and density of non-tariff protection. Our results suggest that the presence of cronies is a strong predictor of the subsequent introduction of NTMs. Crony presence also shapes the density of NTMs as measured by the share of products subject to NTMs. Our results are derived from the robust empirical methods that simultaneously address temporal dependence, fixed effects and endogeneity concerns. To establish causality, we take advantage of the across the board cut in tariffs in the wake of the EU-Egypt free trade agreement in 2004-05 to show that sectors with crony activity were compensated significantly more by new NTMs than non-crony sectors.
O24|Disentangling the Wage Impacts of Offshoring on a Developing Country: Theory and Policy|The various channels through which a reduction in the cost of offshoring can improve wages in a developed country are by now well understood. But does a similar reduction in the offshoring cost also benefit workers in the world's factories in developing countries? Using a parsimonious two-country model of offshoring we find very nuanced results. These include cases where wages monotonically improve or worsen as well as those where wages exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship in response to parametric reductions in the cost of offshoring. We identify qualitative conditions under which wages and welfare increase or decrease in the developing world as a result of a reduction in offshoring costs. Since global welfare always rises with an improvement in offshoring technology, we find that there is a role for a wage tax or a minimum wage in the developing country. We derive the optimal levels of such policies.
O24|Foreign Aid, Public Investment and Capital Market Liberalization|This paper studies the impact of liberalization of capital market on the performance of foreign aid (FA). I consider two cases where FA is transferred to the households and where it is used to finance public investment. Two sources of endogenous productivity growth is considered: (i) public investment (ii) Learning-by-doing generated by tradable sector. Saving is endogenous. I compare two recipient economies with closed and open capital market. I show that transferred-aid reduces productivity and growth through de-industrialization if the capital market is liberalized. In the case of closed capital market transferred-aid can improve the growth (through improving the accumulation of capital) if LBD effect and consumption intensity to N-sector are small. On the contrary, the effect of invested-aid on growth is positive only if the quality of aid is high and the LBD effect and the intensity of public investment to N-sector are low. In this case, the effect of invested-aid on productivity is higher in the case of closed capital market. Nevertheless, productive foreign aid crowds out capital accumulation if capital market is closed while it leads to capital inflow if capital market is open. I show that the impact of invested-aid on GDP is more important for financially liberalized economy if LBD effect is low and private consumption is not very intensive to the N-sector.
O24|Channelizing Afghanistan to Pakistan Informal Trade into Formal Channels|Along with other routes, the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA) is being used by informal traders for smuggling goods into Pakistan. Despite enforcement measures, smuggling continues. Informal traders import goods into Afghanistan, and then route those goods back to Pakistan through informal channels to take advantage from the arbitrage opportunity provided by the differences in applied tariff/taxes between the two countries. Therefore, in addition to strict enforcement measures, the issue of informal trade needs to be handled through incentive measures.
O24|Pakistan's Potential Trade and 'Behind the Border' Constraints|Institutions are source of comparative advantage or disadvantage in international trade. Socio-economic and political constraints also matter for creating comparative advantage and affect the trade pattern of a country. These diverse â€˜beyond the borderâ€™ and â€˜behind the borderâ€™ constraints are often not fully captured in the literature on international trade and institutions. The existence of such institutional, socio-economic, and political constraints to Pakistani exports is empirically investigated in this paper through a cross-sectional analysis employing a trade Stochastic Frontier Gravity Model. Aggregate data for 2006-08 and 2009-11 show lower exports in the latter period. This is attributed to demand-suppressing effects emanating from the 2008 global financial crisis and supply-suppressing effects emanating from energy shortfalls and input constraints, due to floods, in Pakistan. The model estimation then demonstrates that behind the border constraints in Pakistan are statistically significant in explaining total exports during 2009-11. The estimation is also presented for four single-digit SIC categories of products for this period. Behind the border constraints are evident for SIC 0 (agriculture, forestry and fish products) and SIC 2 (manufactured products) that combined account for approximately 80 percent of Pakistanâ€™s exports. The estimation results by country further demonstrate that behind the border constraints affect the pattern of trade through the non-realization of bilateral trade potential. In the post-financial crisis era, Pakistan needs to further develop its institutional capacity to promote competitive exports given the explicit and implicit beyond the border trade barriers it faces and work to remove political obstacles to regional trade.

O24|Armenia’s Economics (1991-2014) And Future Perspectives After Independence|The economic policy of the Soviet Union was managed from a single center that implemented an economic system aimed at achieving economic growth, employment, and development. While on the one hand this central authority attempted to impose particular areas of specialization, it also required some of its constituents to depend on other countries that produced products that were themselves determined by the central economic authority. United to the other Soviet States under this system, Armenia, most of whose resources were in the hands of Moscow, was one of the members of the Soviet Union most affected by the economic dependency that was implemented. The Glasnost and Perestroika policies the Soviet Union adopted in the late 1980’s not only brought to an end the socialist power that had endured for seventy-two years after being established in the 1917 October Revolution; they also destroyed both the Soviet Union, one of the two main actors of the nearly forty-year “Cold War,” and ''The Eastern Bloc'', which had been pioneered by the Soviet Union. As a result, including countries of this block began to declare their independence. Armenia which is one of three countries along with Georgia and Azerbaijan in the South Caucasus Region, declared its independence in 1991 by getting involved in this process. Since independence, Armenia has seen the administration of a permanent war economy, as well as isolation from the international community, due to the occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh. These factors, in addition to corruption and structural problems in the country, have hampered the stable and sustained entry of foreign investment. These developments have also adversely affected the international trade upon which the economy depends. In the present study, an overview and assessment of the Armenian economy will be presented, along with a proposal for the economic future of the country. The authors cite comments on the subject by the Central Bank of Armenia and the official National Statistical Service, as well as by independent international economic institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF; The authors base their study on data from economic organizations that rely on the results of scientific research.
O24|Volatility and Commodity Price Dynamics in Nigeria|This study examines volatility and commodity price dynamics in Nigeria. This was estimated with the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroschedasticity (GARCH) and exponential GARCH, while granger causality test was used to examine the causality direction between domestic commodity prices and spot price of commodity derivatives. The result shows that 30% of volatility in the spot international commodity market can be explained by volatility in domestic and international export commodity prices, while international oil spot prices explains 7% volatility in prices of goods consumed locally and export commodity price index explains 16% of spot price of international commodity between 2000 and 2013 in Nigeria. Inflation and exchange rate is shown to be significantly related to spot price volatility which accounts for its volatility also. Hence, as such, the clamor for a more stable and robust revenue generating sector cannot be over emphasized - the so much talked about diversification.
O24|China’s Economic Growth and Energy Consumption|Economic growth needs to consume large amounts of fossil energy, which will result in greenhouse gas emissions and global climate warming. Therefore, how to save energy and protect environment has become a worldwide problem. This paper establishes an econometric model including labor, fixed capital stock, energy inputs and other explanatory variables based on the Cobb-Douglas production function to empirically analyze the relation between China’s economic growth and energy consumption. Meanwhile, this paper illustrates the relation of China’s carbon dioxide emissions to export trade, too. The study results show that China still promotes economic growth at the costs of high energy consumption and heavily environment pollution. Therefore, how to achieve the transition of a high carbon economy to a low carbon economy will be a fundamental problem that has to solve in China’s future development. To this end, China should participate in international environmental cooperation, promote energy saving and environment conservation
O24|Exporting to bypass weak institutions|Institutions have been shown to be important for trade and growth. In particular, weak institutions may reduce the returns to product quality, harming domestic welfare and making it attractive to export to countries with strong institutions where quality is better rewarded. We model this alternative story as to why the “good apples are shipped out” and explore whether exporting ameliorates the problems created by weak institutions. We find that, instead, because home prices do not reflect the marginal value of quality, access to developed markets can be welfare reducing. Specifically, there are always export prices such that total welfare (and not just consumer welfare) is harmed by exporting. Furthermore, if the domestic price equilibrates to the export price, then the marginal unit exported reduces total welfare. Exporting can even reduce producer surplus, leading to a contraction of the export industry; although, welfare can decrease even if production of the exported good increases. Thus, our results reinforce the importance of strengthening institutions to help the development of economies.
O24|Trading hard hats for combat helmets: The economics of rebellion in eastern Ukraine|Using new micro-level data on violence in Eastern Ukraine, this paper evaluates the relative merits of ‘identity-based’ and ‘economic’ explanations of civil conflict. The first view expects rebellion to be most likely in areas home to the geographic concentration of ethnolinguistic minorities. The second expects more rebel activity where the opportunity costs of insurrection are low. Evidence from the armed conflict in Ukraine supports the second view more than the first. A municipality’s prewar employment mix is a more robust predictor of rebel activity than local ethnolinguistic composition. Municipalities more exposed to trade shocks with Russia experienced a higher intensity of rebel violence throughout the conflict. Such localities also fell under rebel control earlier – and took longer for the government to liberate – than municipalities where the labor force was less dependent on exports to Russia.
O24|Security of property rights and transition in land use|Price and yield uncertainty are traditional considerations in agricultural markets and their impact on development. Agricultural producers in transition economies face an additional risk factor – changes in the institutional protection of property rights. This paper illustrates how institutional uncertainty may affect investment, land use, and crop mix patterns. In particular, in the Ukrainian example, the rights of tenants are viewed as uncertain in anticipation of establishment of an open market for sale of agricultural land. Establishment of the land market in Ukraine has been postponed several times over the last 15 years and a significant number of lease contracts are not formalized. A large panel of farm-level data was used to show that a higher share of rented land is associated with a lower share of land used for investment intensive perennial crops controlling for prices and other factors. The difference in response to uncertainty is found to be significant among three crop types: perennials, grains and oil crops. The implication is that the lower level of protection of use rights and uncertainty regarding the future regulation of land sales market lead to under-investments in more capital intensive crops. As a result, tenants deviate from the optimal crop mix, reducing the productivity of tenant farms. Farms under 200 ha are affected most negatively as they are less likely to be able to access the level of legal and political protection enjoyed by large farms.
O24|Is there really a renminbi bloc in Asia?: A modified Frankel–Wei approach|This paper examines whether the renminbi (RMB) has supplanted the US dollar as the major anchor currency in the implicit currency baskets of East Asian economies. First, we demonstrate that existing techniques to address the problem of severe multicollinearity in estimations of the Frankel–Wei regression model, with the movements in both the US dollar and the RMB included on the right-hand side of the equation, remain limited in providing stable and robust results. We then propose a simple modification of the Frankel–Wei regression model to estimate the RMB weight in an economy's implicit currency basket. We show that this new method yields results that are superior to those obtained by existing techniques. Using the new method, we find that the US dollar continues to be the dominant anchor currency and that there is not yet an RMB bloc in East Asia, contrary to claims made by some recent studies. The RMB has taken on some importance in the implicit currency baskets of several East Asian economies in recent years and this appears to have occurred at the expense of the yen. In short, despite the rising importance of the RMB, it has not eclipsed the US dollar as the dominant anchor currency in East Asia. These conclusions are robust to alternative specifications of the modified Frankel–Wei regression model and the use of a structural break estimation technique.
O24|Currency intervention and the global portfolio balance effect: Japanese lessons|This paper extends the analysis of Bernanke et al. (2004) to show that the official Japanese purchases of foreign exchange in 2003–04 seem to have lowered long-term interest rates not only in the United States, but in a wide range of countries, including Japan. It seems that this decline was triggered by the investment of the intervention proceeds in US bonds and that global portfolio rebalancing spread the resulting decline in US dollar yields to bond markets in other currencies, thus easing global monetary conditions. We also show that the global portfolio balance effect is detectable in the response of yields to large Japanese intervention in data before and after 2003/04, though the effect is weaker. While our findings contribute to a growing body of work that points to common responses across bond markets to official portfolio shifts in the form of large-scale bond purchases (“quantitative easing”), our analysis has the advantage of focusing on a pure portfolio shock.
O24|Macroeconomic effects of the Barcelona Initiative|This paper compares ex post and ex ante assessments of the macroeconomic effects of trade liberalization in the Mediterranean. Using implications from a standard Ramsey growth model augmented for anticipation and implementation effects, we pool cross section and time series data to estimate ex post the effects of trade liberalization on a set of Arabic Southern Mediterranean Partner countries (SMPCs). We find significant and robust evidence for positive effects on major macro variables and discuss the appropriate policies. Second, we review a number of computable general equilibrium (CGE) studies which aimed at assessing the macroeconomic impacts for the same countries ex ante. CGE projections are very much at odds with the econometric findings and the biases seem to be systematic for all macro variables. Third, we use ANOVA techniques to identify possible shortcomings both with respect to design and target country of the CGE study. We find that even well-designed CGE studies targeted to an average type of country do not seem to yield reliable results. Overall, our analysis suggests that there is no sound statistical evidence to believe that CGE analysis has been useful in assessing the macroeconomic effects of trade liberalization in the Mediterranean. But we find considerable econometric evidence to support the view that free trade policies have enhanced growth in the MENA region.
O24|Who really benefits from export processing zones? Evidence from Nicaraguan municipalities|Export processing zones are popular trade policies in developing countries, but there is limited empirical evidence on their local effects. This paper examines the impact of their establishment on the levels of per capita expenditure across Nicaraguan municipalities for the period 1993 to 2009. Using the time and cross-section variation of park openings in a difference-in-differences framework, I find that on average consumption levels increased by 10 to 12% in treated municipalities. Yet, average effects mask significant disparities across the expenditure distribution. The results suggest that the policy benefited the upper-tail the most: expenditure levels increased by up to 25% at the 90th percentile. At the opposite of the distribution, only the bottom decile registered a small positive effect of close to 10% across the period.
O24|Exchange rate misalignment and export diversification in developing countries|The impact of exchange rate misalignment on export diversification in developing countries is highly debated and the empirical evidence is conflicting. However, no deep investigation of such an impact has been provided so far. This paper uses the different explanations to this lack of consensus to investigate the conditions under which misalignment could affect export diversification. While we found some support to the effect of undervaluation on the share of manufactures in total exports, no support is found for an impact of misalignment (neither over nor under valuation) on exports diversification within manufactures. The conclusion resists numerous robustness checks.
O24|Democracy and policy stability|We explain stable growth performance in democracies by characterizing political systems in terms of the distribution of political power across groups, and show when the qualities of policy alternatives are uncertain, greater democracy (decentralization of authority) leads to more stable policy choices. We empirically test this mechanism by creating measures of the inter-temporal variability in fiscal and trade policies. In an array of specifications (cross-sectional, panel with fixed-effects, matching models, instrumental variables, difference-in-difference), we show that policy choices are significantly more stable over time in democracies. This mechanism explains a large part of the negative link between democracy and output volatility.
