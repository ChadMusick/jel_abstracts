Q11|A meta-analysis of the price and income elasticities of food demand|Food demand elasticities are crucial parameters in the calibration of simulation models used to assess the impacts of political reforms or to analyse long-term projections, notably in agricultural sectors. Numerous estimates of these parameters are now available in the economic literature. The main objectives of this work are twofold: we seek first to identify general patterns characterizing the demand elasticities of food products and second to identify the main sources of heterogeneity between the elasticity estimates available in the literature. To achieve these objectives, we conduct a broad literature review of food demand elasticity estimates and perform a meta-regression analysis. Our results reveal the important impacts of income levels on income and price elasticities both at the country (gross domestic product-GDP) and household levels: the higher the income is, the lower the level of elasticities. Food demand responses to changes in income and prices appear to follow different patterns depending on the global regions involved apart from any income level consideration. From a methodological viewpoint, the functional forms used to represent food demand are found to significantly affect elasticity estimates. This result sheds light on the importance of the specification of demand functions, and particularly of their flexibility, in simulation models.
Q11|AGMEMOD outlook for agricultural and food markets in EU member states 2018-2030|Policy, administration and industry need medium-term projections of the expected developments in the agri-food markets for their decision-making processes. The EU Commission presents such projections for the EU as a whole in December of each year. Those projections and their assumptions regarding policy and macroeconomic developments are depicted to the level of individual EU Member States with the exception of Luxembourg, which is included in the figures of Belgium, by applying the partial equilibrium model AGMEMOD. The working paper briefly describes the approach to establish projections for the EU Member States. The projections cover the markets of main agricultural products, in particular for cereals and oilseeds (rapeseed and sunflower seed), livestock (cattle, pigs, goats and sheep), meat (beef, pork, and poultry), milk and dairy products (drinking milk, butter, cheese, skimmed milk powder, whole milk and semi-skimmed milk powder). The outcomes comprise items like areas, livestock numbers, yields, production, trade and use, as well as prices. The individual projection results are displayed in tables.
Q11|The Interplay between Oil and Food Commodity Prices: Has It Changed over Time?|Using time-varying BVARs, we find that oil price increases caused by oil supply shocks did not affect food commodity prices before the start of the millennium, but had positive spillover effects in more recent periods. Likewise, shortfalls in global food commodity supply—resulting from bad harvests—have positive effects on crude oil prices since the early 2000s, in contrast to the preceding era. Remarkably, we also document greater spillover effects of both supply shocks on metals and minerals commodity prices in recent periods, as well as a stronger impact on the own price compared to earlier decades. This (simultaneous) time variation of commodity price dynamics cannot be explained by the biofuels revolution and is more likely the consequence of heightened informational frictions and information discovery in more globalized and financialized commodity markets.
Q11|Firms and Farms: The Local Effects of Farm Income on Firms’ Demand|How do changes in agricultural productivity affect firms? Using the predictions of a simple multi-sector general equilibrium model of the local economy and exploiting weather-induced agricultural volatility across India, I estimate the response of manufacturing firms to changes in agricultural productivity. I show that negative agricultural productivity shocks lower the cost of labor but that this does not cause firms to hire more. Firms’ production and employment in fact decrease because the shocks also reduce local income and hence the demand that firms face. My estimates provide evidence for a significant local demand effect. I then use my framework to show that this has key policy implications. I examine the introduction of a rural workfare program and assess how it affects firms. I show that the program attenuates the impact of negative agricultural shocks on firms because of its counter-cyclical effects on local wage and demand for manufacturing goods. The results highlight how policies that target households and increase their income can affect local market size and therefore the industrial sector through their general equilibrium effects.
Q11|Does Schooling Cause Structural Transformation?|We study how the global schooling increase during the 20th century affected structural transformation by changing the supply of agricultural labor. We develop an analytical model of frictional labor reallocation out of agriculture to infer changes in birth-cohort characteristics from observed data on agricultural employment. Bringing the model to microdata from 52 countries, we find that the increase in schooling was accompanied by a large shift of the labor force’s comparative advantage away from agriculture. We bring empirical evidence to suggest this relationship was causal. With fixed prices, the resulting decrease in the supply of agricultural workers can account for almost half of the observed reallocation out of agriculture. However, in general equilibrium, the net effect is ambiguous.

Q11|Modelling returns and volatility connectedness between food prices and exchange rate in Nigeria|This study measures the connectedness between food prices and exchange rate in Nigeria using the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) approach. Using weekly data from January 2012 to January 2019 on five major food prices â€“ rice, maize, millet gari and sorghum, and naira to dollar exchange rate, the study tests for spillovers transmission between food prices and Nigeria domestic currency against the most traded foreign currency - US dollar. The paper finds evidence of interdependence among the food prices and exchange rate based on the obtained spillover indexes. The study further accounts for the 2016 naira to dollar exchange rate crash. The results show that the huge depreciation in the exchange rate have a greater spillover effects on the food prices with this finding is robust to varying lag structure and VAR lag order.
Q11|Rising Market Concentration and the Decline of Food Price Shock Pass-Through to Core Inflation|Using a vector autoregression that allows for time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility, we show that U.S. core inflation became 75 percent less responsive to shocks in food prices since the late 1970s. The decline in the pass-through of food price shocks to inflation is a result of a decline in both volatility and the persistence of food price changes in inflation. This decline in pass-through coincides with a period of increasing concentration in the food supply chain, especially among U.S. grocery retailers and distributors. We find that 60 percent of the variation in pass-through over the last four decades can be explained by changes in food retailers’ and distributors’ market concentration. Controlling for the composition of the food basket and inflation expectations explains an additional 20 percent of the variation. {{p}} Our results suggest that if the market concentration of food retailers and distributors continues to increase and inflation expectations remain well-anchored, the pass-through of food price shocks to inflation will likely remain subdued.
Q11|Business Cycle during Structural Change: Arthur Lewis' Theory from a Neoclassical Perspective|We document that the nature of business cycles evolves over the process of development and structural change. In countries with large declining agricultural sectors, aggregate employment is uncorrelated with GDP. During booms, employment in agriculture declines while labor productivity increases in agriculture more than in other sectors. We construct a unified theory of business cycles and structural change consistent with the stylized facts. The focal point of the theory is the simultaneous decline and modernization of agriculture. As capital accumulates, agriculture becomes increasingly capital intensive as modern agriculture crowds out traditional agriculture. Structural change accelerates in booms and slows down in recessions. We estimate the model and show that it accounts well for both the structural transformation and the business cycle fluctuations of China.
Q11|China’s grains policy: Impacts of alternative reform options|Reforming China’s grain policy could have significant implications for both domestic and international markets. China has begun to reform its price support policies for several commodities, replacing them with commodity specific area payments. The assessment of policy reform scenarios for grains, using two partial equilibrium models, show that China would maintain more than 80% of self-sufficiency in wheat and maize, and more than 95% in rice. The increase in its grain imports could increase international prices, in particular for wheat and rice. A gradual approach to reforming market price support with compensatory payments would smooth the potential impacts on domestic and world commodity markets, as well as on domestic farm income. While the reform of price support policies benefit consumers the most, more decoupled area payments could also have a greater impact on farm income without increasing the overall cost to society as well as environmental performance of agriculture. Lower costs of managing public grain stocks would equally reduce the budgetary cost of reforms.
Q11|From Twitter to GDP: Estimating Economic Activity From Social Media|Using all geo-located image tweets shared on Twitter in 2012-2013, I find that the volume of tweets is a valid proxy for estimating current GDP in USD at the country level. Residuals from my preferred model are negatively correlated to a data quality index, indicating that my estimates of GDP are more accurate for countries with more reliable GDP data. Comparing Twitter with more commonly-used proxy of night-light data, I find that variation in Twitter activity explains slightly more of the cross-country variance in GDP. I also exploit the continuous time and geographic granularity of social media posts to create monthly and weekly estimates of GDP for the US, as well as sub- national estimates, including those economic areas that span national borders. My findings suggest that Twitter can be used to measure economic activity in a more timely and more spatially disaggregate way than conventional data and that governments’ statistical agencies could incorporate social media data to complement and further reduce measurement error in their official GDP estimates.

From a methodological viewpoint, the functional forms used to represent food demand are found to significantly affect elasticity estimates. This result sheds light on the importance of the specification of demand functions, and particularly of their flexibility, in simulation models.
Q11|The Impact of Food Prices on Conflict Revisited|Studies that examine the impact of food prices on conflict usually assume that (all) changes in international food prices are exogenous shocks for individual countries or local areas. By isolating strictly exogenous shifts in global food commodity prices, we show that this assumption could seriously distort estimations of the impact on conflict in African regions. Specifically, we show that increases in food prices that are caused by harvest shocks outside Africa raise conflict significantly, whereas a “naive” regression of conflict on international food prices uncovers an inverse relationship. We also find that higher food prices lead to more conflict in regions with more agricultural production. Again, we document that failing to account for exogenous price changes exhibits a considerable bias in the impact. In addition, we show that the conventional approach to evaluate such effects; that is, estimations that include time fixed effects, ignores an important positive baseline effect that is common for all regions.
Q11|Climate and Weather Impacts on Agriculture: The Case of Brazil|The worldâ€™s population will rise exponentially in the coming decades, increasing the demand for food and challenging the agricultural sector to ensure food security. Due to the importance of climate conditions for agriculture, this article analyzed two different hypotheses regarding climate impacts on agricultural markets in Brazil. First, farmers only observe the average climate conditions of their region when deciding the type and amount of crop or animal to grow or raise. Second, weather diversions from normal climate conditions cause farmers to deviate from optimal profits. Neither hypothesis was rejected by the data. The 2006 estimated loss from rainfall anomalies was 12.8 billion dollars (in 2014 values).
Q11|Mobile Phones and Mozambique Traders: What is the Size of Reduced Search Costs and Who Benefits?|We investigate to what extent the roll-out of the mobile phone network in Mozambique reduced transport costs and search costs, and thereby decreased spatial price dispersion and improved market efficiency. Estimations are based on data of transport costs of maize grain and maize market prices. The mobile phone rollout explains a 10%-13% reduction in maize price dispersion. Around half of this reduction is associated with search costs related to transport, the other half with other search costs, for example for the collection of maize in source markets. Search costs are substantial and also a substantial component of total transport costs. Benefits of increased market efficiency are biased towards consumer markets. Results are robust for non-random rollout of the mobile phone network and several other threats.
Q11|The Persistent Effects of Monsoon Rainfall Shocks in India: A Nonlinear VAR Approach|We examine the effects of monsoon rainfall shocks on agricultural output, wages, and prices in India. The effects are highly asymmetric: agricultural output falls by 16% after a negative shock, but a positive shock has no significant effects. Although the drop in agricultural output is very short-lived, it elicits a persistent decline (increase) in wages (food prices). This indicates that famines are caused by a persistent disruption in food acquisition, rather than by a shortage in food supply.
Q11|Trade and dietary diversity in Eastern Europe and Central Asia|In public and academic debates, the linkages between agricultural markets and nutrition across the world are vividly discussed. This paper contributes to the ongoing debate by analyzing the relationship between greater openness to trade and dietary diversity. It focuses on the post-communist countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia where trade reforms as part of the economic and political transition provide a natural experiment for studying the effects of trade openness on agricultural markets and consumer behaviour. Reduction in trade barriers, for instance in the context of the accession to the WTO and the EU, and the gradual integration with world markets after 1991 had implications for diets through changes in production, prices and incomes. We utilize country-level panel data for 26 post-communist countries in the period 1996-2013 to assess the effects of trade costs, openness to trade and incomes on dietary diversity measured by the Shannon entropy index. The results arising from fixed effects and instrumental variables estimation are consistent with previous findings that income growth affects dietary diversity positively and provide novel evidence that trade barriers reduce variety of products available in domestic markets, in particular fruits and vegetables.
Q11|AGMEMOD Outlook for Agricultural and Food Markets in EU Member States 2018-2030| Policy, administration and industry need medium-term projections of the expected developments in the agri-food markets for their decision-making processes.

Q11|Is there a Latin American agricultural growth pattern? Factor endowments and productivity in the second half of the twentieth century|In this article we discuss whether there was a single Latin American pattern of agricultural growth between 1950 and 2008. We analyse the sources of growth of agricultural production and productivity in ten Latin American countries. Our results show that the differences between these countries are too strong to establish a single pattern for this region. However, certain common trends may be observed, such as the growing importance of labour productivity to explain agricultural production growth and the increasing importance of TFP to explain agricultural labour productivity growth.
Q11|Experts, Reputation and Umbrella Effects: Empirical Evidence from Wine Prices|We investigate the relationship between external quality evaluation via experts, firm reputation and product prices and extend the existing empirical literature in three dimensions. First, we empirically account for endogenous reputation effects. An increase in quality has an immediate positive impact on product prices but also improves the reputation of a firm, which contributes to higher prices in the future. Secondly, we analyse umbrella effects of reputation: investments in product quality of the ’top product‘ are particularly profitable as they also generate a ’ reputational dividend‘ for other products with lower quality. And finally, we investigate selection effects in expert evaluations. Experts typically evaluate a selection of products only and we find endogenous selection effects to be important for analysing product quality empirically.
Q11|Resistant grape varieties and market acceptance:an evaluation based on experimental economics|We analyze consumers’ evaluations of white wines from resistant varieties, produced in the Languedoc winegrowing region of France (2016 vintage). We use the results from a laboratory experiment performed in Paris in June 2017, where a panel of more than one hundred and sixty consumers, regular buyers of this type of wine, were asked to evaluate a wine of the Bouquet 3159 grape variety (monogenic variety resistant to mildew and powdery mildew and optimized for quality) and compare it with two conventional wines of different quality levels, and with a certified organic wine of similar type and price. The environmental and health performances and the production methods of the different wines were quantified according to several indicators: treatment frequency indicator (TFI) and pesticide residue analysis.\r\nThe consumers first evaluated the wines after tasting, having been given only a minimum amount of information about the region of origin and the vintage, then again after receiving information on production methods and the levels of our indicators. The method used to lend credibility to individual valuations used experimental economics, via a mechanism based on direct disclosure of their willingness to pay (maximum purchase price for a bottle of wine according to available information). The results showed that, on a purely sensory level, consumers had difficulty in accepting wine from a resistant variety. We were then able to see that communication focusing on environmental and health performances very much improved the position of the resistant variety of wine, putting it ultimately at the top of the average qualitative evaluations. In economic terms, we show that this promotion results in high market share, gained from conventional wines. Market share losses were lower, however, for the premium conventional wine, suggesting that the higher quality wines would be less directly challenged by wines produced from resistant varieties.
Q11|Nutrition transition and the structure of global food demand| Estimating future demand for food is a critical aspect of global food security analyses. The process linking dietary changes to wealth is known as the nutrition transition and presents well-identified features that help to predict consumption changes in poor countries. This study proposes to represent the nutrition transition with a nonhomothetic, flexible-in-income, demand system, known as the Modified Implicitly Directly Additive Demand System (MAIDADS). The resulting model is transparent and estimated statistically based on cross-sectional information from FAOSTAT the statistical database of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. It captures the main features of the nutrition transition: rise in demand for calories associated with income growth; diversification of diets away from starchy staples; and a large increase in caloric demand for animal-based products, fats, and sweeteners. The estimated model is used to project food demand between 2010 and 2050 based on a set of plausible futures (trend projections and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios). The main results of these projections are as follows: (1) global food demand will increase by 46 percent, less than half the growth in the previous four decades; (2) this growth will be attributable mainly to lower-middle-income and low-income countries; (3) the structure of global food demand will change over the period, with a 95 percent increase in demand for animal-based calories and a much smaller 18 percent increase in demand for starchy staples; and (4) the analysis of a range of population and income projections reveals important uncertainties depending on the scenario, the projected increases in demand for animal-based and vegetal-based calories range from 78 to 109 percent and from 20 to 42 percent, respectively.
Q11|Forecasting Bordeaux wine prices using state-space methods| Generic Bordeaux red wine (basic claret) can be regarded as being similar to an agricultural commodity. Production volumes are substantial, they are traded at high frequency and the quality of the product is relatively homogeneous. Unlike other commodities and the top-end wines (which represent only 3% of the traded volume), there is no futures market for generic Bordeaux wine. Reliable forecasts of prices can to large extent replace this information deficiency and improve the functioning of the market. We use state-space methods with monthly data to obtain a univariate forecasting model for the average price. The estimates highlight the stochastic trend and the seasonality present in the evolution of the price over the period 1999 to 2016. The model predicts the path of wine prices out of sample reasonably well, suggesting that this approach is useful for making reasonably accurate forecasts of future price movements.
Q11|The Economic Effects of the Abolition of Serfdom: Evidence from the Russian Empire|We document substantial increases in agricultural productivity, industrial output, and peasants' nutrition in Imperial Russia as a result of the abolition of serfdom in 1861. Before the emancipation, provinces where serfs constituted the majority of agricultural laborers lagged behind provinces that primarily relied on free labor. The emancipation led to a significant but partial catch up. Better incentives of peasants resulting from the cessation of ratchet effect were a likely mechanism behind a relatively fast positive effect of reform on agricultural productivity. The land reform, which instituted communal land tenure after the emancipation, diminished growth in productivity in repartition communes.
Q11|Measuring the Impact of Agricultural Production Shocks on International Trade Flows|The purpose of this study is to measure the sensitivity of traded quantities and trade unit values to agricultural production shocks. We develop a general equilibrium model of trade in which production shocks in exporting countries affect both traded quantities and trade unit values. The model includes per-unit trade costs and develops a methodology to quantify their size exploiting the trade unit value data. Using bilateral trade flow data for a large sample of countries and agricultural commodities we find that the intensive margin of trade is relatively inelastic to production shocks, with a 1 percent increase in production leading to a 0.5 percent increase in exports. We also find that per-unit trade costs are large, comprising 15 to 20 percent of import unit values on average. Overall, our results suggest that there is room for improving trade as a mechanism for coping with food production volatility.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q11|The Dynamics of Supply: U.S. Corn and Soybeans in the Biofuel Era|We estimate U.S. corn and soybean supply responses by exploiting the large exogenous price variations associated with implementation of the Renewable Fuel Standard. We focus on recent years and on the 12 U.S. midwestern states and estimate a system of dynamic equations that is consistent with the role of crop rotation. Corn and soybean acreages respond more in the short run than in the long run. Cross-price elasticities of acreage responses are negative and fairly large in absolute value such that, when corn and soybean prices move together, the response of total acreage allocated to these two crops is extremely inelastic.
Q11|L'agriculture de la Cote d'Ivoire a la loupe|The agricultural sector occupies a central place in CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoireâ€™s economy and development. This report provides a unique and detailed description of the state of the Ivorian agricultural sector, including all agricultural value chains of the country. Agricultural, livestock and fishery productions are reviewed and their dynamics, opportunities and constraints are analysed. Finally, the report revises all agricultural policies and development programs implemented since the 1990s in CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire as well as the future ones.

Q11|The Value of Terroir. A historical analysis of Bordeaux and Champagne geographical indications|Previous studies on the value of terroir, or more generally geographical indications (GI), used hedonic techniques. We use historical data and exploit temporal and geographical variations in the introduction of wine GIs in early twentieth century France to study the impact on the price of specific wines in the years and decades following their introduction. We find large effects of GIs on prices of some Champagne wines, but no significant impact on Bordeaux or other Champagne wines.
Q11|Agricultural Price Shocks And Business Cycles: A Global Warning For Advanced Economies|For a panel of 75 countries, we find that increases in global agricultural commodity prices that are caused by unfavorable harvest shocks in other regions of the world significantly curtail domestic economic activity. The effects are much larger than for average global agricultural price shifts. The impact is also considerably stronger in high-income countries, despite the lower shares of food in household expenditures these countries have compared to low-income countries. On the other hand, we find weaker effects in countries that are net exporters of agricultural products, have higher shares of agriculture in GDP or lower shares of non-agricultural trade in GDP; that is, characteristics that typically apply to low-income countries. When we control for these country characteristics, we find indeed that the effects on economic activity become smaller when income per capita is higher. Overall, our findings imply that the consequences of climate change on advanced economies are likely larger than previously thought.

Abstract This paper identifies the determinants of supply of live cattle for fattening identified in the department of Sucre, Colombia, 2007—2015, under the approach of the Autoregressive Distributed Lag model. The primary supply responds negatively to risk—climate and risk—price in the long and short term; positively to the raw milk price and to the regional slaughter; unlike the final supply, there is no inverse relationship in the primary supply with the short term price which would show the ‘short—term’ vision of marketers, or structural changes in the cattle cycle by the generalization of dual purpose production system.

INTRODUCCIÓN La industria de la carne bovina se divide en tres etapas de acuerdo con la fase de crecimiento del ganado: 1) la producción de la vaca con el ternero; 2) el levante y la ceba; 3) el sacrificio de ganado cebado y embalaje de la carne. En la primera, los productores ganaderos crían una vaca para producir y venden un ternero; el levante es la etapa que transcurre entre el destete y el período de ceba o el primer servicio, que debe producirse cuando el animal alcanza un peso equivalente al 55 o 60% del peso adulto; la ceba es el engorde, en la que el productor ganadero asume la alimentación de los ganados jóvenes por varios meses hasta que estén listos para llevarlos a sacrificio con un peso entre 400—450 kilogramos; la tercera etapa es el sacrificio del ganado gordo, el embalaje y la distribución de la carne. El modelo empresarial de producción de carne vacuna predominante en el departamento de Sucre no es homogéneo: algunas unidades productivas integran dos etapas de la producción: la cría y la ceba, proveyéndose de la materia prima principal —el ternero— con la producción de la misma unidad productiva procedente de la primera etapa. Otras, compran la materia prima principal en mercados organizados, o en explotaciones de cría para hacer ceba intermedia, o completa. La principal fuente de provisión del ganado de levante de estas últimas han sido las subastas ganaderas. En una gran proporción —alrededor del 81% en promedio, según OPCA (2016)—, el ganado vendido en las subastas fueron animales machos de primera calidad de menos de 1 año hasta 1¾ de año, con peso medio entre 120—240 kilogramos, procedente del productor y/o del comercializador. Sobre cuáles son los factores que influyen el comportamiento de esta oferta primaria de ganado vacuno en pie para cebar en la región, se ha indagado poco. El objetivo de este artículo es identificar factores relacionados con su evolución a largo y corto plazo durante el período 2007—2015, mediante la estimación de un modelo econométrico de series de tiempo que los asocie. Abordar este tema proporciona evidencia empírica adicional para contrastar la relación teórica entre la oferta del principal insumo para cebar y sus factores determinantes; por tanto, ayuda a comprender la dinámica del mercado de ganado vacuno regional de levante, y contribuye a evaluar los posibles impactos que podrían generar cambios de dichas variables en la oferta final de ganado para sacrificio. Con tal propósito, luego de esta introducción, el presente informe se estructura de la siguiente manera: se presentan elementos teóricos y empíricos existentes del tema en forma general; se evalúa las características del proceso estocástico generador de los datos, y en la parte final se estima un modelo econométrico autorregresivo con retardos distribuidos, ARDL, para identificar la presencia de relaciones de largo y de corto plazo entre la oferta primaria y las variables que la influyen. 2. ELEMENTOS TEÓRICOS Y EMPÍRICOS La función de oferta total agraria se refiere a la relación analítica existente entre la oferta de un producto agrario y los factores determinantes de esta. Los factores considerados teóricamente como tales son: el precio de los factores o insumos de producción; los cambios en la rentabilidad de actividades competentes; el precio de los productos conjuntos o co—productos; el riesgo, asociado a la variación del clima y de los precios, y factores institucionales (Tomek y Robinson, 2005, pp. 68—78; Castillo, 2015, pp. 197—201). El precio pagado al productor agrario influye la oferta del producto, pues es de esperar que —si los otros factores que afectan la oferta permanecen constantes, y si el costo marginal de producción es creciente—, entre mayor (menor) sea el precio mayor (menor) es la disposición del productor a ofrecer una cantidad mayor de producto. Los principales hallazgos empíricos de la literatura internacional en este tema de la sensibilidad de la oferta agraria al precio han sido resumidos por Mundlak (2000, p. 394; 2001, p. 48). La investigación de orden nacional sobre oferta ganadera destinada a sacrificio ha sido abordada por Kalmanovitz (1982), Lorente (1978), UEA—DNP (1980), Hertford y Nores (1982), García (1983), Jaramillo y Caicedo (1996), bajo el influjo de Jarvis (1974). Estos autores utilizan como indicador la oferta interna final o de consumo (sacrificio + exportaciones), o una medida relativa: la tasa de extracción. Como Jarvis, identifican una relación positiva de largo plazo con el precio, y una relación inversa de corto plazo, como expresión del ciclo ganadero de la ceba. El riesgo se refiere a una situación de aleatoriedad peligrosa para el agricultor: una sequía intensa, una inundación, un ataque de plagas y/o de enfermedades a plantas y animales, la inestabilidad de los precios, cambios de políticas, etc. (OECD, 2009, pp. 15—25). El riesgo—precio y el riesgo—clima están asociados a la naturaleza biológica de la producción agraria y a su dependencia del clima, a la vez que juegan un importante papel en la determinación de la oferta en el corto plazo. La evidencia empírica en el examen del impacto del riesgo sobre la oferta agraria ha sido resumida en Moschini y Hennessy (2001 pp. 87—153), en el que destacan: primero, que la incertidumbre en la producción agraria es una de las razones para el estudio de la producción bajo riesgo; segundo, como lo predice la teoría, se espera que el productor averso al riesgo produzca menos que el productor neutral al riesgo, ceteris paribus; por ende, existe una relación inversa entre riesgo y oferta; tercero, la inclusión del riesgo en los modelos econométricos de estimación de la función de oferta sugiere que el impacto del precio se vuelve más importante, es decir, cuando se tiene en cuenta el riesgo, la oferta es más sensible al precio. La técnica de producción ganadera predominante en la región es la del pastoreo en praderas naturales, en el cual el animal es alimentado con pasturas. Bajo estas condiciones, el riesgo—clima tiene efectos importantes sobre las pasturas y los animales: (i) la precipitación afecta la distribución y cantidad de pasto, los déficits hídricos disminuyen la oferta de alimento, lo cual retarda el crecimiento físico de los animales y les hace perder peso, y (ii) la ausencia o el exceso de la lluvia afecta la predisposición del animal al contagio o ataque de enfermedades y/o plagas, lo cual aumenta la tasa de morbilidad y mortalidad (Herrera, 1995). En ambas situaciones, la variabilidad climática puede generar impactos adversos sobre la producción y la oferta ganaderas. La orientación productiva de la ganadería vacuna en la región es el doble propósito (Dane, 2014). Este sistema es un caso de producción múltiple o conjunta, esto es, se obtienen varios productos utilizando los mismos insumos y factores de producción o, al menos, factores e insumos comunes. La leche es un co—producto de la carne de ganado pues son creados en el mismo proceso y al mismo tiempo. La teoría económica sugiere que el precio del co—producto influencia la oferta del otro producto en sentido directo: el aumento del precio de la leche representa un estímulo para los ganaderos, que optarían por aumentar su inventario o mejorar la nutrición y la salud de las reses, lo cual se traduciría en aumento del número de terneros. La oferta primaria de ganado de levante para cebar es afectada por el ciclo ganadero. La demanda para sacrificio del ganado cebado está influenciada por el diferencial o margen entre el precio de la carne vacuna y el precio del ganado cebado en pie. Entre mayor sea el diferencial de precio, es de esperar una mayor demanda de ganado cebado para sacrificio (Parra y Gómez, 2008, pp. 10—11). En el corto plazo, sin embargo, dada una expectativa de mayor rentabilidad futura por el incremento del precio de la carne, el productor de ganado cebado tiende a retener, especialmente hembras y machos jóvenes (Jarvis, 1974) esperando que se valoricen en el mercado. En esta fase de retención disminuye el sacrificio; al escasear el ganado cebado para sacrificio, se acentúa la demanda por ganado de levante, lo cual lo valoriza relativamente, y ello afecta a la oferta primaria vía precio. La respuesta del productor—cebador conduciría a reducir ventas de machos y hembras jóvenes, pero la de un comercializador podría conducir a aumentarlas para ganar un diferencial de precios alto entre el de la subasta y el del sitio de compra en campo. El precio de los insumos es determinante de la oferta agraria. Teóricamente, a nivel del productor individual, la reducción del precio de un insumo implica una reducción de su costo medio, lo cual significa que, si todo lo demás permanece constante, se reduce el costo medio de producción, desplazándose la curva de costo medio hacia abajo. La curva de costo marginal se desplaza hacia adelante como expresión de que la nueva relación precio del insumo—precio del producto ha disminuido; esto es, se ha abaratado el precio relativo del insumo, lo cual incrementa la cantidad usada de este y la cantidad de producto óptima, como lo indica la teoría microeconómica clásica del productor (Hudson, 2007:43—44). Esta nueva curva de costo marginal intercepta a la nueva curva de costo medio disminuida en su nivel más bajo, que constituye la curva de oferta de largo plazo. Como la oferta de mercado es la suma de las ofertas individuales, aumenta la oferta total. Por tanto, la relación entre el precio del insumo y la oferta es inversa. 3. METODOLOGÍA Para estimar el modelo econométrico que relaciona las variables en estudio se procedió así: Primero, se examinó las propiedades subyacentes del proceso que genera las variables de series de tiempo. Esto es, se determinó si el proceso estocástico (aleatorio) subyacente que generó la serie de tiempo de las variables en cuestión es estacionario o no en media y varianza. Para ello se aplicó la prueba de raíz unitaria de Dickey—Fuller con mínimos cuadrados generalizados destendencializados, propuesta por Elliot, Rothemberg y Stock, ERS (1996), conocida por su sigla en inglés como DF—GLS. Básicamente, esta prueba implica la estimación de la ecuación del test de Dickey—Fuller, aumentada después de sustituir los valores originales de las variables en investigación, yt, por los valores destendencializados de la regresión mínimo cuadrática generalizada, ytd: Donde ytd es la serie examinada destendencializada. La hipótesis nula de existencia de una raíz unitaria en las primeras diferencias de la serie se rechaza si la estimación de ? en la ecuación (1) cae por debajo de los valores críticos propuestos por ERS (1996). Segundo, ya que se trata de estimar relaciones de largo y corto plazo mediante un modelo econométrico dinámico, se realizó la prueba de causalidad de Granger (1969). Esta prueba parte de la idea de que el futuro no puede predecir al pasado; de este modo, si una variable x causa a otra variable y, los cambios en la primera deben preceder a los cambios en la segunda. Por consiguiente, en una regresión de la variable y sobre x , si se incluyen valores pasados de x esto mejora significativamente la predicción de y. Se dice entonces que x causa a y (a la manera de Granger). Aplica una definición similar si y causa a x. La dirección de la causalidad puede incluso ir en ambas direcciones (Gujarati y Porter, 2009). Tercero, el establecimiento de relaciones empíricas entre la oferta y sus determinantes se hizo utilizando el modelo autorregresivo con retardos distribuidos, ARDL (por sus siglas en inglés Autoregressive Distributed Lag). Este enfoque es apropiado para investigar la existencia de relaciones de largo plazo en muestras pequeñas (menos de 80 observaciones) y entre series de tiempo de diferente orden de integración, a diferencia de las técnicas de cointegración de enfoque bivariado de Engle y Granger (1987) y multivariado de Johansen (1995), las cuales exigen que las variables sean integradas todas de orden uno. Este enfoque fue desarrollado por Pesaran y Shin (1999) y Pesaran, Shin y Smith (2001); sin embargo, es necesario que ninguna de estas sea integrada de orden dos, ya que estos datos anulan la metodología. En este sentido, el modelo ARDL utilizado es: ?Q = variación de la oferta de ganado macho para ceba; P = el precio del ganado vivo en el mercado; S = sacrificio de vacunos en el Caribe colombiano; Rc = el riesgo—clima; Pl = el precio de la leche; Rp= riesgo—precio. Las expresiones t — j, t — k, t — l, t — i, t — h, t — u, representan la longitud máxima del número de retardos apropiados para las variables1. ?j, ?k, ?l, ?i, ?h, ?u son los coeficientes de corto plazo a estimar. ?1, ?2, ?3, ?4, ?5, ?6, son los coeficientes de largo plazo. ?1t es el término de error; ln = logaritmo natural. Dado que las variables se expresan en logaritmo natural, los coeficientes a estimar son elasticidades y tasas de crecimiento. Seleccionada la estructura del modelo, se aplica la prueba Multiplicador de Lagrange, LM, de Breusch—Godfrey (1978) con el fin de probar la ausencia de correlación serial en los errores de la ecuación (2). Comprobado lo anterior, se realizó la prueba Límites (Bounds Test), propuesta por Pesaran, Shin & Smith (2001), basada en un estadístico estándar. Esta es una prueba de cointegración que contrasta la ausencia de una relación de largo plazo, esto es, prueba la hipótesis nula: H0: ?1 = ?2 = ?3 = ?4 = ?5 = ?6 = 0 en la ecuación (2), contra la alterna HA: no es cierto. Un rechazo de H0 implica que se tiene una relación de cointegración de largo plazo. Si los resultados dan evidencia de una relación de largo plazo, se estima la función de cointegración de largo y corto plazo, las cuales se definen, respectivamente, así: La ecuación (4) es estimada con las variables en diferencias, y el coeficiente ? de zt—1 indica la velocidad del ajuste hacia el equilibrio de largo plazo, que se espera sea significativo y negativo. Para medir la repuesta de la oferta agraria a distintos factores, este enfoque ha sido utilizado por Muchapondwa (2009) en el caso de la oferta agregada de los cultivos en Zimbawe; Ogundari (2016) del maíz a los precios en Nigeria; Ozkan y Karaman (2011) del área de algodón en Turquía; Wyk y Treurnicht (2012) en la oferta de carne de oveja; Maleki et al. (2012) en la oferta de exportación de carne en Irán. En cuanto a la información, la oferta primaria se midió como la cantidad mensual vendida de ganado vacuno macho en pie de primera calidad entre las edades menos de 1 a 1¾ de año en subastas comerciales en el departamento de Sucre, procedente de la unidad productiva ganadera y/o de un comercializador. El precio del producto es un promedio ponderado por las cantidades de las edades consideradas; la unidad de medida es pesos corrientes por kilogramo de ganado vivo, obtenido del Observatorio de precios y costos agrarios del noroccidente del Caribe colombiano, OPCA, de la Universidad de Córdoba, Colombia. La información de las precipitaciones pluviales proviene del Instituto de Hidrología, Meteorología y Estudios Ambientales, IDEAM (2016); a partir de ella se construyó el coeficiente de variación de las precipitaciones mensuales, como proxy al riesgo—clima. El riesgo—precio se midió como la desviación típica de una media móvil de tres meses del precio por kilogramo, propuesto por Behrman (1968). El sacrificio de vacunos en el Caribe colombiano, medido en número de animales, se utilizó como una variable proxy al ciclo de la ceba en la región, y proviene de las encuestas de sacrificio de ganado vacuno del DANE (2015). El precio del co—producto es el precio de la leche cruda pagada al productor por la industria en el departamento de Sucre, obtenido del Ministerio de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural (MADR, 2015), y expresado en pesos corrientes por litro de leche cruda. Para medir la incidencia del precio del insumo se tomó la relación precio de la úrea/precio del ganado en pie. Como una aproximación a la rentabilidad de productos competentes se utilizó el precio relativo del arroz. Ninguna de estas dos últimas variables resultó significativa. La periodicidad de las variables utilizadas es mensual durante el periodo 2007M1—2015M12. Se utilizó el software Econometric—Views, Versión 9.5, para los cálculos del modelo. 4. RESULTADOS Y ANÁLISIS 4.1. Estacionariedad y causalidad a lo Granger La tabla 1 muestra el cálculo del estadístico de la prueba DF—GLS en la ecuación (1). El resultado de las variables originales en niveles permite rechazar la hipótesis nula de la existencia de raíz unitaria en las series Q, Rc y Pl, por tanto, son integradas de orden cero, I(0) . En el caso de las variables P, Rp, y S, la hipótesis nula se rechaza en primeras diferencias, lo que significa que son integradas de orden 1, I(1). Los resultados de la prueba de causalidad a lo Granger2 indican que se rechaza al 1% de significación la hipótesis nula: las variaciones de P, Rc, Rp y S no causan las variaciones de la oferta con 2, 2,3 y 6 retardos, respectivamente; en el caso de Pl se aceptó la hipótesis nula. 4.2. Modelo de la oferta del ganado vacuno macho en pie para cebar Estructura del modelo La especificación del número de retardos de la variable dependiente oferta de ganado macho de primera calidad, Q, tuvo un máximo apropiado de 3 retardos, y 4 para las demás variables regresoras. La estructura seleccionada es: (1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2); es decir: 1 retardo para Q; Pl = 2; P = 2; Rc = 4; Rp = 4 y S = 2. Los resultados de la prueba LM sobre los errores de la estimación de la ecuación (2) con 4 retardos incluidos para la oferta mostraron un p—valor mayor al nivel de significancia del 5% (p—valor = 0,9184). Por tanto, se acepta la hipótesis nula de no correlación en los residuos. Prueba Límites (Bounds Test) La tabla 2 muestra los resultados de la prueba Límites. Indica que existe una fuerte evidencia para rechazar la hipótesis nula de que los coeficientes de largo plazo son cero (?1 = ?2 = ?3 = ?4 = ?5 = ?6 = 0) pues el F calculado, igual a 10,34 con 5 grados de libertad (k=5), supera los valores críticos de los límites superiores en el nivel de significancia del 1%. El modelo de largo y corto plazo de oferta de ganado para ceba La estimación del modelo de oferta de largo y corto plazo del ganado macho para cebar comercializado en las subastas del departamento de Sucre, con las variables en niveles y en primeras diferencias respectivamente, se muestra en la tabla 3. La relación de cointegración de largo plazo muestra que la oferta primaria responde de manera negativa y significativa al riesgo—clima: un aumento o una disminución del 10% en la desviación estándar de las precipitaciones con respecto a su media mensual genera una disminución en el largo plazo de la oferta de ganado macho del 4,9% en promedio. Para el conjunto de la producción agraria en Colombia, Jaramillo y Junguito (1993) identificaron esa relación inversa. En el corto plazo, la tabla 3 indica que las ventas de ganado macho para cebar está influenciada en sentido positivo y de manera significativa (al 1% de significación) por las siguientes variables: (i) Las variaciones de su precio: un aumento (o disminución) del 5% en el precio por kilo del mes anterior aumenta (o disminuye) en 9,2% la oferta del mes siguiente. (ii) los cambios en el sacrificio regional de ganado vacuno en el mes corriente y en el anterior: un aumento del 10% en el sacrificio de ganado vacuno en el mes pasado y en el de hoy produce un aumento contemporáneo de las cantidades ofertadas de ganado macho de 6,5% y 5,6%, respectivamente. (iii) Las variaciones del precio de la leche cruda (aunque con menos rigor estadístico, significativa al 5%): una variación del 1% en su precio en el mes anterior provoca que la oferta corriente de ganado de levante varíe en 0,6%. El primer resultado3, señalado como (i), contrasta con la relación que se ha encontrado en la investigación a nivel nacional cuando se considera la oferta final de ganado cebado para sacrificio en la que, como se señaló antes, la relación de corto plazo entre la oferta y el precio es inversa. Una primera explicación de este hecho estaría relacionada con lo siguiente: (a) La lógica económica del comercializador es más de corto plazo y su objetivo inmediato es vender rápido para ganar la máxima diferencia entre el precio de venta en subasta y el precio de compra en la unidad productiva, especialmente en época de retención4. (b) La intensificación del componente de leche en el sistema de producción doble propósito ha producido modificaciones en el ciclo de la ceba de manera que precios más altos de la leche, aún con bajos precios de la carne o del cebado vivo, conducen a retener la hembra para producir más leche, y vender más crías (Suárez, 2005, p. 41). (iv) En sentido inverso, los cambios en el riesgo—clima afectan en el corto plazo la oferta: variaciones del 1% en la desviación estándar de las precipitaciones con respecto a su media del mes en curso y la de tres meses atrás provoca, en promedio, una disminución de la oferta en cuestión del 0,19% y 0,13% en el mes corriente. (v) Los productores y comercializadores son aversos al riesgo—precio: una desviación de $100 COP con respecto a la media móvil trimestral del precio por kilo dos meses atrás disminuye la oferta corriente en 0,12%. El coeficiente del término de corrección de errores, z—1 , el cual representa la velocidad de ajuste hacia el largo plazo, tiene el signo esperado y es significativo; el resultado de este coeficiente es menor a la unidad e indica que, aproximadamente, el 80% del error de largo plazo en la oferta del ganado macho con la presencia de lluvias se corrige en el mes siguiente. 5. CONCLUSIÓN En este informe de investigación se analizó la oferta primaria de ganado macho en pie para ceba en Sucre y sus determinantes durante el periodo 2007—2015 mediante la estimación de un modelo ARDL. Los resultados destacan la sensibilidad de productores y comercializadores a dos factores importantes de la producción ganadera: el clima, en particular en un sistema de pastoreo natural; y el precio, en un sistema de mercado. Ante la amplia variabilidad de estos factores, tienden a reducir la cantidad de producto ofrecido en el corto y largo plazo. En esta etapa de la producción de ganado no se evidenció una relación inversa de corto plazo entre la oferta y su precio, lo cual parece ser un resultado de la lógica económica de ganancia cortoplacista que subyace en el comercializador, pero también podría ser que la intensificación del componente leche, en el sistema de producción doble propósito regional, probablemente haya modificado las características estructurales del ciclo de la ceba, que es más evidente como un fenómeno nacional. Una implicación de política derivada de este estudio: primera, tener una política de manejo de agua que reduzca la dependencia de dicha actividad, pues las desviaciones de largo plazo del nivel de oferta se corrigen rápidamente con la presencia de este factor. Segunda, en un contexto de reducción anual del hato vacuno departamental durante el período de estudio, sería recomendable políticas de apoyo para repoblamiento bovino en la etapa de vaca—cría con el productor directo de ganado. Tercera, avanzar en mecanismos financieros que contribuyan a reducir el riesgo—precio y riesgo—clima ante productores aversos al mismo Notas 1 El número de retardos máximos se define utilizando el criterio de información Akaike, AIC. 2 Por razones de espacio no se incluyen los resultados, pero están disponibles para los editores y lectores. 3 Con menos contundencia estadística, Arrieta y Bracamonte (2016) hallaron esa misma relación directa entre la oferta de ganado hembra de levante con el precio y el sacrificio. 4 Contribuye a explicar este hecho también que durante 2007—2015 se encontró una correlación inversa entre la variación del inventario ganadero anual y la de la oferta de ganado macho y hembra de levante vendida en subasta, aunque no es estadísticamente significativa la correlación. La correlación entre inventario y ventas debe esperarse directa. BIBLIOGRAFÍA Behrman, J. (1968). Supply response in underdeveloped agriculture: a case study of four mayor crop in Thailand.

Q11|Spatial dispersion of retail margins: evidence from Turkish agricultural prices|The farmer share of retail prices is shown to be about 16%, corresponding to about 84% of a distribution share, on average across agricultural products and regions within Turkey. The share of transportation costs in retail prices is only about 7%, while the share of retail margins is about 77% of retail prices. The dispersion of retail prices across regions is shown to be mostly due to local wages and variable markups, while the contribution of traded‐input prices is relatively small. Accordingly, the high dispersion of farmer prices across locations is not reflected in the dispersion of retail prices due to the high contribution of retail margins. These retail margins are also shown to account for about one third of the consumer welfare dispersion across regions and more than half of the consumer welfare dispersion across products.
Q11|The Price of Biodiesel RINs and Economic Fundamentals|The D4 RIN is the tradable compliance certificate for the biomass-based diesel mandate in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Understanding the price dynamics of the D4 RIN is important for understanding the RFS because its price sets a ceiling on the ethanol RIN (D6) and because some observers have suggested that RIN price fluctuations are too large to be explained by economic theory. We use option pricing theory to develop a model of the D4 RIN in terms of its economic fundamentals: the spread between the prices of biodiesel and petroleum diesel and the status of the biodiesel blenders’ tax credit. The resulting D4 fundamental price closely tracks actual D4 prices. We conclude that RIN price volatility arises because of the design of the RFS and intrinsic features of the US fuel supply system.
Q11|Establishing the Link Between Poverty and Changes in Climatic Conditions in the Philippines|This paper investigates whether changes in climatic conditions significantly contribute to incidence of poverty in the Philippines. Due to the lack of sufficient regional estimates of poverty, this study utilized food cpi data to proxy for poverty level. The relationship between poverty level and food cpi were tested and found to be moving in parallel direction, and hence, could be substituted for each other for this study’s purposes. The relationship between poverty and food prices has also been verified in the literature, as higher food prices is the dominant variable that results in higher poverty levels. The results show that higher agricultural wages as well as extreme climate-influenced shocks such as El Niño and La Niña were significant determinants of poverty. Higher agricultural wage benefits agricultural workers, but the income effect may be small, and that overall, the net effect of is higher food prices that, in turn, exacerbates overall poverty. The negative impact of El Niño and La Niña on food prices (and therefore, poverty level) could be attributed to the consistent and appropriate government response to these weather shocks, which have stabilized supply of food. Government programs to stock up on rice during weather shocks, and the automatic assistance to farmers during calamities, have had the overall effect of neutralizing the potential poverty impacts of climate-related shocks. These are useful insights in carving out a climate-resilient economic development plan, and emphasize the importance of timely and appropriate government action and adaptation programs.
Q11|Determining the Inflationary Effects of El Niño and La Niña in the Philippines|"This paper investigates whether climate ""shocks"" (or short-term but sharp changes in climatic conditions), El Niño and La Niña, have significant impacts on inflation in the country. Using regional panel data and information from PAGASA, this study finds that both of these weather shocks have significant effects on the general price level in the Philippines, along with interest rate, foreign exchange, and unemployment rate. Further, the results also indicate that long-term changes in climatic conditions, specifically average temperature and rainfall, do not have any significant impacts on prices. These findings are consistent with the literature that point to the fact that successful adaptation to long-term changes in climatic conditions negates any potential negative impacts to the economy. The study concludes that adaptation must be expanded not only to respond to long-term changes in climatic conditions, but also to short-term but intense changes in temperature and rainfall."
Q11|Long Run Trends and Fluctuations In Cotton Prices|One revelation from the 2008 Global Financial Crisis was the fragility of models and assumptions based on samples too short to include periods of high volatility, and this study attempts to remedy that short-coming for USDA’s development of long run cotton price projections. Real cotton prices have fallen significantly since 1900, but statistical verification of the presence of a long-run downward trend has proven elusive. Cotton price volatility has varied widely over the last 226 years, largely correlated with macroeconomic instability. Cotton’s period of greatest instability—during the U.S. Civil War—was primarily driven by cotton-specific trade and production disruptions, but since the Civil War, cotton volatility has largely coincided with broader commodity price volatility. One of cotton’s most volatility\e episodes since 18th century occurred over 2009-12, and was in part a consequence of nearly unprecedented macroeconomic instability and, in part due to factors specific to cotton markets. Looking ahead, cotton price volatility over 2018-27 is likely to be greater than the volatility experienced during 2016-17, when volatility was unusually low, likely reduced by China’s large sales from its National Reserve.
Q11|On the Drivers of Global Grain Price Volatility : an empirical investigation|A vast number of studies examined the determinants of price volatility in agricultural markets. It is clear that the joint influence of several causes may generate market instability, but the partial contribution of different factors is still debated. We investigate how market-based drivers influence the global price volatility of three major grains: wheat, corn, barley. We adopt a Seemingly Unrelated Regression Equations model, in order to investigate potential common patterns and to control for the influence of external drivers. We compare inter-annual, intra-annual, and global volatility, to conclude on short-run and long-run dynamics of markets instability. We quantify the negative relationship linking (temporal) arbitrage and grain price volatility and conclude on the effects of supply movements on price volatility.
Q11|The Impact of Exchange Rate Dynamics on Agricultural Output Performance in Nigeria|Abstract The study investigated the possible asymmetric effect of real exchange rate dynamics on agricultural output performance in Nigeria over the period of 1981 to 2016 by collecting data from secondary sources. The study employed a combination of stationary and nonstationary variables as was found out through the ADF unit root test. Based on the Bounds test for cointegration, a long-run relationship was absent between real exchange rate and agricultural output, irrespective of specifications. Generally, the result of model estimation showed that the significant drivers of agricultural output are real exchange rate (log-levels), real appreciation and depreciation (after some lags), industrial capacity utilization rate, and government expenditure on agriculture (after some lags). ACGSF loan exerted positive and insignificant influence on agricultural output. In addition, though the effect of real appreciation was larger than that of real depreciation, the present study could not find any evidence in support of the asymmetric effect of real exchange rate dynamics on agricultural output performance in the Nigerian economy. It is therefore suggested that fiscal and monetary authorities in Nigeria should work in unison at ensuring that the full potentials of the agricultural sector are harnessed for the growth and development of the country.
Q11|Can locally available foods provide a healthy diet at affordable costs? Case of Armenia|Nutrition-related health problems, such as obesity, stunting, anemia, and high blood pressure are common in Armenia. A large portion of the population lives below the national poverty line, and consumes less than the necessary energy intake per day. Linear programming is used in this study of diet optimization to create a healthy diet model for children and adults of different ages at the minimum cost. The model is based on culturally appropriate food products. The study finds that, while average Armenians can afford a healthy diet, their current dietary choices do not meet the requirements of Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). Moreover, people earning minimum salary need to spend more than half of their monthly income on food to afford a healthy diet. Based on the study’s findings, several policy recommendations are made.
Q11|Economic impacts of El Niño southern oscillation: evidence from the Colombian coffee market|El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a naturally occurring phenomenon that affects weather around the world. Past ENSO episodes have had severe impacts on the economy of Colombia. We study the influence of ENSO on Colombian coffee production, exports, and price. Our structural econometric specification is consistent with an economic model of the market for Colombian coffee which, in the short run, is characterized by a downward‐sloping demand curve and by a vertical supply curve. We show that El Niño (i.e., positive shocks to ENSO) is beneficial for Colombian production and exports and decreases the real price of Colombian coffee. On the contrary, La Niña (i.e., negative shocks to ENSO) depresses Colombian coffee production and exports and increases price. However, the overall impact of ENSO shocks is small. Both in the short run and in the long run, shocks to international demand for Colombian coffee are more relevant than supply‐side shocks in Colombia in explaining the dynamics of the price of Colombian coffee. Our results suggest that a given coffee price shock can have beneficial, detrimental, or negligible effects on the Colombian economy, depending on its underlying cause. As a consequence, policy responses to coffee price shocks should be designed by looking at the causes of the shocks.
Q11|Quantitative Study of Tea Industry in India: Market , Pricing and Organization|The study describes various aspects of the quantitative features of Indian tea industry based on secondary data from Tea Statistics for different years as published by the Tea Board of India, and primary survey in major tea producing regions of South and North India, namely in West Bengal, Assam and Tamil Nadu. The paper is organized in the following way: first part gives an overview of the quantitative study of Indian tea industry at national and inter-national levels based on predictions of observed patterns for selected variables. The variables are critical for the growth of tea industry in India. The second part of the study discusses the basic findings from field survey of big growers, small growers and bought-leaf factories from North and South Indian tea producing regions. Several of the predictions and decompositions obtained in this study are both novel and robust and directly amenable to policy instruments.
Q11|Effects of Price Insurance Programs on Supply Response: A Case Study of Corn Farmers in Quebec|Aims: This study examines the supply response of corn in the province of Quebec. Study Design: A time series design is implemented. Place and Duration of Study: Our analysis covers the period from 1985 to 2013 and uses the data of corn production in the province of Quebec. Methodology: A generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) process is used to model output price expectations and its volatility. Results: We found that application of the Farm Income Stabilisation Insurance in Quebec neutralises the adverse effects of price volatilities on corn production and generates a market power for corn producers. The change in the producers' attitude towards risk is other implication of the insurance program. Conclusion: These results imply that implementation of the insurance program in the province of Quebec leads to an increase of corn production and consequently this increase in production can impose more compensation cost (paid by the insurance program) to governments.
Q11|Volatility Linkages between Energy and Food Prices: Case of Selected Asian Countries|We examine the linkages between energy price and food prices over the period 2000–2016 by using a Panel-VAR model in the case of 8 Asian economies: Bangladesh, the People’s Republic of China, Indonesia, India, Japan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Our results confirm that energy price (oil price) has a significant impact on food prices. According to the results of impulse response functions, agricultural food prices respond positively to any shock from oil prices. The findings from variance decomposition reveal that shares of oil prices in agricultural food price volatilities are the largest. In the second period 4.81%, and in the 20th period 62.49%, of food price variance is explained by oil price movements. We offer new policy insight. Since We also found that the impact of biofuel prices on food prices is statistically significant but explains less than 2% of the food price variance. However, by increasing the demand for biofuel, especially in advanced countries, there should be more concern about the global increase in agricultural commodities prices and endangering food security, especially in vulnerable economies.
Q11|Agricultural Price Shocks and Business Cycles - A Global Warning for Advanced Economies|For a panel of 75 countries, we find that increases in global agricultural commodity prices that are caused by unfavorable harvest shocks in other regions of the world significantly curtail domestic economic activity. The effects are much larger than for average global agricultural price shifts. The impact is also considerably stronger in high-income countries, despite the lower shares of food in household expenditures these countries have compared to low-income countries. On the other hand, we find weaker effects in countries that are net exporters of agricultural products, have higher shares of agriculture in GDP or lower shares of non-agricultural trade in GDP; that is, characteristics that typically apply to low-income countries. When we control for these country characteristics, we find indeed that the effects on economic activity become smaller when income per capita is higher. Overall, our findings imply that the consequences of climate change on advanced economies are likely larger than previously thought.
Q11|Pork Market in Poland after the EU Accession|Pork production in Poland has a significant economic, social and environmental impact. Favourable natural conditions as well as the tradition and consumption patterns have made Poland, producing 2.5-2.8 million tonnes of pig livestock (in liveweight), one of the biggest producers in the EU. The pig sector is not only one of the most important branches of the Polish agri-food economy, but is also considered one of the most sensitive ones (Rowinski, Tereszczuk 2008). What makes it so important is its large share in commercial production and agricultural income, sales revenue and employment, as well as a high level of pork consumption and its share in consumers? food spending. Following Poland?s accession to the EU, the development of the pig sector has been more hindered than the production and processing of poultry, milk and beef. Poland has become a shortage country in pork production, the share of imports in the supply of the domestic market has increased to 40%, and the negative balance of foreign trade in pork reached in 2016 220 thousand tonnes in a meat equivalent and EUR 342 million. The article presents the changes taking place on the pork market in Poland in 2004-2016 and indicates the factors determining them. Problems relating to pork production are mainly due to: fragmented farm structure compared to those in EU-15 Member States, decreasing share of pork in agricultural commercial production und in the total meat production, low price competitiveness, problems with ASF in the eastern regions of Poland and hindered exports due to an embargo imposed by Russia.
Q11|Goose market from global and domestic perspective in the years 2012-2017|The main objective of the article is to present changes in the Polish goose meat market in the years 2012-2017 in the context of changes in the global goose meat market. Poland is one of the largest producers and exporters of goose meat in the world. In the analysed period, the production and sale of goose meat in Poland was of seasonal change, which, most probably in the case of availability of goose meat in retail trade will change, since buyers? preferences are changing and the demand for niche types of poultry meat is growing. At the turn of 2016/2017, Poland was affected by avian influenza which had a negative impact on the production of and trade in goose meat. In 2013, Poland was the fifth largest global producer of goose meat. The structure of the global export of goose meat and offal (total) is very concentrated. In the analysed period, its largest global exporter was Hungary with the share ranging from 34% to 47% while Poland was ranked second with the share ranging from 31% to 37%.
Q11|The Dynamics of Dependencies between the World Grain and Oilseed Markets|The paper analyses relations between world grain and oilseed markets in the period from the beginning of 2000 to the middle of 2018. The study covered the period of drastic hikes and drops of cereal grain and oilseed prices during the economic and financial crisis. The study assessed the strength and dynamics of dependencies between rates of return from grain and oilseed sub-Indexes of the International Grains Council. For this purpose copula-based multivariate GARCH models were used, and dynamic Kendall's tau coefficients and dynamic tail dependence coefficients were calculated. Among the analysed markets the strongest (weak or moderate) relationships were found between the maize and soybean markets, and between the wheat and maize markets, with the linkages changing in time. The greatest probabilities of extreme events transfer were recorded for the maize and soybean markets.
Q11|Price discovery in commodity futures and cash markets with heterogeneous agents|Since 2004, commodity futures markets have seen an unprecedented liquidity inflow linked to noise traders that follow global liquidity cycles rather than market fundamentals. This paper develops a price discovery model for commodity futures markets that incorporates noise trader effects by assuming two forms of limits to arbitrage: transaction costs and noise trader risk. It is shown that under these assumptions, commodity prices are driven by both market fundamentals and noise trader positions. Further, noise trader effects spill over to the cash market if limits to arbitrage due to transaction costs are imperfect but are confined to the futures market otherwise. The model is empirically tested using data from six grain and soft commodity markets.
Q11|Spatial distribution of the international food prices: unexpected randomness and heterogeneity|"Global food prices are typically analysed in a times series framework to assess the causes of volatility and to highlight spikes, that are interpreted as a signal of food crises. We address the spatial dimension of the issue at hand by focusing on the spatial food price dispersion, at the country-scale, in the international food trade network (IFTN) for ten relevant commodities. We base our study on bilateral trade by focusing on both the ""internal"" variance, which indicates that an exporter sets di erent prices to different importers for the same commodity, and the ""external"" variance, that is a measure of market price competitiveness. We nd that spatial price dispersion is remarkable and persistent over time and that there exists a strict correlation between price spikes (in level) and peaks in spatial price variability. This entails that during price crises the market is more fragmented and a higher spatial price dispersion is found. Moreover, we implement a randomness test on the country-scale price distributions to test whether they can be replicated through a random process of extraction. It results that the actual distribution of prices of several commodities is well described by a random distribution. It follows that the process of data aggregation is not neutral because, in several cases, the information at the micro-level scale (firms' decision) is lost at the macro-scale due to the complexity of the international food trade network (IFTN). We suggest some possible economic explanations of this occurrence and we discuss the main methodological consequences."
Q11|The system-wide impact of healthy eating: assessing emissions and economic impacts at the regional level|Encouraging consumers to shift their diets towards to a lower meat/lower calorie alternative has been the focus of food and health policies across the world. The economic impact on regions has been less widely examined, but is likely to be significant, where agricultural and food activities are important for the host region. In this study we use a multi-sectoral modelling framework to examine the environmental and economic impacts of a dietary change, and illustrate this using a detailed model for Scotland. We find that if household food and drink consumption follows healthy eating guidelines, it would reduce both Scotlandâ€™s â€œfootprintâ€ and â€œterritorialâ€ emissions, and yet may be associated with positive economic impacts, generating a â€œdouble dividendâ€ for both the environment and the economy. Furthermore, the likely benefits to health suggest the potential for a â€œtriple dividendâ€ . The economic impact however depends critically upon how households use the income previously spent on higher calorie diets.
Q11|Mobile Phones and Mozambique Farmers: Less Asymmetric Information and More Trader Competition?|We investigate the impact of search costs of farmers and traders on prices, by measuring to what extent the introduction of mobile phones in Mozambique has affected the margin between recorded maize producer prices and retail market prices, and by exploring who benefits from possible margin changes. Estimations are based on weekly producer and retail market prices of white maize grain, from July 1997 to December 2009, for 15 major producer markets in Mozambique. We find a margin increase varying from 4.5% to 9.6%, supporting a bias of benefits towards traders. Hence, not less asymmetric information and more trader competition, but rather the reverse. Estimation results are robust for non-random rollout of the mobile phone network and various other threats. Impacts can be traced towards improved information on terminal market prices and are also significantly correlated with network density. Household survey data yield a mostly insignificant impact for farmers, consistent with the key result of this study. Several farmer characteristics are in line with lower farmer benefits.
Q11|Does Output Influence Productivity? - A Meta-Regression Analysis|The goal of this paper is to conduct a meta-regression analysis (MRA hereafter) regarding the effects of the Kaldor-Verdoorn effect – the relation between output/demand and productivity. The Kaldor-Verdoorn effect has been subject to many econometric studies and while the overwhelming majority of them finds a positive overall effect, there is no consensus on its size - the results vary quite a bit, especially according to the chosen econometric specification. This MRA estimates a 'true value' of the Kaldor-Verdoorn effect without interference from potential publication selection bias via the use of multivariate MRA. A series of moderator variables is used to check for their effect of excess variation, including amongst others the year of publication, the sectors and the countries studied. This MRA study uses available data from 22 published studies with 303 estimations of the Kaldor-Verdoorn effect. When examining the primary literature as a whole, there seems to be publication bias. While there seems to exist a genuine Kaldor-Verdoorn effect, its size varies considerably depending on the specification chosen.
Q11|Russian food and agricultural import ban: The impact on the domestic market for cattle, pork and poultry| This study analyses the impact of the Russian food and agricultural import ban on import of meat, the structural changes of trade pattern and reallocation of import flows of meat and meat products, and the price development in the import market and its impact on producers and consumers market for cattle, pork and poultry meat in the Russian Federation (RF). There is empirical evidence that the collapse of meat exports to Russia and, hence, the increase of meat prices happened even long before the import ban was introduced. The structure of Russian import market for meat has significantly changed. Brazil became the largest meat exporter in the Russian meat import market achieving market share in the total meat import of the RF almost 50% in 2015-2016. The structural changes of the Russian import market suggests that the beef and pork exporters are not price-takers on the one hand. On the other hand, they may be able to discriminate prices in the Russian import markets.
Q11|The nutrient-income elasticity in ultra-poor households: Evidence from Kenya|The relationship between nutrient intake and wealth of poor households continues to be an issue of huge policy relevance. In this paper, we contribute to the ongoing debate on the nutrient-income elasticity using a sample of ultra-poor households with orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in Kenya. To estimate the nutrient-income elasticity for these households, we employ panel data techniques that enable us to tackle measurement error and simultaneity bias. In addition, we use semi-parametric panel data models to address nonlinearities. For most of the nutrients considered, we find that income elasticities are significantly different from zero but below unity. Caloric intakes turn out to be less income-inelastic than macro and micro nutrient intakes.
Q11|The dynamics of microcredit borrowings in Cambodia|We employ 2011–2014 panel data of eleven villages in Cambodia to investigate the impact of microcredit access on paddy quantity and income, expenditure on inputs of paddy production, and self-employment income. The panel data enables us to implement difference-in-differences and triple differences estimators. We find that credit participants observe a 26.1% increase in paddy income, 68.9% in paddy quantity and 26.5% in expenditure on inputs of paddy production. Poorer households benefit more from credit participation. Participants also observe an increased nonland durable assets relative to those of non-participants, particularly agricultural assets. We find week evidence that women participants benefit more from credit programme than male counterparts. Although women are more likely to start selfemployment activities with the loans—mainly in informal sector—the income gains are not statistically different from zero relative to what men earn.
Q11|Welfare analysis in a two-stage inverse demand model: an application to harvest changes in the Chesapeake Bay|Abstract Like many agricultural commodities, fish and shellfish are highly perishable and producers cannot easily adjust supply in the short run to respond to changes in demand. In these cases it is more appropriate to conduct welfare analysis using inverse demand models that take quantities as given and allow prices to adjust to clear the market. One challenge faced by economists conducting demand analysis is how to limit the number of commodities in the analysis while accounting for the relevant substitutability and complementarity among goods. A common approach in direct demand modeling is to assume weak separability of the utility function and apply a multi-stage budgeting approach. This approach has not, however, been applied to an inverse demand system or the associated welfare analysis. This paper develops a two-stage inverse demand model and derives the total quantity flexibilities which describe how market clearing prices respond to supply changes in other commodity groups. The model provides the means to estimate consumer welfare impacts of an increase in finfish and shellfish harvest from the Chesapeake Bay while recognizing that harvests from other regions are potential substitutes. Comparing the two-stage results with single-stage analysis of the same data shows that ignoring differentiation of harvests from different regions, or the availability of substitutes not affected by a supply shock, can bias welfare estimates.
Q11|Agricultural Trade and Food Security|Agricultural trade is vitally important for achieving the goal of ending hunger by 2030, as enshrined in the second Sustainable Development Goal. While trade is frequently seen as posing threats to this vitally important goal, it can in fact play a major role in achieving it. Trade helps in a number of ways, by allowing countries to take advantage of their radically different factor endowments, with land-abundant countries providing exports and land-poor countries taking advantage of much more efficiently-produced imports. Trade liberalization can also help by raising production efficiency in agriculture, allowing improvements in dietary diversity and increasing access to food. Allowing trade substantially reduces the volatility of food prices by diversifying sources of supply. By contrast, beggar-thy-neighbor policies of price insulation such as the imposition of export bans in periods of high prices redistribute, rather than reduce, volatility. However, the tendency of other countries to use price-insulating policies creates a serious collective action problem in world markets. Proposals for Special Safeguards would exacerbate these problems by adding massive duties—and creating even larger declines in world prices—during periods of already-depressed prices.
Q11|Impact of agricultural export restrictions on prices in importing countries|During the commodity price spikes in 2007-08 and 2010-11, several countries implemented temporary export restrictions on staple foods in an attempt to protect domestic consumers from rising and volatile prices. The impacts of these policies, however, are not limited to the countries that are instituting them; they can also influence consumer prices in their trading partners. This study analyses whether the impact of export restrictions was different in countries that were traditionally more dependent on imports from the restricting country than in countries that imported a smaller share. Four export bans are considered: the maize ban in Argentina, the rice bans in India and Viet Nam, and the wheat ban in the Russian Federation. Using an error correction model in a panel framework, the study identifies the long-run impacts of export bans by showing whether the introduction of these bans caused a structural break in the long-term relationship between prices in international markets and consumer prices in domestic markets. The analysis demonstrates that the effects of an export ban were more pronounced in the group of countries that traditionally imported a higher share from the restricting countries than in countries with a lower import dependency. The results show that, even though export bans are temporary in nature, they can have long lasting effects.
Q11|Market Implications of Integration of Asian Rice Markets|This paper explores how the integration of rice markets in ASEAN countries influences the import, export, production, consumption, and prices of rice in those countries, as well as in the rest of the world. The analysis describes current policies applied to ASEAN rice markets, then evaluates the ten-year impacts of two reform scenarios using the OECD-FAO Aglink-Cosimo model. The first scenario involves the elimination of tariffs within the region, while protection vis-à-vis countries outside the region remains unchanged. The second scenario involves closer price integration across the region, again with protection versus countries outside the region unchanged. The analysis finds that opening up the regional trade market will lead to greater overall production, consumption and trade across the region. The overall welfare gains are over fifteen times higher with full price integration, as opposed to just tariff reform. Significant price changes create winners and losers within all countries, underscoring the need for complementary policies to accompany a rice market integration agenda.
Q11|The Cost of High Food Prices in West Africa|West African households were particularly affected by the food price crisis of 2007-08. As these households depend on markets for two-thirds of their food supplies, prices have become a key determinant of access to food. However, food prices are 30-40% higher in sub-Saharan Africa than in the rest of the world at comparable levels of per capita income. These price levels have a negative impact on the purchasing power of households and are a major factor of food and nutrition insecurity. Price monitoring systems need to be updated and strengthened. Increasing productivity, promoting regional trade and supporting food value chain development are three of the policy options available to decision-makers to drive down food prices sustainably.
Q11|Le coût des prix alimentaires élevés en Afrique de l'Ouest|Les ménages ouest-africains sont particulièrement touchés par la flambée des prix de 2007-08. Ils dépendent des marchés pour deux-tiers de leurs approvisionnements. Les prix sont désormais un facteur clé de l'accessibilité économique à l’alimentation. Ils sont plus élevés de 30 à 40 % en Afrique subsaharienne que dans le reste du monde à niveau de revenu par habitant comparable. Ces niveaux ont un impact négatif sur le pouvoir d'achat des ménages et représentent un risque majeur d’insécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle. Il conviendrait de revoir et de renforcer les systèmes de suivi des prix. L'augmentation de la productivité, la promotion du commerce régional et le soutien au développement des chaînes de valeur sont trois des options stratégiques à la disposition des décideurs politiques pour faire baisser les prix alimentaires de manière durable.
Q11|On consumption patterns in oyster markets: the role of attitudes|Achieving a low-carbon and sustainable economy is a long-term goal that EU aims at achieving in the next few decades: the potential role of bioeconomy is likely to make the difference, and in particular, the EU aquaculture and the seafood processing industry has the potential to contribute substantially to the emergence of bioeconomies (for instance through new – niche - markets for bio-based products such as algae, etc). In this particular framework, understanding how to enhance cleaner and more sustainable consumption patterns is preliminary to the transition towards more equitable and sustainable markets. The present analysis investigates the role of consumers’ attitudes with respect to sustainable attributes (namely food safety and respect of the environment) in order to suggest on their potential role to catalyze the transition toward bioeconomies. Up to date, empirical investigations on this issue are limited to few markets, and studies on aquaculture are particularly scant. The gap is reduced by the present analysis: it has been implemented a survey on fish consumers to investigate how their attitudes toward food safety and environmental issues tend to influence consumption choices, and it is shown that those attitudes are important determinants of consumers choices. Put differently, a cleaner and more sustainable supply chain (i.e through a safer, and environmental friendly product) is likely to enhance consumption of oysters. To the extent that policy makers, producers, and taxpayers are interested in enhancing sustainable bioeconomies, understanding the relevance of attitudes toward food safety and environmental sustainability is an important and pressing goal. The analysis, novel in its application to a high quality product, speaks in this direction and will help understanding how to accelerate the transition to sustainable bioeconomies.
Q11|Macroeconomic Trends and Factors of Production Affecting Potato Producer Price in Developing Countries|Principal component analysis is performed on 33 mainly agriculture related social variables of 40 developing countries. Important components are also put to explain potato producer price. The analysis reveals that the data set contains macroeconomic trends; economic growth, growing importance of the potato and improving infrastructures for the market economy. Although the coefficients for these trends in affecting potato producer price are not statistically significant, it is noteworthy that their signs are in line with observations from earlier research. Economic growth and increasing potato importance are often accompanied with potato price rising in developing countries, whereas improving infrastructures increase availability of food with lower average prices. Potato producer price is statistically significantly affected by four factors of production: land, labour, capital and technology. Relating potato supply constraints of earlier survey literature to principal component interpretation also revealed primary paths how these macroeconomic inputs are being formed in developing countries. Potato suitability allows more cultivated land and greater production with lower price. Agricultural poverty brings limited alternatives and poor terms of trade for farmers, with abundant labour at low wage rate leading to low potato producer price. Better alternative business lowers capital inflow to agricultural land development, entailing low production and high price. Knowledge increases productivity lowering price.
Q11|Drivers of grain price volatility: a cursory critical review|Understanding the determinants of price volatility is a key step to prevent potential negative consequences of to the uncertainty faced by farmers. Our critical provides a novel categorization of grain price volatility drivers. We distinguish endogenous and exogenous causes and conclude on the potential effects that each of identified factors may generate on price dynamics. In particular, we deepen on the contribution of endogenous factors such as spatial and temporal arbitrage, as well as drivers of shocks of demand and supply.
Q11|Deskripsi Pengambilan Keputusan Dalam Berusahatani Padi Pandan Wangi (Oryza sativa L) di Kalangan Petani Cianjur<BR>[Description of Decision Making in Agribusiness of Pandan Wangi (Popular Variety of Rice) in Cianjur District]|Abstract This research aim to know the farmer base for in Pandan Wangi Paddy rice farming, farming acceptance and also its earnings. The analysis unit is rice field farmer Pandan Wangi Paddy at season plant 2012. Farmer of sample selected at random high rice modestly (Stratified Random Sampling) and size measure of sample farmer to eachevery strata used high rice random modestly with allocation of sample which is proportional (Proportionate Stratified Random Sampling).

Q11|Threshold cointegration and spatial price transmission when expectations matter|We examine the performance of the threshold cointegration approach, specifically Bandâ€ TVECM, to price transmission analysis in an explicit context where trade decisions are made based on expectation of final prices, because trade takes time. We find that, following a standard inference strategy, a large portion of threeâ€ regime cases are not identified as such. Results show that transfer costs are systematically underestimated, particularly in threeâ€ regime models. The speed of price transmission is also biased in threeâ€ regime models. Furthermore, inferences about occurrence of trade are poor, with estimated models suggesting far lower market integration than is true in the dataâ€ generating process.
Q11|Changing Scenario of Pulses in India: An Analysis of its Growth and Instability in Eastern States|Despite of deceleration in area and marginal rise in production due to higher productivity growth rate but gross decline in area and production is perceived to be a major threat towards future food and nutritional security of the country as well as the Eastern states.Framing strategies to overcome the present gloomy situation may be considered as a greatest ever challenge faced by policy makers as well as agricultural scientists. The present situation necessitates long term planning to augment production. The strategies for stepping up domestic production must include development and adoption of modern technology including high yielding varieties, better monetary incentives to farmers to make pulses cultivation more remunerative than competitive crops, assured market which will motivate farmers to allocate more land for pulses cultivation. The minimum support price should be greater coordination with farm harvest price and market price. The Inputs constraints particularly quality seeds, fertilizers and lifesaving irrigation growth are not enough as compared to rice and wheat crops. Liberalized and subsidized import of pulses of India helps to meet demand-supply gaps,which have occurred because of stagnation in the area under cultivation, very slow growth in yield, poor increase in production and speedy increase in population. Ban on export and re-export of pulses make the closure of Indian pulses processing units. Problems of pulses economy can be solved with the increase the sources of production. Effective and continuous efforts are needed to increase the area under cultivation with better technological and logistic support.
Q11|Price Forecasting Model for Perishable Commodities: A Case of Tomatoes in Punjab, Pakistan|This study focused on developing forecasting model for perishable commodities and tomato is taken as a case to study. The model is developed on in-depth analysis of market dynamics and structure. An estimable theoretically founded model is the major output of this study which is based on true structure of the market. Complete model is comprised of inverted demand equation, Plantation and yield equations and the role of price expectations. The study reveals the fact that the farmers’ production decisions are affected by the expected profitability which is based on the expected output prices. However, due to the involvement of certain intermediaries the farmers couldn’t get the proper prices of its output whereas the domestic production meets 31.5% to its total demand only and the deficit is imported from other provinces of the country and from India. Low per acre yield and inefficient management practices, non-availability of hybrid seed, weather conditions and less profit margins and declining area of production causes the production to fall short of its potential maximum. Moreover, the increased reliance on imports and the increased demand due to increase in population causes the domestic prices to becomes more volatile. The majority of the small farmers sell their product through commission agents and wholesaler that cause imperfections in the market. Tomatoes value chain have certain problems like there exists a disparity between the small and large farmers in cost of production, yield and profitability. The model may forecast the prices on monthly or weekly basis depending upon the data availability.
Q11|Trends of Pulses Production, Consumption and Import in India: Current Scenario and Strategies|Though India is the largest producer (around 25% of global production), it however, consumes 27% and imports around 14% of its pulses requirements. The yield of pulses in India is quite low at 781 kg/ha which might be due to policy neglect. The post green revolution era saw a sharp decline in per capita production and availability of pulses with record 4.0 million tones imports of pulses in 2012-13. Bihar is one of the important pulse growing state of India with productivity of 839.3 Kg/ha in 2010-11 which is projected to attain 1461.3 kg/ha by 2050-51, highest in eastern India. With nearly 2.2 million ha of rice fallows, a small technological intervention can transform the rice- fallow to rice-gram or rice-lentil system bringing about pulse revolution. Need is to diversify from cereal–based cropping systems to pulses-based cropping system with certain policy decision like identification of additional rice fallow lands largely in Eastern India, crop diversification, improving seed replacement rate, improved crop production techniques etc. Provisions should be made for easy credit, insurance, attractive Minimum Support Price (MSP) with procurement and appropriate incentives for pulse producers as well as creating necessary infrastructure for processing, marketing and value-addition. This paper analyses status of pulse crop in India as whole and Bihar in particular along with paradigm shift required in policy decision, pulse research, technology generation and dissemination, commercialization along with capacity building of farmers and frontier areas of research and extension.
Q11|Enhancing Pulses Production in Bihar: Constraints and Strategies for Sustainable Growth|Food grains are the major agricultural commodity, produced on about 93 percent of cropped area, of which pulses share merely 7.06 per cent and the productivity of pulses ranges between 819 kg/ha in 2000-01 to 897 kg/ha in 2013-14. Bihar ranks 9th in terms of pulses production with a contribution of 0.52 million tons to the national pulse pool. Traditionally pulses have been considered important elements of cropping systems in the Bihar, but with the introduction of irrigation and high profitability of alternative sources of soil nutrients in the form of inorganic fertilizers in 1960s, pulses were replaced or relegated to marginal lands and were substituted by high- yielding varieties of rice and wheat. There has been an incessant decline in pulses area, production and productivity during last three and half decades accounting for about 437.24 thousand hectares, 428.93 thousand tons and 981 kg ha-1 respectively in 2014 - 15 against the corresponding figures of 717.2 thousand hectares, 620.7 thousand tons and 865 kg ha-1 in 2000-01 registering a compound annual decline of -2.5 percent in area and -0.41 percent in production but productivity increased by 2.15 percent per annum. Lentil is only crop which has performed well in Bihar whereas area and production of most of the major pulses have gone down. In Bihar 2.2 million ha rice fallow land is there which are most suitable for pulses cultivation where medium and long duration paddy is cultivated and after field vacating due to lack of irrigation facility and delay normally the field remains vacant. Pulse production is also adversely affected by a number of biotic and abiotic stresses which can be overcome by assembling the available components of integrated pest management like host plant resistance, cultural practices to disrupt the life cycles of pests, and need-based use of pesticides and to validate them in farmers' participatory on-farm trial and demonstration in farmers field, to deliver management components effectively to stabilize and increase the productivity of pulses. There is also need to strengthen extension efforts to disseminate available pulse technologies through on-farm demonstrations and farmers' participatory research.
Q11|Emerging trends in European food, diets and food industry|Understanding how an adequate food security may be determined, how nutritional intakes evolve over time and are influenced by global dynamics are few of the questions scholars are trying to answer. In addition, a great interest is devoted to the changes in consumers’ preferences and expectations as well as to the analysis of food innovations and their impact on the global market. We review the recent and emerging trends in food supply chains of selected sectors (fruits and vegetables, meat, and seafood), and deepen on emerging trends in the food industry. By presenting the evidence provided by the literature and emphasizing the unresolved research questions, we offer a critical view of future directions that should be followed by research agenda.
Q11|Food Consumption Patterns and Nutrition Disparity in Pakistan|The study examines the changes in household consumption patterns in Pakistan based on eleven composite food groups. The analysis is based on micro level survey dataset, Household Income Expenditure Survey (HIES) with seven consecutive rounds spanning over the period 2000-01 till 2013-14. Along with differences in consumption and calorie bundles, variations in household’s response to change in prices and income have also been estimated. Empirical results based on Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) support the hypothesis that food consumption patterns are not only different across regions but are also different among provinces. Despite the increase in availability of food items and increased per capita income, average calories intake per adult equivalent in the country is still less than 2350 Kcal benchmark. It is estimated that, thirty percent of children under age 5 are underweight, forty-five percent are stunted, eleven percent are wasted and thirty percent are underweighted. The overall scenario may increase vulnerability to poverty, countrywide disease burdens and lower productivity.
Q11|Instability of Romania’s fruit production and the responsible factors for this phenomenon|The paper offers a framework of understanding the stability/instability degree of the fruit domain’s production system both at national and regional profile. We chose the utilization of Cuddy Della Valle variability index. We followed the evolution of the variability index for two different periods, respectively: 1996-2005 (P1) and the period 2006-2015 (P2). Reducing the variability index through the time is confirming the hypothesis that in case of fruit trees’ orchards in our country the production’s stability is greatly affected by the structural factors.
Q11|The effect of maize production and consumption on prices in Romania|The present study seeks to answer the question: how does corn price influence production, consumption and foreign trade? In order to answer this question we will analyse the areas cultivated with corn, the total production and implicitly the average yield per hectare in the last years. These data, together with the average annual consumption of grain maize and the volume of imports and exports, will lead to the determination of supply and demand for maize on the market. With the help of price data collected on the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, which can be found in geographical areas and calendar months, we can observe the monthly differences in prices. Using these data and calculating the correlation coefficient, it will be possible to determine at the end of the project the effects of the demand and the supply on the price of this product.
Q11|Tourism and agrotourism evolution on an european and national level|In this article we wanted to identify, analyze and present the evolution in the last years of the tourism and agrotourism on an European and national level. In order to do that, the following indicators have been analyzed: the evolution and structure of international arrivals of tourists around the globe, the evolution and structure of international tourism encash, the evolution and share of tourist accommodation in Romania, the evolution and share of the accomodation capacity in Romania, the evolution of arrivals in accomodation units from Romania and the evolution of overnight stays in accomodation units from Romania. Following this analysis that is presented in the article in the rows below, we come to the conclusion that the tourism and agrotourism, on an European and national level, has had a constant growth in the last 5 years, thus representing an important branch with possibilities to develop economy, generating profit.
Q11|Agricultural cooperatives in developing agriculture in Romania and the European Union|The Agricultural Cooperative is an autonomous association of natural and / or legal persons, as the case may be, a private legal person established on the basis of the expressed consent of the parties in order to promote the interests of cooperative members in accordance with the principles of cooperation. In the course of the paper we will present the laws of agricultural co-operation, professional associations and the role of cooperatives in the development of agriculture. Also, the types and forms of agricultural cooperation in the European Union will be presented. To create agricultural producers in associative forms new opportunities for economic development are opened by attracting regional, zonal or local advantages and using collective power in order to increase the prosperity of members, their families and the communities they are part of. The cooperative can carry out several types of activities that have various benefits for members and help them achieve these goals.
Q11|The Evolution of Inefficiency in USDA’s Forecasts of U.S. and World Soybean Markets|We derive a set of stylized facts about USDA’s soybean supply and demand forecasts and draw implications from these results for efforts to improve the accuracy of these forecasts. USDA’s short run soybean supply and demand forecasts are inefficient, with several key variables significantly biased throughout much of the annual forecast cycle. Bias and other characteristics have varied significantly over recent decades, and evaluation efforts intended to guide forecast improvement need to focus on very recent sample years and seasonally disaggregated data. USDA should expand the information set used in its forecasting of U.S. soybean yields, take note of its mid-season downward bias in its Brazilian production forecasts, and shift the weight of its early-season focus for China’s soybean consumption estimates towards forecasts of growth rates and reduce the weight it applies to forecasting consumption and trade by China in terms of levels. During 2004-2015, downward-biased U.S. production forecasts and upward-biased foreign excess supply forecasts resulted in downward-biased U.S. export forecasts throughout much of USDA’s annual forecasting cycle. Twenty years earlier, this downward bias was confined to the end of the forecasting cycle, whereas U.S. soybean ending stock forecasts have been upward biased for decades across much of the forecasting cycle. The forecasts for U.S. soybean exports are also characterized by smoothing, with strong correlation between month-to-month forecast revisions towards the later months of USDA’s annual forecasting cycle.
Q11|On the direct, indirect and induced impacts of public policies: The European biofuel case|This paper deals with the controversial indirect land use changes of the European biodiesel policy. Two studies sponsored by the European Commission finds significant, but contrasted, land use effects for the different vegetable oils used for biodiesel production. The first study uses an aggregate computable general equilibrium model capturing direct, indirect and induced effects. The second recent study uses a biotechnical partial equilibrium model offering a detailed representation of the indirect effects occurring through the livestock sectors. We develop an original economic emulator to understand the diverging key results of these studies and test their sensitivity. We find that the direct and indirect effects on vegetable oil markets explain most of the differences. We also find that indirect effects on the livestock sector and the induced effects do not significantly influence the biodiesel results. However results are critically sensitive to crop yield responses that are considerably underestimated in both studies. The cropland displacement due to the biodiesel policy computed by the recent study is overestimated by a factor of 5.
Q11|Agricultural Trade and Food Security|The second United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG2) includes the goal to: “End hunger and achieve food security and improved nutrition” by 2030. While such an ambitious goal will clearly involve a wide range of policies and actors, this policy brief focuses on the role of trade policies in affecting food and nutrition security. Extensive and frequently contentious, debate swirls about whether trade in agricultural products is beneficial or detrimental for food security, particularly in developing countries (Diaz-Bonilla 2015). Food self-sufficiency proponents argue that global trade in food products can hurt smaller and poor producers in developing countries by exposing them to increased price volatility and competition (Edelman et al. 2014). For those on the pro-trade side, trade in food products is an important channel for improving consumers’ access to food, and agricultural exports are an importance source of income for many small farmers worldwide. This brief first examines the relationship between trade and food security. It then turns to how specific agricultural trade policies can impact food security and hunger.
Q11|Spatial price transmission and trade policies: new evidence for agricultural products from selected sub-Saharan African countries with high frequency data|We assess the conjunctural impact of price insulating policies on spatial price transmission of maize, rice and wheat in Cameroon, Kenya and Tanzania in the period 2005-2015. We therefore separately estimate the impact of trade policies within two regimes of behaviour of the domestic price series: the first regime with an increasing trend of domestic prices and the second regime with a decreasing trend. We find a significant impact of trade policies in both price regimes. This is however much larger if prices are increasing. Our results show that trade policies were able to insulate the three analyzed countries from the price shocks on international markets during the food price spike crisis 2007/2008. Although the impact of these policy instruments proved to be relevant as a counter-cyclical measure during the food price spike crisis, these policies cannot be regarded as structural long-term solutions. This paper extends the existing literature on spatial price transmission in agricultural markets by estimating the impact of tariff and non-tariff trade policies using monthly data. Employing monthly data allows for a more precise assessment of short-lived movements in the analysed series, which could disappear due to a time aggregation bias at lower yearly frequencies. While monthly price series are provided in the GIEWS database, we obtain monthly ad-valorem equivalent tariff rates by a time disaggregation of the yearly effectively applied weighted average tariff rate from the WITS/UNCTAD- TRAINS database through the monthly trade policies from the FAO-FADPA. By presenting high frequency analyses and techniques that are able to detect non-linearities in the Data Generating Process (DGP), this study provides results which differ from what is stated in the standard literature (Anderson and Nelgen, 2012a) (Anderson and Nelgen, 2012b) (Anderson and Nelgen, 2012c).
Q11|Agricultural crisis in Spain (19th and 20th centuries)|Spanish agriculture over the last two centuries has been mostly analysed from the perspective of its evolution, on many occasions over the long term, and with respect to its contribution to Spain's economic development (or, on the contrary, its possible “responsibility” for the relative backwardness of Spain). Here, however, the emphasis is placed on the opposite case, on the difficulties or crises which have affected it. Agricultural crises are not only important for explaining difficult periods during which the population and the agricultural sector have faced problematic circumstances. They have also generated a sufficiently large impact so as to provoke a reorganisation of the agricultural sector and significant changes within it. The crisis of the Ancien Régime brought about a complete transformation of the predominant agrarian institutions. On occasions, technological change was fostered by crisis situations. The depression at the end of the nineteenth century gave rise to the introduction of new technologies which profoundly modernised the sector to maintain its feasibility. In the same way, international integration affected agriculture and profound changes were required in order to maintain leading positions in international markets. Therefore, without a clear understanding of the agricultural crises, it is difficult to obtain a clear and precise perspective of the profound transformations experienced by Spanish agriculture throughout history.
Q11|Climate Change and indian Agriculture: Impacts on Crop Yield|This paper reviews the extant literature on the impacts of climate change on agriculture. We first discuss various methodologies used to study climatic impacts on crop yield. We then present a brief survey of studies from across the globe followed by a discussion on India-specific research. The empirical evidence on the effects of climate change on agriculture has been mixed: while some studies find evidence of adverse impacts others report evidence of positive effects. Applying nonparametric median regression technique to state-level time series data on average yield of rice and wheat, and on temperature and rainfall from 1968 to 2001, we further investigate the impacts of changes in these climate variables on rice and wheat yields in India. The results indicate that rising temperature has a significant negative impact and rising rainfall variability has a significant positive impact on the average rice yield. Furthermore, an increase in temperature variability over the crop year appears to have a significant positive impact on wheat yield.
Q11|Contemporaneous causal orderings of US corn cash prices through directed acyclic graphs|Abstract This study investigates dynamic relationships among US corn cash prices for the years 2006–2011. Using daily data from 182 markets in seven Midwestern states, an error correction model is estimated and directed acyclic graphs characterize the contemporaneous causal relationships among prices from different states. Empirical results based on the PC algorithm show that three states, Iowa, Ohio, and Minnesota, dominate corn cash prices. Four potential causal paths among the three states also are identified. Given that physical flows of grain are different at different times of the year, the data are divided into storage periods and harvest periods, and a VAR in differences is adopted to model the price relationships. While Iowa and Ohio continue to dominate corn prices during the storage period, the causal flows are mixed during the harvest period. An application of the LiNGAM algorithm refines the results relative to those derived from the PC algorithm and reveals that Iowa, the leading corn-producing state, is the only state that dominates pricing over the crop year.
Q11|Evaluating the Fertilizer Subsidy Reforms in the Rice Production Sector in Sri Lanka: A Simulation Analysis|This paper analyses the change in fertilizer subsidy policy in Sri Lanka with aÂ view to understand its impact on national rice production, demand/supply ofÂ inputs, farm profit and government budget. In addition, cost effectiveness of theÂ fertilizer subsidy is evaluated in terms of transfer inefficiency. Demand supplyÂ equilibrium model along with input markets is employed to obtain the results. TheÂ results indicate, complete fertilizer subsidy reduction would reduce riceÂ production by around 4%, while a 36% decline in the fertilizer demand for paddyÂ cultivation. Although, the subsidy cut reduces the enormous government burden,Â farmers are unfavorably affected by 40% reduction of farm profit. Moreover,Â fertilizer subsidy would cause government to spend Sri Lankan Rupees (SLRs.)Â 1.38-1.91 to increase farm profit by one rupee. Meanwhile, a 3% decline of paddyÂ production and a 14.5% increase in the rice price is expected with the proposedÂ cash transfer policy.JEL classification numbers: Q11, Q13Keywords: fertilizer subsidy, transfer inefficiency, two-stage technology.
Q11|Mean-Reversion in Unprocessed Food Prices|The high volatility in food prices in the last decade is a major concern for policymakers across the globe. This study tests if there is mean-reverting behaviour in the unprocessed food prices towards a long-run trend, for twenty-four European countries, using linear and nonlinear unit root tests. The results indicate linear or non-linear mean reversion for more than one-third of the group. Non-linear models are useful in detecting asymmetric correction behaviour, depending on the size and sign of the deviation from the mean. However, out-of-sample forecasting performances of these models are poor relative to a simple autoregressive benchmark.
Q11|Impact of Mobile Phones on Staple Food Markets in Mozambique: Improved Arbitrage or Increased Rent Extraction?|We investigate to what extent the roll-out of the mobile phone network in Mozambique reduced search costs, and thereby lowered transport costs and improved the efficiency of agricultural markets. Estimations are based on data of both maize market prices and transport costs of maize grain. Evidence suggests improved arbitrage jointly with increased rent extraction by traders: the rollout explains a 4.5-7 percent reduction in maize price dispersion, and a slightly larger reduction in per ton km transport costs. Benefits of increased market efficiency are not biased towards either producer or consumer markets. Results are robust for non-random rollout of the mobile phone network and several other threats.
Q11|Bayesian Estimation of the Storage Model using Information on Quantities|This paper presents a new strategy to estimate the rational expectations storage model. It uses information on prices and quantities – consumption and production – in contrast to previous approaches which use only prices. This additional information allows us to estimate a model with elastic supply, and to identify parameters such as supply and demand elasticities, which are left unidentified when using prices alone. The estimation relies on the Bayesian methods popularized in the literature on the estimation of DSGE models. It is carried out on a market representing the caloric aggregate of the four basic staples – maize, rice, soybeans, and wheat – from 1961 to 2006. The results show that to be consistent with the observed volatility of consumption, production, and price, elasticities have to be in the lower ranges of the elasticities in the literature, a result consistent with recent instrumental variable estimations on the same sample.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q11|Assessing the cost of supplying water for agriculture: the food supply cost curve|As part of a “Regional Initiative on Water Scarcity in the NENA Region”, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been proposing a practical tool for the assessment of investment projects, called the Food Supply Cost Curve (FSCC). This chapter illustrates the concept of the Food Supply Cost Curve, and which steps need to be taken to practically implement an FSCC evaluation exercise. It concludes by commenting on some preliminary findings obtained at the FAO when the FSCC has been employed in some countries in the Near East and North Africa.
Q11|To what extent will climate and land-use change affect EU-28 agriculture? A computable general equilibrium analysis|This paper assesses the structural, joint implications of climate and land-use change on agriculture in the European Union, by means of a computable general equilibrium model of the world economy. The counterfactual simulations are conducted at the year 2050 under the second Shared Socioeconomic Pathway. We find that climate and land-use change are likely to affect agricultural systems very differently across Europe. Northern countries are expected to benefit from climate change impacts, whereas other areas in Europe will suffer negative consequences in terms of reduced agricultural output, real income and welfare. The most vulnerable region is not made of Mediterranean countries, but rather Central Europe. Our results suggest that climate and land-use changes may exacerbate existing disparities within the EU. Therefore, appropriate adaptation strategies and a more flexible land-use are required to limit these negative consequences and possibly exploit the beneficial effects of climate change in some countries.
Q11|Productivity, efficiency and technical change in world agriculture: a färe-primont index approach|This paper makes a comparative analysis of the total factor productivity (TFP) estimations on the agricultural sector between the traditional Malmquist index and the new Färe-Primont index (FPI) proposed by O´Donnell. Moreover, the study makes some direct comparisons with previous traditional literature. In addition, it makes use of an improved measure of the capital stock, which showed important effects on the estimates of the agricultural productivity. The new FPI yields some lower growth of agricultural productivity and the use of the improved measure of the capital stock shows a very important effect on TFP gains.
Q11|To what extent will climate and land-use change affect EU-28 agriculture?

Q11|Is the Allocation of Time Gender Sensitive to Food Price Changes? An Investigation of Hours of Work in Uganda|Dramatic spikes in food prices, like those observed over the last years, represent a real threat to food security in developing countries with severe consequences for many aspects of human life. Price instability can also affect the intra-household allocation of time, thus changing the labour supply of women, who traditionally play the role of 'shock absorbers'. This paper explores the nature of time poverty by examining how changes in the prices of the two major staples consumed, matooke and cassava, have affected the paid and unpaid labour time allocation in Ugandan households. We exploit the panel nature of the Uganda National Household Survey by adopting a Tobit-hybrid model. Our results show that gender differentials in the intra-household allocation of labour actually occur in correspondence with changes in food prices. We find that, overall, women work significantly more, since the additional hours women work in the labour market are not counterbalanced by a relevant reduction in their other labour activities. For men, we do not find any significant effect of price changes on hours of work.
Q11|Food Price Shocks and Government Expenditure Composition: Evidence from African Countries|The delicacy of socio-political consequences during the recent commodities’ prices spikes has given rise to stabilising measures that might have had repercussions on public policy alternatives. This effect may be worrying for developing countries, which because of the importance of the share of imports in their households’ basket, have observed a remarkable increase of their food import bills. This paper attempts to evaluate the effect of food price shocks on public expenditure in level and composition on 47 African countries between 1980 and 2011. After solving for endogeneity issues, our results show that food price shocks positively and significantly affect total government expenditure and the share of current government consumption in the total government expenditure. More precisely, an additional one standard deviation of the food price shock increase is associated to an increase of 0.06 standard deviation of the percentage of current government consumption in the total government expenditure. Interestingly, this effect highly depends on the vulnerability level. Future studies will use more disaggregated data of fiscal variables, including those on revenue, to better assess food security policies.
Q11|Modeling fluctuations in the global demand for commodities|It is widely understood that the real price of globally traded commodities is determined by the forces of demand and supply. One of the main determinants of the real price of commodities is shifts in the demand for commodities associated with unexpected fluctuations in global real economic activity. There have been numerous proposals for quantifying global real economic activity. We discuss which criteria a measure of global real activity must satisfy to be useful for modeling industrial commodity prices, we examine which of the many alternative measures in the literature are most suitable for applied work, and we explain why some popular measures are inappropriate for modeling industrial commodity prices. Given these insights, we examine the question of whether there has been a slowdown in global real economic activity between 2011 and 2016 and by how much. Drawing on a range of new evidence, we show that the global commodity price boom of the 2000s appears to have been largely transitory and that the partial recovery after 2016 has been fueled by the strength of advanced economies rather than China. Our analysis has important implications for the design of structural models of commodity markets, for the analysis of the transmission of commodity price shocks to commodity-importing and -exporting economies, and for commodity price forecasting.
Q11|Local Food Prices and International Price Transmission|World food prices spiked in the periods 2007–8 and 2010–11. The impact of these spikes in world food prices on local food prices and thus on local consumers is determined by the food price pass through. Pass through is defined as the extent to which changes in world food prices lead to changes in local food prices. We examine the determinants of variation in food price pass through from global to local consumer prices in a global sample of 147 countries, using FAO data on world food prices and ILO data on food prices for consumers. While market integration matters, our study finds that income per capita is the dominant factor explaining cross-country variation in pass through of food prices. We estimate an elasticity of about −0.3 of pass through with respect to income per capita. This means far greater price transmission of food price shocks at the commodity level to final consumers in low-income countries than in high-income countries. The implication is that future swings in world food prices will in particular jeopardize food security in poor countries. Trade policy measures of market integration also affect the pass through significantly, whereas infrastructure and geography measures play no significant role.
Q11|Are daily agricultural grains prices stationary? New evidence from GARCH-based unit root tests|In this paper, we employ the GARCH-based unit root tests including the one proposed by Narayan and Liu (NL) (2015) to further examine the stationarity of daily agricultural grain prices from 1986 to 2015. We also compare the performance of these tests with standard unit root tests. Our results suggest that the unit root test for agricultural grains prices is better modeled in the presence of GARCH process with a time trend and possibly one or two shifts in the intercept. The policy implications of these findings are well documented in the paper.
Q11|On the behavior of commodity prices when speculative storage is bounded|This paper investigates the implications of bounded speculative storage, storage bounded from below at zero and above at a capacity, on commodity prices. Binding capacity mirrors the non-negativity constraint on storage and leads to negative price spiking and higher volatility when the market is in deep contango, i.e. low current prices at high stock levels. With bounded storage there is no need to restrict storage to be costly to ensure a rational expectations equilibrium. This allows the model to cover a wide range of storage technologies, including free and productive storage. We also provide an alternative expression for speculative prices that highlights the key role of the storage boundaries. The competitive equilibrium price is the sum of discounted future probability weighted boundary prices. The boundary prices can be viewed as dividends on commodities in storage reflecting the realization of economic profits from storage.
Q11|Using the competitive storage model to estimate the impact of ethanol and fueling investment on corn prices|The impact of biofuel mandates on the prices of commodities used to produce food continues to be a major consideration by policy makers. More recently concern about high compliance costs of oil companies due to mandates led to reductions in US biofuel mandates. To gain insights into the policy impacts of mandates on agricultural commodity prices and compliance costs requires development of dynamic models that can capture the fact that many agricultural commodities used to produce biofuels can be stored and that flexible compliance mechanisms allow for banking and borrowing of tradable permits. US biofuel mandates are enforced using a system of tradable permits, called RINs. RIN market dynamics are important because RINs can be banked for the future or borrowed from the future. Corn is the primary U.S. biofuel feedstock and is storable. Rational expectations competitive storage models are well suited to capture the dynamic behavior of commodity markets. Such a model is developed here for corn and RIN markets to estimate the impacts of alternative future ethanol mandate levels. The model considers corn use for ethanol, storage and all other uses in each period, accounting for two random variables: oil prices and corn yields. Borrowing and banking provisions of the Renewable Fuels Standard mandate are explicitly integrated into the model. We use the model to provide estimates of the impact on corn prices, corn plantings and ethanol production under two ethanol mandate scenarios for six marketing years from 2016/17. Our scenarios are a combination of volume requirements and infrastructure investment. The first scenario is one in which corn ethanol mandates stay the same as required in the current and proposed RFS and additional E85 stations are introduced that allow for compliance with higher mandates. The second scenario is one in which no investment occurs and the Environmental Protection Agency reduces the mandate to 13.87billiongal, a level that can just be met with 10 percent ethanol blends. Comparing the results for two scenarios, we find that average corn prices are about 5 to 6% lower with the reduced mandates or about 22 to 30 cents per bushel, while average RIN prices drop from around 60 to 40 cents per RIN.
Q11|REDD policy impacts on the agri-food sector and food security|Recent research shows that the combined contributions of deforestation, forest degradation and peat land emissions account for about 15% of greenhouse gas emissions. The REDD policy which preserves forests and values standing forests, enables substantial emission reductions. Since agricultural production and area expansion is a primary driver of tropical deforestation, REDD policies might limit the expansion possibilities of agricultural land use and therefore influence competitiveness of the agricultural sector, agricultural prices, trade patterns, agricultural production and therefore food security in the world. This paper studies the impact of REDD policies on the agri-food sector and food security with a global CGE model called MAGNET using a scenario approach. It focuses on the restrictions on agricultural land expansion within the REDD policy package. Simulation results show that REDD policies start to affect the agri-food sector in some lower developed countries if more than 15% of potentially available agricultural areas are protected from deforestation. A stringent REDD policy that protects 90% of land reserves that could potentially be used for agriculture production results in a global real agricultural price increase of almost 7.6%, and a worldwide agricultural production decrease of 1.7%. Regional differences are large, with real agricultural price changes ranging from 4% in North America to about 24% in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. Food access rapidly deteriorates for low-income population in these regions in the case of high forest protection levels. Compensatory payments are necessary from a food security point of view if the level of forest protection increases. Our results indicate that from a food security perspective REDD policy should stop short of trying to protect more than 40% of global carbon if the compensation mechanism is not effectively implemented within REDD.
Q11|Grain Price and Volatility Transmission from International to Domestic Markets in Developing Countries|Understanding the sources of domestic food price volatility in developing countries and the extent to which it is transmitted from international to domestic markets is critical to help design better global, regional, and domestic policies to cope with excessive food price volatility and to protect the most vulnerable groups. This paper examines short-term price and volatility transmission from major grain commodities to 41 domestic food products across 27 countries in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. We follow a multivariate GARCH approach to model the dynamics of monthly price return volatility in international and domestic markets. The period of analysis is 2000 through 2013. In terms of price transmission, we only observe significant interactions from international to domestic markets in few cases. To calculate volatility spillovers, we simulate a shock equivalent to a 1% increase in the conditional volatility of price returns in the international market and evaluate its effect on the conditional volatility of price returns in the domestic market. The transmission of volatility is statistically significant in just one-quarter of the maize markets tested, more than half of rice markets tested, and all wheat markets tested. Volatility transmission seems to be more common when trade (imports or exports) are large relatively to domestic requirements.
Q11|AH1N1 impact on the Mexican pork meat market|This article presents estimates of AH1N1's effects on the consumption of pork through an Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) for meat consumption in Mexico. Additionally, indirect effects through the Mexican economy are estimated using a general equilibrium model that captures the effects of intersectoral relationships and the induced effects by the circular flow of income. It is concluded that the presumed risk of contracting AH1N1 via pork consumption provoked total economic losses of $94 million. The rumor affected the pork sector, the grains sector and the manufacturing sector of food, beverages and tobacco. The poor rural households were the most affected.
Q11|Impact of India's demonetization on domestic agricultural markets|In this paper we estimate the impact on domestic trade in agricultural commodities of India's demonetization exercise that invalidated 86 of the currency in circulation. Using data on arrivals and prices from close to 3000 regulated markets in India for 35 major agricultural commodities for the period 2011-2017, we focus on short term effects up to 3 months after demonetization, tracking both the impact and recovery. These 35 commodities account for an overwhelming share of land under cultivation and value of production and hence are representative of Indian agriculture in more than one sense. Using earlier years as comparison years, we use a combination of difference in differences techniques and synthetic control methods to identify the causal impact of demonetization. We find that demonetization has displaced domestic agricultural trade in regulated markets by over 15 in the short run settling at 7 after recovery at the end of the 90 day period after demonetization. Trade in perishables was displaced to the extent of 23 in the week following demonetization. It recovered slightly by the end of 90 days, but was still 18 lower than the usual. Most of this decline is on account of the significant decline in prices rather than of arrivals, which appear to have recovered over a period of three months. There are significant differences across commodities but almost all of these are in expected ways. The impacts are sharpest for kharif crops where government intervention is minimal or absent and for perishables and least for crops where farmers are well organized or commodities which governments actively procure. Robustness checks and falsification tests support our findings to a large extent. Overall, it seems to be the case that the monetary contraction embodied in demonetization significantly impacted arrivals and prices, though the price impacts are perhaps more lasting. The findings from this analysis and anecdotal evidence from field visits suggest that the impacts of demonetization potentially have effects that could last beyond the immediate impact.
Q11|Impact du changement climatique sur lÕagriculture : dŽtermination de lÕexistence dÕun biais de prix dans les Žtudes ricardiennes|This study shows the existence of a price bias in the so-called ÒRicardianÓ studies inspired by Mendelsohn et al. (AER, 1994) and quantifies this bias. To do this, we use panel data on the 45 provinces of Burkina Faso over 12 years. The crops studied are maize, millet and sorghum. The analysis shows that the effects of climate variables on the yield and value of production per hectare of maize and millet are not the same, reflecting the presence of a price bias. In the case of Sorghum, the effects of climatic variables on yields and the value of production per hectare are practically the same, indicating the absence of statistically significant price bias. Quantifying the price bias in cases where it exists, ie for maize and millet shows that the more unfavorable the climate change, the greater the price bias will be. In the worst case, it reaches a gap of 2.05 percentage point for millet and 0.92 percentage point for maize. From this analysis, Ricardian in cross sectional or even panel studies assuming constant prices underestimate the impact of climate change by using income or value.
Q11|Can a Repeated Opt-Out Reminder remove hypothetical bias in discrete choice experiments? An application to consumer valuation of novel food products|Recent papers have suggested that use of a so-called Repeated Opt-Out Reminder (ROOR) might mitigate hypothetical bias in stated Discrete Choice Experiments (DCE), but evidence so far has only been circumstantial. We provide the first comprehensive test of whether a ROOR can actually mitigate hypothetical bias in stated DCE. The data originates from a field experiment concerning consumer preferences for a novel food product made from cricket flour. Utilizing a between-subject design with three treatments, we find significantly higher marginal willingness to pay values in hypothetical than in nonhypothetical settings, confirming the usual presence of hypothetical bias. Comparing this to a hypothetical setting where the ROOR is introduced, we find that the ROOR effectively eliminates hypothetical bias for one attribute and significantly reduces it for the rest of the attributes. Our results further suggest that these reductions of hypothetical bias are brought about by a decrease in the tendency to ignore the price attribute.
Q11|Nutrition transition and the structure of global food demand|Estimating future demand for food is a critical aspect of global food security analyses. The process linking dietary changes to wealth is known as the nutrition transition and presents well-identified features that help to predict consumption changes in poor countries. This study proposes to represent the nutrition transition with a nonhomothetic, flexible-in-income, demand system, known as the Modified Implicitly Directly Additive Demand System (MAIDADS). The resulting model is transparent and estimated statistically based on cross-sectional information from FAOSTAT. It captures the main features of the nutrition transition: rise in demand for calories associated with income growth; diversification of diets away from starchy staples; and a large increase in caloric demand for animal-based products, fats, and sweeteners. The estimated model is used to project food demand between 2010 and 2050 based on a set of plausible futures (trend projections and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios). The main results of these projections are as follows: (1) global food demand will increase by 46%, less than half the growth in the previous four decades; (2) this growth will be attributable mainly to lower-middle-income and low-income countries; (3) the structure of global food demand will change over the period, with a 95% increase in demand for animal-based calories and a much smaller 18% increase in demand for starchy staples; and (4) the analysis of a range of population and income projections reveals important uncertainties: depending on the scenario, the projected increases in demand for animal-based and vegetal-based calories range from 78 to 109% and from 20 to 42%, respectively.
Q11|Impact of Indiaâ€™s National Food Security Act on domestic and international rice markets| Policy making in food security is at a crossroads in India, particularly for the rice crop. Whereas India has emerged has a leading rice exporter over the last two years, the government has also introduced a large food subsidy program called the National Food Security Act. The program requires that 33.6 million metric tons of rice per year be distributed to the marginalized rural and urban populations of the country. In this study, we analyze the long-term impact of Indiaâ€™s Food Security Act on its domestic rice market and the international market for rice. We specify and apply a structural demand-and-supply model to Indiaâ€™s rice market and link it with the world rice market, as part of a broad partial equilibrium modeling system of international agriculture commodity markets. We specifically focus on three different scenariosâ€”subsidy as a price effect, subsidy as an inelastic income effect, and subsidy as an elastic income effectâ€”under the broader framework of the National Food Security Act. We find that at the end of the projection period (the 2024/2025 crop year), as a result of the rice subsidy program, the consumption of rice increases significantly by 6,831 thousand metric ton (MT) in the case of the price effect while the inelastic income effect has little on production, consumption which increase by 265 thousand MT and 269 thousand MT, respectively and no impact on rice export of India.
Q11|Food inflation and food price volatility in India: Trends and determinants| The study analyzes food inflation trends in India over the last decade. Annual trends show that different commodities have contributed to food inflation in different years and that no single commodity shows uniformly high inflation. A decomposition exercise shows that eggs, meat, fish, milk, cereals, and vegetables were generally the main contributors to recent food inflation. The contribution of pulses, except pigeon peas (arhar), and of edible oils remained low. Fruits and vegetables displayed a much higher degree of intrayear volatility, and high-weight commodities in the national consumption basket also showed very high inflation rates, which is a cause for concern. Results of the econometric analysis show that both supply and demand factors are important. Cereal and edible oil prices appear to be mainly driven by supply-side factors such as production, wage rates, and minimum support prices. For pulses, the effects of supply- and demand-side factors appear almost equal. The prices of eggs, meat, fish, milk, and fruits and vegetables appear to be driven mainly by demand-side factors.
Q11|Can Phosphate Salts Recovered from Manure Replace Conventional Phosphate Fertilizer?|Pig farming produces more manure than can reasonably be spread onto surrounding fields, particularly in regions with high livestock densities and limited land availability. Nutrient recycling offers an attractive solution for dealing with manure excesses and is one main objective of the European commission-funded project “BioEcoSIM”. Phosphate salts (“P-Salt”) were recovered from the separated liquid manure fraction. The solid fraction was dried and carbonized to biochar. This study compared the fertilizing performance of P-Salt and conventional phosphate fertilizer and determined whether additional biochar application further increased biomass yields. The fertilizers and biochar were tested in pot experiments with spring barley and faba beans using two nutrient-poor soils. The crops were fertilized with P-Salt at three levels and biochar in two concentrations. Biomass yield was determined after six weeks. Plant and soil samples were analysed for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents. The P-Salt had similar or even better effects than mineral fertilizer on growth in both crops and soils. Slow release of nutrients can prevent leaching, rendering P-Salt a particularly suitable fertilizer for light sandy soils. Biochar can enhance its fertilizing effect, but the underlying mechanisms need further investigation. These novel products are concluded to be promising candidates for efficient fertilization strategies.

Q11|Development and Testing of a Device to Increase the Level of Automation of a Conventional Milking Parlor through Vocal Commands|A portable wireless device with a “vocal commands” feature for activating the mechanical milking phase in conventional milking parlors was developed and tested to increase the level of automation in the milking procedures. The device was tested in the laboratory and in a milking parlor. Four professional milkers participated in the experiment. Before the start of the tests, a set of acoustic models with speaker-dependent commands defined for the project was acquired for each milker using a dedicated “milker training procedure”. Two experimental sessions were performed by each milker, with one session in the laboratory and a subsequent session in the milking parlor. The device performance was evaluated based on the accuracy demonstrated in the vocal command recognition task and rated using the word recognition rate (WRR). The data were expressed as %WRR and grouped based on the different cases evaluated. Mixed effects logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate the association between the %WRR and explanatory variables. The results indicated significant effects due to the location where the tests were performed. Higher values of the %WRR were found for tests performed in the laboratory, whereas lower values were found for tests performed in the milking parlor (due to the presence of background noise). Nevertheless, the general performance level achieved by the device was sufficient for increasing the automation level of conventional milking parlors.
Q11|Practices for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Rice Production in Northeast Thailand|Land management practices for rice productivity and carbon storage have been a key focus of research leading to opportunities for substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. The effects of land management practices on global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) from rice production within the farm gate were investigated. For the 13 study sites, soil samples were collected by the Land Development Department in 2004. In 2014, at these same sites, soil samples were collected again to estimate the soil organic carbon sequestration rate (SOCSR) from 2004 to 2014. Surveys were conducted at each sampling site to record the rice yield and management practices. The carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, Net GWP, and GHGI associated with the management practices were calculated. Mean rice yield and SOCSR were 3307 kg·ha −1 ·year −1 and 1173 kg·C·ha −1 ·year −1 , respectively. The net GWP varied across sites, from 819 to 5170 kg·CO 2 eq·ha −1 ·year −1 , with an average value of 3090 kg·CO 2 eq·ha −1 ·year −1 . GHGI ranged from 0.31 to 1.68 kg·CO 2 eq·kg −1 yield, with an average value of 0.97 kg·CO 2 eq·kg −1 yield. Our findings revealed that the amount of potassium (potash, K 2 O) fertilizer application rate is the most significant factor explaining rice yield and SOCSR. The burning of rice residues in the field was the main factor determining GHGI in this area. An effective way to reduce GHG emissions and contribute to sustainable rice production for food security with low GHGI and high productivity is avoiding the burning of rice residues.
Q11|State Support in Brazil for a Local Turn to Food|The local turn to food is often claimed to be a way to increase the value-added component retained by primary producers and to provide healthy, fresh and affordable food to consumers. Rio do Grande do Sul in Brazil has several governmental support programs that aim to empower family farmers and open up new market opportunities for them. This article examines these programs, investigates how small-scale farmers engage with them and the resultant changes in farming and marketing practices that ensue. The article uses cluster and content analysis to identify and interpret the extent, and the different ways, in which these farmers engage with and make use of the local knowledge and innovation system. The results provide useful insights into how policy instruments improve the performance of family agribusinesses, helping them to make better use of the resources available to them, encouraging farm diversification, and strengthening local interrelations between producers and consumers.
Q11|Beyond Food Provisioning: The Transformative Potential of Grassroots Innovation around Food|The newly-emerged ethical foodscape includes multiple expressions of innovation around food. With reference to the Italian context, this paper focuses on the transformative potential of the experiences of social innovation, innovative grassroots initiatives, which have been significantly contributed to shaping the food culture and production-consumption practices during the last two decades. While still consolidating their fundamentals and facing the challenge of growth, the networks behind them continue to be engaged in an effort of innovation, inside and outside their niche. The paper explores these dynamics. Understanding how these networks are managing their transformative capacity and what are the opportunities and challenges arising in the relation with the mainstream system may help to better capture and value the potential of this innovation niche, drawing useful lessons for fostering its expression and for a broader transition to more equitable and sustainable food systems.
Q11|Rice Cultivation and Greenhouse Gas Emissions: A Review and Conceptual Framework with Reference to Ghana|Rice is an essential crop in Ghana. Several aspects of rice have been studied to increase its production; however, the environmental aspects, including impact on climate change, have not been studied well. There is therefore a gap in knowledge, and hence the need for continuous research. By accessing academic portals, such as Springer Open, InTech Open, Elsevier, and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology’s offline campus library, 61 academic publications including peer reviewed journals, books, working papers, reports, etc. were critically reviewed. It was found that there is a lack of data on how paddy rice production systems affect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly emissions estimation, geographical location, and crops. Regarding GHG emission estimation, the review identified the use of emission factors calibrated using temperate conditions which do not suit tropical conditions. On location, most research on rice GHG emissions have been carried out in Asia with little input from Africa. In regard to crops, there is paucity of in-situ emissions data from paddy fields in Ghana. Drawing on the review, a conceptual framework is developed using Ghana as reference point to guide the discussion on fertilizer application, water management rice cultivars, and soil for future development of adaptation strategies for rice emission reduction.
Q11|Efflux of Soil Nitrous Oxide from Applied Fertilizer Containing Organic Materials in Citrus unshiu Field in Southwestern Japan|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from agricultural fields are an important source of the increasing atmospheric N 2 O concentration. We conducted a two-year investigation of soil N 2 O emissions induced by the application of combined organic and synthetic fertilizer (COS) and distilled silage waste (DSW). Three experimental treatments were applied to a Citrus unshiu field in January 2013 in Ehime, Japan: no fertilizer (NF), COS, and DSW. The applied nitrogen (N) from DSW was 192 and 244 kg N ha −1 in the first and second years, respectively, although the N application in COS was 192 kg N ha −1 in both years. The main N forms in COS and DSW were ammonium- and nitrate-N, respectively. Soil N 2 O and carbon dioxide fluxes, soil chemical properties, and mineral N leaching from topsoil were measured. The soil N 2 O flux increased after fertilization in COS and DSW, and a higher N 2 O efflux after supplemental fertilization was induced by warm and wet soil conditions. The emission factor of N 2 O was higher in COS (2.02%) than in DSW (1.18%), while N leaching was higher in DSW than in COS. The organic materials remaining after the application possibly increased the N 2 O emissions in the summer season. Therefore, to mitigate N 2 O emissions in citrus orchards, fertilizer containing organic materials should be applied during a cool and dry season.
Q11|Small-Scale Vegetable Farmers’ Participation in Modern Retail Market Channels in Indonesia: The Determinants of and Effects on Their Income|The rise of supermarkets in Indonesia since the end of the 1990s have been transforming the food retail sector and providing further market opportunities for small-scale farmers, in which most of Indonesia’s farmer falls into this category. The aim of this paper is to examine the supermarket participation and its effect on the well-being of small-scale farmers. We compare the differences between participants and non-participants in supermarket channels in order to explore the constraints on supermarket participation. By applying a treatment effects model which allows capturing the possibility of selection bias, we examine the factors that determine farmers’ participation as well as the effect on their income. The results show that younger farmers with higher levels of education, irrigated land, who have packaging equipment and storage facilities, and are located near paved roads, are more likely to participate in the supermarket channels. On the other hand, farmers who have sprayer equipment are more likely to participate in the traditional market channels. The effect analysis shows that small-scale farmer participation in the supermarket channels can boost their income.
Q11|Durum Wheat Cover Analysis in the Scope of Policy and Market Price Changes: A Case Study in Southern Italy|Agricultural land systems are the result of human interactions with the natural environment, and subjective evidence of socio-economic and environmental interactions has been demonstrated. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to analyze empirically the link between agricultural market and policy, as well as the environmental response due to changes in crop management by local stakeholders. In this study, we propose a cross investigation and analysis to bring the link between vegetation cover, policy, market and farmer’s behavior to light. Our methodology is a combination of a rational positive and analogical approach between the quantifiable and non-quantifiable agents on a temporal basis. The method is applied to a dominant mono-crop agricultural watershed in Southern Italy that has been dedicated to durum wheat cultivation. In this region, we studied the relationship between the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), durum wheat market price, vegetation cover and land allocation. As a first step, we conducted a separate analysis for each factor, exploiting Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observed Leaf Area Index (LAI) to analyze the land vegetation space–time distribution over the period 2000–2014 and three Land Satellite (Landsat) validated images as check-points for the agricultural pattern and CAP’s reforms. We used the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) and Eurostat data to investigate the on-farm accountancy and the durum wheat market price changes, respectively. Based on the study period, we developed a storyline of the major relevant CAP’s policy changes. In a second step, we conducted a comparative analysis where the CAP’s reforms were used as interpretational support, the land allocation and the on-farm accountability for CAP’s implementation, the price of durum wheat and the LAI for analytical comparison. We found interesting insights regarding the non-agronomic driving forces of LAI dynamics. The behavior of the individual farmers is influenced by the CAP policy that has been implemented by using profitability as the stimulus for the decision making of the farmer. This explains the correlation of the trend between the market price, the LAI of durum wheat and their associated dynamics.
Q11|Mitigating Global Warming Potential and Greenhouse Gas Intensities by Applying Composted Manure in Cornfield: A 3-Year Field Study in an Andosol Soil|A 3-year study was conducted in cornfield to evaluate how composted cattle manure application affects net global warming potential (GWP; the sum of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4 ) minus net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB)) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI; net GWP per unit of plant biomass yield). In the first experiment, conducted from 2010 to 2012, five fertilization strategies that included an unfertilized control plot, inorganic fertilizer-only plot, two plots with inorganic fertilizer plus composted cattle manure, and composted cattle manure-only plot were established. In the second experiment composted cattle manure was applied in autumn 2012 and the field was subdivided into three plots in spring 2013, with one plot receiving additional composted cattle manure, the second plot received additional inorganic fertilizer and the third plot did not receive any additional fertilization. Fluxes of N 2 O, CH 4 and CO 2 were measured using the static closed chamber method. NECB was calculated as carbon (C) inputs minus C output (where a negative value indicates net C loss). In experiment 1, manure application significantly increased NECB and reduced net GWP by more than 30% in each of the three years of the study. GHGI in the manure-amended plots was lower than in other plots, except in 2012 when the manure-only plot had higher GHGI than fertilizer-only plot. Application of inorganic fertilizer alone increased GWP by 5% and 20% in 2010 and 2011, but showed a 30% reduction in 2012 relative to the unfertilized control plot. However, due to higher net primary production (NPP), fertilizer-only plot had lower GHGI compared to the control. Application of inorganic fertilizer together with manure showed the greatest potential to reduce GWP and GHGI, while increasing NPP and NECB. In experiment 2, additional manure or inorganic fertilizer application in spring increased NPP by a similar amount, but additional manure application also increased NECB, and decreased GWP and GHGI. Manure application, as a partial substitute or supplemental fertilizer, shows potential to mitigate GWP and GHGI.
Q11|Advances in Eco-Efficient Agriculture: The Plant-Soil Mycobiome|In order to achieve a desirable ecological and sustainable agriculture a thorough understanding of the plant-soil mycobiome is imperative. Commercial industrial agriculture alters greenhouse gas emissions, promotes loss of plant and soil biodiversity, increases pollution by raising atmospheric CO 2 , and releases pesticides, thus affecting both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Diversified farming systems, including perennial cultivated pastures, are among worldwide strategies that aim to reduce terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions and deal with threats to global sustainability. Additionally, stimulation of soil microbes and appropriate soil management can influence soil interactions as well as the rates of organic matter decomposition and the release of gases. Agricultural soil microbial communities play a central role in ecosystem processes and are affected by biocontrol agents, biofertilizers, and exposure to pesticides, the extent to which is yet to be fully elucidated. Intercropping different plant species is beneficial, as this can increase carbon fixation by plants, transferring carbon to the soil, especially via mycorrhizas, thus modifying interplant interactions. This review focuses on agro-ecosystems, showing the latest advances in the plant-soil interface (the mycobiome) for an eco-efficient agricultural production.
Q11|Achieving Sustainability: Insights from Biogas Ecosystems in India|This paper focuses on how the use of renewable energy technologies such as biogas can help to achieve environmental and socio-economic sustainability. It combines research on sustainable consumption and production, natural and industrial ecosystems and renewable energy adoption to develop a framework for an industrial ecosystem for biogas for bottom-of-the-pyramid and rural populations. The framework suggests that three dimensions of industrial ecosystems and a meta-dimension can be embedded in the design of a new industrial ecosystem for biogas to facilitate environmental and socio-economic sustainability. Case studies of an organization engaged in using biogas to create a sustainable bioenergy ecosystem for rural populations and two organizations producing biogas in urban India provide support for the framework.
Q11|Assessment of Photosynthetic Pigment and Water Contents in Intact Sunflower Plants from Spectral Indices|Under water-limited conditions, monitoring water and chlorophyll status is essential to avoid restrictions in crop growth and yield. This study was carried out to assess water and chlorophyll contents from spectral indices in sunflower plants. The hybrid Sunbright Supreme was cultivated inside a non-acclimatized greenhouse until the start of the flowering stage, and later was maintained in a growth chamber with the purpose of submitting the plants to a slow and progressive dehydration rate for 12 consecutive days. Spectral (reflectance and transmittance), leaf masses (fresh and dry), and total chlorophyll measurements were accomplished in sunflower plants. The water stress caused a reduction in the water and chlorophyll contents, resulting in linear and nonlinear decreases for the spectral indicators Water Index (WI) and Chlorophyll Content Index (CCI), respectively. The low scattering of the average values around the fitted models indicates that WI and CCI were effective in representing changes in water and chlorophyll status for sunflowers ( R 2 = 0.912 and R 2 = 0.905). The benefits of using hand-held optical meters for reflectance and transmittance are that they enable rapid, accurate, and nondestructive assessments of water and chlorophyll contents in sunflower plants from radiometric indicators.
Q11|Changes in the Polyphenolic Profile, Carotenoids and Antioxidant Potential of Apricot ( Prunus armeniaca L.) Leaves during Maturation|Apricot ( Prunus armeniaca L.) leaves were studied to assess the potential of apricot leaves for future studies and their applications in nutraceutical and bioactive functional ingredients. The changes in the phenolic profile, carotenoids, pigments and antioxidant potential were studied at four maturation stages. Polyphenols and carotenoids were studied using reversed-phase HPLC-DAD. Pigments, total phenolic contents and radical scavenging activity were also measured. Results revealed twelve phenolic compounds in the apricot leaves. The major phenolic compounds were 3- O -caffeoylquinic acid (14.6–49.6 mg/g), 4- O -caffeoylquinic acid (0.56–7.5 mg/g), 5- O -caffeoylquinic acid (5.6–25.7 mg/g) and quercetin-3- O -glucosides (8.6–19.9 mg/g), while others include caffeic acid and derivatives of coumaric acid and kaempferol. Significant changes were observed in polyphenolic compounds during maturation. Lutein (56.7–65.7 µg/g), neoxanthin (0.66–4.79 µg/g), 5,6-epoxy-α-carotene (5.89–7.9 µg/g), and β-carotene (12.3–26.9 µg/g) were the major carotenoids. There were significant variations in the carotenoids, pigment contents, total phenolic contents and radical scavenging activity during maturation. In conclusion, significant variation occurred in the polyphenolic profile, carotenoids contents and antioxidant potential of apricot leaves under the studied conditions.
Q11|Ammonia and Methane Emission Factors from Cattle Operations Expressed as Losses of Dietary Nutrients or Energy|The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of published literature on ammonia (NH 3 ) and enteric methane (CH 4 ) emissions from beef and dairy cattle operations to obtain statistically representative emission factors based on dietary intakes of nutrients or energy, and to identify major causes of emission variations. NH 3 emissions from lagoon or other manure storage facilities were not included in this review. The NH 3 and CH 4 emission rates, expressed as a percentage losses of dietary nutrients or energy, demonstrated much less variation compared with emission rates expressed in g/animal/day. Air temperature and dietary crude protein (CP) content were identified as two major factors that can affect NH 3 emission rates in addition to farm type. Feed digestibility and energy intake were identified as two major factors that can affect CH 4 emission rates expressed as a percentage losses of dietary energy. Generally, increasing productivity and feed efficiency represented the greatest opportunity for mitigating NH 3 or CH 4 emissions per unit of livestock product. Expressing CH 4 loss on a digestible energy basis rather than a gross energy intake basis can better represent the large variation among diets and the effects of varying dietary emission mitigation strategies.

Q11|Effect of Organic and Inorganic Fertilizers on Soil Properties and the Growth, Yield and Quality of Tomato in Mymensingh, Bangladesh|Field trials were conducted on tomato for yield and quality of fruits using different types of organic and inorganic fertilizers at the horticulture farm of Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), Mymensingh. Fertilizer treatments were tested on two varieties of tomato ca. Roma VF and BARI 15. The fertilization treatments were T1, vermicompost (12 t/ha); T2, compost (10 t/ha); T3, integrated plant nutrient system (IPNS) or mixed fertilizers (organic 2/3 part and inorganic 1/3 part); T4, inorganic fertilizers; and a control (T5). Results showed growth and yield (20.8 t/ha) in tomato were higher in the IPNS treatment. A higher number of fruits per plant (73.7) and plant height (73.5 cm) were obtained from mixed fertilizers (organic 2/3 + inorganic 1/3) or IPNS (integrated plant nutrient system) in Roma VF than other treatments. Fruit yield and diameter were found statistically significant. No significant difference was observed in the quality (total soluble solids) of tomato fruits in both varieties’ response to the treatments. The electrical conductivity and pH of the soil were improved by the application of organic manure.
Q11|Guest Editorial: Conservation Tillage for Organic Farming|There is interest in reducing or even eliminating tillage in organic production systems. In this special Issue, research teams in Europe and North America summarize recent and on-going efforts to develop conservation-tillage systems that can be used on commercial organic farms. While progress is being made in the development of organic no-tillage (no-till) systems, considerable work still needs to be done before there will be wide-spread adoption by organic farmers.
Q11|The Impact of a Warming Micro‐Climate on Muooni Farmers of Kenya|Rainfed agriculture has become highly vulnerable to the depleting water resources in most arid and semi‐arid tropics (ASATs) under the effect of climate change. The impact has certainly been very high in Muooni catchment where more than 99% of the natural forest has been cleared. The warming micro‐climate is accelerated by extended deforestation, unsustainable irrigation, and water over‐abstraction in the catchment by eucalyptus and other exotic trees. The dwindling crop yields add to the farmer’s suffering. Farming communities have created various innovative ways of coping with a warming environment to increase their agriculture resiliency. These include, among others, rain water management, reforestation and agro‐forestry. To what extent have these practices been disturbed by the increasing temperatures, and decreasing rainfalls and river discharges in Muooni catchment? This study used statistical forecast techniques to unveil the past, current and future variations of the micro‐climate in Muooni catchment, and relevant factors determining farmers’ vulnerability to drought. Muooni catchment is warming by 0.8 to 1.2 °C in a century as a result of a changing micro‐climate. These changes are mainly driven by deforestation due to the high urbanization rate and agricultural practices in Muooni catchment. Centennial rainfall is subsequently plummeting at 30 to 50 mm while discharges are decreasing from 0.01 to 0.05 m3∙s−1, with unmet water demands of 30% to 95% and above. In view of the current trends of the population growth and urbanization in Muooni, agricultural expansion is seriously threatened if no appropriate policy, extension service and science based emergency measures are put in place by the Government of Kenya.
Q11|Suppression of CH4 Emission by Rice Straw Removal and Application of Bio‐Ethanol Production Residue in a Paddy Field in Akita, Japan|To elucidate the effects of rice straw removal and rice straw‐based bio‐ethanol production residue application on rice growth and methane (CH4) emission from a paddy field, a lysimeter experiment with three treatments (application of rice straw after harvesting (the rice‐straw plot); removal of rice straw and the application of bio‐ethanol production residue (the Et‐residue plot); removal of rice straw (the no‐application plot)) was conducted over three years. Though the grain yields in the Et‐residue and no‐application plots tended to be slightly higher than that in the ricestraw plot, there were no significant differences among the plots (530–546 g∙m−2). Suppression of CH4 emission by the treatments was found clearly in the early part of the growing season. The total CH4 emissions during the rice‐growing season (unit: g∙C∙m−2∙period−1) followed the order of the noapplication plot (11.9) < the Et‐residue plot (14.6) < the rice‐straw plot (25.4), and a significant difference was found between the no‐application and rice‐straw plots. Consequently, bio‐ethanol production from rice straw and a following application of its residue to paddy fields is considered to be a promising technology which can obtain new sustainable energy and suppress CH4 emission without any inhibition on rice growth.
Q11|Development and Evaluation of Poly Herbal Molluscicidal Extracts for Control of Apple Snail ( Pomacea maculata )|Golden Apple Snail (GAS) is the most destructive invasive rice pest in Southeast Asia. The cost of synthetic molluscicides, their toxicity to non-target organisms, and their persistence in the environment have propelled the research of plant-derived molluscicides. Most research efforts have focused on individual plant extracts for their molluscicidal potency against GAS and have not been proven to be entirely effective in rice field conditions. Selective combination of synergistically acting molluscicidal compounds from various plant extracts might be an effective alternative. In this direction, ethanolic extracts from six different plants (Neem, Tobacco, Nerium, Pongamia, Zinger, and Piper) were evaluated against Pomacea maculata Perry. Of the various combinations studied, a binary extract (1:1) of nerium and tobacco (LC 90 177.71 mg/L, 48 h), and two tri-herbal extract formulations (1:1:1) of (nerium + tobacco + piper) and (nerium + tobacco + neem) were found to be most effective, with LC 90 values of 180.35 mg/L and 191.52 mg/L, respectively, in laboratory conditions. The synergistic effect of combined herbal extracts resulted in significant reduction in LC 90 values of the individual extracts. The findings of this study demonstrate that the selective combinations of potent molluscicidal herbal extracts are effective for management of P. maculata under laboratory conditions.
Q11|Fusarium Wilt Affecting Chickpea Crop|Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) contributes 18% of the global production of grain legume and serves as an important source of dietary protein. An important decrease in cropping area and production has been recorded during the last two decades. Several biotic and abiotic constraints underlie this decrease. Despite the efforts deployed in breeding and selection of several chickpea varieties with high yield potential that are tolerant to diseases, the situation has remained the same for the last decade. Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris (Foc) is the major soilborne fungus affecting chickpeas globally. Fusarium wilt epidemics can devastate crops and cause up to 100% loss in highly infested fields and under favorable conditions. To date, eight pathogenic races of Foc (races 0, 1A, 1B/C, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) have been reported worldwide. The development of resistant cultivars is the most effective method to manage this disease and to contribute to stabilizing chickpea yields. Development of resistant varieties to fusarium wilt in different breeding programs is mainly based on conventional selection. This method is time‐consuming and depends on inoculum load and specific environmental factors that influence disease development. The use of molecular tools offers great potential for chickpea improvement, specifically by identifying molecular markers closely linked to genes/QTLs controlling fusarium wilt.
Q11|Phytochemistry and Agro-Industrial Potential of Native Oilseeds from West Africa: African Grape ( Lannea microcarpa ), Marula ( Sclerocarya birrea ), and Butter Tree ( Pentadesma butyracea )|Ethnobotanical investigations on local oilseed species in Burkina Faso revealed that oils from tree oilseeds are frequently used for food, cosmetics and traditional medicine by local people. To test the bio-preservative capacity, the effect of the oilseed extracts on the stabilization of Shea butter was evaluated. Levels of bioactive phyto-components were evaluated through several methods. Some aspects of the quality of oilcakes were evaluated based on their inhibitory capacity on the endogenous digestive enzymes of cattle. For fat stabilizing quality, the extract from Lannea microcarpa Engl. & K. Krause has showed the largest increase (91.47%) in the Rancimat induction time (TIR) of Shea butter. Using DPPH and FRAP methods for prevention or scavenging of free radicals, the results evidenced the highest activity with extracts of L. microcarpa . With respect to the feed quality of the oilcakes, the IC 50 obtained with α-amylase and trypsin have showed that the ethanolic extracts of Pentadesma butyracea Sabine (1824) is less toxic for cattle. These results suggest that phenolic compounds extracted from these native oilseeds, especially those of Lannea microcarpa , can be used as biological antioxidants for bio-preservation of edible fats. In addition, the by-products of the oil-extraction can be valorized as nontoxic and protein-rich oilcakes for livestock feed.
Q11|Changes in Carbon Cycling during Development of Successional Agroforestry|Successional agroforestry systems (SAFS) mimic the structure of natural forests while providing economical outputs. This study clarifies how carbon cycling and carbon sequestration change during successional development of SAFS. In Brazil, three successional stages of SAFS, 6, 12, and 34 years old, were compared in terms of carbon balance. Aboveground biomass, fruit harvest, litterfall, soil respiration, and soil organic carbon were measured for two years and analyzed. Carbon sequestration expressed by net primary productivity increased with age of SAFS from 9.8 Mg·C·ha −1 ·year −1 in 6-year-old system to 13.5 Mg·C·ha −1 ·year −1 in 34-year-old system. Accumulation of plant biomass and increased internal carbon cycling in SAFS led to an intensive sequestration of carbon. SAFS can be a sustainable way of agricultural production on vulnerable tropical soils.
Q11|Impacts of Rural Labor Resource Change on the Technical Efficiency of Crop Production in China|This paper probes effects of the evolvement of labor resources on technical efficiency in crop production in rural China. Based on twelve years of data on crop production of 30 provinces in China, a stochastic frontier production function model is used to measure crop production efficiency in three crop-functional areas—the production area, the consumption area, and the balanced area. Then effects of both quantity and quality change in labor force on technical efficiency in different regions of China are analyzed. Results show that rural China generally has an increasing number of employees shifted to non-agricultural sectors and a decreasing trend of the stock of human capital. However, both these two changes in rural labor force have significantly positive effects on improving crop production efficiency. In addition, China’s technical inefficiency is at an average of 22.2%. Dynamically, the technical efficiencies show a tendency to rise steadily throughout China and in three areas, while the consumption area possesses the highest technical efficiency. Those results may lend some experience for other countries that are currently experiencing rural labor force and economic transition.
Q11|Surface and Subsurface Transport of Nitrate Loss from the Selected Bioenergy Crop Fields: Systematic Review, Analysis and Future Directions|Nitrate loss from bioenergy crop fields has attracted considerable attention during the last few years because of its potential negative impact on aquatic and human health. Both controllable and uncontrollable factors for nitrate loss have been the subject of several previous studies. Due to differences in climate, biophysical dissimilarities and land management characteristics in different parts of the world the factors affecting nitrate loss are often inconsistent and hence difficult to generalize. Therefore, reanalyzing the experimental field or plot scale studies to understand the nitrate loss factors in crop fields is useful and necessary in developing management strategies for reducing nitrate loss. This research synthesized and investigated 36 peer reviewed scientific journal articles related to selected bioenergy crop fields that included: continuous corn, corn in rotation with soybean, switchgrass and Miscanthus to conduct a meta-analysis of the available research. In this study, factors such as drain tile spacing, tillage practices, type and timing of the fertilization rate, irrigation and various other factors, which are challenging to represent in regression equations, were also systematically analyzed. In addition, various other agronomic characteristics that are attributed too nitrate loss are caused by perennially planted bio energized crops such as Miscanthus and switchgrass. Results indicated that 49% of nitrate loss through surface runoff from corn fields is directly related to the annual precipitation and fertilization rate. Multiple linear regression equations were developed to estimate the annual subsurface nitrate loss for the continuous corn fields with a R 2 value of 0.65, 0.58 and 0.26 for sandy loam, silty loam and clay loam, respectively. Our analysis resulted in the conclusion that corn has a 2 to 3 times higher nitrate loss in surface runoff compared to switchgrass. Likewise, continuous corn and corn in rotation with soybean contributed more than 9 times the subsurface loss of nitrate compared to the established subsurface loss attributed to the Miscanthus and switchgrass.
Q11|Evaluation of Pectin Extraction Conditions and Polyphenol Profile from Citrus x lantifolia Waste: Potential Application as Functional Ingredients|The citrus by-products pectin and polyphenols were obtained from Citrus x lantifolia residues. The use of acid type, solute-solvent ratio, temperature, and extraction time on pectin yield recovery was evaluated using a factorial design 3 4 ; pectin physicochemical characterization, polyphenol profile, and antioxidant activity were also determined. Results indicated a total polyphenol content of 3.92 ± 0.06 mg Galic Acid Equivalents (GAE)/g of citrus waste flour in dry basis (DB), with antioxidant activity of 74%. The presence of neohesperidin (0.96 ± 0.09 mg/g of citrus flour DB), hesperidin (0.27 ± 0.0 mg/g of citrus flour DB), and ellagic acid (0.18 ± 0.03 mg/g of citrus flour DB) as major polyphenols was observed. All of the factors evaluated in pectin recovery presented significant effects ( p < 0.05), nevertheless the acid type and solute-solvent ratio showed the greatest effect. The highest yield of pectin recovery (36%) was obtained at 90 °C for 90 min, at a ratio of 1:80 ( w / v ) using citric acid. The evaluation of pectin used as a food ingredient in cookies elaboration, resulted in a reduction of 10% of fat material without significant texture differences ( p < 0.05). The pectin extraction conditions and characterization from these residues allowed us to determine the future applications of these materials for use in several commercial applications.
Q11|Nitrous Oxide Emission from Organic Fertilizer and Controlled Release Fertilizer in Tea Fields|A field experiment was conducted for two years in the Green Tea Laboratory of Saitama Prefectural Agriculture and Forestry Research Center, Iruma, Saitama, Japan from March 2014 to December 2015. Controlled release fertilizers (CRF) or organic fertilizers (ORG), which are a mixture of chicken manure and oil cake, were applied with the amount of 450 kg·N·ha −1 ·year −1 in 2014 and 397 kg·N·ha −1 ·year −1 in 2015. Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from soil in green tea fields were measured by the closed chamber method. The results showed that CRF has significantly lower N 2 O compared to ORG. The cumulative N 2 O emissions from CRF accounted for 51% of N 2 O emissions from ORG fields and 138% of control with no fertilizer treatment. The N 2 O flux from the row was higher than that under the canopy, since fertilizer was applied on the row. However, the total emission from the area between the rows was lower than that under the canopy because the area ratio between the row and canopy was 1:5.
Q11|Impact of Practice Change on Runoff Water Quality and Vegetable Yield—An On-Farm Case Study|Intensive agricultural practices in farming systems in eastern Australia have been identified as a contributor to the poor runoff water quality entering the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). A field investigation was carried out to measure the off-farm water quality and productivity in a coastal farming system in northeastern Australia. Two vegetable crops (capsicum and zucchini) were grown in summer 2010–2011 and winter 2011 respectively using four different management practices (Conventional—plastic mulch, bare inter-row conventional tillage and commercial fertilizer inputs; Improved—improved practice with plastic mulch, inter-row vegetative mulch, zonal tillage and reduced fertilizer rates; Trash mulch—improved practice with cane-trash or forage-sorghum mulch with reduced fertilizer rates, minimum or zero tillage; and Vegetable only—improved practice with Rhodes grass or forage-sorghum mulch, minimum or zero tillage, reduced fertilizer rates). Results suggest improved and trash mulch systems reduced sediment and nutrient loads by at least 50% compared to conventional systems. The residual nitrate nitrogen in soil accumulated at the end-of-break crop cycle was lost by deep drainage before the subsequent sugarcane crop could utilize it. These results suggest that future research into establishing the linkages between deep drainage, groundwater quality and lateral movement into adjacent streams is needed. The improvement in runoff water quality was accompanied by yield reductions of up to 55% in capsicum and 57% in zucchini under trash mulch systems, suggesting a commercially unacceptable trade-off between water quality and productivity for a practice change. The current study has shown that variations around improved practice (modified nutrient application strategies under plastic mulch, but with an inter-space mulch to minimize runoff and sediment loss) may be the most practical solution to improve water quality and maintain productivity. However, more work is required to optimize this approach and thus reduce the size of any potential productivity and profitability gap that would necessitate an expensive policy intervention to implement.
Q11|Effect of Organic, Inorganic Fertilizers and Plant Spacing on the Growth and Yield of Cabbage|The impact of chemical farming and the negative consequences on the environment and human health in Bangladesh are on the rise. Organic farming is gaining attention and increasing globally because it is eco-friendly, safe and has benefits for human health. A field study was conducted at the horticulture farm of Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), Mymensingh, to evaluate the growth and yield performance of cabbage cv. Atlas—70 using organic and inorganic fertilizers in various plant spacing arrangements. Two factor experiments were conducted on plant spacings of 60 cm × 40 cm (S 1 ), 60 cm × 50 cm (S 2 ) and 60 cm × 60 cm (S 3 ) and fertilizers vermicompost (T 1 ), biogen (T 2 ), integrated plant nutrient system (IPNS) Organic (⅔) + inorganic (⅓) (T 3 ) and inorganic (T 4 ). IPNS (T 3 ) application increased the marketable yield (54.77 t·ha −1 ) of cabbage. The highest marketable yield (48.75 t·ha −1 ) was obtained with a plant spacing of 60 cm × 40 cm (S 1 ). No significant variation was found in plant spacings S 1 and S 2 . The treatment combination of S 2 T 3 recorded the highest plant height (37.81 cm), plant spread (47.75 cm), cabbage head (21.80 cm), stem length (12.31 cm), thickness of the cabbage head (12.53 cm) and marketable yield (65.0 t·ha −1 ). The results suggest that IPNS (T 3 ) combining organic and inorganic fertilizer applications with a 60 cm × 50 cm spacing (S 2 T 3 ) increases the yield performance of cabbage.
Q11|Global Biofuels at the Crossroads: An Overview of Technical, Policy, and Investment Complexities in the Sustainability of Biofuel Development|Biofuels have the potential to alter the transport and agricultural sectors of decarbonizing societies. Yet, the sustainability of these fuels has been questioned in recent years in connection with food versus fuel trade-offs, carbon accounting, and land use. Recognizing the complicated playing field for current decision-makers, we examine the technical attributes, policy, and global investment activity for biofuels (primarily liquids). Differences in feedstock and fuel types are considered, in addition to policy approaches of major producer countries. Issues with recent, policy-driven trade developments are highlighted to emphasize how systemic complexities associated with sustainability must also be managed. We conclude with near-term areas to watch.
Q11|Estimating the Competitive Storage Model with Trending Commodity Prices|We present a method to estimate jointly the parameters of a standard commodity storage model and the parameters characterizing the trend in commodity prices. This procedure allows the influence of a possible trend to be removed without restricting the model specification, and allows model and trend selection based on statistical criteria. The trend is modeled deterministically using linear or cubic spline functions of time. The results show that storage models with trend are always preferred to models without trend. They yield more plausible estimates of the structural parameters, with storage costs and demand elasticities that are more consistent with the literature. They imply occasional stockouts, whereas without trend the estimated models predict no stockouts over the sample period for most commodities. Moreover, accounting for a trend in the estimation imply price moments closer to those observed in commodity prices. Our results support the empirical relevance of the speculative storage model, and show that storage model estimations should not neglect the possibility of long-run price trend<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q11|Portugal’s wine globalization waves, 1750-2015|From 1750 to 2015 we may detect three waves of globalization of wines produced in Portugal, namely, port wine exports for the British market in the 18th century, common wines exports to France in the second half of the 19th century, and finally the growth of exports to European markets from the last decade of the 20th century up to the present times. This chapter explores the fundamentals of such waves looking at trends in output, productivity, domestic and foreign consumption, commercial agreements and economic policies. The first two waves came to halt as conditions in the foreign markets changed, because they did not have a solid domestic base of production and commercialization. The chapter argues that the third wave is of a different kind as it developed from a more solid domestic base of the wine sector that had developed for decades based on domestic consumption. Thus we may conclude that wine globalization is also about changing domestic economic conditions. The process was however long and painful, as the sector had a very irregular performance throughout the 20th century which is however related to the overall backwardness of the Portuguese economy in the European context.
Q11|Bioethanol Production In Mexico: Socio- Economic Implications, Produccion De Bioetanol En Mexico: Implicaciones Socio-Economicas|Energy reforms in Mexico and the search for new sources of environmentally friendly energy have generated changes in the Mexican economy. One potential solution for decreasing the emission of greenhouse gases is the use of bioethanol produced from corn, sorghum, barley or wheat. These crops were studied to estimate the elasticities of the Marshallian and Hicksian demands through the application of the Almost Ideal Demand System with seemingly unrelated regressions and the use of the Stone Index. Results indicate that corn is the only superior good. Its demand increases despite price increments. The apparent relationship with the use of corn in the United States for the production of ethanol has generated speculation in the international market and has affected the price of tortilla and corn, decreasing the capability of the Mexican population for purchasing corn derived products
Q11|Impact of India's Demonetization on Domestic Agricultural Markets|This paper estimates the impact on domestic trade in agricultural commodities of India's demonetization exercise that invalidated 86% of the currency in circulation. Using data on arrivals and prices from close to 3000 regulated markets in India for 35 major agricultural commodities for the period 2011-2017, the focus is on short term effects up to 3 months after demonetization, tracking both the impact and recovery. These 35 commodities account for an overwhelming share of land under cultivation and value of production and hence are representative of Indian agriculture in more than one sense. Using earlier years as comparison years, the paper uses a combination of difference in differences techniques and synthetic control methods to identify the causal impact of demonetization.
Q11|USDA Forecasts Of Crop Ending Stocks: How Well Have They Performed?|This study analyzes forecasts of U.S. ending stocks for corn, soybeans, and wheat issued by the USDA. The proposed efficiency tests focus on forecast revisions. Forecast errors are decomposed into monthly unforecastable shocks and idiosyncratic residuals. The error covariance matrix allows for heteroscedasticity and auto-correlations. Results suggest that the USDA forecasts are inefficient, providing strong evidence that the USDA is conservative in forecasting the ending stocks. Unforecastable shocks are heteroscedastic, and idiosyncratic residuals are small. Results are consistent across the three decades analyzed, but soybean forecasts are found to be considerably worse from 2005 to 2015.
Q11|Spatial price transmission and trade policies: new evidence for agricultural products from selected sub-Saharan African countries with high frequency data|We assess the conjunctural impact of price insulating policies on spatial price transmission of maize, rice and wheat in Cameroon, Kenya and Tanzania in the period 2005-2015. We therefore separately estimate the impact of trade policies within two regimes of behaviour of the domestic price series: the first regime with an increasing trend of domestic prices and the second regime with a decreasing trend. We find a significant impact of trade policies in both price regimes. This is however much larger if prices are increasing. Our results show that trade policies were able to insulate the three analyzed countries from the price shocks on international markets during the food price spike crisis 2007/2008. Although the impact of these policy instruments proved to be relevant as a counter-cyclical measure during the food price spike crisis, these policies cannot be regarded as structural long-term solutions. This paper extends the existing literature on spatial price transmission in agricultural markets by estimating the impact of tariff and non-tariff trade policies using monthly data. Employing monthly data allows for a more precise assessment of short-lived movements in the analysed series, which could disappear due to a time aggregation bias at lower yearly frequencies. While monthly price series are provided in the GIEWS database, we obtain monthly ad-valorem equivalent tariff rates by a time disaggregation of the yearly effectively applied weighted average tariff rate from the WITS/UNCTAD-TRAINS database through the monthly trade policies from the FAO-FADPA. By presenting high frequency analyses and techniques that are able to detect non-linearities in the Data Generating Process (DGP), this study provides results which differ from what is stated in the standard literature (Anderson and Nelgen, 2012a) (Anderson and Nelgen, 2012b) (Anderson and Nelgen, 2012c).
Q11|A Stochastic Production Frontier Estimator of the Degree of Oligopsony Power in the U.S. Cattle Industry|Abstract The objective of this study is to estimate the degree of oligopsony power in the U.S. cattle industry with the use of the recently developed stochastic frontier estimator of market power. Unlike the seminal paper where estimation of the mark-up in an output market at firm level was the main objective, this work proposes a stochastic production frontier estimator in order to estimate the mark-down in an input market at aggregate level. Furthermore, with the help of the new estimator we derive and estimate the Lerner index of oligospony power for the U.S. cattle market. For the empirical part of the study we employed annual time series data from the U.S. cattle/beef industry for the time period 1970-2009. Our results suggest that beef packers exert market power when purchasing live cattle for slaughter.
Q11|Válság- és agglomerációs hatások a magyarországi sertéstartásban<BR>[Crisis and agglomeration in Hungary s pig production]|"A tanulmány célja, hogy feltárja a sertéstartásra gyakorolt agglomerációs külső gazdasági hatásokat a 2000 és 2010 közötti Magyarországon. Az e témában végzett eddigi kutatások elsősorban az észak-amerikai és nyugat-európai országokra koncentráltak - a kelet-közép-európai gazdaságokat közvetlenül még nem vizsgálták az agglomerációs externáliák szempontjából.

Q11|Wealth Heterogeneity and the Income Elasticity of Migration|How do income shocks affect international migration flows from poor countries? Income growth not only increases the opportunity cost of migration but also eases liquidity constraints. I develop a method to separate these countervailing individual effects and identify the overall income elasticity of migration. Using new administrative and census data from Indonesia, I find that positive agricultural income shocks increase labor emigration flows, particularly in villages with relatively more small landholders. However, in the most developed rural areas, persistent income shocks reduce emigration. Overall, the findings highlight the important role of wealth heterogeneity in shaping migration flows as incomes rise.
Q11|Measuring the Impact of Agricultural Production Shocks on International Trade Flows| The purpose of this study is to measure the sensitivity of trade volumes and trade unit values to agricultural production shocks. We derive a gravity model of trade with two new features. First, the model assumes perfectly in- elastic supply, which captures the short-run nature of year-to-year production shocks and has important implications for levels of regression coecients and how they can be used to measure the elasticity of substitution. Second, the presence of per-unit trade costs implies that, in percentage terms, unit values based on importing country data (including trade costs) should react less to production shocks than unit values based on exporting country data (exclud- ing trade costs). Using bilateral trade ow data for a large sample of countries and agricultural commodities we nd empirical support for the predictions of the model, with relatively high substitutability between varieties of crops dif- ferentiated by country of origin and quantitatively large per-unit trade costs. Our framework provides a new method for measuring substitution elasticities and per-unit trade costs using international trade data. Furthermore, our results suggest that trade frictions or substitution with other goods diminish the role of international trade as way of coping with production volatility.
Q11|The Impact of Monetary Policy on Agricultural Price Index in China: A FAVAR Approach| We use recently available Chinese data from 2005m1 to 2016m2 to examine the impact of monetary policy on agricultural price using a factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) model proposed by Bernanke et al. (2005). Results show the superiority of a FAVAR model with three variables and three factors over other specifications. Impulse response functions show that both money supply and interest rate have no impact on agricultural price in the long-run (beyond 50 months). However, results indicate the considerable short-run impact of monetary policy on agricultural price. According to forecasting error variance decompositions, the interest rate could account more for the fluctuations in agricultural price than the money supply.

Q11|Demand for Yogurt in the Trend of Manufacturer Brand and Organic Information| The random coefficients multinomial logit model was used to study the demand for yogurt which is differentiated by manufacturer brands and organic information. For this purpose, we used the scanner-level data set collected by the Information Resource Incorporated at the chain level. General Mills and Danone are the two brands with the highest market shares. In general, demand for yogurt has found to be elastic for all brands. On average, consumers are more price-sensitive to non-organic brands than organic brands. Results revealed some degree of brand loyalty and the switching behavior among yogurt consumers.
Q11|Changing Impacts of Beef Demand on Cattle Producers| Economists have long recognized changes in consumer demand directly impact stakeholders throughout corresponding supply chains. However, empirical applications quantifying how demand signals are transmitted through vertically connected industries are limited. One study which provided empirical linkages between changes in retail level U.S. beef demand and economic welfare of beef producers was provided by Marsh (2003). However, given the changing landscape of the beef industry, changing consumer preferences, and globalization this paper is outdated. Our analysis aims to provide an improved quantification of how changes in retail and export beef demand are transmitted to different members of the beef industry.
Q11|Household Demand for Meat in Nigeria| This study was an application of the Linear Approximate Almost Ideal Demand System (LA-AIDS) model on household aggregate meat demand in Nigeria. The data used was obtained from the World Bank’s Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) on households in Nigeria. Previous research had studied demand only at a regional level but this study estimates meat demand at a national level. The results showed that beef was a necessity while goat, chicken and mutton were luxuries. The results further revealed that all the meat products considered were normal goods with own-prices that were negative and consistent with demand theory except mutton. Goat meat and mutton were price elastic and as such, price changes for these products will affect their consumers more than consumers of other meat products that were less elastic.

Q11|Adaptation to Climate Change: Evidence from US Agriculture|Understanding the potential impacts of climate change on economic outcomes requires knowing how agents might adapt to a changing climate. We exploit large variation in recent temperature and precipitation trends to identify adaptation to climate change in US agriculture, and use this information to generate new estimates of the potential impact of future climate change on agricultural outcomes. Longer run adaptations appear to have mitigated less than half--and more likely none--of the large negative short-run impacts of extreme heat on productivity. Limited recent adaptation implies substantial losses under future climate change in the absence of countervailing investments.
Q11|Food Prices and Inflation in Tanzania|We develop an empirical representation of inflation in Tanzania for the decade from 2001, estimating 'multiple-determinant' single-equation models for headline inflation and its major components (food, energy and core inflation). Our results suggest that while supplyside factors, including yield variability and international price arbitrage, play a major role in determining domestic food and fuel inflation (which together account for almost 60 percent of the total CPI basket), demand-side factors amenable to policy intervention by the monetary authorities anchor core inflation.
Q11|Analysis of Price Shock Transmission: Case of the Wheat-Bread Market Value Chain in Ethiopia|This study assesses the degree of vertical price transmission along the wheat-bread value chain in Ethiopia. This is pursued by applying a vector error correction model (VECM) and an impulse response analysis using monthly price data for the period 2000-2015. The analysis considers different market levels starting from international wheat market and domestic wheat producers at the upstream to domestic bread market at the downstream of the value chain. The empirical findings indicate that significant cointegration exists across prices of the different stages along the value chain. There is a transmission from international prices to domestic prices at downstream markets, in particular flour and bread prices. Prices at upstream markets are largely influenced by the domestic wholesale market. In general, the speed of adjustment is quite slow with a half-life of about one year for restoring the equilibrium price. As price margins between the different market stages in the value chain have substantially decreased in the last 15 years, higher transmission, and thus, exposure to international market shocks can be expected in future. Last but not least, the results also reveal that causal relationships exist between prices at different market stages-with the wholesale market identified as the key market level where prices and price expectations are formed.
Q11|Impacts of climate and price changes on global food production| Agriculture is one of the key drivers and victims of climate change. Climate-resilient agriculture is therefore vital for achieving enhanced food security—which is a crucial component of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). This paper provides answers to questions that are prerequisite for policies that address agriculture and climate change. We analyze the determinants of global average crop production for maize, wheat, rice, and soybeans over the period 1961–2013. We find strong and statistically significant supply elasticities for all four crops with respect to own crop prices. Our results also underscore the relevance of output price volatility for the supply of these key global agricultural staple crops—especially on production of wheat and maize. Comparing the standardized effect sizes of own price and price volatility estimates, the effects are on par for wheat production while the price volatility effect is only a fifth of the own price effect on maize production. In agreement with previous studies, we also find that climate change has significant adverse effects on production of the world’s key staple crops. More importantly, this study finds that weather extremes—both in terms of temperature and precipitation shocks— during the growing months have significant adverse impacts on the production of the abovementioned food crops. Price and weather extremes do not only adversely affect average global food production, they also positively contribute to the year-to-year fluctuations of food availability. Thus, combating climate change using both mitigation and adaptation technologies is crucial for global production and hence food security.
Q11|Got data too poor for time series analysis? Can cluster analysis be a remedy? Studying wheat market integration in Ethiopia| Recent global food price developments have spurred renewed interest in analyzing integration of local markets to global markets. A popular approach to quantify market integration is cointegration analysis. However, local market price data often has missing values, outliers, or short and incomplete series, making cointegration analysis impossible. Instead of imputing missing data, this paper proposes cluster analysis as an alternative methodological approach for analyzing market integration. In particular, we perform cluster analyses on a set of statistical indicators of eight Ethiopian local price series to analyze how they relate to world market prices. Moreover, recognizing several policy regimes in the period 2007-2010 we investigate how market clusters change over time. Results show that in periods with wheat imports via the private sector, several local markets form a common cluster with the world market. In periods with government controlled imports and exchange rate collapse, domestic prices measured by a comprehensive set of characteristics were strongly dissimilar from those of world market prices.
Q11|Semiparametric insights into price dynamics in Tanzanian maize markets| Maize is a major staple food in Sub-Saharan Africa. Monthly maize prices in Tanzania are analyzed since the country is an important maize producer and exporter in East Africa. We analyze price transmission between the five most important urban regions of Tanzania between 2000 and 2008 which correspond to major maize production or consumption areas. We propose a novel method for the analysis. The semiparametric vector error-correction model allows the partial impact of the past deviations from price equilibria on current price changes to be potentially nonlinear. The nonparametric estimates of these partial influences suggest that they can be adequately modeled by linear functions.
Q11|Segmenting Wine Market: California Red and White Wine Retail Prices in British Columbia| Previous hedonic wine studies have employed conventional regression models to show the effects of objective and subjective attributes such as sensory characteristics, expert quality panel assessments, and regional reputation on wine prices. This paper employs a market segmentation approach based on price to show how lower, mid-priced and higher priced California red and white wines sold in British Columbia (BC) are influenced by objective attributes including geographical origin, grape variety, family brand names, alcohol content, and volume sales. Results show that red and white wine prices are segmented differently and the price segments for either wine type vary from those reported by earlier studies. Also, the effects of numerous attributes on wine prices vary significantly across wine types and price segments. The study findings show higher priced California Cabernet Sauvignon wines fetch a sizeable price premium compared to similar priced varietal wines like Merlot. Higher priced California white wines from Napa are discounted relative to wines labeled with a generic California appellation, whereas higher priced California red wines from Sonoma, Central Valley and Central Coast earn a price discount. Moreover, alcohol content is negatively related to higher priced California red wines, while positively associated with prices of mid-priced and higher priced California white wines.
Q11|Detecting the Sources of Information Rigidity: Analyzing Forecast Bias and Smoothing in USDA’s Soybean Forecasts| USDA’s U.S. soybean ending stock forecasts are upwardly biased. To determine the source of this bias, we examine the revision characteristics of the ending stocks forecasts, and examine USDA’s forecasts of other U.S. soybean balance sheet variables and foreign soybean balance sheet variables. Bias in USDA’s soybean export forecasts is the most likely source of ending stock forecast bias. In turn, bias in the U.S. export forecasts has diverse sources, including bias in foreign trade estimates and late in the forecast cycle slow updating of the forecasts to reflect new information.

Q11|Price Discovery and Price Transparency in the U.S. Cheese Industry| The private Exchange spot cheese market has historically performed a primary price-discovery function in the U.S. cheese industry. Since 1997 the spot cheese trade takes place at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The Exchange spot cheese prices have been used as reference prices in cheese contracts used to transact the vast majority of cheese produced in the country. Furthermore, the Exchange spot cheese prices have been influencing prices paid for milk used in cheese manufacturing within the system of Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs). The objective of this research is to analyze the conduct and performance of the Exchange spot cheese market during three FMMOs milk pricing regimes (1983-2015). First, the patterns of trading activities (actual sales, unfilled bids and uncovered offers) and the behavior of spot cheddar cheese prices are analyzed. Second, to evaluate the role of the Exchange spot cheese market in the entire U.S. cheese industry, the performance of the natural cheddar cheese industry segment is evaluated by analyzing changes in milk price, wholesale cheddar cheese price, retail price of natural cheddar cheese and associated margins over time.
Q11|The Great Recession and Vertical Price Transmission in the U.S Beef Market| This study analyses the price adjustment of the U.S beef sector using monthly prices of the farm, wholesale and retail levels for the period of 1970-2014. The objectives are to investigate both speed and magnitude of price adjustment. To this purpose, the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) and historical decomposition graphs are applied. The results indicate that retail prices have lower speed of adjustment than wholesale prices. Also, the magnitude of price adjustment in the presence of the Great Recession shock, as an exogenous shock, is different for each level of the U.S. beef marketing chain such that wholesale prices show a higher magnitude of price adjustment toward the long-run equilibrium. Finally, it is concluded that with respect to both speed and magnitude of the price adjustment, the U.S. beef sector has asymmetric price adjustment, pointing to inefficiency of the U.S. beef supply chain. These results have welfare implications for the U.S. beef consumers and producers.

Q11|Price Discovery in the U.S. Milled Rice Markets using a Cluster Analysis and Tournament| A major aspect concerning US rice producers and milling industry has to do with price transmission and the price discovery process among domestic milled rice markets and the international rice market. The paper investigates the dynamic relationships between the US domestic and international rice prices and determines the price discovery process using the vector error correction model (ECM) and the tournament approach using a cluster analysis. Results determine that Arkansas medium grain and California short grain are milled rice price reference or leaders in the U.S. We compare the speed of adjustment coefficients from ECM and find that California short grain has a slight edge over Arkansas medium though this lead may be rather insignificant. Two markets contribute equally in the price discovery process. We test both Arkansas medium and California short against Thai 5% rice export price, a frequent reference of international rice price. Result indicates that Thai 5% slightly leads Arkansas medium but is mildly led by California short. The US market and Thai 5% contribute equally in the price discovery in the international market. Results indicate differences from prior findings that the US rice market is segregated from Asian/international market.
Q11|A Global Demand Analysis of Vegetable Oils for Food and Industrial Use: A Cross-Country Panel Data Analysis with Spatial Econometrics| This article analyzes global demand for major edible and non-edible vegetable oils using cross-country panel data from 1991 to 2011. A fixed effects model, accounting for spatial dependence of the residuals, is specified. Compared to food use, income elasticities are significantly higher for industrial use, suggesting that demand for non-edible vegetable oils is expected to increase with the rise of global wealth in the future. Income elasticities will be useful for simulation research of estimating how much agricultural land needs to be developed in the future in order to meet an expected increase in demand for biofuel feedstocks.
Q11|Intraday market effects in electronic soybean futures market during non-trading and trading hour announcements| This article investigates market reactions to major United States Department of Agriculture announcements during non-trading and trading hours in the soybean futures market using microstructure data. Following report release, volume increases and remains elevated for up to 15 to 20 minutes. The volume spikes for the non-trading releases relative to the trading releases, but are identical after the first reaction. Report releases during non-trading hours cause a large spike in volatility at the onset of trading which subsides quickly. In contrast, releases during trading hours result in a smaller volatility spike, which extends for 5–6 min at a higher magnitude. Adjusting volatility by normal trading volatility indicates that volatility in trading hour release is higher in both immediate response and persistence. Return correlations provide little evidence to support systematic under- or overreaction in prices regardless of when the report is released reflecting the efficiency of the market.
Q11|The Effect of China’s Pork Reserve Program on Pork Price Volatility| China introduced a systematic pork reserve program in 2009 to decrease pork price volatility. The price stabilization effectiveness of the reserve program is unknown. Two econometric procedures are used to analyze the effectiveness of the program in reducing pork price volatility. The first approach is an autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic (ARCH) regression model estimated using monthly national average wholesale pork price data for January 2000 to July 2015. Price volatility is modeled as the difference in monthly price in consecutive months. The ARCH procedure controls for domestic production, consumer income and seasonality. A difference in difference (DD) regression procedure, compliments the ARCH procedure, to further investigate the relationship between the reserve policy and price volatility. Two DD analyses are conducted. The first analysis measures monthly price volatility in terms of absolute differences, and the second in absolute percentage change differences. Both the ARCH and DD approaches find that pork price volatility increased, not decreased, after the introduction of the reserve program.
Q11|Estimating the Location of World Wheat Price Determination| The United States may be losing its leading role in the world wheat market. Rising trading volume in foreign futures markets and shifting shares of world trade are suggested as evidence of this shift, but neither necessitates that futures markets in the United States are any less important for wheat price discovery. This paper uses the Hasbrouck (1995) Information Shares method to estimate the proportion of price discovery occurring in wheat futures markets in Chicago and Paris. Our preliminary results suggest that both markets are important for price discovery, but the Chicago market still leads. The proportion of wheat price discovery in each market remained relative stable over the period 2007-2013.
Q11|An Evaluation of the 2015 Outbreak of Avian Influenza in the U.S| This study quantifies the impacts of the 2015 outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) along the Pacific, Central and Mississippi flyways via a partial equilibrium sector-specific modeling system. Production shocks for egg and turkey sectors as well as trade shocks for egg, turkey, and broiler sectors are analyzed based on actual changes reported by USDA. Alternative scenarios for greater HPAI production losses were analyzed along with export demand reductions to test the combined impacts on prices of broiler, eggs, and turkey. The effects of the HPAI outbreak are examined by comparing the 10-year projection results for production, exports, prices, and per capita consumption for broiler, turkey, and egg. In all cases, the effects of the shock on production start to disappear after the second year while the effects of the shock on exports continue for 5 or more years.
Q11|Economic Impact Of The Sugarcane Aphid Outbreak In South Texas| The sorghum industry is threatened by a new invasive pest, the sugarcane aphid (SCA), capable of causing substantial damage to crop production and local economies. Little work has been conducted to assess and better understand the economic implications of the SCA outbreak. The objective of this study was to estimate the economic impact of SCA in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV), Texas, where 11.5% of the state production is located. Local producers were surveyed to gather detailed information about yearly crop yields, crop acreage, insecticide application decisions, and management and production practices. Collected data were used to estimate the reduction in growers’ profit associated to the SCA infestation, as well as the monetary value of the prevented loss attributed to control efforts. Sorghum industry losses were then used to assess the overall economic impact of the SCA outbreak in the LRGV economy in terms of output, value-added, labor income and employment effects.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q11|Valuing the Absence of Feral Swine for US Corn, Soybean, Wheat, Rice, and Peanut Producers and Consumers. A Partial Equilibrium Approach|" Conflicts between humans and wildlife are manifestations of inevitable divergences between human interests and wildlife presence and survival. Those conflicts can range from property damage to threatening and predatory behavior (USDA APHIS 2015). In the US, considerable financial resources are dedicated to managing human-wildlife conflicts. In 2014, the USDA allocated $106 million to the Wildlife Services division of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service for a portion of the federally funded human-wildlife conflict mitigation efforts (USDA 2015). Among policy makers and researchers interested in human-wildlife conflicts, one species of particular recent interest is feral swine. The USDA has dedicated $20 million to support the ambitious goals to ""eliminate feral swine from two States [sic] every three to five years and stabilize feral swine damage within 10 [sic] years"" and to these and supporting efforts (Bannerman and Cole 2014). Feral swine are known to cause damage to crops among other types of property damage. Pimentel, Zuniga, and Morrison (2005) is the only publication with a nationwide estimate of feral swine damage in the US, estimating $800 million in crop and environmental damages per year. Damage estimates such as Pimentel, Zuniga, and Morrison (2005) are part of the foundation of knowledge required to arrive at an economic value of removal. However, they do not reflect a more complex reality. When crops are damaged, the quantity available to be brought to market decreases. Markets adjust to the lower quantities with higher prices. Farms suffering damage have less to sell at higher market prices and farms that do not suffer damage have the same quantity at higher market prices. Welfare measures such as changes in producer and consumer surplus describe if individuals are better or worse off from a given policy action or market change. To-date, there are no studies that assess the welfare implications of feral swine crop damage. To address this need in the literature we ask, what are the welfare effects to US crop producers and consumers from an immediate removal of feral swine in nine of the hardest hit states in the southeastern US? Additionally, what would be the distribution of those effects among consumers and farmers in different states? A partial equilibrium model is built based on historical production data in all US counties with a crop insurance program for Corn, Soybeans, Wheat, Rice, and Peanuts from USDA NASS, feral swine presence data from USDA APHIS, and feral swine damage estimates from a recent USDA survey conducted in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas. This model is used to create a counterfactual to the current reality of feral swine damage to value the absence of feral swine in the previously mentioned states. One framework for measuring the effects of feral swine crop damage is an Equilibrium Displacement Model (EDM). The EDM is a linear abstraction of supply and demand functions that describe the transition from one equilibrium to another without defining an exact functional form (Wohlgenant 2011; Wohlgenant 1993). The versatility of the EDM has allowed them to be used to examine export demand effects on grain, feed products, and livestock using genetically modified organisms (Preckel, Harrington and Dubman 2002), returns to public research (Alston, Norton and Pardey 1995), welfare effects of the Washington State University wheat breeding program (Nogueira et al. 2015), country of origin labeling (Brester, Marsh and Atwood 2004), and animal disease outbreaks (Pendell et al. 2007), among other uses. These varied applications are made possible by the flexibility inherent to the EDM. The literature has examples of EDMs with more than one product and location to serve as examples. Perrin and Scobie (1981) use an EDM with both multiple markets and price wedges to study the options for increasing nutrient consumption among Colombia's poor. More recently, Wohlgenant (2011) detailed several different variants of EDMs with multiple products and markets including vertical integration and joint products. Alston, Norton, and Pardey (1995) described several variants of EDMs with multiple markets including products related in consumption and products related in production as well as other models with multiple geographical markets. Nogueira et al. (2015) created a model that had both multiple products and multiple markets. Each of these models took a slightly different approach to measuring welfare changes. Our model closely follows the lead of Nogueira et al. (2015) in covering the products listed above in more than one place. Due to the price decrease resulting from the quantity increase, preliminary results indicate welfare losses for producers in states without feral swine, welfare gains or even losses for producers in states with feral swine, and unambiguous gains for consumers from a removal of feral swine damage. Final results will establish upper limits for what should be paid to control feral swine based on crop damage justification."
Q11|Costly Choices: Does the U.S. Retail Market Reward Coffee Origin Labeling?| The paper presents estimated single origin premiums based on retail prices for specialty coffees offered in the U.S. market from 1997 to 2014. The data include retail price, the quantity sold in a retail package and label descriptions that identify 28 different origins. Label descriptions also include information on cultural practices such as natural and organic production, market channels such as Fair Trade and whether the wholesale source was a specialty auction. In addition, data for each coffee contains a score for roast type and a cup rating determined by professional tasters. The overall data set permits and evaluation how coffee origin affects market values, as well as how different coffee supply chain segments affect value, including the coffee producer, market channel and roaster.

Q11|Pass-through in the United States Beef Industry: An Update and Expansion| Understanding how signals for change are transmitted from primary consumer demand through the supply chain is key for long-term prosperity of the cattle industry. Zhao, Du, and Hennessy (2011) used Ricardian rent theory (RRT) to determine if complete pass-through occurs from fed cattle and corn prices to feeder cattle prices. Due to changes in the beef industry since 2004, this study updates and expands Zhao, Du, and Hennessy (2011). This article presents three analyses. First, an update using data from 2004 to 2016 is presented. Next, an analysis using futures market feeder and live cattle prices from 1994 to 2016 identifies four different regimes and tests RRT in each regime. Finally, Kansas cash feeder cattle and expected live cattle prices using historical basis are used to test RRT with two structural breaks. Evidence supporting RRT in cattle markets is mixed. The future direction of expansion for this study is discussed.
Q11|GMO Contamination Price Effects in the U.S. Corn Market: StarLink and MIR162| While genetically modified technology has been investigated extensively, few studies have examined the price impact of genetically modified food contamination events. This paper contributes to the literature by examining the price effects of multiple genetically modified contamination events in the U.S. corn market. Using the relative price of substitute method and time-varying cointegration, we identify three structural breaks relevant to the corn contamination events, with the two largest being associated with StarLink and MIR162. Our results support the StarLink’s large effect on corn prices, but the effect attributed to MIR162 is less clear. This more recent break in prices emerged three months prior to China’s import ban, and was influenced by changes in U.S. corn supply, and EPA’s proposed reduction of the ethanol mandate. Expansion of sorghum exports and subsequent increased corn production likely kept pressure on corn prices. While China’s import ban on MIR162 may have influenced prices, evidence suggests the recent downturn in the U.S. corn market has been mainly caused by other domestic supply and demand changes.
Q11|Analysis of Energy and Agricultural Commodity Markets with the Policy Mandated: A Vine Copula-based ARMA-EGARCH Model| The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 states an increase in ethanol production to 36 billion gallons per year by 2022. Biofuels mainly are produced from agricultural commodities, so that increasing demand of biofuels would have an impact on agricultural commodity prices. The linear relationships between crude oil prices and prices for agricultural commodities are well documented, but not appropriate to explain the asymmetric dependency. Vine copula modeling which is used in this study can extend to higher dimensions easily and provide a flexible measurement to capture an asymmetric dependence among commodities. The purpose of this study is to analyze the degree and the dependence structure of commodities with the policy effect of EISA 2007 along the biofuel supply chain in the United States agricultural market. We employ vine copulas in order to better capture an asymmetric dependence among commodities using six U.S. agricultural commodities’ and crude oil. The empirical results provide that vine Copula-based ARMA-EGARCH (1,1) is an appropriate model with the skewed Student t innovations to analyze returns dependency of crude oil and agricultural commodities before EISA 2007 (January 1st, 2003- January 17th, 2007) and after EISA 2007 (January 18th, 2007-December 31st, 2012). Our findings on the relationship among agricultural commodities can provide policymakers and industry participants appropriate strategies for risk management, hedging strategies, and asset pricing.
Q11|Does the Boxed Beef Price Inform the Live Cattle Futures Price?| We study the lead-lag relationship among live cattle futures and negotiated boxed beef cutout prices. To account for temporal differences in the information contained in boxed beef report release, Friday afternoon boxed beef prices are compared to both current day and one-day prior live cattle futures settlement prices. Extensive testing and innovation accounting based on VECM residuals indicate that the futures price leads boxed beef price as the dominant source of information in the fed cattle market. The futures price has a strong predictive influence on the boxed beef price and appears to assimilate fed cattle price information quicker than both contemporaneous and one-day ahead boxed beef prices. Newly-developed price discovery metrics interpreted to allow for a maximum boxed beef effect in the pricing process still identify the dominance of the current futures price, and nearly equal weighting for the lagged one-day futures price.
Q11|New Evidence On The Structure Of Food Demand In China: An Easi Demand Model Estimated Via Panel Data Techniques| This study analyzes the structure of food demand in urban China based on the most recent household expenditure survey data. Consumer food preferences are represented by an Exact Affine Stone Index (EASI) demand model, which accounts for unobserved consumer heterogeneity and allows for arbitrary Engel curve shapes. Further, we account for unobserved province-level heterogeneity in food preferences via province fixed-effects. Our findings indicate that seafood, fruit, and vegetables are income and expenditure elastic, while commodities such as grains and eggs are less than unitary elastic.

Q11|Proximity and price co-movement in West African rice markets| We have explored the link between proximity and price transmission in rice markets, where proximity is captured using variables for geographic, political and cultural distance. Linear and threshold cointegration was tested for 351 rice market pairs in six West African countries, with threshold specifications accounting for transaction costs. The influence of proximity on price transmission is estimated in a subsequent multinomial logistic regression. The results provide evidence of a robust and statistically significant link between the strength of price transmission and measures of proximity such as distance, international borders, contiguity and a common language. We conclude that proximity matters for market integration processes in West African rice markets.
Q11|Estimating the Location of World Wheat Price Discovery|The United States may be losing its leadership role in the world wheat market. Rising trading volume in foreign futures markets and shifting shares of world trade are suggested as evidence of this shift, but neither necessitates that futures markets in the United States are any less important for wheat price discovery. This paper applies high frequency pricing data and market microstructure methods, including the Yan and Zivot (2010) information leadership share, to estimate the proportion of price discovery occurring in wheat futures markets associated with Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Paris. We find United States futures markets remain dominant, although the share of price discovery for the Paris market increased noticeably in 2010, coinciding with major supply shocks in Russia and Ukraine. Prior to August 2010, 91% of information about the common fundamental value of wheat was first revealed in United States futures markets in an average month. After August 2010, this share dropped to 75%.
Q11|Anticipatory Signals of Changes in Corn Demand| Contemporaneous observations on expected supply and on prices of post-harvest futures contracts for corn are used to estimate expected demand relationships. These equations are used to forecast the prices of the post-harvest contracts based on new supply estimates. Each forecast can be compared with a corresponding futures price, i.e., the market’s forecast. The differences help discern the market’s expectations about the expected demand for the new crop relative to historical experience, which can help support outlook analyses. The discussion also deepens understanding of the term “anticipatory prices,” as used by H. Working (1958).
Q11|Testing for bubbles in agriculture commodity markets| [EN] We apply the recent generalized sup augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) test for explo-sive bubbles (Phillips et al., 2012) to monthly time-series for food, beverages, agricultural raw material, cereals, dairy, meat, oils and sugar indices and a total of 28 agricultural commodities between 1980-2012. We found price bubbles occurred for 6 out of the 10 indices studied and for 6 out of the 28 commodities within food markets. Results from the tests can help implementing policies aimed at mitigating effects of future price bubbles to targeted food commodity markets that may require special attention. [ES] Aquí aplicamos un test estadístico recientemente desarrollado para la identificación de bur-bujas explosivas, generalized sup augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) test (Phillips et al., 2012) a series temporales mensuales de indicadores de precios de alimentos, bebidas, materias primas agrícolas, cere-ales, productos lácteos, productos cárnicos, aceites y azúcar así como para un total de 28 productos agrí-colas durante el período 1980-2012. Se han encontrado burbujas en los precios para 6 de los 10 índices y para 6 de los 28 productos alimenticios estudiados. Los resultados de estos tests pueden ayudar a llevar a cabo políticas que tengan como objetivo mitigar los efectos de futuras burbujas explosivas en mercados de productos agrícolas identificados como aquellos puedan requerir una atención especial.
Q11|Understanding Dynamic Conditional Correlations between Commodities Futures Markets|We estimate dynamic conditional correlations between 10 commodities futures returns in energy, metals and agriculture markets over the period 1998-2014 with a DCC-GARCH model. We look at the factors influencing those correlations, adopting a pooled mean group (PMG) estimator. Macroeconomic variables are significantly correlated with agriculture-energy and metals-energy dynamic conditional correlations; while financial variables are relevant in the agriculture-energy correlations and poorly significant in the metals-energy ones. Speculative activity is generally not statistically significant. Correlations started increasing in the years before the financial crisis and decreased at the end of our period of analysis.
Q11|Price signals and supply responses for staple food crops in SSA countries|"Several studies have focused on estimating the supply response of farmers in Sub Saharan Africa.This literature has used a variety of approaches and has generally concluded that price elasticities of supply were low or very low. However, only a few analyses have gone beyond estimating the aggregate supply response for the sector as whole or the specific case of cash crops. In most cases, data scarcity especially on producer prices has been the main limiting factor. In this paper, we revisit this question focusing on the supply response of main staple food crops in selected Sub Saharan African (SSA) countries. We use an innovative dataset recently developed by FAO's ""Monitoring and Analysing Food and Agricultural Policies"" (MAFAP) programme which provides prices at the producer, wholesale, and border levels for selected value chains. Using dynamic panel techniques, we are able to test how acreage, production and yields respond to price signals and other non-price factors over the recent food price crises (2005-2013).We observe that farmers producing staple food crops react to real price signals, even if with a limited intensity. Moreover, our results suggest that direct price incentives arising from border protection and government intervention in domestic markets and price shocks at the border are more important than macroeconomic policies in influencing farmers' decisions. We also show that omitting marketing costs from the supply response function leads to underestimation of the price elasticity. Conversely, using wholesale instead of farm gate prices as proxy for producer prices leads to overestimation of the price elasticity."
Q11|Organized Data and Information for Efficacious Agriculture Using PRIDE™ Model| Farmers in India are faced with a myriad of issues from access to agricultural inputs, scientific agriculture practices, and market intelligence over climate and weather calamities which often make farming an unprofitable business. A combined approach of group farming and effective farm management with the help of efficient data collection, processing and analysis is a widely accepted solution to these issues. Progressive Rural Integrated Digital Enterprise (PRIDE™) is an innovative business model which enables rural India to tackle these challenges and prosper collectively. The technology enables efficient collection of data from farmers’ fields, agricultural universities, and other private and public stakeholders which is processed and disseminated to farmers on their mobile phones.
Q11|Price Transmission in Global Dairy Markets| The price relationships governing dairy commodity price transmission among the US, Oceania, and EU markets are considered using vector autoregressive (VAR) and vector error correction (VECM) models. Results demonstrate a one-way price relationship for US dry milk powders as price shocks in Oceania and the European Union spread to the United States while US price shocks do not spread into those markets. US prices for cheddar and butter are impacted by price shocks in Oceania and the EU. However, US price shocks also spread into the Oceania market and may reflect potential arbitrage opportunities. Historically thought to be shielded from international prices through low import quotas and high out-of-quota tariffs, these results are the first to empirically demonstrate that US dairy commodity prices are influenced in both the long-run and short-run by international dairy commodity prices.
Q11|A Segmented Hedonic Analysis of the Nutritional Composition of Fruit Beverages| Given the increased importance consumers and manufacturers have placed on the functional nutrients found in fruit beverages, as well as the changing federal guidelines on fruit beverage consumption, this study sought to determine whether specific nutrients garner price premiums in fruit beverages sold in the US. Using the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey, hedonic price models for fruit juice and fruit drinks are estimated to determine whether specific nutrients, product characteristics, packaging type and acquisition characteristics are associated with price premiums. Based on the results from the hedonic price models, three generalizations are made about the price premiums for nutrients and sugar in fruit beverages: (1) all nutrients garner premium prices in fruit juice, (2) sugar and select nutrients garner price premiums in non-diet fruit drinks and (3) all nutrients and sugar are associated with negative price premiums in diet fruit drinks. Findings further suggest that product attributes such as brand, flavor, organic labels, diet labels and package type, and acquisition characteristics such as store type, region, season and payment type are associated with price premiums in fruit beverages.
Q11|Problems Of Ecological Farms On Valuable Natural Areas (Based On The Example Of The West-Pomeranian Province)| Subject and purpose of work: The study deals with the issue of ecological agricultural farms from the West-Pomeranian Province, which are located close to or on valuable natural areas. It aims to describe the kinds of problems which accompany the activity of ecological farms situated on naturally valuable areas. Materials and methods: The review of the research studies was based on Polish and foreign literature was made. The analysis of the survey data collected from farmers working on ecological farms located close to or directly on valuable natural areas was also conducted. A sample of 765 farmers was used for the purpose of the study. Results : The data gathered from the survey have led to seven conclusions. It was proved that natural methods of production are desirable, on the one hand, as they help preserve the values of nature sites, but, on the other hand, they are considered by farmers as insufficiently developmental as far as valuable natural areas are concerned. Conclusions : It is therefore necessary develop and present different concepts of development resulting from the mutual support and interaction.-----Przedmiot i cel pracy: Przedmiotem opracowania są ekologiczne gospodarstwa rolne województwa zachodniopomorskiego położone w pobliżu lub na terenach obszarów przyrodniczo cennych.

Badania ankietowe przeprowadzono na próbie liczącej 765 rolników. Wyniki : Uzyskana wiedza pozwoliła na opracowanie 7 wniosków i potwierdzenie, że naturalne metody produkcji są z jednej strony wskazane do długotrwałego zachowania walorów obszarów przyrodniczo cennych, ale z drugiej strony uważane są przez rolników za mało rozwojowe właśnie ze względu na obszary przyrodniczo cenne. Wnioski : Konieczne jest wobec powyższego opracowanie i przedstawienie różnych koncepcji rozwoju wynikających z wzajemnego wspierania i współoddziaływania.
Q11|Crises de Segurança do Alimento e a Demanda por Carnes no Brasil| We investigate whether food safety crises affect the demands for beef, pork and chicken in Brazil. We construct series of food safety crisis indices for each meat (beef, pork and chicken) based on the total number of news in ‘Folha de São Paulo’ newspaper fitting predefined search criteria. We use those series, the retail prices of each type of meat, the price of a composite good and per capita expenditure on consumption as explanatory variables in six specifications of a four-equation demand system. We select the preferred specification of the models based on adjusted likelihood ratio tests. Based on the preferred model specification we do not reject the hypothesis by which food safety crisis do not affect the demand for meat in Brazil. We conclude that if the shifts down in the demand in response to food safety crises create incentives for companies to adopt measures to produce safer food, such incentives do not exist in the meat sector in Brazil. This reinforces the importance and necessity of an active public system to regulate and establish standards for meat safety in Brazil.
Q11|Prices of Domestic and Imported Riesling Wine in the U.S. Market: A Hedonic Price Approach| The price of wine reflects the various features that differentiate each bottle. This study is aimed at analyzing the determinants of Riesling wine prices, one of the most popular varieties in the white wine category. A hedonic price model is estimated using data collected between 2000 and 2015 from the Wine Spectator, with a total of 3078 individual wines, focusing on age, vintage, production, critical points, and variables related to the country of origin. The impact of geographic production of origin from Canada, Germany, France, Italy, New Zealand and South Africa is analyzed. An important aspect of this analysis is to investigate whether the country of origin of production is important, and if any price premium from a key import region like Germany is changing, holding quality and quantity constant. The main findings suggest Riesling prices are determined by time related variables such as age and vintage. The levels of production and expert points given by the Wine Spectator also have a significant impact on prices.
Q11|An Analysis of Fresh Vegetables in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan Area| Since 1961 world vegetable consumption and production have been increasing steadily at annual average growth rates of 3.24 % and 9.29 % respectively. Tomatoes represent the largest annual world production volume with an average share of 62% followed by carrots (13 %), lettuce (10%), cauliflower (8%), spinach (6%) and onions (2 %). The study estimates the full Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) and provides an in-depth analysis of fresh vegetables in the Dallas-Ft. Worth metropolitan area, which is largest market for Northeast Texas producers. The study estimates expenditure and price elasticities using AC Nielsen Homescan consumption data on carrots, cauliflowers, lettuce, onions, spinach, tomatoes, and precut salad mix. It is critical for vegetable growers and agribusinesses to understand the substitution patterns among different types of vegetables as well as current production and consumption trends at the retail level. A discussion about how various types of fresh vegetables perform at the retail level is presented. Several cases of substitutes and complements fresh vegetables were identified. Our disaggregated analysis may help producers better identify products that are highly marketable in the area. Our results may also provide insight in determining which fresh vegetables are most profitable for local producers.
