R13|An assessment of IPA public investment in R&I in Albania|The European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) is supporting an Innovation Agenda for the Western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, Republic of North Macedonia and Serbia). Smart Specialisation is the European Union (EU) place-based policy aiming at more thematic concentration in research and innovation (R&I) investments via the evidence-based identification of the strengths and potential of a given economy. Access to data and economic analysis are key to a better identification of both current and future socio-economic policy challenges. The EU Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) supports reforms in the enlargement countries with financial and technical help. Out of the almost â‚¬650 million destined to Albania over the programming period 2014-2022, â‚¬44 are supporting competitiveness and innovation. Policy simulations using CGE modelling techniques show positive macro-economic effects of the IPA funds for competitiveness and innovation both in the short run and in the long run thanks to productivity improvements.
R13|The impact of the Grand Paris Express on the European regions: a RHOMOLO analysis|This technical report illustrates a simulation performed to assess the likely economic impact of the Grand Paris Express investments on the ÃŽle-de-France and the other European Union regions, under the working assumption of a combined 1% increase in labour productivity due to better matching between skill supply and demand and a 1% increase in accessibility due to the project. Our simulations suggest an overall medium-term positive GDP impact for the EU as a whole (0.18%), for France (0.79%) and for ÃŽle-de-France (2.61%).
R13|On the Road (Again): Commuting and Local Employment Elasticities in Germany|This paper uses the quantitative spatial model with heterogeneous locations linked by costly goods trade, migration and commuting developed in Monte et al. (2018) to address the workings of local labor markets in Germany. One key contribution concerns the analysis of the role of the expenditure share of housing in the economy. We provide arguments that, in accordance with Rognlie (2015), for an economy-wide quantitative exercise, this share should be chosen lower than stipulated in much of the extant research. Our analyses show that the local general equilibrium employment and resident elasticities with respect to local productivity shocks are significantly higher with a lower housing share. Moreover, simple ex-ante observable commuting measures have very little predictive power for these general equilibrium elasticities when the housing share is small. The size of the housing share turns out to play no crucial role for two further results, however. First, employment and resident elasticities are very heterogeneous across German local labor markets, irrespective of the housing share. Second, the housing share has only little influence on the welfare effects and location patterns of counterfactual commuting cost reductions.
R13|The pure effect of social preferences on regional location choices: The evolving dynamics of convergence to a steady state population distribution| This paper tracks the consequences of individuals’ desire to align their location with their social preferences. The social preference studied in the paper is distaste for relative deprivation, measured in a cardinal manner. Location is conceived as social space, with individuals choosing to relocate if, as a result, their relative deprivation will be reduced, holding their incomes constant. Conditions are provided under which the associated dynamics reaches a spatial steady state, the number of periods it takes to reach a steady state is specified, and light is shed on the robustness of the steady state outcome. By way of simulation it is shown that for large populations, a steady state of the relocation dynamics is almost always reached, typically in one period, and that cycles are more likely to occur when the populations’ income distributions are more equal.
R13|A geographical simulation of impacts of Vientiane-Hanoi expressway|In this paper, we estimated the economic impacts of the proposed and some alternative routes of Vientiane-Hanoi Expressway (VHE), using a computational general equilibrium model based on spatial economics. The estimation results show that overall international positive impact depends more on whether it forms a cross-border expressway connection between the capitals of Vietnam and Thailand. The proximity of the expressway to Laos’s capital is nevertheless critical to economic benefits expected within Laos.
R13|The Welfare Effects of Transportation Infrastructure Improvements|We develop a general equilibrium geographic framework to characterize the welfare effect of transportation infrastructure investments. We tackle three distinct but conflating challenges: First, we offer an analytical characterization of the routing problem and, in particular, how infrastructure investment between any two connected locations decreases the total trade costs between all pairs of locations. Second, we characterize how this cost reduction affects welfare within a standard general equilibrium geography setup where market inefficiencies arise due to agglomeration and dispersion spillovers. Finally, we show how our framework admits analytical characterizations of traffic congestion, which creates a critical --albeit tractable--feedback loop between trade costs and the general equilibrium economic system. We apply these results to calculate the welfare eects of improving each of the thousands of segments of the U.S. national highway network. We nd large but heterogeneous welfare eects with the largest gains concentrated in metropolitan areas and along important trading corridors
R13|On the Economics of Science Parks|Science parks play a growing in knowledge-based economies by accommodating high-tech firms and providing an environment that fosters location-dependent knowledge spillovers and promote R&D investments by firms. Yet, not much is known about the economic conditions under which such entities may form in equilibrium without government interventions. This paper develops a spatial equilibrium model with a competitive final sector and a monopolistic competitive intermediate sector, which allows us to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for a science park to emerge as an equilibrium outcome. We show that strong localized knowledge spillovers, high startup costs, skilled labor abundance, or low commuting costs make intermediate firms more likely to cluster and a science park more likely to form. We also show that the productivity of the final sector is highest when intermediate firms cluster. As the decay penalty, firms' startup and workers' commuting costs become lower, science parks will eventually be fragmented
R13|Affordable Housing and City Welfare|Housing affordability has become one of the main policy challenges for the major cities of the world. Two key policy levers are zoning and rent control policies. We build a new dynamic equilibrium asset pricing model to evaluate the implications of such policies for house prices, rents, production and income, residential construction, income and wealth inequality, as well as the spatial distribution of households within the city. We calibrate the model to New York City, incorporating current zoning and rent control systems. Our model suggests large welfare gains from relaxing zoning regulations in Manhattan, and more modest gains from reducing the size of the rent control program. The former policy is progressive and a Pareto improvement, while rent control reform is regressive in nature and hurts the current beneficiaries.
R13|Income Growth and the Distributional Effects of Urban Spatial Sorting|We explore the impact of rising incomes at the top of the distribution on spatial sorting patterns within large U.S. cities. We develop and quantify a spatial model of a city with heterogeneous agents and nonhomothetic preferences for locations with different amenities of endogenous quality. As the rich get richer, their increased demand for luxury amenities available downtown drives housing prices up in downtown areas. The poor are made worse off, either being displaced or paying higher rents for amenities that they do not value as much. Endogenous provision of private amenities amplifies the mechanism, while public provision of other amenities in part curbs it. We quantify the corresponding impact on well-being inequality. Through the lens of the quantified model, the change in the income distribution between 1990 and 2014 led to neighborhood change and spatial resorting within urban areas that increased the welfare of richer households relative to that of poorer households by an additional 1.7 percentage points on top of their differential income growth.
R13|Cognitive Hubs and Spatial Redistribution|In the U.S., cognitive non-routine (CNR) occupations associated with higher wages are disproportionately represented in larger cities. To study the allocation of workers across cities, we propose and quantify a spatial equilibrium model with multiple industries that employ CNR and alternative (non-CNR) occupations. Productivity is city-industry-occupation specific and partly determined by externalities across local workers. We estimate that the productivity of CNR workers in a city depends significantly on both its share of CNR workers and total employment. Together with heterogeneous preferences for locations, these externalities imply equilibrium allocations that are not efficient. An optimal policy that benefits workers equally across occupations incentivizes the formation of cognitive hubs, leading to larger fractions of CNR workers in some of today's largest cities. At the same time, these cities become smaller to mitigate congestion effects while cities that are initially small increase in size. Large and small cities end up expanding industries in which they already concentrate, while medium-size cities tend to diversify across industries. The optimal allocation thus features transfers to non-CNR workers who move from large to small cities consistent with the implied change in the industrial composition landscape. Finally, we show that the optimal policy reinforces equilibrium trends observed since 1980. However, these trends were in part driven by low growth in real-estate productivity in CNR-abundant cities that reduced welfare.
R13|Evil deeds in urban economics|"The purpose of this note is to update an ancient controversy over the comparison between discrete and continuous agent models of land use and agent location in urban economics. Berliant (1985) shows that that the following statement is self-contradictory: ""There is a continuum of agents, each of whom owns or is endowed with a positive Lebesgue measure of land."" A corollary follows: ""As the number of agents tends to infinity, the set of agents who own a positive Lebesgue measure of land shrinks to zero."" The basic question is this: Under what circumstances, if any, can we reconcile the two models?"

R13|The Impact of Climate Change on Internal Migration in Brazil|Business-as-usual climate-change forecasts point to sharp temperature rises and agriculture yield losses in Brazil. We study the impact of these changes on internal migration and population distribution. We employ a spatial equilibrium model in which the climate shapes workers' locational choices through the usual amenity-value channel and the novel indirect channel via agriculture wages. Our simulations reveal that migration rates are 5.9% higher, and that half million more people migrate inter regionally under future climate conditions. Furthermore, climate change will likely exacerbate the country's regional inequalities, as the most developed regions gain population and welfare while the least developed regions lose.
R13|The Implications of Brexit for UK and EU Regional Competitiveness|Any form of Brexit will impact heterogeneously in terms of sectors and regions on the competitiveness of firms in both the UK and Europe. The ongoing uncertainty about the conditions under which the UK will be leaving the EU, creates difficulties in structurally estimating these impacts. Using uniquely-detailed interregional trade data on goods and services for the EU, we apply a novel methodology that disentangles region-sector sensitivities (elasticities) of firmsâ€™ competitiveness to (non)tariff barriers from the implications of different post-Brexit UK-EU trade scenarios. This enables us to derive the impact of Brexit on the competitiveness of firms along with the degree of uncertainty that surrounds these impacts, independently from the scenarios. Our analysis demonstrates that the adverse international competitiveness shocks on UK firms are much larger than those on the rest of the EU due to the dependency of the UK on the EU via global value chains. The competitiveness shocks mean that within the UK, Brexit is likely to increase both interregional inequalities and also intra-regional inequalities. In contrast interregional inequalities across Europe may actually fall, depending on the nature of the post-Brexit UK-EU trading arrangements.
R13|The rebound effect and its representation in energy and climate models|In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art and common practice of energy and climate modeling vis-à-vis the rebound literature, in particular regarding how macroeconomic energy and climate models quantify and include energy and greenhouse gas rebound effects. First, we focus on rebound effects in models of costless energy efficiency improvement that hold other attributes constant (zero-cost breakthrough), and an energy efficiency policy that may be bundled with other product changes that affect energy use (policy-induced efficiency improvement) (Gillingham et al. 2015). Second, we examine macroeconomic studies focusing on energy efficiency both in industry and in private households. Third, we go through a general theoretical revision from micro- to macroeconomic levels (the aggregation level) to include a review of the so-called meso-level studies (focused on the analysis of the production side). From 118 recent studies along the aggregation level, out of which 25 compute rebound calculations, we find that the average energy rebound effect is 58% with a standard deviation of 58%, and when we include green house gas rebound calculations, the magnitude is of the order of 43% with a standard deviation of 55%. Finally, we argue that the rebound effect is a phenomenon that requires a sound understanding of the complex interactions from different dimensions (e.g. aggregation level, heterogeneity, climate, energy conservation and economic growth), and we provide some ideas and motivations for future research.
R13|Fiscal Transfers in the Spatial Economy|Many countries operate pronounced fiscal equalization schemes that shift tax revenue across jurisdictions. We use a general equilibrium model with multiple asymmetric regions, costly trade and labor mobility to carve out the aggregate implications of this policy. Calibrating the model for Germany, we find that it indeed delivers smaller spatial economic disparities across regions. This comes at the cost of lower national output, however, because activity is diverted away from core cities and towards remote areas with low productivity. But despite this output loss, fiscal transfers may still raise national welfare, because they effectively countervail over-congestion in large cities.

R13|An application of dynamic factor models to nowcast regional economic activity in Spain|The goal of this paper is to propose a model to produce nowcasts of GDP growth of Spanish regions, by means of dynamic factor models. This framework is capable to incorporate in a parsimonious way the relevant information available at the time that each forecast is made. We employ a Bayesian perspective to provide robust estimation of all the ingredients involved in the model. Accordingly, we introduce the Bayesian Factor model for Regions (BayFaR), which allows for the inclusion of missing data and combines quarterly data on regional real output growth (taken from the database of the AIReF and from the individual regional statistics institutes, when available) and monthly information associated to indicators of regional real activity. We apply the BayFaR to nowcast the GDP growth of the four largest regions of Spain, and illustrate the real-time nowcasting performance of the proposed framework for each case. We also apply the model to nowcast Spanish GDP in order to be able to assess the relative growth of each region.
R13|Firms and Farms: The Local Effects of Farm Income on Firms’ Demand|How do changes in agricultural productivity affect firms? Using the predictions of a simple multi-sector general equilibrium model of the local economy and exploiting weather-induced agricultural volatility across India, I estimate the response of manufacturing firms to changes in agricultural productivity. I show that negative agricultural productivity shocks lower the cost of labor but that this does not cause firms to hire more. Firms’ production and employment in fact decrease because the shocks also reduce local income and hence the demand that firms face. My estimates provide evidence for a significant local demand effect. I then use my framework to show that this has key policy implications. I examine the introduction of a rural workfare program and assess how it affects firms. I show that the program attenuates the impact of negative agricultural shocks on firms because of its counter-cyclical effects on local wage and demand for manufacturing goods. The results highlight how policies that target households and increase their income can affect local market size and therefore the industrial sector through their general equilibrium effects.
R13|Economic impacts of the vale-cultura (culture voucher): a computable general equilibrium model|Restricted access to consumption of cultural goods and services is one of the major problems faced by this sector in Brazil. To address this issue, the federal government created the Vale-Cultura, a voucher in which individuals receive an income transfer to be used exclusively for purchasing cultural goods and services. The aim of this study is to analyze the impacts of the Vale-Cultura in the cultural sector and in the economy in general. The methodology applied is the Brazilian Recursive Dynamic General Equilibrium model (BRIDGE). Our simulations found that GDP growth is driven mainly by the increase in household consumption. There is a positive variation in welfare, assessed by the equivalent and compensating variations in income for beneficiaries of the vouchers. Finally, a positive growth is projected at the level of activity of cultural sectors and negative growth in others, showing a reallocation of productive factors.
R13|Rush hours and urbanization|We use a spatial general equilibrium model with potential commuting of workers between their place of work and their place of residence to analyze the effects of rush hours on the spatial allocation of employment and population, average labor productivity and the housing market. Abolishing traffic congestion during rush hours leads to a more urbanized economy as households move from the low-density countryside to the commuter belts of cities rather than from the city centers to the periphery. Employment, however, becomes more agglomerated in high-density large cities. This adjustment implies an increase of average labor productivity of 7.2 percent and higher inequality of housing costs.
R13|Urbanization, productivity differences and spatial frictions|We study decentralized and optimal urbanization in a simple multi-sector model of a rural-urban economy focusing on productivity differences and internal trade frictions. We show that even in the absence of the typical externalities studied in the literature, such as agglomeration, congestion or public goods, the decentralized city size can be either too large or too small relative to that chosen by a planner. In particular, optimal urbanization exceeds decentralized levels when productivity differences in location specific non-traded goods is small, a case typically arising in developed economies. In contrast, developing countries are likely to display overurbanization. A numerical exercise calibrated to Brazilian data suggests that the wedges can be quantitatively important. Urban biased policies - placing a higher weight on the welfare of city dwellers - are closer to optimal policies than decentralized allocations whenever productivity differences in non-traded sectors are either very small or very large. For intermediate productivity differences, the urban bias leads to larger cities even relative to decentralized policies.
R13|Competition, Land Price, and City Size|Larger cities typically give rise to two effects working in opposite directions: tougher competition among firms and higher production costs. Using an urban model with substitutability of production factors and pro-competitive effects, we study how market outcome responds to city population size, land-use regulation and commuting costs. For industries with small input of land, larger cities host more firms which set lower prices whereas larger cities accommodate more firms which charge higher prices in industries with intermediate land share in production. Furthermore, for industries with high input share of land, larger cities allocate fewer firms with higher product prices. We show that softer land-use regulation and/or lower commuting costs reinforce pro-competitive effects making larger cities more attractive for residents via lower product prices and broader variety for a larger number of industries.

This paper develops a spatial equilibrium model with a competitive final sector and a monopolistic competitive intermediate sector, which allows us to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for a science park to emerge as an equilibrium outcome. We show that strong localized knowledge spillovers, high startup costs, skilled labor abundance, or low commuting costs make intermediate firms more likely to cluster and a science park more likely to form. We also show that the productivity of the final sector is highest when intermediate firms cluster. As the decay penalty, firms' startup and workers' commuting costs become lower, science parks will eventually be fragmented.
R13|Optimal Transport Networks in Spatial Equilibrium|We study optimal transport networks in spatial equilibrium. We develop a framework consisting of a neoclassical trade model with labor mobility in which locations are arranged on a graph. Goods must be shipped through linked locations, and transport costs depend on congestion and on the infrastructure in each link, giving rise to an optimal transport problem in general equilibrium. The optimal transport network is the solution to a social planner’s problem of building infrastructure in each link. We provide conditions such that this problem is globally convex, guaranteeing its numerical tractability. We also study cases with increasing returns to transport technologies in which global convexity fails. We apply the framework to assess optimal investments and inefficiencies in observed road networks in European countries.
R13|Cognitive Hubs and Spatial Redistribution|In the U.S., cognitive non-routine (CNR) occupations associated with higher wages are disproportionately represented in larger cities. To study the allocation of workers across cities, we propose and quantify a spatial equilibrium model with multiple industries that employ CNR and alternative (non-CNR) occupations. Productivity is city-industry-occupation specific and partly determined by externalities across local workers. We estimate that the productivity of CNR workers in a city depends significantly on both its share of CNR workers and total employment. Together with heterogeneous preferences for locations, these externalities imply equilibrium allocations that are not efficient. An optimal policy that benefits workers equally across occupations incentivizes the formation of cognitive hubs, leading to larger fractions of CNR workers in some of today's largest cities. At the same time, these cities become smaller to mitigate congestion effects while cities that are initially small increase in size. Large and small cities end up expanding industries in which they already concentrate, while medium-size cities tend to diversify across industries. The optimal allocation thus features transfers to non-CNR workers who move from large to small cities consistent with the implied change in the industrial composition landscape. Finally, we show that the optimal policy reinforces equilibrium trends observed since 1980. However, these trends were in part driven by low growth in real-estate productivity in CNR-abundant cities that reduced welfare.
R13|The Environmental Cost of Land Use Restrictions|Cities with cleaner power plants and lower energy demand have stricter land use restrictions; these restrictions increase housing prices and disincentivize living in these lower polluting cities. We use a spatial equilibrium model to quantify the effect of land use restrictions on household carbon emissions. Our model features heterogeneous households, cities that vary by power plant technology and the benefits of energy usage, as well as endogenous wages and rents. Relaxing restrictions in California to the national median leads to a 2.3% drop in national carbon emissions. The burden of a carbon tax differs substantially across locations.
R13|How Should We Measure City Size? Theory and Evidence Within and Across Rich and Poor Countries|It is obvious that holding city population constant, differences in cities across the world are enormous. Urban giants in poor countries are not large using measures such as land area, interior space or value of output. These differences are easily reconciled mathematically as population is the product of land area, structure space per unit land (i.e., heights), and population per unit interior space (i.e., crowding). The first two are far larger in the cities of developed countries while the latter is larger for the cities of developing countries. In order to study sources of diversity among cities with similar population, we construct a version of the standard urban model (SUM) that yields the prediction that the elasticity of city size with respect to income could be similar within both developing countries and developed countries. However, differences in income and urban technology can explain the physical differences between the cities of developed countries and developing countries. Second, using a variety of newly merged data sets, the predictions of the SUM for similarities and differences of cities in developed and developing countries are tested. The findings suggest that population is a sufficient statistic to characterize city differences among cities within the same country, not across countries.
R13|O ciclo das commodities e crescimento regional desigual no Brasil: uma aplicação de equilíbrio geral computável (EGC)|The principles of uneven development are important for understanding the Brazilian regional reality, which has peculiar contours by dependence on commodity exports. Given the locational rigidity and the volatility of prices characteristic of this market, the spatial distribution of the impacts of these activities assumes importance in the persistence of regional inequalities. This work proceeds from the use of IMAGEM-B model (Integrated Multi-Regional Applied General Equilibrium Model - Brazil) configured to capture the impact that the increase in foreign demand for commodities had on Brazil's economic performance, allowing to identify the main channels capable of stimulating economic growth. Preliminary results indicate that the Brazilian economy showed significant responses to effect price of exports (investment, regional employment, income and consumption), the quantum effect in exports to other exporting regions (export and domestic import) and the aggregate result of GDP. The observed trends reflect not only different levels of industrialization and regional production structures, but also an economic concentration (sectoral and spatially selective) held a regional division of production, which has not allowed apparently reduce regional inequalities
R13|Shocking Germany – A spatial analysis of German regional labor markets|This paper quantifies the surprisingly large heterogeneity of real income and employment effects across German counties in response to local productivity shocks. Using a quantitative model with imperfect mobility and sector-specific labor market frictions together with an outstanding data set of county level goods shipments, I identify the sources of the heterogeneity in Germany’s complex interregional linkages. I find that population mobility reduces the magnitude of local employment rate responses by a striking 70 percent on average. In all but a few counties, changes in the sectoral composition of production have a much milder effect on employment elasticities. National employment rates are less dependent on mobility with worker in- and outflows in individual counties partially cancelling out effects. For productivity shocks affecting individual sectors across all regions the composition effect is substantially magnified, the mobility effect reduced. In line with recent real world observations I find that real income and employment effects, while correlated, do not need to be of the same sign. Finally, the spatial propagation of real income effects closely follows trade linkages whereas employment effects are more complex to predict.
R13|Impact Assessment of Scenarios of Interregional Transfers in Colombia|En este trabajo se evalúan los efectos económicos de diferentes escenarios de asignación regional empleados en el esquema actual de transferencias interregionales en Colombia, destacando los posibles compromisos entre la eficiencia y la equidad regional. Las simulaciones realizadas en el trabajo, utilizando un modelo de equilibrio general computable interregional, contribuyen al análisis del impacto del crecimiento relacionado con algunos de los objetivos generales que persiguen los gobiernos centrales al asignar transferencias subnacionales a los gobiernos locales. En este sentido, se simulan escenarios contra factuales en los que las políticas redistributivas están diseñadas para evaluar los posibles resultados del Producto Bruto Regional. Los resultados muestran que cuando la distribución se lleva a cabo sobre la base del tamaño de la población regional, hay ganancias potenciales en el crecimiento nacional junto con un aumento en las disparidades regionales. Sin embargo, cuando la distribución se lleva a cabo de acuerdo con otros criterios redistributivos, como el número de personas en condición de pobreza o las brechas horizontales de equidad fiscal, existen mejoras potenciales en la desigualdad regional, a pesar de estar acompañadas de efectos negativos del crecimiento. En este sentido, si se prioriza el criterio redistributivo para compensar la reducción del crecimiento, las regiones que enfrentan un aumento neto en las transferencias deben asignar los recursos adicionales para mejorar en términos de Productividad Total de los Factores (PTF), específicamente, priorizando en inversiones que mejoran la PTF en el largo plazo, tales como aquellas en capital humano enfocadas a la educación y la salud. **** ABSTRACT: We assess the economic effects of different scenarios of regional allocation of the current interregional transfers’ scheme in Colombia, highlighting potential tradeoffs between regional equity and efficiency. The simulations conducted in this work, using an interregional computable general equilibrium model, contribute to the analysis of the growth impact related to some of the broad objectives that central governments pursue when allocating subnational transfers to local governments. We simulate counterfactual scenarios in which redistributive policies are designed to assess potential Gross Regional Product (GRP) outcomes had they been applied to the Colombian economy. The results show that when the distribution is carried out based on regional population shares, there are potential gains in national growth together with an increase in regional disparities. However, when the distribution is carried out according to other redistributive criteria, such as the number of people impoverished or the horizontal equity gaps, there is a potential improvement in regional inequality despite negative growth effects. In this sense, if we prioritize the redistributive criterion in order to offset the reduction of growth, regions that face a net increase in transfers should allocate the additional resources to improve in terms of Total Factor Productivity (TFP), specifically, in long-term TFP-enhancing investments, such as human capital in the form of education and health outcomes.
R13|The economics of revoking NAFTA|In a world economy interconnected by global value chains (GVCs), domestic productivity depends on the availability of imported inputs and the vast majority of workers stands to lose from protectionism. To exemplify this, we provide a quantitative assessment of the aggregate and distributional effects of one hypothetical protectionist measure - the case of revoking the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Using a multi-country, multi-sector, quantitative model of global production, we show that a full revocation extending to both tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers would result in a real annual GDP loss of US$ 37 billion in Canada, US$ 22 billion in Mexico, and US$ 40 billion in the USA. In contrast, annual combined losses would amount to less than US$ 5 billion if only tariff rates were to be increased. For both counterfactuals, the distributional impacts across sectors would be an order of magnitude larger than the aggregate effects. Combining these results with information on the geographic distribution of sectoral employment, we show that almost all regions in North America would record reductions in their average real wage.
R13|Tourism, amenities, and welfare in an urban setting|Using data on Italian cities, we document that over the period of 2001–2011, the number of establishments and employment in some key service industries are positively related to the inflow of tourists. We then build a general equilibrium model of small open cities encompassing these empirical features to study the impact of tourism on endogenous consumption amenities, factors’ allocation across sectors, prices, and welfare. We also study the interplay of exogenous historical amenities, tourism, and residents welfare in a system of two cities. When residents are immobile, they are unambiguously better off when they live in a city with richer historical amenities, and thus more tourists, than the other city. When residents are mobile and their welfare is equalized between cities, the strength of consumption amenities becomes crucial to determine whether they are better off living in an urban system where cities are heterogeneous or similar in terms of historical amenities.
R13|The Welfare Costs of Tiebout Sorting with True Public Goods|We develop a model of Tiebout sorting based on decentralized income taxation, which allows for spillovers and imperfect rivalry in consumption of the publicly provided good. We identify three sources of welfare loss from decentralization: Imperfect redistribution, inter-jurisdictional free-riding, and inecient residential choice. Whereas the welfare loss from imperfect redistribution decreases and that from free-riding rises unambiguously as the publicly provided good becomes more pure, the welfare loss from the inecient residential choice depends non-monotonically on spillovers and rivalry. The equilibrium can be characterized by relative crowding of either the rich or the poor municipality. Our results imply that the characteristics of the publicly provided good are an important determinant for the welfare costs of decentralization.
R13|Distribution Effects of Local Minimum Wage Hikes: A Spatial Job Search Approach|This paper develops and estimates a spatial general equilibrium job search model to study the effects of local and universal (federal) minimum wage policies. In the model, firms post vacancies in multiple locations. Workers, who are heterogeneous in terms of location and education types, engage in random search and can migrate or commute in response to job offers. I estimate the model by combining multiple databases including the American Community Survey (ACS) and Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI). The estimated model is used to analyze how minimum wage policies affect employment, wages, job postings, vacancies, migration/ commuting, and welfare. Empirical results show that minimum wage increases in local county lead to an exit of low type (education
R13|Projeção dos impactos econômicos regionais do desastre de Mariana-MG|The large-scale economic damage and losses caused by disasters have attracted the attention of specialists who are studying ways of modeling that kind of impacts. In face of the deep losses and damages caused by the disaster in Mariana, on November 5th, 2015, this work aims to project the main regional economic impacts of the event. The main contribution is to provide methodology and results that will collaborate in the evaluation of the economic effects of the disaster. To do so, we have developed a dynamic model of Computable General Equilibrium, especially built for municipalities directly and indirectly affected by the disaster, in order to capture the regional economic impacts in the period from 2016 to 2020. The results indicate that, generally, the five-year post disaster were insufficient for the retake of production, family consumption, employment, investment and trade, even in the event of the resumption of the total Mariana production in 2018. In addition, the results suggest a great interdependence in the absorption of negative impacts by the regions along the Doce river

The model is based on a social accounting matrix (SAM) with 44 industries and 63 products. The first part of the document describes how the SAM was constructed. First, a SAM for Quebec as a whole was elaborated, using the 2011 Statistics Canada supply and use tables. Regional SAMs were built from that one by distributing values across regions following several key indicators, particularly the regional GDP estimates of the Institut de la statistique du Québec. The resulting discrepancy in each region between salaries received and paid is attributed to worker commuting; origin-destination flows were estimated using cross-entropy minimization from Statistics Canada’s 2011 Census commuting data. Discrepancies between regional absorption and production are attributed to interregional trade; bi-lateral flows are generated by simulation using a gravity model. Attraction factors – key parameters in the gravity model – are obtained by aggregating attraction factors constructed at the finer Municipalité Régionale de Comté (MRC) spatial scale, according to network distances, in minutes, between population-weighted centroids. The second part of the document persents the model itself, whose specification is more or less standard for dynamic multiregional CGE models. In particular, trade between regions follows the Armington imperfect substituability hypothesis: supply is apportioned according to constant-elasticity-of-transformation (CET) functions, and demand according to constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) functions. Regional labor markets are characterized by the presence of unemployment, the rate of which depends on the level of wages, following a wage curve. Interregional worker commuting flows are logistic functions of regional wage rates. The document includes several appendices, one of which describes the reference scenario and the closure rules that are applied by default in the model. Ce document présente le modèle multirégional du Québec MegBec, un modèle d’équilibre général calculable (MEGC) dynamique séquentiel où l’on distingue 16 régions dites « régions analytiques ». Il s’appuie sur une matrice de comptabilité sociale (MCS) avec 44 industries et 63 produits. La première partie du document décrit le processus d’élaboration de la MCS. D’abord on a élaboré une MCS du Québec dans son ensemble, à partir des tableaux de ressources-emplois de 2011 de Statistique Canada. À partir de cette MCS, les matrices régionales ont été construites en répartissant les valeurs entre régions selon plusieurs clés, en particulier les estimations du PIB des régions de l’Institut de la statistique du Québec. L’écart qui en résulte dans chaque région entre salaires reçus et salaires payés est attribué au navettage des travailleurs; les flux origine-destination ont été estimés par la méthode de minimisation de l’entropie croisée à partir de données de navettage du recensement de 2011 de Statistique Canada. Les écarts entre l’absorption et la production régionales par produit sont attribués aux échanges interrégionaux, qui sont générés par simulation au moyen d’un modèle gravitaire. Les facteurs d’attractivité, paramètres critiques du modèle gravitaire, sont obtenus par agrégation de facteurs d’attractivité construits à l’échelle plus fine des MRC, selon les distances réticulaires en minutes entre centroïdes pondérés par la population. La deuxième partie du document présente le modèle lui-même, dont la spécification est grosso modo conforme à la structure classique des MEGC multirégionaux dynamiques. En particulier, le commerce entre les régions suit l’hypothèse de substituabilité imparfaite d’Armington : l’offre se distribue suivant des fonctions de distribution de l’offre à élasticité de transformation constante (CET) et la demande suivant des fonctions de répartition de la demande à élasticité de substitution constante (CES). Les marchés régionaux du travail sont caractérisés par la présence de chômage, dont le taux dépend du niveau des salaires, selon une courbe salaire-chômage (wage curve). Le navettage interrégional des travailleurs suit un modèle de fonction logistique des salaires régionaux. Le document compte plusieurs annexes, dont l’une décrit le scénario de référence et expose les règles de fermeture appliquées par défaut dans le modèle.
R13|The Impact of Microcredit on Farms and Rural Household: A Literature Review of Experimental Studies|In this article, we review the literature on the best ways to identify the causal effects of microcredit, present, and discuss some empirical results of the impact of microcredit on the adoption of innovations, investments, farm incomes, and profits. The results of empirical studies converge toward a positive impact of access to microcredit on the adoption of agricultural technology and investment. In terms of the effect on the technical efficiency of farms, agricultural income and profit, and consumption, the results do not all point in the same direction. The effects of microcredit are likely to vary depending on the context of the study.
R13|Impact Assessment of Scenarios of Interregional Transfers in Colombia|En este trabajo se evalúan los efectos económicos de diferentes escenarios de asignación regional empleados en el esquema actual de transferencias interregionales en Colombia, destacando los posibles compromisos entre la eficiencia y la equidad regional. Las simulaciones realizadas en el trabajo, utilizando un modelo de equilibrio general computable interregional, contribuyen al análisis del impacto del crecimiento relacionado con algunos de los objetivos generales que persiguen los gobiernos centrales al asignar transferencias subnacionales a los gobiernos locales. En este sentido, se simulan escenarios contra factuales en los que las políticas redistributivas están diseñadas para evaluar los posibles resultados del Producto Bruto Regional. Los resultados muestran que cuando la distribución se lleva a cabo sobre la base del tamaño de la población regional, hay ganancias potenciales en el crecimiento nacional junto con un aumento en las disparidades regionales. Sin embargo, cuando la distribución se lleva a cabo de acuerdo con otros criterios redistributivos, como el número de personas en condición de pobreza o las brechas horizontales de equidad fiscal, existen mejoras potenciales en la desigualdad regional, a pesar de estar acompañadas de efectos negativos del crecimiento. En este sentido, si se prioriza el criterio redistributivo para compensar la reducción del crecimiento, las regiones que enfrentan un aumento neto en las transferencias deben asignar los recursos adicionales para mejorar en términos de Productividad Total de los Factores (PTF), específicamente, priorizando en inversiones que mejoran la PTF en el largo plazo, tales como aquellas en capital humano enfocadas a la educación y la salud. **** ABSTRACT: We assess the economic effects of different scenarios of regional allocation of the current interregional transfers’ scheme in Colombia, highlighting potential tradeoffs between regional equity and efficiency. The simulations conducted in this work, using an interregional computable general equilibrium model, contribute to the analysis of the growth impact related to some of the broad objectives that central governments pursue when allocating subnational transfers to local governments. We simulate counterfactual scenarios in which redistributive policies are designed to assess potential Gross Regional Product (GRP) outcomes had they been applied to the Colombian economy. The results show that when the distribution is carried out based on regional population shares, there are potential gains in national growth together with an increase in regional disparities. However, when the distribution is carried out according to other redistributive criteria, such as the number of people impoverished or the horizontal equity gaps, there is a potential improvement in regional inequality despite negative growth effects. In this sense, if we prioritize the redistributive criterion in order to offset the reduction of growth, regions that face a net increase in transfers should allocate the additional resources to improve in terms of Total Factor Productivity (TFP), specifically, in long-term TFP-enhancing investments, such as human capital in the form of education and health outcomes.
R13|Creating a labor-market module for USAGE-TERM: illustrative application, theory and data|"This paper documents a project carried out under contract with the U.S. Department of Commerce. As stated in the contract, the aim was to: ""provide the means to conduct analyses of the impacts of trade on employment by industry and occupation in regional labor markets via the creation of a labor market module add-on to the dynamic version of USAGE-TERM. The resultant labor-market enhanced dynamic USAGE-TERM model will give users the capability to identify structural adjustment problems arising from difficulties that workers displaced by trade may have in transferring their skills to alternative employment possibilities in other industries and/or regions."" In the paper we provide technical documentation on how the labor-market module was created and illustrate its application by simulating the effects on regional labor markets of a hypothetical reduction in U.S. exports of Machinery and equipment."
R13|SinoTERM365, Bottom-up Representation of China at the Prefectural Level|The TERM methodology requires relatively modest data requirements to create a multi-regional, sub-national CGE database. SinoTERM365 is an extreme form of stretching available data, with the master database representing 162 sectors in 365 prefectural regions of the Chinese economy. A collaborative effort is envisaged among users to enable ongoing improvements to the database. The TERM approach facilitates rapid amendments to the database when improved data are available. The alternative, to wait until better data emerge before building a model, may result in less detail and a less versatile framework for analysis. In our example, we consider a downturn in use of coal and coal-generated electricity in China.
R13|Equilibrium selection and stability in dynamic core-periphery models with heterogeneous preferences|In New Economic Geography, recent models have shown that idiosyncratic preferences of workers for locations act as a dispersion force affecting the number and stability of equilibrium population distributions. Yet those models are based on ad hoc deterministic adjustment procedures that have two shortcomings. Firstly, they remove the aggregate effect of idiosyncratic preferences on the collective spatial dynamics of workers, whose study would require the use of specific notions of equilibrium stability. Secondly, these adjustment dynamics lack an explicit time unit that prevents adjustment trajectories to be expressed as dynamic scenarios. Those two shortcomings strive against the use of New Economic Geography models to support policy recommendations. Starting from a classic core-periphery model of New Economic Geography, this paper proposes a novel approach to adjustment dynamics, based on stochastic migration models, by which the dynamics of the population distribution is a continuous-time Markov chain. Using a diffusion approximation, the dynamic system is reduced to a set of Itô stochastic differential equations, which is an original contribution to New Economic Geography. In those equations, deterministic and stochastic effects are still distinct at the aggregate scale, which enables to numerically compute equilibrium population distributions as well as to evaluate their stability and selection under stochastic perturbations generated by idiosyncratic preferences. Those equations also enable to complete expected adjustment trajectories with an explicit time unit and with confidence intervals, for different scenarios. Hence this paper is a substantial improvement of the capacity of New Economic Geography models to support policy recommendations.
R13|E-Commerce Integration and Economic Development: Evidence from China|The number of people buying and selling products online in China has grown from practically zero in 2000 to more than 400 million by 2015. Most of this growth has occurred in cities. In this context, the Chinese government recently announced the expansion of e-commerce to the countryside as a policy priority with the objective to close the rural-urban economic divide. As part of this agenda, the government entered a partnership with a large Chinese e-commerce firm. The program invests in the necessary logistics to ship products to and sell products from tens of thousands of villages that were largely unconnected to e-commerce trading. The firm also installs an e-commerce terminal at a central village location, where a terminal manager assists households in buying and selling products through the firm's e-commerce platform. This paper combines a new collection of survey and administrative microdata with a randomized control trial (RCT) that we implement across villages in collaboration with the e-commerce firm. We use this empirical setting to provide evidence on the potential of e-commerce integration to foster economic development in the countryside, the underlying channels and the distribution of the gains from e-commerce across households and villages.
R13|Place-Based Policies for Development|Many development policies, such as placement of infrastructure or local economic development schemes, are “place-based.” Such policies are generally intended to stimulate private sector investment and economic growth in the treated place, and as such they are difficult to appraise and evaluate. This paper sets out a framework for analyzing the effects of such policies and assessing their social value. It then reviews the literature on place-based policies in the contexts of transport improvements, economic corridors, special economic zones, lagging regions, and urban policies.
R13|The Economics and Politics of Revoking NAFTA|We provide a quantitative assessment of both the aggregate and the distributional effects of revoking NAFTA using a multi-country, multi-sector, multi-factor model of world production and trade with global input-output linkages. Revoking NAFTA would reduce US welfare by about 0.2%, and Canadian and Mexican welfare by about 2%. The distributional impacts of revoking NAFTA across workers in different sectors are an order of magnitude larger in all three countries, ranging from -2.7 to 2.26% in the United States. We combine the quantitative results with information on the geographic distribution of sectoral employment, and compute average real wage changes in each US congressional district, Mexican state, and Canadian province. We then examine the political correlates of the economic effects. Congressional district-level real wage changes are negatively correlated with the Trump vote share in 2016: districts that voted more for Trump would on average experience greater real wage reductions if NAFTA is revoked.
R13|Does the law of one price hold for hedonic prices?|Hedonic prices of locational attributes in urban land markets are determined by a process of spatial arbitrage that is similar to that which underpins the law of one price. If hedonic prices deviate from their spatial equilibrium values then individuals can benefit from changing locations. I examine whether the law holds for the hedonic price of rail access using a unique historical dataset for Berlin over the period 1890-1914, characterised by massive investment in the transport infrastructure. I estimate the hedonic price of rail access across multiple urban neighbourhoods and time periods to generate a panel dataset of hedonic price differences that I test for stationarity using a panel unit root test. Across multiple specifications I consistently fail to reject the null hypothesis of no unit root and accept the alternative hypothesis that the law holds. My estimates indicate a half-life for convergence to the law of one price that lies between 0.28 and 1.14 years. This result is consistent with spatial equilibrium.
R13|Empty homes, longer commutes: The unintended consequences of more restrictive local planning|We investigate the impact of land use regulation on housing vacancy rates. Using a 30-year panel dataset on land use regulation for 350 English Local Authorities (LAs) and addressing potential reverse causation and other endogeneity concerns, we find that tighter local planning constraints increase local housing vacancy rates: a one standard deviation increase in restrictiveness causes the local vacancy rate to increase by 0.9 percentage points (23%). The same increase in local restrictiveness also causes a 6.1% rise in commuting distances. The results underline the interdependence of local housing and Labour markets and the unintended adverse impact of more restrictive planning policies.
R13|New Estimates of the Elasticity of Marginal Utility for the UK|Abstract This paper provides novel empirical evidence on the value of the elasticity of marginal utility, $$ \eta $$ η , for the United Kingdom. $$ \eta $$ η is a crucial component of the social discount rate (SDR), which determines the inter-temporal trade-offs that are acceptable to society. Using contemporaneous and historical data, new estimates are obtained using four revealed-preference techniques: the equal-sacrifice income tax approach, the Euler-equation approach, the Frisch additive-preferences approach and risk aversion in insurance markets. A meta-analysis indicates parameter homogeneity across approaches, and a central estimate of 1.5 for $$ \eta $$ η . The confidence interval excludes unity, the value used in official guidance by the UK government. The term structure of the SDR is then estimated. The result is a short-run SDR of 4.5% declining to 4.2% in the very long-run. This is higher and flatter than the UK official guidance. The difference stems from incorrect calibration of social welfare and estimation of the diffusion of growth. Other things equal, the results suggest that current UK guidance might need to be updated.
R13|Broken Market or Broken Policy? The Unintended Consequences of Restrictive Planning|This paper summarises the evidence from recent research relating to the British Planning system's impact on the supply of development. Planning serves important economic and social purposes but it is essential to distinguish between restricting development relative to demand in particular places to provide public goods and mitigate market failure in other ways, including ensuring the future ability of cities to expand and maintain a supply of public goods and infrastructure; and an absolute restriction on supply, raising prices of housing and other urban development generally. Evidence is presented that there are at least four separate mechanisms, inbuilt into the British system, which result in a systematic undersupply of land and space for both residential and commercial purposes and that these have had important effects on both our housing market and the wider economy and on welfare more widely defined.
R13|Location as an Asset|The location of individuals determines their job opportunities, living amenities, and housing costs. We argue that it is useful to conceptualize the location choice of individuals as a decision to invest in a ‘location asset.’ This asset has a cost equal to the location's rent, and a payoff through better job opportunities and, potentially, more human capital for the individual and her children. As with any asset, savers in the location asset transfer resources into the future by going to expensive locations with good future opportunities. In contrast, borrowers transfer resources to the present by going to cheap locations that offer few other advantages. As in a standard portfolio problem, holdings of this asset depend on the comparison of its rate of return with that of other assets. Differently from other assets, the location asset is not subject to borrowing constraints, so it is used by individuals with little or no wealth that want to borrow. We provide an analytical model to make this idea precise and to derive a number of related implications, including an agent's mobility choices after experiencing negative income shocks. The model can rationalize why low wealth individuals locate in low income regions with low opportunities even in the absence of mobility costs. We document the investment dimension of location, and confirm the core predictions of our theory with French individual panel data from tax returns.
R13|Commuting, Labor, and Housing Market Effects of Mass Transportation: Welfare and Identification|REVISED MARCH 2019 This paper studies the effects of Los Angeles Metro Rail on the spatial distribution of people and prices. Using a panel of bilateral commuting flows, I estimate a quantitative spatial general equilibrium model to quantify the welfare benefits of urban rail transit and distinguish the benefits of reduced commuting frictions from other channels. The subway causes a 7%-13% increase in commuting between pairs of connected tracts; I select plausible control pairs using proposed subway and historical streetcar lines to identify this effect. The structural parameters of the model are also estimated and are identified using a novel strategy that interacts tract-specific labor demand shocks with the spatial configuration of the city. These parameters indicate people are relatively unresponsive to changes in local prices and characteristics, implying that the commuting response corresponds to a large utility gain. The welfare benefits by 2000 are significant: LA Metro Rail increases aggregate welfare by $246 million annually. However, these benefits are only about one-third of annualized costs. While benefits did not outweigh costs by 2000, I employ more recent data to show that there are dynamic effects: Commuting continues to increase between connected locations.
R13|On Quantitative Spatial Economic Models|Quantitative spatial economics (QSE) specifies various components such as preferences, production technology, and frictions for the movement of goods, people, and ideas. Despite the long literature on endogenous location decisions, the question of how these specifications affect resulting spatial equilibria has not been systematically explored. In this paper we start with workhorse models of QSE based on different specifications of preferences and show that spatial equilibria in those models can be generated using the conditional logit model by McFadden (1974). Our result suggests that existing models of QSE have a common origin in one of the oldest location choice models.
R13|Cohesion Policy 2007-2015: The RHOMOLO assessment|The European Cohesion Policy 2007-2015 was implemented in challenging times due to the economic and financial crisis and widespread cuts to public investment. Cohesion Policy has been used to reach objectives related to employment, R&D, energy sustainability, education, and poverty and social exclusion. Policy simulations using the RHOMOLO dynamic CGE model show positive macro-economic effects of the policy at the EU level, with significant differences between less developed regions, transition regions, and more developed ones. Cohesion Policy funds mainly targeted the less developed regions which received 60% of the total investments, while transition regions and more developed ones received 24% and 16% of the total, respectively. RHOMOLO simulations estimate the long-run GDP impact of Cohesion Policy to be equal to +0.7% at the EU level, with peaks in some less developed regions above +5%. The cumulative multipliers associated with the Cohesion Policy funds are above one in most EU regions by 2030.
R13|R&I and Low-carbon investment in Apulia, Italy: The RHOMOLO assessment|The European Cohesion Policy supports eleven thematic objectives. Four of these are key priorities for the European Regional Development Fund: Research and Innovation (R&I), Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), SME competitiveness, and Low-carbon economy. The European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) is supporting Apulia, Italy, with the design and implementation of Regional Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3). Quantitative tools such as the RHOMOLO model could help evaluate the impact of funding programmes in different policy areas across European regions. R&I and Low-Carbon ERDF Investments aim at generating sustainable growth and supporting the capacity of regional economies to innovate in line with the Energy Union strategy and the EU's transition to a low-carbon economy. Policy simulations using the RHOMOLO dynamic CGE model show positive macro-economic effects of the ERDF investments related to the R&I and Low-carbon thematic objectives in Apulia both within the region and in its neighbouring regions.
R13|The impact of Cohesion Policy 2007-2015 in EU regions: Simulations with the RHOMOLO Interregional Dynamic General Equilibrium Model|In this paper we assess the system-wide economic impact of the key financial instruments adopted by the European Union for the implementation of the regional policy: The Structural funds and The Cohesion Funds. We take a bottom-up approach by aggregating the 86 categories of expenditures defined in the Structural and Cohesion Funds into six main policy variables. The outcomes of the simulations are the results of a combination of demand-and-supply-side shocks that are implemented into the RHOMOLO spatial and dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated on a set of inter-regional Social Accounting Matrices for the year 2010. In our analysis we document the direct, indirect, and general equilibrium effects of the EU regional policy at the regional, national, and EU level. In the short-run, our simulation exercise suggests a pronounced variegate patters across EU regions. In the long-run, a more homogenous spatial distribution is detected. Moreover, we identify and quantify the interregional spillover effects arising from trade links and capital mobility.
R13|Economic impacts of economic corridors in Mongolia : an application of IDE-GSM|In this paper, we tried to estimate the economic impacts of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Economic Corridor 4a, 4b, and 4c projects, which enhance the connectivity between Mongolia and its surrounding countries, using a computational general equilibrium model based on spatial economics. The estimation results show that the economic impacts for Corridor 4b, which connects China and Russia through Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, are the highest compared with the other two corridors. Apart from Mongolia, Corridor 4b also economically impacts China, EU, and Russia; thus, cooperation among these four parties might be a suitable arrangement for development. The evaluation of large-scale economic development of corridors is not very easy without proper evaluation tools.
R13|Analysis of economic potentials of infrastructure developments in and around Bhutan|This paper conducts a simulation analysis of a spatial economic model in Southern Asia, with a particular focus on Bhutan. It indicates the potential impacts of different infrastructure investments on regional economies in Bhutan and the neighboring countries. The results reveal that road infrastructure investments within Bhutan will likely increase regional accessibility, reshape the monocentric structure of the economy, and induce migration, thereby increasing the real wage for most of Bhutan’s regions. Furthermore, road infrastructure investments within India have some spillover effects on Bhutan, which can be magnified by further reduction in non-tariff barriers. The comparison of the different scenarios indicates that the combination of projects may generate synergy effects.
R13|Impacto económico del empredimiento en una economía regional: el caso de Andalucía| Although traditionally entrepreneurship has been considered as one of the engines of economic activity, it has not been until recent years that public authorities have made a planned and organized effort to support the entrepreneurial initiative. However, even though many millions of euros are invested annually in this support, the effectiveness of such investment is rarely measured in terms of the impact of entrepreneurial activity on the economy. For this reason, in this paper we analyze the effect of this activity (entrepreneurship) on a regional economy and its impact on it. To do so, we develop a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model for the Andalusian economy for 2015, within a top-down approach. The model is based in the Andalusian Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) updated for the year 2015. A SAM is a statistical-accounting instrument that collects all the information of an economic system and, in addition, closes the circular flow of incomes, considering direct, indirect and induced effects. This gives an overview of the implications of the economic flows on the different sectors of activity and at the same time details and completes them. The SAM for Andalusia 2015 has a disaggregation level of 35 economic activities (27 productive sectors plus 8 endogenous accounts that include items such as capital, consumption, labor, investment, taxes, public sector and sector Exterior). In order to obtain the impact vector for the entrepreneurial activity, necessary to make the estimates for each one of the activity sector, the statistical official information available about business creation in Andalusia has been used. The results will show the effects on Gross domestic product, Productive Output and employment creation and its distribution by sectors of Activity.
R13|On Barriers to Technology Adoption, Appropriate Technology and Deep Integration (with implications for the European Union)|Based on two strands of research, namely ‘barriers to technology adoption’ and ‘appropriate technology’, we propose a formal reappraisal of ‘deep integration’, a broad concept often used in trade policy discussions. We then evaluate the 2004-7 EU enlargement wave utilizing this operational reappraisal. More speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst estimate, using 2007 data, total labor productivity (TLP) in the 27 EU member states, and show that in all but a few sectors, new member states clearly stand below the lower envelope technology frontier of the older members in their use of skilled and unskilled labor. We interpret this as being the result of past barriers to technology adoption that are likely to be removed by the integration process into the EU, with these new counties’ TLP shifting to the incumbent members’ lower envelope. We then explore the potential eﬀects on all 27 EU member states of this ‘deep integration’ experiment using a calibrated intertemporal multisectoral general equilibrium model. Our main ﬁnding is that, for most parameter conﬁgurations, workers’ welfare in incumbent member countries is not negatively impacted despite the rather drastic improvement in competitiveness experienced by new members.
R13|Connecting the Countryside via E-Commerce: Evidence from China|This paper estimates the impact of the first nation-wide e-commerce expansion program on rural households. To do so, we combine a randomized control trial with new survey and administrative microdata. In contrast to existing case studies, we find little evidence for income gains to rural producers and workers. Instead, the gains are driven by a reduction in cost of living for a minority of rural households who tend to be younger, richer and in more remote markets. These effects are mainly due to overcoming logistical barriers to e-commerce, rather than to additional investments to adapt e-commerce to the rural population.
R13|Place-Based Policies for Development|"Many development policies, such as placement of infrastructure or local economic development schemes, are ""place-based.""

R13|Optimal Spatial Policies, Geography and Sorting|We study optimal spatial policies in quantitative trade and geography frameworks with spillovers and sorting of heterogeneous workers. We rst characterize ecient spatial transfers and the labor subsidies that would implement them. Then, we quantify the aggregate and distributional eects of implementing these policies in the U.S. economy. Under homogeneous workers and constant-elasticity spillovers, a constant labor subsidy over space restores efficiency regardless of micro heterogeneity in fundamentals and trade costs. In that case, the quantification suggests that the observed spatial transfers in the U.S. are close to ecient. Spillovers across heterogeneous workers create an additional rationale for place-specific subsidies to attain optimal sorting. Under heterogeneous workers, the quantication suggests that optimal spatial policies may require stronger redistribution towards low-wage cities than in the data, reduce wage inequality in larger cities, weaken spatial sorting by skill, and lead to signicant welfare gains. Spillovers across dierent types of workers are a key driving force behind these results.

R13|Happiness at Different Ages: The Social Context Matters|This paper uses a variety of individual-level survey data from several countries to test for interactions between subjective well-being at different ages and variables measuring the nature and quality of the social context at work, at home, and in the community. While earlier studies have found important age patterns (often U-shaped) and social context effects, these two sets of variables have generally been treated as mutually independent. We test for and find several large and highly significant interactions. Results are presented for life evaluations and (in some surveys) for happiness yesterday, in models with and without other control variables. The U-shape in age is found to be significantly flatter, and well-being in the middle of the age range higher, for those who are in workplaces with partner-like superiors, for those living as couples, and for those who have lived for longer in their communities. A strong sense of community belonging is associated with greater life satisfaction at all ages, but especially so at ages 60 and above, in some samples deepening the U-shape in age by increasing the size of the life satisfaction gains following the mid-life low.
R13|The economics and politics of revoking NAFTA|Abstract We provide a quantitative assessment of both the aggregate and the distributional effects of revoking NAFTA, using a multi-country, multi-sector, multi-factor model of world production and trade with global input-output linkages. Revoking NAFTA would reduce US welfare by about 0.2%, and Canadian and Mexican welfare by about 2%. The distributional impacts of revoking NAFTA across workers in different sectors are an order of magnitude larger in all three countries, ranging from -2.7 to 2.26% in the United States. We combine the quantitative results with information on the geographic distribution of sectoral employment, and compute average real wage changes in each US congressional district, Mexican state, and Canadian province. We then examine the political correlates of the economic effects. Congressional district-level real wage changes are negatively correlated with the Trump vote share in 2016: districts that voted more for Trump would on average experience greater real wage reductions if NAFTA is revoked.
R13|On Barriers to Technology Adoption, Appropriate Technology and Deep Integration (with implications for the European Union)|Based on two strands of research, namely 'barriers to technology adoption' and 'appropriate technology', we propose a formal reappraisal of 'deep integration', a broad concept often used in trade policy discussions. We then evaluate the 2004-7 EU enlargement wave utilizing this operational reappraisal. More specifically, we first estimate, using 2007 data, total labor productivity (TLP) in the 27 EU member states, and show that in all but a few sectors, new member states clearly stand below the lower envelope technology frontier of the older members in their use of skilled and unskilled labor. We interpret this as being the result of past barriers to technology adoption that are likely to be removed by the integration process into the EU, with these new counties' TLP shifting to the incumbent members' lower envelope. We then explore the potential effects on all 27 EU member states of this 'deep integration' experiment using a calibrated intertemporal multisectoral general equilibrium model. Our main finding is that, for most parameter configurations, workers' welfare in incumbent member countries is not negatively impacted despite the rather drastic improvement in competitiveness experienced by new members.
R13|Optimal Spatial Policies, Geography and Sorting|We study optimal spatial policies in a quantitative trade and geography framework with spillovers and spatial sorting of heterogeneous workers. We characterize the spatial transfers that must hold in efficient allocations, as well as labor subsidies that can implement them. There exists scope for welfare-enhancing spatial policies even when spillovers are common across locations. Using data on U.S. cities and existing estimates of the spillover elasticities, we find that the U.S. economy would benefit from a reallocation of workers to currently low-wage cities and from a greater mixing of high and low skill workers in these locations. Inefficient sorting may lead to substantial welfare costs.
R13|Barriers to Entry and Regional Economic Growth in China|The non-state manufacturing sector has been the engine of China's economic transformation. Up through the mid-1990s, the sector exhibited large regional differences; between 1995 and 2004 we observe rapid convergence in terms of productivity, wages, and new firm start-up rates. To analyze the drivers of this behavior, we construct a Hopenhayn (1992) model that incorporates location-specific capital wedges, output wedges, and a novel entry barrier. Using Chinese Industry Census data we estimate these wedges and examine their role in explaining differences in performance across prefectures and over time. Entry barriers turn out to be the salient factor explaining performance differences. We investigate the empirical covariates of these entry barriers and find that barriers are causally related to the size of the state sector. Thus, the downsizing of the state sector after 1997 may be important in explaining the regional convergence and manufacturing growth after 1995.
R13|The Rebound Effect and its representation in Climate and Energy models|In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art and common practice of energy and climate modeling vis-a-vis the rebound literature, in particular regarding how macroeconomic energy and climate models quantify and include energy and greenhouse gas rebound effects. First, we focus on rebound effects in models of costless energy efficiency improvement that hold other attributes constant (zero-cost breakthrough), and an energy efficiency policy that may be bundled with other product changes that affect energy use (policy-induced efficiency improvement) (Gillingham et al. 2015). Second, we examine macroeconomic studies focusing on energy efficiency both in industry and in private households. Third, we go through a general theoretical revision from micro- to macroeconomic levels (the aggregation level) to include a review of the so-called meso-level studies (focused on the analysis of the production side). From 118 recent studies along the aggregation level, out of which 25 compute rebound calculations, we find that the average energy rebound effect is 58% with a standard deviation of 58%, and when we include green house gas rebound calculations, the magnitude is of the order of 43% with a standard deviation of 55%. Finally, we argue that the rebound effect is a phenomenon that requires a sound understanding of the complex interactions from different dimensions (e.g. aggregation level, heterogeneity, climate, energy conservation and economic growth), and we provide some ideas and motivations for future research.
R13|On the Numerical Structure of Local and Nationwide Government Spending Multipliers: What Can We Learn from the Greek Crisis?|We develop a multiregional general equilibrium model for Greece to simulate the short run impacts of temporary deficit-financed rises in government spending. It has been recognized that the fiscal multiplier is a function of structural features of the economy and policy reaction parameters. Moreover, the debate on the magnitude of the multiplier along the business cycle has also been the subject of disputed debates. On these grounds, we look at the Greek case by calibrating the model using data for distinct states of the Greek economy during the development of the recent crisis. Whether this matters for local and nationwide multipliers depends on qualitative differences of the numerical structures of the model. Our results imply that structural coefficients have a strong effect on government spending impact multipliers. In the case of Greece, lack of information on the changing magnitudes of behavioral parameters over time adds another layer of uncertainty to this debate.
R13|Mobility in Cities: Distributional Impact Analysis of Transportation Improvement in SÃ£o Paulo Metropolitan Region|This paper evaluates the impacts of transportation investments/policies using a spatial computable general equilibrium (SCGE) model integrated to a travel demand model. In order to enhance our understanding of the distributional impacts of transportation improvements in Brazilian cities, we simulate the impact of different types of mobility investments in the SÃ£o Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR). To explore further the income effects of infrastructure investments, we also conduct microsimulation exercises integrated to the SCGE results. We look at 10 different scenarios, ranging from a series of infrastructure-related interventions â€“ considering the expansion of the mass-transit public transportation network â€“ to policies that focus on monetary disincentives to the use of cars. The simulations results suggest trade-offs between efficiency and equity.
R13|EUREGIO: The construction of a global IO DATABASE with regional detail for Europe for 2000-2010|This paper introduces the EUREGIO database: the first time-series (annual, 2000-2010) of global IO tables with regional detail for the entire large trading bloc of the European Union. The construction of this database, which allows for regional analysis at the level of so-called NUTS2 regions, is presented in detail for its methodology and applications. The tables merge data from WIOD (the 2013 release) with, regional economic accounts, and interregional trade estimates developed by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, complemented with survey-based regional input-output data for a limited number of countries. All used data are survey data and only non-behavioral assumptions have been made to estimate the EUREGIO dataset. These two general rules of data construction allow empirical analyses focused on impacts of changes in behavior (of economies, firms, policies) without endogenously having this behavior embedded already by construction. The tables are publicly available to the research community, from the Dutch government open data website. In this project, both a regional trade database, and production and consumption data of different actors in different regions, were used. The focus is thus intentionally on the regionalization of both trade and the regional use and supply of products by different economic actors. The paper is organized around the successive steps of the data construction: (1) adjustment of WIOD, (2) regional information, (3) Construction of tables, (4) conclusions on the usefulness of this type of regional IO tables with an overview of current applications of the EUREGIO database.
R13|Barriers to Entry and Regional Economic Growth in China|The non-state manufacturing sector has been the engine of China's economic transformation. Up through the mid-1990s, the sector exhibited large regional differences; subsequently we observe rapid convergence in terms of new firm start-up rates, productivity, and wages. To analyze the drivers of this behavior, we construct a Melitz (2003) model that incorporates location-specific capital wedges, output wedges, and a novel entry barrier. Using Chinese Industry Census data for 1995, 2004, and 2008, we estimate these wedges and examine their role in explaining differences in performance across prefectures and over time. Entry barriers turn out to be the salient friction for explaining performance differences. We investigate the empirical covariates of these entry barriers and find that barriers are causally related to the size of the state sector. Thus, the downsizing of the state sector after 1997 may be important in explaining the rapid manufacturing growth over the 1995-2008 period.
R13|Multidimensional and fuzzy poverty at regional level in Iran|In the present paper we propose a multidimensional and fuzzy set approach for measuring poverty at province level in Iran. We go beyond the conventional study of poverty based simply on the poor/non-poor dichotomy defined in relation to some poverty line chosen on the basis of income or total expenditure only. On the contrary, multidimensional poverty is treated as matters of degree determined in terms of the relative position of individuals in Iran, i.e. in the distribution of some aspects of their living conditions. The state of deprivation is thus seen in the form of ‘fuzzy sets’ to which all members of the population belong but to varying degrees. The methodology is the applied to HBS survey in Iran, collected from March 2016 to March 2017 (1395 Solar Hijri year in Iran).
R13|Core-Periphery vs Home Market Effect: Trade in the Traditional Sector and the Demand Advantage|We study the role of (i) initial differences in shares of immobile workers between countries which stand for the agglomeration forces, and (ii) positive trade costs in the traditional sector which are related to the dispersion forces, in shaping the spatial pattern of the developed and transition countries. We show that on the trade liberalization path in skill-intensive industries, keeping high trade barriers in less skill-intensive sectors is enough to protect a transition country from de-industrialization. If trade liberalization in a skill-intensive sector is accompanied by decreasing trade barriers in the traditional sector, the developed country has a higher probability to become a Core. When partial agglomeration is stable, it is characterized by the Home Market Eect (HME).
R13|Commuting, Migration, and Local Employment Elasticities|We provide theory and evidence that the elasticity of local employment to a labor demand shock is heterogeneous depending on the commuting openness of the local labor market. We develop a quantitative general equilibrium model that incorporates spatial linkages in goods markets (trade) and factor markets (commuting and migration). We quantify this model to match the observed gravity equation relationships for trade and commuting. We find that empirically-observed reductions in commuting costs generate welfare gains of around 3.3 percent. We provide separate quasi-experimental evidence in support of the model's predictions using the location decisions of million dollar plants.
R13|China-Kyrgyzstan railway meets IDE-GSM|The impact of connecting Kashgar, Trougart, Uzgen, and Karasuu and facilitating customs at the national border between China and Kyrgyzstan are examined by using IDE-GSM (Institute of Developing Economies, JETRO Geographical Simulation Model). We found that the railway connection has a positive impact in southern Kyrgyzstan and a negative impact in regions of northern Kyrgyzstan, neither of which are the capital city of Kyrgyzstan.
R13|Geographical simulation analysis of the development of Thilawa and Myanmar|We use a geographical simulation model to assess the economic impacts of special economic zones (SEZs) and other policy measures in Myanmar. We compare cases wherein SEZ development is concentrated in Thilawa/Yangon with those wherein it is dispersed among 15 districts. We find that concentrated development has a much larger economic impact on Myanmar. Moreover, this impact is larger when we assume the development of a domestic economic corridor and regulatory reform in addition to the development of Thilawa and may reduce the excessive inflow of households into the Yangon area. We also discuss how delaying the dispersion of development affects the economic impacts on Yangon and other regions as well as on Myanmar.
R13|Spatial scale of agglomeration and dispersion: Theoretical foundations and empirical implications|This paper revisits a wide variety of existing economic geography models in a many-region setup. It investigates the spatial scale of agglomeration and dispersion intrinsic to each model. In our unified analytical framework, these models reduce to two canonical classes: one with a global dispersion force and the other with a local dispersion force. Their formal distinction is that the former is dependent, whereas the latter is independent of the distance structure of the model. These classes exhibit two stark differences. The first difference concerns their response to transport costs: Global and local dispersion forces are triggered by higher and lower transport costs, respectively. Consequently, in a realistic model with both types of dispersion forces, a decrease in transport costs simultaneously causes both agglomeration at the global scale and dispersion at the local scale. The second difference concerns the agglomeration pattern: multiple agglomerations emerge and spread globally over the regions in the former, whereas agglomeration always takes the form of a unimodal regional distribution of mobile agents in the latter. Endogenous agglomeration mechanisms generally do not isolate the locations at which agglomerations grow or decline for a given change in transport costs. However, they offer predictions for the global spatial distribution of agglomerations as well as the local spatial extent of an individual agglomeration. This knowledge provides a consistent explanation for the set of seemingly unrelated empirical results from reduced-form regressions on regional agglomerations (e.g., Baum-Snow, 2007; Baum-Snow, Brandt, Henderson, Turner and Zhang, 2017; Duranton and Turner, 2012; Faber, 2014); it provides a new set of testable hypotheses. Moreover, our analytical framework provides formal predictions of treatment effects in the structural model-based approaches for regional agglomeration. Applications to the most standard formulations (e.g., Allen and Arkolakis, 2014; Redding and Sturm, 2008) are discussed.
R13|Medición de los efectos de un aumento del 20% de las tarifas de Estados Unidos sobre la economía mexicana a través de modelización multisectorial|The goal of this research is to simulate the possible effects of the 20% increase in tariffs on the Mexican economy. The price model used is based on a general equilibrium linear model. With this price model, the estimate of the impact of the effects of a US tariff increase of 20% on the Mexican economy is roughly estimated, simulating this increase on prices in the rest of the world. In this way, it is possible to calculate the effects on consumer prices and welfare represented in this case by the CPI. The main result shows that the impact of the increase of the prices of the rest of the world to the increase of the tariffs in the United States on the CPI is inflationary with an increase of around 4%.
R13|¿Cómo se ha comportado el sector turístico andaluz en la crisis económica? Reflexiones sobre turismo sostenible y el desarrollo regional|Assessing the effects of tourism activities on regional development is not a common practice, although its benefits for the host economies are widely highlighted. This work focuses on Andalusia to analyze these effects during the crisis period. To do so, a Social Accounting Matrix based model is employed, which depicts Tourism activities as a key sector for the regional economy. Additionally to the structural analysis, a bunch of socio-economic data is analyzed to determine whether the role of the Tourism within the regional economy is sustainable or a simple result of the current framework. Within the latter, employment data is studied in a detailed way since Tourism play a role of the major importance in job creation at regional level. The preliminary results point out that the relevance of Tourism in the regional economy comes from the crisis and the declining behavior of the remaining sectors rather than the own characteristic of the sector. Moreover, the work highlights the weaknesses of the sector and the lack of development of a system of sustainable tourism indicators.
R13|Goods and Factor Market Integration: A Quantitative Assessment of the EU Enlargement|The economic effects from labor market integration are crucially affected by the extent to which countries are open to trade. In this paper we build a multi-country dynamic general equilibrium model with trade in goods and labor mobility across countries to study and quantify the economic effects of trade and labor market integration. In our model trade is costly and features households of different skills and nationalities facing costly forward-looking relocation decisions. We use the EU Labour Force Survey to construct migration flows by skill and nationality across 17 countries for the period 2002-2007. We then exploit the timing variation of the 2004 EU enlargement to estimate the elasticity of migration flows to labor mobility costs, and to identify the change in labor mobility costs associated to the actual change in policy. We apply our model and use these estimates, as well as the observed changes in tariffs, to quantify the effects from the EU enlargement. We find that new member state countries are the largest winners from the EU enlargement, and in particular unskilled labor. We find smaller welfare gains for EU-15 countries. However, in the absence of changes to trade policy, the EU-15 would have been worse off after the enlargement. We study even further the interaction effects between trade and migration policies and the role of different mechanisms in shaping our results. Our results highlight the importance of trade for the quantification of the welfare and migration effects from labor market integration.
R13|Effects of Emigration on Rural Labor Markets|Rural to urban migration is an integral part of the development process, but there is little evidence on how out-migration transforms rural labor markets. Emigration could benefit landless village residents by reducing labor competition, or conversely, reduce productivity if skilled workers leave. We offer to subsidize transport costs for 5792 potential seasonal migrants in Bangladesh, randomly varying saturation of offers across 133 villages. The transport subsidies increase beneficiaries’ income due to better employment opportunities in the city, and also generate the following spillovers: (a) A higher density of offers increases the individual take-up rate, and induces those connected to offered recipients to also migrate. The village emigration rate increases from 35% to 65%. (b) This increases the male agricultural wage rate in the village by 4.5-6.6%, and the available work hours in the village by 11-14%, which combine to increase income earned in the village, (c) There is no intra-household substitution in labor supply, but primary workers within households earn more during weeks in which many of their village co-residents moved away. (d) The wage bill for agricultural employers increases, which reduces their profit, with no significant change in yield. (e) Food prices increase by 2.7% on net, driven by an increase in the price of (fish) protein, and offset by (f) a decrease in the price of non-tradables like prepared food and tea. Seasonal migration subsidies not only generate large direct benefits, but also indirect spillover benefits by creating slack in the village-of-origin labor market during the lean season.
R13|The Marginal Product of Climate|We develop an empirical approach to value changes to a climate in terms of total market output given optimal factor allocations in general equilibrium. Our approach accounts for unobservable heterogeneity across locations as well as the costs and benefits of adaptation in climates of arbitrary dimension. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Envelope Theorem implies the marginal product of a long-run climate can be exactly identified using only idiosyncratic weather variation. We apply this method to the temperature climate of the modern United States and find that, despite evidence that populations adapt, the marginal product of temperature has remained unchanged during 1970-2010, with high temperatures having low net value. Integrating marginal products recovers a value function for temperature, describing the causal effect of non-marginal climate changes net of adaptive re-optimization. We use this value function to consider the influence of temperature in the current cross-section and a future climate change scenario.
R13|Housing Policy of the Administrative-Territorial Units in Northeastern Bulgaria 2010-2014|The article examines the status and the change of the parameters characterizing the housing policy in the Northeastern region of the Republic of Bulgaria. Surveyed are the various counties in the Northeastern Region of Bulgaria - Varna, Dobrich, Targovishte and Shumen. Subject of analysis are the strategic goals, the operational aspects and the indicators characterizing the housing policy in these counties. Analyzed and outlined are the impact of specific factors on housing policy and the vision and strategic objectives thereof in this region of the country. The conclusions may be summarized as follows: the strategic objectives are aimed at improving the condition of existing housing and the provision new affordable housing for the population. Housing affordability for the population is improved as a result of reduced price levels and increased incomes. The residential standard, the housing concentration and the average housing area are growing as a result of a slowdown in housing numbers relative to the population and the growth rate of the housing area. These changes are the result of the demographic, economic and social changes in this part of the country.

R13|A multiplier evaluation of primary factors supply–shocks|Demand-side multipliers have ruled within multisectoral models as the main indicators for policy effectiveness and key-sector determination. The causal link between new exogenous final demand and responded endogenous total output is well understood and has been the basis for such a prevalent demand-side analysis both in linear interindustry analysis and in non-linear applied general equilibrium models. In this paper we shift the perspective to supply-side injections and we do so by studying the repercussion effects of marshalling additional primary factors, labor and capital services, which are injected into the economy and give rise to a general resource reallocation. As a result, we obtain estimates of supply multipliers that provide complementary information to standard demand multipliers. We illustrate the methodology using an empirical general equilibrium model built with the most recent data for the region of Andalusia, Spain.
R13|Decomposition of inter-regional inequality in average personal incomes by income sources: the Russia case study|Research background: This paper is dedicated to inter-regional disparities in personal incomes and their composing by sources. We suggest that income sources contribute differently to overall inequality. Some of them, e.g. property incomes, amplify inequality, while others, e.g. social transfers, should mitigate it. Purpose of the article: The aim of this article is to determine the character, direction and strength of influence of different sources, i.e. wages and salaries, property incomes, social transfers, entrepreneurship incomes and revenues from informal activities on inter-regional differences in overall incomes per capita and their dynamics based on Russian regional statistics in 2001-2014. Methodology/methods: We used the method of relative deflating of regional incomes based on the fixed consumer basket cost, the population-weighted Theil index to measure inequality and technique of its decomposition to evaluate the contribution of various sources to regions’ convergence in real incomes per capita. Findings: For Russian regions in 2001-2014 we revealed different paths of inter-regional inequality for various sources of incomes. Decomposition of inter-regional income inequality demonstrated the largest and growing contribution made to it by wages and salaries. Informal incomes demonstrated declining influence on inequality and provided more than half of total inter-regional convergence. The contribution of entrepreneurship incomes to inter-regional disparities occurred the third and slightly decreasing, but their share in total incomes has declined. Social transfers per capita demonstrated the largest smoothing effect, but their contribution to convergence is mostly depleted. The property incomes proved to have the greatest enhancing impact on inequality especially in the period of economic growth, albeit not large by value because of small share in total income. Ultimately we revealed the substituting role of informal incomes in respect of formal incomes and existence of self-perpetuating mechanisms of reducing inequality in Russian economy.

R13|Artificial nighttime lights and the “real” well-being of nations: ‘Measuring economic growth from outer space’ and welfare from right here on Earth|GDP remains too much of an imprecise measure of the standard of living. There is a need for either substitutes or complements. Nighttime lights are a reasonable indicator of the extent, scale, and intensity of socio-economic activities, but a poor measure of national welfare. However, if nighttime lights are understood to constitute externalities, then their effects can be used to adjust measured growth for welfare. Nighttime lights appear to exert sub-optimal positive externalities in developing countries, and supra-optimal negative externality in developed countries. This means that even if we assume equal growth rates in developing and developed countries, welfare is enhanced by increased nighttime lights in developing countries and reduced by increasing nighttime lights in developed countries.
R13|Spatial Scale of Agglomeration and Dispersion: Theoretical Foundations and Empirical Implications|This paper studies the theoretical properties of existing economic geography models with agglomeration and dispersion forces in a many-region setup, rather than their original two-region space, to investigate the spatial scale—global or local—of agglomeration and dispersion intrinsic to each model. We show that models in the literature reduce to two canonical classes that differ starkly in their engendered spatial patterns and comparative statics. Our formal results offer a consistent explanation for the set of various outcomes from the extant reduced-form regression analyses and also provide qualitative predictions of the treatment effects in the structural model-based studies on regional agglomeration.

R13|Empirical Analysis of the Transformation of Economic Growth into Social Development at an International Level|Abstract This paper takes a look at the countries of the world and their rankings in terms of material wealth. Using the attributes and variables featured in the development of these countries and synthetic indexes, it analyzes the relationship between wealth levels and estimates of social development. First we use the indicators estimated by UNDP. Using UNDP methodology and multivariate statistical methods such as factor analysis, we then turn to complementary estimators. Our results not only allow us to identify which countries are better (or worse) at turning economic growth into social development but they also contribute to detecting the dimensions of development behind position changes across various rankings.

R13|The long‐term economic implications of Brexit for Scotland: An interregional analysis|This paper offers a cautionary tale about the economic cost of European disintegration. Scotland provides an interesting twist on that story as somewhere that voted to remain part of the EU, but is now likely to be negatively affected, even though it is less directly exposed to EU trade than the UK. This occurs even if it were to achieve the softer Brexit with continued single market membership to which it aspires. The analysis includes potentially important lessons for the many nations and regions in which there exists pressures to move away from trade liberalization and towards protectionism. Este artículo ofrece una historia con moraleja sobre el costo económico de la desintegración europea. Escocia proporciona un giro interesante en esa historia, por ser un lugar que votó para seguir siendo parte de la UE, pero ahora es probable que se vea afectada negativamente, a pesar de que está menos expuesta directamente al comercio con la UE que el resto del Reino Unido. Esto ocurriría incluso si se lograra un Brexit leve en el que continuaría la membresía del mercado único a la que aspira. El análisis incluye importantes lecciones potenciales para el gran número de naciones y regiones en las que existen presiones para alejarse de la liberalización del comercio en dirección al proteccionismo. 本稿では欧州における統合の崩壊による経済的損失に関する訓話を提示する。スコットランドは、住民のほとんどがEU残留に投票し、このストーリーに興味深い展開を与えたが、今となってはイギリスほどEUとの貿易による直接的な影響を受けてはいないものの、悪影響を受けている可能性が高い。スコットランドが強く希望している、EU単一市場には残留するというソフトブレグジット(soft Brexit:穏健な離脱)が成功したとしても結果は同じである。分析の結果には、貿易自由化を離れて保護貿易主義に向かわせる圧力が存在する多くの国家および地域にとって重要となりうる教訓が含まれている。
R13|The Gains from Economic Integration|This paper measures the effect of sharing a national state on the degree of trade integration. We call the causal effect of this political integration the economic integration - this is the additional trade integration gained by entities which come together to form a country rather being independent countries. The existence of very large border effects, even within the European Union, is well known, and is a consequence of this aforementioned economic integration achieved within national states. Nevertheless, these border effects are bound to overestimate the gains from sharing a state. This is because places which share larger affinities are more likely to both trade with each other and to select into sharing a state. This endogeneity therefore means that estimates of the average border effect overstate the reductions in trade frictions achieved by sharing a state. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach. We identify marginal regions (regions which could conceivably be independent countries by themselves) and marginal countries (countries that are the closest trading partner in the data to the country to which that marginal regions belong). We propose that the gap in trade frictions between these marginal regions and marginal countries is a much better estimate to the causal impact of state sharing. Despite controlling for selection bias, we find that the gains from economic integration are still substantial: it is about one third of the total gains from trade.
R13|Economic effects of climate change in developing countries: Economy-wide and regional analysis for Ethiopia|Quantifying the economic effects of climate change is a crucial step for planning adaptation in developing countries. This study assesses the economy-wide and regional effects of climate change induced productivity and labor supply shocks in agriculture in Ethiopia. The study shows, in worst case scenario, the effects on national GDP may add up to -8% with uneven regional effects ranging from -10% in agrarian regions (e.g. Amhara) to +2.5% in urbanized regions (e.g. Addis Ababa). Cost-free exogenous structural change scenarios in labor markets and transaction costs may offset about 20-30% of the ripple effects of climate change. Therefore, the ongoing structural transformation in the country may underpin the resilience of the economy to climate change. Nevertheless, given the role of agriculture in the current economic structure of the country and the potency of biophysical impacts of climate change, adaptation in the sector is indispensable. Otherwise, climate change may hamper economic progress of the country, and make rural livelihood unpredictable.
R13|General equilibrium effects of public adaptation in agriculture in LDCs: Evidence from Ethiopia|Ethiopia is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. This is because its important economic sector, agriculture, is virtually rain-fed. The role of the sector in the current economic structure and the potency of the anticipated biophysical impacts of climate change necessitates proactive adaptation in agriculture. This, however, breeds questions of adaptation costs and adaptation finance. This study attempts to derive plausible range of planned adaptation costs in agriculture along with their economy-wide and regional effects in Ethiopia. It also assess the economy-wide and regional effects of the likely options available to a government of a least-developed country to finance adaptation in agriculture. The results show that planned public adaptation in agriculture puts pressure on government surplus, impedes on manufacturing and private services, and GDP of urbanized regions. As such, it may strain the current macroeconomic endeavors of the country which puts government driven structural transformation and reducing fiscal deficit relative to GDP at the center. Government of Ethiopia may reconcile this by laying out incentives to urban agriculture and private investment in agriculture. Besides, foreign support in the form of biotechnology transfer and debt-relief may help to control the side effects of grants on foreign exchange market and trade balance.
R13|Migration when Social Preferences are Ordinal: Steady-state Population Distribution and Social Welfare| This paper adds three dimensions to the received literature: it models migration when the individuals’ preferences regarding their relative income are ordinal, it works out the resulting spatial steady state distribution of the individuals, and it shows that the aggregate of the individuals’ migration choices in the spatial steady state distribution sums up to the social optimum. This finding does not apply when the individuals’ preferences regarding their relative income are cardinal. We highlight the importance of the assumption about the nature of the individuals’ social preferences (whether ordinal or cardinal) to studying and predicting their migration behavior, and to elucidating the consequences of that behavior for social welfare.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R13|The pattern of structural change: testing the product space framework|The set of available local “capabilities” determines what an economy produces today (its static comparative advantage) and, at the same time, defines the trajectories that the process of structural change may take in the future. The product space (PS) framework developed in recent seminal works by economists and physicists suggests that path-dependence characterizes the evolution of the production basket (Hausmann and Klinger, 2007, Harvard University Center for International Development Working Paper #146; Hidalgo et al., 2007, Science Magazine, 317(5837), 482–487). These authors represent economies as sets of productive capabilities that can be combined in different ways to produce different products. Countries progressively change their production baskets and move toward goods that require capabilities that are already available; on the contrary radical structural change rarely happens. In this article, we analyze the evolution over time of the production baskets in 107 Italian provinces (NUTS 3) and perform the first test on the PS hypothesis of path-dependence. We investigate whether new products entering the provincial production baskets are nonrandomly related to initial production baskets. We confirm the general tendency of path-dependence but highlight at the same time that a sizable share of “new products” are an exception to this general pattern. These “random entries” over the PS are particularly interesting for industrial policy, since they represent radical deviations from the initial comparative advantage. In the final part of the article, we investigate using parametric analysis the product and provincial characteristics that determine these deviations from the PS pattern.
R13|Firm Heterogeneity, Technological Adoption, and Urbanization: Theory and Measurement|This paper develops a model of firm heterogeneity, technological adoption, and urbanization. In the model, welfare is measured by household real income, and urbanization is measured by population density. I use the model to derive statistics that measure the effect of a new technology on productivity, welfare, and urbanization. The empirical application of the paper estimates these effects using nineteenth-century firmlevel data on mechanical steam power in the Canadian manufacturing sector, and townshiplevel population data. The results indicate that the introduction of steam power increased productivity by 22.8 percent, and welfare by 6.0 percent. By comparing the model predicted change in urbanization to observed population density growth, I find that the introduction of mechanical steam power accounts for approximately 6.2 percent of the observed variation in urbanization during this period.
R13|¿Está Afectando el Impuesto Predial el Precio de la Vivienda en Bogotá? Un Análisis Basado en la Econometría Espacial|Este documento provee evidencia sobre los efectos del impuesto predial en los precios de la vivienda nueva en Bogotá para el período 2009-2016. Se utiliza información fiscal y de los atributos físicos y de localización de 6.013 predios residenciales de estratos medios y altos, ubicados en las tres localidades de mayor urbanización y contribución al fisco (Chapinero, Suba y Usaquén). Mediante el uso de modelos espaciales para datos de panel, el trabajo encuentra que los aumentos registrados en la tarifa efectiva del predial han impactado negativamente los precios de los inmuebles y que dicho efecto ha venido aumentando en los últimos años. Los resultados son robustos tanto a cambios en la matriz de pesos espaciales como a cambios en las metodologías de estimación. Los ejercicios controlan por los impactos sobre los precios debidos a los atributos físicos de las viviendas, su estrato y ubicación, con resultados coherentes con la evidencia internacional sobre precios hedónicos.
R13|Optimal Spatial Taxation: Are Big Cities too Small?|We analyze the role of optimal income taxation across different local labor markets. Should labor in large cities be taxed differently than in small cities? We find that a planner who needs to raise revenue and is constrained by free mobility of labor across cities does not choose equal taxes for cities of different sizes. The optimal tax schedule is location specific and tax differences between large and small cities depends on the level of government spending and on the concentration of housing wealth. Our estimates for the US implies higher marginal rates in big cities, but lower than what is observed. Simulating the US economy under the optimal tax schedule, there are large effects on population mobility: the fraction of population in the 5 largest cities grows by 8.0% with 3.5% of the country-wide population moving to bigger cities. The welfare gains however are smaller. Aggregate consumption goes up by 1.53%. This is due to the fact that much of the output gains are spent on the increased costs of housing construction in bigger cities. Aggregate housing consumption goes down by 1.75%.
R13|The relevance of inter-regional trade data produced by the 2012 Commodity Flow Survey for multi-regional CGE modelling|The objective of this study is to assess the suitability of Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) data released by the US Census Bureau as a check on the estimates of inter-regional trade generated in creating the USAGE-TERM master database. A close inspection of the Census Bureau's CFS data indicate that they record movements to and from transport nodes. In some cases, transport nodes may align with production origins and final use destinations. In other cases, nodes appear to be intermediate points rather than origins or final destinations. This implies that CFS data are often incompatible with the trade flows in a CGE database. Merchandise, that is primary and manufacturing commodities, account for no more than 15% of GDP in the U.S. economy. Therefore, even comprehensive merchandise trade flow data would have limited use in a CGE database. The usefulness of the CFS data is diminished further by its concentration on bulky goods, which account for a small fraction of total trade flows. Bulky trade flows may account for a substantial proportion of the volume of trade but make a small contribution to total economic activity. Mining products excluding oil and gas account for 50.9% of the recorded weight in the survey, but just 3.9% of the value of trades – and only 0.3% of GDP. The CFS data might be useful for examining transport logistics but are of little use in CGE database preparation. There is no evidence that the CFS data supersedes the Horridge gravity method of allocating inter-regional trades. However, CFS data point to the desirability of noting the difference between transport in the Mississippi basin and elsewhere. The basin relies heavily on water transport for moving agricultural, mining and fuel products.
R13|Indonesia's Moratorium on Palm Oil Expansion from Natural Forests: Economy-Wide Impacts and the Role of International Transfers|Indonesia has introduced a moratorium on the conversion of natural forests to land used for palm oil production. Using a dynamic, bottom-up, interregional computable general equilibrium model of the Indonesian economy, we assess several scenarios of the moratorium and discuss its impacts on the domestic economy as well as on regional economies within Indonesia. We find the moratorium reduces Indonesian economic growth and other macroeconomic indicators, but international transfers can more than compensate the welfare losses. The impacts also vary across regions. Sumatra, which is highly dependent on palm oil and is home to forests that no longer have a high carbon stock, receives fewer transfers and suffers the greatest economic loss. Kalimantan, which is relatively less dependent on palm oil and has forests with a relatively high carbon stock, receives more transfers and gets greater benefit. This implies that additional policy measures anticipating the unbalanced impacts of the moratorium are required if the trade-off between conservation and reducing interregional economic disparity is to be reconciled.
R13|The National and Regional Consequences of Australia's Goods and Services Tax|The major political parties support the tenet of the original GST agreement that GST change requires unanimous state approval. However, GST change could differentially affect state economies, and thus influence support from individual states. We investigate the potential for GST change to differentially affect state economies. We do this by developing a multi‐regional model of the Australian economy that contains details of the legislated features of the GST. In this model, when we change any element of the GST, the economic effects are informed by regional differences in economic structure and their interactions with the details of our GST theory.
R13|Using a regional CGE model for rapid assessments of the economic implications of terrorism events: creating GRAD-ECAT (Generalized, Regional And Dynamic Economic Consequence Analysis Tool)|The Terrorism Risk Assessment (TRA) groups in the Department of Homeland Security assess millions of terrorism scenarios defined by location, agent (e.g. nuclear device), and delivery method (e.g. car bomb). For each scenario they estimate deaths, injuries, property damage, clean-up and health expenses, visitor discouragement, and other damage dimensions. The TRA groups translate damages into economic measures, e.g. loss of GDP. Previously they used an input-output (I-O) model. Here we replace I-O with computable general equilibrium (CGE). Solving CGE models is computationally time-consuming and requires specialist skills. For the TRA groups this creates two challenges: feasibility and security. A model that cannot be solved in less than a fraction of a second is infeasible for analyzing millions of scenarios. The TRAs can rely only on people with high security clearances, limiting the possibilities for obtaining specialist advice. Our approach to these challenges was to use a CGE model to estimate elasticities that show the sensitivity of economic variables to direct damage effects of events occurring in different regions. For example, we supplied the TRA groups with CGE-based estimates of the percentage effect on national welfare of destruction of 1 per cent of the capital stock in congressional district NY14. Our elasticity approach meets both challenges. First, for any given terrorism scenario specified by a location and a vector of direct damage shocks, the TRA groups can use the elasticities in linear equations to estimate in nanoseconds the implications for a wide range of economic variables. Second, as outside contractors, we have no need for access to sensitive information on specific shock vectors and target regions. We describe how we used a dynamic, multi-regional CGE model, USAGE-TERM, to estimate the elasticities.
R13|The urban economics of retail|This paper is the first to document empirically that urban shopping areas have a pronounced centre where the rents are the highest, and a negative rent gradient. We use this insight to build and test empirically a simple theoretical model of the competition between the residential and the retail land in a city. The model predicts that rents and occupancy rates on the edges of shopping areas are most sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Demand shocks may lead to transformations between retail and residential land use, mostly at the edge, and to a contraction or expansion of shopping areas. The model predictions are tested on unique data on the location and characteristics of all retail and non-retail properties within 300 largest shopping areas in the Netherlands in 2004-2014, a period including the Great Recession. With every 100 metre distance from the centre of a shopping area rents fall, on average, by 15 percent. Shopping streets, areas located on attractive sites and areas offering free parking have a flatter distance decay. The vacancy rate on the edge of a shopping area is almost twice as high as in the centre. During the Great Recession some 2% of the retail properties were transformed into other use, mostly on the edges of the shopping areas.
R13|The effect of a local allowance on the endogenous formation of jurisdictions|This paper analyses the effect of allowances, whose amount depends on jurisdictions, on the segregative properties of endogenous formation of jurisdictions. Households choosing to live at the same place form a jurisdiction whose aim is to produce a local public good and to implement a redistribution policy, by granting every household an allowance whose amount is determined by the jurisdiction. In every jurisdiction, the production of the local public services and the allowance are financed with a local tax based upon the householdsâ€™ wealth. Local wealth tax rates and the level of the allowance are exogenously determined in every jurisdiction. Households are free to leave their jurisdiction for another jurisdiction that would provide them with their highest utility. We find that the existence of an allowance mitigates the segregative properties of endogenous jurisdiction formation, as the condition identified by Gravel and Thoron to ensure the segregation of any stable jurisdiction structure remains necessary, but is no longer sufficient.
R13|Domestic vs. International Welfare Gains from Trade|Using varieties of a rich model that considers sectoral heterogeneity and input-output linkages, this paper shows that the overall welfare gains of a region within a country can be decomposed into domestic versus international welfare gains from trade. Empirical results based on state-level data from the U.S. suggest that about 91 percent of the overall welfare gains of a state are due to domestic trade with other states, on average across alternative model specifications, with a range between 72 percent and 99 percent across states. When national-level data are used for the U.S., international welfare gains are shown to be almost identical to the those obtained by the aggregation of state-level results, suggesting that one can use the implications of a region-level analysis to have national-level results based on welfare gains from trade. We use this implication to propose an approximation to measure the domestic welfare gains from trade when domestic trade data are not available. Accordingly, using the implications of the model introduced, a Dispersion of Economic Activity Index (DEAI) is introduced that depends on internal distance and elasticity measures. It is empirically shown that DEAI can capture domestic welfare gains from trade within the U.S. when standard internal distance and elasticity measures in the literature are employed. Important policy suggestions follow.
R13|Heterogeneous Workers and Federal Income Taxes in a Spatial Equilibrium|This paper studies the incidence and efficiency of a progressive income tax in a spatial equilibrium. We use US census data to estimate an empirical spatial equilibrium with heterogeneous workers, landowners, and firms. The US income tax shifts skilled workers out of high-productivity cities, leading to a deadweight loss of 2% of tax revenue. Flattening the tax schedule significantly increases welfare inequality between skilled and unskilled workers and does not increase overall worker welfare, as the efficiency gains are captured by landowners. This suggests that progressive income taxes reduce welfare inequality without reducing total worker welfare.
R13|Regional Equalization: Do Any Incentives for Regional Development Still Exist?|"The study aims to assess how the currently applied methodology for allocating equalization transfers to Russian regions has retained incentives for their economic development. To answer this question, the term ""incentive"" is defined more precisely, and an indicator is suggested whereby it becomes possible not only to identify the presence or absence of regional economic development incentives, but also to perform their quantitative assessment. That indicator is the degree of compensation for the increased amount of tax and non-tax revenues by a reduction in the amount of equalization grants. It demonstrates how the amount of equalization transfers would change if the tax capacity of each region would have been different. The hypothesis that there still exists a sufficient amount of incentives, while at a first glance contradicting the popular belief about their absence, relies on the review of a broad spectrum of components and specific features of the currently applied methodology for distributing equalization transfers between RF subjects, which contribute to the preservation of such incentives. That hypothesis is confirmed by the study results. In particular, the calculated effects of changes in regions' tax capacities on the amount of equalization transfer received by them over the period 2006-2015 demonstrate that for the majority of regions, less than half of their revenue loss was compensated, which means that there exist significant incentives for the regions to develop their economies and the revenue base of their budgets. This stimulating effect varied depending on whether the initial fiscal capacity of each region prior to the allocation of equalization transfers was below or above 0.6: in the latter case, it was significantly higher. The study also analyses the supplementary factors that are associated with the negative net financial effect of increased revenue capacity on regional budget."
R13|Regional inequality and convergence in southern Europe. Evidence from Height in Italiy and Spain, 1850-2000|This paper analyzes the growth of height and its regional variability in Spain and Italy, among the generational cohorts of 1850 and 1980. Using male height data drawn from the military enlistment records of the period between 1870 and 2000, this paper explores inequality and regional convergence in the two countries. This long period was characterised by economic growth and the expansion of human welfare. Regional inequality and convergence are analysed using sigma and beta convergence, a methodology based on panel data to obtain the speed of convergence. The results show that in 1850 in both countries the height measurements started at low levels, but the two countries recorded a significant increase in the average height over the long term, which became more intense in Italy as from the beginning of the twentieth century, and in Spain from 1950. Therefore, there was divergence in the first half of the century and strong convergence at the end of the century. The regional inequality was more significant in the Italian case. Processes of regional convergence can be observed in both countries during the second half of the twentieth century, but at the end of the period, inequality was lower in Spain than in Italy.
R13|The Potential Economic Impacts of the Proposed Development Corridor in Egypt: An Interregional CGE Approach|Egypt has proposed a new development corridor. A main component is a desert-based expansion of the current highway network. This network is founded on a 1200-kilometer north-south route that starts at a proposed new port near El-Alemein and runs parallel to the Nile Valley to the border of Sudan. It also includes 21 east-west branches that connect the main axis to densely populated cities on the Nile. The paper is a first attempt at an economic assessment of the impact of this proposed corridor. It uses an interregional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model developed and reported in a prior paper. Here, that model is integrated with a more detailed geo-coded transportation network model to help quantify the spatial effects of transportation cost change due specifically to changes in accessibility induced by the corridor. The paper focuses on the likely structural economic impacts that such a large investment in transportation could enable through a series of simulations related to the operational phase of the project.
R13|How deep is your love? A quantitative spatial analysis of the transatlantic trade partnership|This paper explores the quantitative effects of trade liberalization envisioned in a transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP) between the United States and the European Union. We use a quantitative trade model that, in contrast to other works, features consumptive and productive uses of land and we allow for labor mobility and a spatial equilibrium. Our calibration draws mainly on the world inputâ€“output database (WIOD). The eventual outcome of the negotiations is uncertain. Tariffs in E.U.â€“U.S. trade are already very low, however, so that an agreement will have a major impact only by eliminating nontariff barriers. These are extremely hard to quantify. We address these uncertainties by considering a corridor of tradeâ€ liberalization paths and by providing numerous robustness checks. Even with ambitious liberalization, real income gains within a TTIP are in the range of up to 0.46 percent for most countries. The effect on outside countries is typically negative, yet even smaller. Taking land into account scales down the welfare effects strongly. Interestingly, we find that all German counties derive unambiguous welfare gains even though the model allows for negative termsâ€ ofâ€ trade effects. Our analysis also implies that in order to arrive at the same welfare gains as under a TTIP, a multilateral liberalization would have to be much more ambitious for the U.S. than for the E.U.
R13|Beyond the austerity dispute: new priorities for fiscal policy|The workshop aimed at moving forward the fiscal policy debate, which in the crisis years was unavoidably focused on how to regain fiscal credibility and to implement sizable and fast consolidation plans. Four main themes have been proposed for the debate during the workshop. First, the two-way link between fiscal consolidation and inequality, with the idea that consolidation efforts cannot be successful in the long run if they entail a socially unsustainable increase in inequality. Second, the importance of preserving, even in contexts in which the fiscal policy stance is necessarily restrictive, growth-enhancing public investments. Third, the challenges posed to fiscal management by a low inflation context, taking into account that a subdued price dynamics not only makes the real burden of debt heavier, but it also has subtle effects, at least in the short term, on several budgetary items. Finally, the need for a simpler and more appropriate set of rules for the governance of the EMU. The latter topic was also the object of the high-level panel at the end of the workshop. While differences in emphasis emerged among the panellists, they agreed that the current framework could be streamlined, and – more importantly – that no set of rules can work if trust and a sense of sharing a common objective is not rebuilt among the Member States.
R13|Agricultural Insurances - Growth Factor For The Stability Of The Agricultural Production. Agricultural Insurance Schemes In Some European Union Member States|It is widely known that in the last years, the climate changes have had a great impact in the crop yield. For agriculture, the challenge is that, at international level, the food production will have to be double in order to feed 9 billion people - the estimated world population by 2050. In this context, the setting up of proper risk management systems in agriculture becomes an extremely important operation. This paper has tried to analyse the agricultural insurance systems existent in several European Union member states, taking into account that the EU is one of the biggest exporters of agricultural produce in the world, due to a strong agri-food industry and to the importance given to the implementation of new instruments for the management of risks connected to the agricultural activity.
R13|A Spatial Perspective on European Integration: Heterogeneous Welfare and Migration Effects from the Single Market and the Brexit|We use a quantitative model to study the implications of European integration for welfare and migration flows across 1,318 regions. The model suggests that an increase of trade barriers to the level of 1957 reduces welfare by about 1-2 percent on average, depending on the presumed trade elasticity. However, remote regions may face initial welfare losses of up to 4 percent causing an estimated migration of about 8 million individuals to the European core. This implies that the dismantling of trade barriers in Europe has led to a more homogeneous spatial distribution of economic activity. With regard to the Brexit, we find moderate welfare losses for the UK of -0.44 percent in the most pessimistic scenario while continental Europe’s welfare declines by 0.18 percent. In the most unfavorable scenario, about 500,000 people would leave the UK in the long run.
R13|Unemployment Rate And The Internal Migration In Romania|This article analyzes the influence of the internal population migration phenomenon on unemployment in Romania. During the analyzed period, the years between 1991 and 2015, Romania has gone through important economic and social changes and the long-time economic crisis generated a high unemployment rate involving reduced chances of re-employing the unemployed. At the same time the internal migration rate from urban to urban area, respectively from urban to rural area shows the fact that in Romania the population living in cities is influenced by the professional status and they take risks easier than the ones that come from rural area. The conducted research has a high degree of novelty as it refers to internal migration that, besides the external one, may generate economic unbalances and this is the reason why we take into consideration that these analyzed aspects and tendencies be known and taken into consideration especially by the decision factors at socioeconomic level.
R13|Substantiation of Strategic Points for Efficient Functioning of Production Infrastructure of the Southern Region|The article analyzes optimal conditions of efficient functioning and strategic development of production infrastructure of the Southern Region. According to the authors, it principally depends on taking into account the specificity of the region when defining the policy of regional authorities, population, and manufacturers. The authors note that the main condition of the production infrastructure development is supporting efficient work of the manufacturing industry. According to the authors, almost all areas and objects of the regional social and production infrastructure require close attention. However, it is possible to predictably include some objects in social and production areas. In the article the authors revealed prerequisites of the development of the essentially new Concept of Developing Infrastructure of the Chechen Republic (ChR) for the Med-term Perspective within the Strategy of Social and Economic Development of the ChR till 2020. When creating this Concept of Developing Infrastructure of the ChR for the Med-term Perspective, the authors took into consideration the whole range of the implemented and developed documents of the federal level, strategies, and programs related to developing industrial ministries and departments.
R13|How will a nationwide carbon market affect regional economies and efficiency of CO2 emission reduction in China?|As the country with the greatest energy consumption and CO2 emissions globally, China has commenced preparations for a nationwide carbon market, to be established during the period 2016–2020. Given the spatial heterogeneity of economic development across different regions, the nationwide market will have differing impacts on China's regional economies. The present paper uses a multi-regional CGE model to examine the effects of a nationwide carbon market on regional economies and CO2 reduction efficiency under different emission reduction targets. The results indicate that such a market can effectively reduce costs across the whole society, improving welfare and allocation efficiency of production factors and so reducing regional economic disparities and promoting coordinated regional development. These measures can help China to achieve more ambitious reduction targets with the same abatement costs, and large-scale inter-regional transfer of funds during emissions trading can be invested in CO2 mitigation technologies in economically backward regions, promoting CO2 reduction efficiency and industrial upgrading.
R13|The effects of probabilistic innovations on Schumpeterian economic growth in a creative region|We analyze the impact that stochastically occurring innovations have on Schumpeterian economic growth in a region that is creative in the sense of Richard Florida. Our analysis leads to four findings. First, we delineate the so called balanced growth path (BGP) equilibrium and then compute the BGP growth rate in our creative region. Second, we discuss why the lower limit of the support of the random variable that describes the outcome of innovation quality improvements, takes the value that it does. Third, we solve the social planner's problem and derive the Pareto optimal growth rate in our creative region. Finally, we compare the BGP and the Pareto optimal growth rates, we discuss when there is either too much or too little innovation, and we conclude by commenting on the implications of our findings for future research on Schumpeterian economic growth in creative regions.
R13|Links between urban structure and life satisfaction in a cross-section of OECD metro areas|Contemporary urban planning is often oriented towards encouraging compact cities and the prevention of sprawl. But relatively little empirical work has quantitatively examined how land-use fragmentation, population density and compactness determine individual wellbeing. We analyse the relationship between these aspects of urban structure and life satisfaction in 33 cities distributed across five OECD countries. We create a unique dataset merging a household survey on environmental attitudes and behaviours in these countries with geospatial data on a number of indicators related to urban structure. In support of standard urban economic theory, we find a life satisfaction trade-off in terms of households' home sizes and distances to the urban core. A novel finding from the analysis is that the degree of local land-use fragmentation around households' residence is associated strongly and negatively with life satisfaction. We also find suggestive evidence that city centralization (the relative proportion of the population living in the core) decreases life satisfaction on average for individuals residing both within and outside the core.
R13|Workforce location and equilibrium unemployment in a duocentric economy with matching frictions|This article examines unemployment disparities and efficiency in a duocentric city where workers are non-uniformly distributed between the two job centers. We introduce commuting costs and search-matching frictions to deal with the spatial mismatch between workers and firms. In a decentralized economy job-seekers do not internalize a composition externality they impose on all the unemployed. With symmetric job centers, a change in the distribution of the workforce can lead to asymmetric equilibrium outcomes. We calibrate the model for Los Angeles and Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Areas. Simulations suggest that changes in the workforce distribution have non-negligible effects on unemployment rates, wages, and net output, but cannot be the unique explanation of a substantial mismatch problem.
R13|Congestion, agglomeration, and the structure of cities|Congestion costs in urban areas are significant and clearly represent a negative externality. Nonetheless, economists also recognize the production advantages of urban density in the form of positive agglomeration externalities. The long-run equilibrium outcomes in economies with multiple correlated but offsetting externalities have yet to be fully explored in the literature. Therefore, I develop a spatial equilibrium model of urban structure that includes both congestion costs and agglomeration externalities. I then estimate the structural parameters of the model using a computational algorithm to match the spatial distribution of employment, population, land use, land rents, and commute times in the data. Policy simulations based on the estimates suggest that congestion pricing may have ambiguous consequences for economic welfare.
R13|Congestion pricing effects on firm and household location choices in monocentric and polycentric cities|This paper develops a spatial general equilibrium model to explore the land use effects of three roadway congestion pricing strategies in both monocentric and polycentric city settings, where household and firm locations and wage rates are endogenously determined. Simulation results show how marginal cost pricing (MCP) of travel in the polycentric setting can cause many jobs (16% in this example) to leave the central business district (CBD) and relocate to a relatively dense but suburban ring. To achieve city-wide welfare gains, efficient land use regulations should permit such job decentralization. Simulations also illuminate how simple, distance-based tolls generate lower welfare improvements, but stimulate similar land use effects. A cordon toll imposed in monocentric cities may agglomerate all firms in a smaller CBD or re-agglomerate parts of firms in a sub-center ring of development. Overall, results highlight how an urban economic model enabling endogenous business and household decisions can illuminate various travel, congestion pricing, and land use connections.
R13|Multi-region job search with moving costs|We develop a competitive search model involving multiple regions, geographically mobile workers, and moving costs. Equilibrium mobility patterns are analyzed and characterized, and the results indicate that shocks to a particular region, such as a productivity shock, can propagate to other regions through workers' mobility. Moreover, equilibrium mobility patterns are inefficient due to the existence of moving costs.
R13|Welfare effects of tourism-driven Dutch disease: The roles of international borrowings and factor intensity|This paper develops a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model to analyze the welfare implications of the Dutch disease induced by the demand shock arising from a tourism boom. Compared with the existing literature, we introduce two new elements, namely, international borrowings and the relative factor-intensiveness, and examine their interplay with the welfare effects of the Dutch disease. We show that (i) when the household can freely borrow from the world financial market, the Dutch disease will not affect welfare; (ii) when the economy is closed to the world financial market, the Dutch disease is beneficial (harmful) to the residents' welfare if the tourism good sector is capital-intensive (labor-intensive). Moreover, this paper provides a simulation analysis to examine the welfare effect of both the steady-state and the transitional responses arising from a tourism boom.
R13|The Geography of Wage Inequality in British Cities| Lee N., Sissons P. and Jones K. The geography of wage inequality in British cities, Regional Studies. There is widespread concern about the scale and implications of urban inequality in Great Britain, but little evidence about which cities are the most unequal and why. This paper investigates patterns of wage inequality in 60 British cities. It has two principal goals: (1) to describe which cities are most unequal; and (2) to assess the important determinants of inequality. The results show a distinct geography of wage inequality: the most unequal cities tend to be affluent and located in parts of the Greater South East of England. A central determinant of these patterns is the geography of highly skilled workers. Because of this, the geography of urban wage inequality reflects the geography of affluence more generally.
R13|Análisis estructural de la economía mexicana para el año 2008|Identificar sectores productivos, capaces de impulsar la economía, es fundamental para diseñar políticas. Este trabajo analiza la estructura de la economía mexicana con modelos lineales de equilibrio general, que están basados en una matriz de contabilidad social. Primero, realizamos un análisis de sectores clave, a fin de determinar efectos directos, indirectos e inducidos, con una descomposición de multiplicadores. Luego, elaboramos un paisaje tridimensional de la economía e identificamos los multiplicadores de empleo. Finalmente, analizamos la distribución ingreso-gasto de los hogares. Entre otros resultados, los sectores más importantes resultaron ser las actividades comerciales; con menos importancia para la economía, están los sectores de la construcción, servicios de esparcimiento, electricidad, agua y gas, corporativos y minería.
R13|Agglomerations in a multi-region economy: Poly-centric versus mono-centric patterns|Agglomeration externalities have been recognized as major sources of lumpy spatial distributions of industries and population. While the abstraction of interregional space has been a common exercise, recent increasing availability of disaggregated geographical data and more sophisticated computational techniques have promoted counterfactual analyses based on many-region models of agglomeration externalities with explicit interregional space (e.g., Redding and Sturm, 2008; Allen and Arkolakis, 2014). A caveat is that incorporating interregional space to a many-region model with agglomeration externalities does not by itself warrant the formation of polycentric agglomerations in stable equilibria—a crucial property in order to replicate the observed geography of agglomerations. We elaborate this point by comparing a pair of new economic geography models, Forslid and Ottaviano (2003) and Helpman (1998). In a two-region economy, these models exhibit both “agglomeration” (i.e., a relative concentration of mobile agents in one of the regions) and “dispersion” (i.e., a uniform distribution of mobile agents across the two regions). But, if the location space were more disaggregated, only the former admits poly-centric agglomerations in stable equilibria, while in the latter, only a mono-centric agglomeration can occur if any.
R13|Trade and Labor Market Dynamics|We develop a dynamic trade model where production and consumption take place in spatially distinct labor markets with varying exposure to domestic and international trade. The model recognizes the role of labor mobility frictions, goods mobility frictions, geographic factors, and input-output linkages in determining equilibrium allocations. We show how to solve the equilibrium of the model without estimating productivities, migration frictions, or trade costs, which are usually difficult to identify. We calibrate the model to 38 countries, 50 U.S. states, and 22 sectors, and use the rise in China's import competition to quantify the effects across more than 1,000 U.S. labor markets. We find that China's trade shock resulted in a loss of 800,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs, about 50% of the change in the manufacturing employment share unexplained by a secular trend. We find aggregate welfare gains, but, due to trade and migration frictions, the welfare and employment effects vary across U.S. labor markets. Estimated transition costs to the new long-run equilibrium are also heterogeneous and reflect the importance of accounting for labor dynamics.
R13|Pollution and city size: can cities be too small?|We study the optimal and equilibrium size of cities in a monocentric city model with environmental pollution. Pollution is related to city size through the effect of population on production, commuting, and housing consumption. If pollution is local, we find that equilibrium cities are too large, mirroring standard results in the theory of city systems. When pollution is global and per capita pollution declines with city size, however, equilibrium cities may be too small.
R13|China's Capital Stock Series by Region and Sector|The lack of capital stock statistics for empirical research of the Chinese economy has for a long time been one of the major impediments in the profession. Professor Gregory Chow is one of the pioneers who attempted to deal with this matter. His seminal paper on China's capital formation and economic growth was published in 1993 (Chow, 1993). Since then many authors have estimated their own capital stock data series. However, most authors have focused on investigations at the national level and their findings are not without controversies. In particular, few studies have provided estimates of capital stock for China's regional economies. This paper adds to the existing literature in several ways. First, it presents a critical review of the methods and findings in the existing literature. Second, it proposes an alternative approach to estimate China's capital stock series by region as well as across three economic sectors (agriculture, industry and services). Finally, preliminary analyses of the derived capital stock statistics are conducted to examine growth, disparity and convergence in China's regional economies.
R13|The Competitive Paradigm in Spatial Economics|This paper discusses the reasons for the spatial impossibility theorem, which states that the competitive paradigm cannot explain the formation of large urban agglomerations and trade ows. This result is especially meaningful insofar as it is internal to the theory itself. We then briey explores dierent solutions to remedy to this methodological failure.
R13|Savings And Financial Control In Students Of Economic Area And Administrative Region South High Jalisco, Mexico, El Ahorro Y Control Financiero En Estudiantes Del Area Economicoadministrativa De La Region Altos Sur De Jalisco, Mexico|Personal financial planning involves administrative, organization and systematic processes for an individual, family or organization. These activities should be performed efficiently and effectively, optimizing economic resources. Saving is a smart move that is not easy to accomplish. This does not mean spending less. The challenge is to know how to spend money to maximize income in managing their finances. Individuals obtain as a result an economic and quality of life improvement. This study provides information on the ability and academic skills of students in the economic-administrative area of the Southern Region Altos de Jalisco, Mexico. In the optimization exercise, their personal financial resources depend on control and saving income. This study identifies how students perform in undergraduate courses in personal finance curriculum. Learning units are considered related to administration and finance. The important result is that students take control of their personal finances and have the habit of saving that is recorded weekly. Most students are subsidized by their parents or guardians
R13|RHOMOLO-v2 Model Description: A spatial computable general equilibrium model for EU regions and sectors|This report presents the current version of the European Commission's spatial computable general equilibrium model RHOMOLO, developed by the Directorate-General Joint Research Centre (DG JRC) in collaboration with the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG REGIO) to undertake the ex-ante impact assessment of EU policies and structural reforms. The RHOMOLO model has been used with DG REGIO for the impact assessment of Cohesion Policy, and with the European Investment Bank for impact assessment of EU investment support policies. The structure of the model departs from standard computable general equilibrium models in several dimensions. First, it generalises the modelling of market interactions by introducing imperfect competition in products and labour markets. Second, it exploits the advantages of a full asymmetric bilateral trade cost matrix for all EU regions to capture a rich set of spatial market interactions and regional features. Third, it acknowledges the importance of space also for non-market interactions through an inter-regional knowledge spill-over mechanism originating from research and development activities within a country. This report describes the theoretical foundation of RHOMOLO-v2 (v2 = version 2), its mathematical structure, dynamics, data sources and calibration to allow the reader to approach the model and its outputs with a higher degree of awareness of its strength and limitations. Indeed, as for any general equilibrium model with a reasonable level of complexity, in RHOMOLO it is often challenging to track the mechanisms at work after a policy shock and clearly disentangle causes and effects because of the high number of channels of adjustment and the presence of many feedback effects. The purpose of this documentation is thus to provide a compass to the reader to sail safely through its many equations, assumptions and connections.
R13|Regionalisation of Social Accounting Matrices for the EU-28 in 2010. A regional database for RHOMOLO at NUTS 2 level|This paper presents the regionalisation methodology followed to build a regional database for RHOMOLO, the regional computable general equilibrium model developed by the European Commission to evaluate the impact of Cohesion Policy. This report describes the methodology used to develop two sets of regional Social Accounting Matrices for the EU-28 at NUTS 2 level, according to both the NUTS 2006 and the NUTS 2010 classifications. The starting point is the set of national SAMs developed for the model by Alvarez Martinez and Lopez Cobo (2016). The national SAMs are subsequently regionalised by means of non-survey techniques using the available regional statistical data from Eurostat, inter-regional bilateral trade flows developed ad hoc for this project and inter-regional transport cost data from the TRANSTOOLS project. The initial regional data prepared for RHOMOLO v2 included only the EU-27 and NUTS 2006, but following the adhesion of Croatia to the European Union on January 1st 2013, in this paper we also include a national SAM and two regional SAMs for Croatia.
R13|Family Decision of Investment in Human Capital and Migration in a Model of Spatial Agglomeration|This paper analyzes human capital investment decision and location choice, focusing on the intergenerational interactions within a family in an economy where geographic concentrations of high technology industries and high-level service sectors are proceeding. For highly educated young adults searching for job opportunities is much more frequently accompanied by long distance migrations, sometimes beyond the national border. That discourages parents to invest in human capital for their children. Public human capital investment decision is also discussed.
R13|Comparative Advantage and Agglomeration of Economic Activity|The division of labor between and within countries is driven by two fundamental forces, comparative advantage and increasing returns. We set up a simple Ricardian model with a Marshallian input sharing mechanism to study their interplay. The key insight that emerges is that the interaction between agglomeration economies and comparative advantage involves a fundamental tension which is intricately affected by trade costs. A reduction of trade costs fosters the dispersive impact of comparative advantage in sectors governed by this force whilst the impact of agglomeration economies is enhanced by trade cost reductions in the increasing returns sector. The key implication for international trade is that the wage ratio between large and small economies is not only shaped by the primitives that determine agglomeration economies and comparative advantage but also, and differentially, by the sectoral levels of trade costs. The fundamental implication for an economic geography context where labor is mobile across locations is that partial agglomeration emerges when agglomeration economies are strong relative to comparative advantage, and this is more likely the lower are trade costs in increasing returns sectors and the higher are trade costs in sectors governed by comparative advantage. The model may serve as a foundation for an urban system where the endogenously emerging larger city exhibits more diversity in production.
R13|Economic impacts of the Kra Canal : an application of the automatic calculation of sea distances by a GIS|A plan to construct a canal through the Kra Isthmus in Southern Thailand has been proposed many times since the 17th century. The proposed canal would become an alternative route to the over-crowded Straits of Malacca. In this paper, we attempt to utilize a Geographical Information System (GIS) to calculate the realistic distances between ports that would be affected by the Kra Canal and to estimate the economic impact of the canal using a simulation model based on spatial economics. We find that China, India, Japan, and Europe gain the most from the construction of the canal, besides Thailand. On the other hand, the routes through the Straits of Malacca are largely beneficial to Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia, besides Singapore. Thus, it is beneficial for all ASEAN member countries that the Kra Canal and the Straits of Malacca coexist and complement one another.
R13|City competition for the creative class|Abstract This paper explores the conditions under which decentralization and fiscal competition lead to a policy of providing public amenities in order to attract highly productive labor. It provides a theoretical analysis which shows that the incentive to provide such amenities is particularly strong, if institutional restrictions prevent local governments from adjusting their tax structure. The empirical analysis considers the case of Germany, where public subsidies to local theaters are shown to exert a compensating earnings differential for highly educated labor. Taking account of the institutional setting, our empirical results suggest that local jurisdictions in Germany are subject to a substantial fiscal incentive to subsidize cultural activities.

R13|National Policy for Regional Development: Evidence from Appalachian Highways|How effective are policies aimed at integrating isolated regions? We answer this question using the construction of a highway system in one of the poorest regions in the United States. With construction starting in 1965, the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) ultimately consisted of over 2,500 high-grade road miles. Motivated by a model of inter-regional trade we estimate the elasticity of total income with respect to market access, which we then use to evaluate the overall impact of the ADHS. We find that removing the ADHS would have reduced the total income by $45.9 billion or, roughly, 1 percent. Ultimately, the population response to improvements in transportation infrastructure reduced the gains in income per capita, which were equal to $515 (1.4 percent) in the poorest counties. Today, the region's performance relative to the national average is similar to its position in the 1960s. Thus, despite substantial investment in transportation and some gains in income per capita the region continues to lag behind the rest of the country.
R13|Who Wants Affordable Housing in Their Backyard? An Equilibrium Analysis of Low Income Property Development|We estimate the spillovers of properties financed by the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) onto surrounding neighborhood residents. We nonparametrically estimate the impact of LIHTC development on nearby house prices by developing a new difference-in-differences style estimator which exploits smoothness in housing prices across geographic distance and time. We find LIHTC development helps revitalize low income neighborhoods, driving up house prices 6.5%, lowering crime rates, and attracting a more racially and income diverse population. LIHTC development in higher income, low minority areas leads to local house price declines of 2.5% and attracts lower income households. We link these housing price effects to homeowner and renter preferences by developing a generalized hedonic model. Our estimates indicate that an affordable housing development in a low-income area improves welfare by $23,000 per local homeowner and $6500 per local renter, with aggregate welfare benefits to society of $115 million. When viewed as a place-based policy, affordable housing appears to be a desirable way to invest in and revitalize low-income communities.
R13|Estimating Quarterly Poverty Rates Using Labor Force Surveys: A Primer|This paper builds on the existing cross-survey imputation literature to provide up-to-date estimates of poverty when official estimates are deemed outdated. This is achieved by imputing household expenditure data into Labor Force Surveys (LFSs) with models that have been estimated using Household Expenditure Surveys (HESs). In an application to Morocco, where the latest official poverty rate is for 2007, estimates of poverty are obtained for all years (and quarters) between 2001 and 2009. It is found that the approach accurately reproduces the official poverty statistics for the two years these surveys are available. The imputation-based estimates furthermore reveal that poverty has consistently declined over the entire 2001–2009 period. This would suggest that poverty reduction in Morocco was not halted by the global financial crisis. While our focus is on head-count poverty, the method can be applied to any welfare indicator that is a function of household income or expenditure, such as the poverty gap or the Gini index of inequality.
R13|Practical Approach of the PEST Analysis from the Perspective of the Territorial Intelligence|Considering that steam power was the trigger of the First Industrial Revolution in the 18thcentury and that the discovering new sources of energy, alongside with developing the technologiesrequired to use these new type of fuels in the end of the 19th century was considered the SecondIndustrial Revolution, then the proliferation of the Information Technology and Communicationson one hand, and the development of knowledge workers on the other hand are the main drivers ofthe Third Industrial Revolution, also known as the Knowledge revolution. Digging deeper in the Knowledge Economy, we propose as the subject of this paper and as apart of our research, a theoretical approach in assessing and analyzing a region from theperspective of both territorial intelligence and smart developing.
R13|Формування І Розвиток Соціальної Інфраструктури Муніципальних Утворень<BR>[The formation and development of social infrastructure of municipalities]|Управління розвитком муніципальних утворень розглядається в контексті управління процесами розвитку відповідної територіальної системи, що зорієнтоване на багатоаспектність розвитку цієї системи та багатовекторність інтересів представників місцевої громади. Виділено деякі продуктивні моменти зарубіжного досвіду, які можуть знайти успішне застосування в українській практиці програмно-цільового управління розвитком соціальної інфраструктури муніципальних утворень. Доведено, що муніципальне утворення як суб’єкт, що володіє певними ресурсами, у процесі реалізації своєї місії, яка полягає в наданні комплексу послуг територіальній громаді та забезпеченні стандартів життя населення, має використовувати їх ефективно. Management of the development of municipalities is considered in the context of the management of development processes of the appropriate territorial system. This management takes into account the multi-level development of the system and the vectors of interests of the members of the local community. The author identifies important aspects of foreign experience, which may find successful application in practice of the Ukrainian program management by the development of social infrastructure of municipalities. It is proved that the municipality has specific resources and fulfils its mission. This mission is to provide comprehensive services to the community and the standards of living of the population. Resources must be used efficiently.
R13|Does higher level of education reduce poverty and increase inequality? Evidence from Urban India| By considering India's 52 large urban agglomerations, this paper finds the relationship between higher level of education and poverty and inequality in urban India. Besides using city level education data from University Grants Commission (UGC), the study uses two rounds of National Sample Survey (NSS) unit-level data on 'consumption expenditure', and 'employment and unemployment' for the year 2011-2012. An empirical analysis using OLS regression method has shown that city level education, proxied by city-wise total number of PhD students enrolled in the universities, has a negative impact on city level poverty rate as seen by poverty head-count ratio, poverty gap ratio, and squared poverty gap ratio. On the other hand, city level education has a positive impact on city level inequality. City-wise work force participation rate has a negative effect on city poverty rate. The article suggests that we need appropriate city level policy to promote higher level education for reduction in city level inequality and poverty rate for sustainable urban development in India.
R13|Equilibrium commuting|Abstract We consider the role of a nonlinear commuting cost function in determination of the equilibrium commuting pattern where all agents are mobile. Previous literature has considered only linear commuting cost, where in equilibrium, all workers are indifferent about their workplace location. We show that this no longer holds for nonlinear commuting cost. The equilibrium commuting pattern is completely determined by the concavity or convexity of commuting cost as a function of distance. We show that a monocentric equilibrium exists when the ratio of the firm agglomeration externality to commuting cost is sufficiently high. We also show that equilibrium residential land rent is decreasing and convex in distance to the business district under concave commuting cost given that the total land used for offices is smaller than that used for housing. Finally, we find empirical evidence of both long and short commutes in equilibrium, implying that the commuting cost function is likely concave.
R13|The Relationship between Societal attributes, Feminine Leadership & Management Style: Responses from Pakistan's Urban Region Female-Owned Businesses|Research paper investigates various societal attributes including; male employees' performances, living standards, level of poverty, and employment opportunities in relation with feminine leadership and style of management in urban regions of Pakistan's SMEs and Cottage Industries. 'Socio-Anthropological Paradigm' undertaken for exploring research variables. Epistemology under Post-positivism philosophy is used. Moreover, considering mixed method, 4 points Likert scale survey questionnaire and open ended interviews are used as research instruments for data collection. The survey sample size contains 37 female entrepreneurs and interviews with 30 male employees working under feminine leadership and style of management through quota, stratified, and convenience sampling in Pakistan's five urban regions. The results confirmed positive relationship between feminine leadership and management style and various societal attributes. Furthermore, male varying performances are due to situational commitment. Moreover, in male dominated society, cultural barriers and lack of governmental support is limiting the female entrepreneurship to urban regions.
R13|Health inequalities regarding territorial differences in Hungary by discussing life expectancy|Since the middle of the 1990s, Hungary has seen substantial increases in life expectancy. Despite this improvement, many health outcomes remain poor, placing Hungary among the countries in the European Union with worse health status. Based on the general state of health of the population, Hungary belongs with the middle-ground countries of the world. Majority of the health indicators are worse than the average of OECD’s values, and this is especially true regarding the mortality rate of the middle-aged male population. The main objective of the study is to investigate health inequalities with regional differences in Hungary. It is still worth explaining how health inequalities and inequities have changed in terms of space and time after the Hungarian economic and political transition. The territorial range of the study includes the national and regional levels (NUTS3) with the micro-regional level (LAU1). The statistical analysis is based on the use of life expectancy in addition to some mortality indicators. Data for 1990–2014 were examined to define health effects of the Hungarian transition as well as the consequences of the latest economic crisis. Improvements in health along with growth of regional inequalities were found in Hungary since the second half of the 1990s. Larger relative inequalities were observed between Western and Eastern Hungary based on its higher and lower income. Gender differences are also significant in life expectancy. Poor health among the unemployed people was detected, which is a socio-economic effect of the latest economic crisis. In Hungary, income-related health inequalities persist; however, their degree has changed in space and time over the last 25 years. For a comprehensive description of health in Hungary, assessment of the poor health of lower income social groups and the regional level of health inequalities is needed.
R13|Commuting links between settlement hierarchy levels in Hungary|The interaction between the home and workplace has been a central component of urban and regional economic theories (Clark et al. 2003). According to the latest data, in 2011, one-third (1.3 million) of the employed persons commuted daily in Hungary. Compared to 2001, the ratio increased by 4.1 percentage points (up to 34%), and this fits into the global trends as the separation of the location of residence and workplace is becoming more and more common (Reggiani and Rietveld 2010). The phenomenon is fuelled mostly by suburbanisation. This process was at its peak in the 2000s when many people moved from big cities to the surrounding areas, mainly families with stable wealth conditions. The employed members of these families typically kept their jobs at the city of the previous residence.
R13|What cluster model for the competitiveness of Tunisian companies?|"This paper gives purpose to identify the factors of the constitution of ""the Tunisian cluster"" in an environment open to competition. It is a contribution to the debate on the importance of clusters for competitiveness of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to make more innovative and competitive regions and to promote strategically important sectors in technology. Approaches based on the knowledge economy grew by better integrating forms of proximity, organizational, institutional and geographical, (Torre and Rallet 2005) and relational (Boshma, 2005). An empirical study was conducted on a sample of Information and Communication Technologies ICTs’companies. The results show that the lack of attractiveness of ICT Tunisian companies to form clusters is not due to a lack of suitable infrastructure but to the absence of relations involved in a partnership approach or localized nature between higher education, research centers, industry training and organization, enabling to carry out scientific and technical projects."

We use data from the Dun and Bradstreet MarketPlace files to examine how new sports facilities affect nearby business activity in terms of the number of new businesses and workers. We find no evidence of increased new businesses openings after the opening of new sports facilities in 12 U.S. cities in the 2000s; employment at new businesses near new facilities is larger than at new businesses elsewhere in the metropolitan statistical area; this increase cannot be linked to businesses in any specific industry.

R13|Economic impacts of road investments under different financing alternatives|This study explores the issue of road infrastructure funding, analyzing the impact of financing a road improvement project through tolls tariff charged from the final users vis-a-vis the financing through an increase in the country’s payroll tax rate. Using a transport model integrated to an interregional computable general equilibrium model this research simulated alternative arrangements for financing investments made at BR-040, Brazilian road granted by the Federal Government and which figured as the case study for this research. The results indicate that the way the investment is financed is relevant to the regionally distributed impacts of the project, being decisive in defining which regions are benefited by the improvement project. Analyzing the country’s aggregated results, the situation that has the greatest impact on the Brazilian's GDP growth is the investment payed by the road users through toll tariff. From a regional perspective, a clear area of influence that benefits from the improvements on the road can be identified and, when the costs for executing such improvements are shared with the whole country through a tax increase, these benefits are accentuated.
R13|Regional analysis of domestic integration in Egypt: an interregional CGE approach|Abstract We develop an interregional computable general equilibrium model to help assess the ex ante impact of transportation infrastructure policies in Egypt. The model is integrated with a GIS network. We illustrate the analytical capabilities of the model by looking at the domestic integration of the country. Improvements of transportation costs among Egyptian governorates and of their links to the broader world economy are considered in stylized simulations. The results provide quantitative and qualitative insights (general equilibrium effects) into trade-offs commonly faced by policy makers when dealing with transportation infrastructure projects in a spatial context. In the case of Egypt, there seems to be an important trade-off between efficiency and regional equity: projects that produce potential higher impacts on national GDP also tend to contribute more to regional concentration.
R13|Reducing disparity through a regions-focused development: A modeling approach of assessing the Indonesian MP3EI|For the last 10 years, Indonesian economy suffers from a triple setback. First, it experiences a slowing-down in economic growth. Second, the rate of poverty reduction is also slowed down, and third, there has been no improvement in the inter-regional economic disparity. In 2011, Indonesian government set a new strategy by launching a master plan for the acceleration and expansion of economic development (MP3EI) in response to these challenges. The strategy divides Indonesia into 6 economic corridors with two aims: (1) to accelerate investment in each corridor focusing on sectors with high comparative advantage; (2) to accelerate infrastructure investment in each corridor. Using a multi-sectors and multi-regions computable general equilibrium model of the Indonesian economy, this paper evaluates the extent to which these strategies can reduce Indonesia's inter-regional disparity. The result of the analysis suggests that the direction of the MP3EI strategy is in line with its mission to reduce regional disparity as it can accelerate the growth of regions outside Java and Sumatera, particularly eastern regions (Maluku and Papua). However, it can be made more progressive by broadening the sectoral base of the investment target. The current strategy relies on sectors with high comparative advantage particularly capital-intensive resource-based sectors. A broad-based sectoral approach can generate more employment particularly in the least-developed regions and ensuring more progressive acceleration in the poverty reduction.
R13|Let Tiebout pick up the tab: Pricing out externalities with free mobility|Free mobility has not been thought of as an effective tool to correct over- or underproduction of externalities. In this paper, we establish that foot voting can internalize the cost of negative externalities. Workers have to accept the wage and rent, however high or low they are in equilibrium, if they cannot relocate. In reality, they are mobile and they can effectively influence the equilibrium wage and rent to reflect the externalities by threatening to walk away if the current externalities are at an intolerable level. Firms indirectly pay for the damage in the form of an increased labor or land cost and thus the externalities are partially internalized in an open city as opposed to a closed city. We will specify the condition under which an open equilibrium is efficient in the presence of externalities, and discuss potential policy implications of our findings.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R13|Regional trade agreements: The impact of the Transatlantic Trade & Investment Partnership (TTIP) on low income countries: Agreement heterogeneity and supply chain linkages|The Transatlantic Trade & Investment Partnership (TTIP) that is currently being negotiated between the EU and USA is aimed to stimulate international trade between the two partners. Most research indicates that the economic effects for the EU and USA are positive, but that with regard to third countries the economic effects seem less certain. Most existing studies point to the (negative) trade diversion effects for third countries. What is neglected in the literature is agreement heterogeneity; the ambition of TTIP is far reaching and the provisions discussed encompass much more than just the standard trade measures. A related topic is the influence of supply chains in determining the impact of TTIP on third countries. If strong supply chains exist between the TTIP partners and third (low income) countries, trade diversion need not occur. In general, we find that some provisions have a statistically significant impact on trade (positive as well as negative). Others have no effect at all, but can be important for other (policy) reasons than trade. The trade effects of TTIP for the EU and USA are positive. Third country effects are diverse, but for the poorest countries they tend to be positive, especially if provisions mutually reinforce each other. Stylized facts on supply chains show that we do not have to modify our results by including supply chains explicitly for the lowest income countries. Instead, supply chain effects are concentrated in middle income countries. This is largely in line with our results for the trade effects.
R13|Cost-benefit analysis of small hydroelectric generation project utilizing resident volunteers|"Small-scale renewable electricity generation projects have the potential to address not just the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, but also to provide local, sustainable economic and community revitalization. In this paper, we have proposed a small hydroelectric generation project with citizen participation which includes cooperation in some activities such as cleaning and patrols, and have evaluated the project economically by using the regional input-output (I-O) analysis in which the willingness to work (WTW) is incorporated. The WTW for the project have been estimated by using the conjoint analysis as a function of its various attributes, namely revenue from the project's electricity sales, profits earned for the local community, and rewards given to contributors. The results show that the amount of WTW provided by resident volunteers will increase with increasing unit value of reward, but the amount of reward paid to volunteers will also increase. On the other hand, the operating income of the establishment that has contracted maintenance of the small hydroelectric supply sector will decrease, and its influence will spread through the inter-industry relations. Then, we have analyzed such economic ripple effect by using the regional I-O table for analysis of small hydroelectric generation project. By considering the range of the ""unit value of reward"" and the ""substitution rate of resident volunteers"", even if the project is deficit, we have found a good countermeasure which can be expected positive effects. As a result, it is possible to reduce the subsidies of regional governments with respect to the project, and it is possible to devote that amount of budget to improvement of other administrative services. Although introduction of volunteer activities is finished when the amount of WTW exceeds the consignment work load in this case study, more volunteer activities may be introduced if external economic benefits of volunteers are expected. For example, if the bond of community are strengthened by that residents participate in volunteer activities, the bond strengthened can compensate for the lack of government services such as disaster prevention and welfare, and improvement of resident satisfaction may be expected. By evaluating such external economic benefits and practicing social cost benefit analysis, it is possible to discuss that more volunteer activities should be introduced or not. Such external economic benefits can be measured by the opportunity cost of volunteer activities or the time value of WTW, but this matter will be discussed at the next stage. When this type of small hydroelectric generation project utilizing resident volunteers is introduced, household utility levels increase. Understanding the dynamism between these factors can allow regional governments to adapt the scheme to best fit the needs of individual regions."
R13|Regional development in Spain 1989-2010: capital widening and productivity stagnation|"This paper analyses the different factors that explain the pattern of economic growth in Spain along the 1989-2010 period. The results of our analysis provide strong evidence of stagnation in productivity throughout most of the period under study. The large investments and the strong growth in capital stocks were practically absorbed by an intense process of job creation. As a consequence, the capital/labour ratio and labour productivity levels had a very low growth, whereas total factor productivity (TFP) decreased over the period of analysis. Therefore unlike other European countries, Spain did not experience a phenomenon of capital deepening with an increase in productivity. The intense GDP pc growth in Spain was of a rather ""extensive"" type, mainly based on a capital widening process."
R13|Assessing policy options for the EU Cohesion Policy 2014-2020|In this paper we analyse the possible impact of Cohesion Policy 2014-2020, putting together the investments supported by EU funding in all NUTS2 regions and running a set of simulations. We make use of RHOMOLO, a spatial CGE model tailored for economic analysis at the subnational level, which is described in the paper. We do so by first considering infrastructure investment, human capital development and innovation climate support, including environmental amelioration, separately and then run a combined simulation of the three categories to give an impression of the pattern and time profile of the overall effect. The results of the simulation show substantial heterogeneity in the effects across the regions, which are not a mere image of the differences in input. The concentration of EU funding on the less developed regions, and on energy saving, innovation and social inclusion in the more developed regions receiving support, could be a fruitful mix for lifting the standards of living in the whole of Europe.

RHOMOLO: a dynamic general equilibrium modelling approach to the evaluation of the European Union's R&D policies, Regional Studies . European integration changes the prospects of regional economies within the member states of the European Union in many ways. Cohesion Policy is the European Union's instrument to influence and complement the efforts made at the national level to ensure that the gains of economic integration reach everyone, and there are no regions left behind. This paper presents and applies a spatial general equilibrium model RHOMOLO to assess the impact of regional policy in the European Union. The presented simulation results highlight strengths of the approach taken in RHOMOLO in handling investments in research and development (R&D), infrastructure and spillovers of investments in the innovation capacity of the regions, both of which cannot be captured by models in which the spatial structure is not present.
R13|The concept of territorial cohesion as understood and practiced by Polish regions|In the paper, the results of research on integration of various aspects of development in Polish voivodships are shown with a particular reference to territorial capital. An answer is sought to the question, “to what extent and how the Polish regions managed to successfully follow/implement the paradigm of territorial cohesion. For this purpose the findings of a questionnaire survey study, conducted with the offices responsible for a broadly understood development of voivodships were made use of. The research reveals that representatives of regional authorities are relatively well acquainted with issues relating to territorial cohesion, but their understanding of this concept is generally narrower than that found in theoretical studies. Territorial cohesion is rightly associated with conducting spatial policy, as well as with utilization of endogenous development factors. At the level of definition the majority of voivodships underline the role of endogenous factors for growth, but as regards the shape of their intraregional policy more traditional approach is widely prevalent. Regions see their internal spatial policy as nothing but delimitation of areas. This takes place based on negative criteria (referring to “problem areas” that were formerly identified). A lack of integrative approach is also typical. Territory fails to be treated as a subject of integrative policy, and, as well, as an opportunity that can be used to overcome the sectoral divisions. It is rather treated as a tool for achieving other goals. Simultaneously, however, an evolution in approach (forced by the EU regulations) is clearly visible, which forms the basis for more territorial-based policy on the regional level.
R13|The Impact of Taxes and HOA Fees on Single-Family Home Prices|This empirical study utilizes a hedonic pricing model and a large dataset to investigate how property taxes and homeowners association (HOA) fees were capitalized into the real price of single-family homes from 2002 through 2013 in Duval County, Northeast Florida. The findings suggest that the real price was negatively impacted by real city and county property taxes, but positively affected by membership in an HOA. These findings are consistent with earlier research and have implications for government policy makers, real estate developers and civic groups, both regionally and nationally.

R13|Measuring Poverty and Inequality from Highly Aggregated Small Area Data: The Changing Fortunes of Latrobe Valley Households|The Latrobe Valley generates 85% of Victoria's electricity. The progressive privatisation of the electricity industry between 1989 and 1997, had a lasting effect on income distribution in the region. This paper investigates the change in income level, inequality and poverty for this region between 1986 and 2006. To circumvent data availability issues, we propose a general method of using aggregated data to obtain regional income distributions. We find that in 1986 Latrobe Valley incomes were well above other non-metropolitan areas while inequality measures were relatively low. Mean income subsequently dropped below comparable locations while inequality rose. Although income levels had partially recovered by 2006, inequality measures continued to rise.
R13|Relative Income and Subjective Wellbeing: Intra-national and Inter-national Comparisons by Settlement and Country Type|We extend the Easterlin Paradox (EP) literature in two key respects, testing whether inter-national as well as intra-national income comparisons matter for subjective wellbeing, and testing whether these effects differ by settlement-type as well as by country-type. We confirm the intra-national EP predictions (that subjective wellbeing is left unchanged by an equi-proportionate rise in all intra-country incomes) across four developed country settlement types ranging from rural areas to large cities. The EP result also holds for rural areas in transitional countries but not for larger settlement sizes in those countries. For all country-settlement types, we confirm the importance also of inter-national income comparisons in determining people’s subjective wellbeing. Again, however, the effect is less prominent in larger transitional country cities. We also show that once we control for personal characteristics and income-related factors, we cannot reject the presence of a spatial equilibrium in life satisfaction. Our results indicate that each individual government that wishes to raise the life satisfaction of its residents still needs to boost those residents’ incomes in order to raise their subjective wellbeing. However, at least amongst developed countries, this practice results in an international Prisoners Dilemma in which mean life satisfaction stays stable despite rising global incomes.
R13|Migration, congestion externalities, and the evaluation of spatial investments|The direct benefits of infrastructure in developing countries can be large, but if new infrastructure induces in-migration, congestion of other local publicly provided goods may offset the direct benefits. Using the example of rural household electrification in South Africa, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for migration when evaluating welfare gains of spatial programs. We also provide a practical approach to computing welfare gains that does not rely on land prices. We develop a location choice model that incorporates missing land markets and allows for congestion in local land. Using this model, we construct welfare bounds as a function of the income and population effects of the new electricity infrastructure. A novel prediction from the model is that migration elasticities and congestion effects are especially large when land markets are missing. We empirically estimate these welfare bounds for rural electrification in South Africa, and show that congestion externalities from program-induced migration reduced local welfare gains by about 40%.
R13|The Impact of Trade on Labor Market Dynamics|We develop a dynamic labor search model where production and consumption take place in spatially distinct labor markets with varying exposure to domestic and international trade. The model recognizes the role of labor mobility frictions, goods mobility frictions, geographic factors, and input-output linkages in determining equilibrium allocations. We show how to solve the equilibrium of the model without estimating productivity, reallocation frictions, or trade frictions, which are usually difficult to identify. We use the model to study the dynamic labor market outcomes of aggregate trade shocks. We calibrate the model to 38 countries, 50 U.S. states and 22 sectors and use the rise in China's import competition to quantify the aggregate and disaggregate employment and welfare effects on the U.S. economy. We find that China's import competition growth resulted in 0.6 percentage point reduction in the share of manufacturing employment, approximately 1 million jobs lost, or about 60% of the change in the manufacturing employment share not explained by a secular trend. Overall, China's shock increases U.S. welfare by 6.7% in the long-run and by 0.2% in the short-run with very heterogeneous effects across labor markets.
R13|State Taxes and Spatial Misallocation|We study state taxes as a potential source of spatial misallocation in the U.S.. We build a spatial general equilibrium framework that incorporates salient features of the U.S. state tax system, and use changes in state tax rates between 1980 and 2010 to estimate the model parameters that determine how worker and firm location respond to changes in state taxes. We find that heterogeneity in state tax rates leads to aggregate welfare losses. In terms of consumption equivalent units, harmonizing state taxes increases worker welfare by 0.6% if government spending is held constant, and by 1.2% if government spending responds endogenously. Harmonization of state taxes within Census regions achieves most of these gains. We also use our model to study the general equilibrium effects of recently implemented and proposed tax reforms.
R13|Exploring the Effect of Urban Structure on Individual Well-Being|Building on the OECD’s Better Life Initiative and new work using geospatial analysis, this paper investigates how reported life satisfaction relates to some of the urban structure indicators. To this end, it merges OECD household survey data with urban structure data from OECD’s Metropolitan Database, which includes a number of city-level indicators such as population and road density, as well as localised measures of land-use. The merged data permit analysis for five countries: France, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. The findings from this analysis provide some evidence of a trade-off between home size and distance to the city centre, although the statistical power of this effect is relatively weak. Interestingly, regression analysis suggests that overall city-level compactness has a clear negative relationship with life satisfaction, regardless of whether individuals live in the urban core or in peri-urban areas. Land-use fragmentation is also found to have a negative relationship with individuals’ life satisfaction. These general patterns are for the most part robust to various statistical tests. They also hold when econometric analysis is conducted at the country level. Residents of cities with greater levels of centralisation – i.e. a greater share of the population living in the city centre – exhibit measurably lower levels of life satisfaction. A naïve interpretation of this result would suggest that anti-sprawl policies do not in fact improve overall welfare. This study does not support this conclusion. It does, however, give cause for consideration before accepting ‘win-win’ arguments for ‘smart growth,’ often brought forward to support increasingly concentrated, high-density development. The evidence presented here suggests that such policies are not without their welfare trade-offs, and that there will be winners and losers from their implementation. While high-density policies can clearly make a positive contribution to reducing local and global environmental externalities, many of these benefits are deferred and may largely accrue to future generations. A key general lesson from this study is that compensation of the losers may improve the equity effects of these policies, as well as prove more expeditious from a political economy perspective. One of the simplest approaches to compensation would be to balance pecuniary incentives for smart growth, such as higher development taxes or fees, with compensatory policies, such as subsidies or tax or fee offsets in other domains. The main policy conclusion from this study is that smart growth policies should include distributional analysis and recommendations for addressing concerns about inequalities flowing from the scoping and implementation of policies. En s’appuyant sur l’initiative du Vivre mieux de l’OCDE et sur les nouveaux travaux fondés sur des analyses géospatiales, ce rapport étudie les relations entre le niveau de satisfaction déclaré par les ménages et certains des indicateurs de structure urbaine. Pour ce faire, il croise les données d’enquête ménages de l’OCDE et les données sur la structure urbaine tirées de la base de données métropolitaines de l’OCDE, qui réunit plusieurs indicateurs urbains tels que les densités démographique et routière, et des mesures localisées de l’occupation des sols. Ce travail a permis de produire des analyses pour cinq pays : l’Espagne, la France, le Japon, les Pays-Bas et la Suède. Les résultats de ces analyses confirment qu’il existe une relation inverse entre la taille des logements et l’éloignement du centre-ville, même si la significativité statistique de cet effet est relativement faible. Notons aussi que l’analyse empirique révèle l’existence d’une corrélation négative incontestable entre la compacité urbaine et la satisfaction à l’égard de la vie, que l’on habite au coeur des villes ou en périphérie. Même constat en ce qui concerne la fragmentation urbaine. Ces schémas généraux sont pour la plupart validés par différents tests statistiques et confirmés à l’échelle de chaque pays. Les habitants des villes dont le niveau de centralisation est plus élevé – en d’autres termes, les villes où la part de la population vivant dans le centre est supérieure – affichent un niveau de satisfaction à l’égard de la vie bien plus faible. Une interprétation naïve de ce résultat consisterait à dire que les mesures visant à lutter contre l’étalement urbain n’améliorent pas le bien-être global. Le présent rapport ne soutient pas cette conclusion. En effet, ce constat empirique révèle plutôt qu’il est nécessaire d’arrêter de retenir les arguments « gagnant-gagnant » en faveur de la « croissance intelligente », souvent mis en avant pour soutenir un développement urbain favorable à une concentration et une densité de plus en plus fortes. Les constatations présentées dans le présent document font apparaître que ces politiques ne présentent pas que des avantages en termes de bien-être, et que leur mise en oeuvre profitera à certains individus au détriment des autres. Si les politiques en faveur d’une haute densité urbaine peuvent avoir un impact positif en réduisant les externalités environnementales à l’échelle locale et mondiale, nombre de leurs avantages sont différés dans le temps et ne profiteront sans doute en grande partie qu’aux générations futures. L’un des enseignements essentiels à tirer de cette étude tient au fait que l’on pourrait améliorer l’équité des politiques urbaines en offrant une compensation aux individus lésés par ces mesures. L’une des méthodes les plus simples consisterait à équilibrer les incitations pécuniaires en faveur d’une croissance intelligente en introduisant des dispositifs compensatoires tels que des subventions, des taxes ou des redevances dans d’autres domaines. Ce n’est qu’un exemple parmi tout un éventail de mesures possibles. Enfin, la conclusion principale à tirer sur le plan de l’action publique consiste à dire que les mesures en faveur d’une croissance intelligente devraient comporter une analyse des effets redistributifs ainsi que des recommandations pour faire face aux problèmes d’inégalités lors de leur cadrage et de leur mise en oeuvre.
R13|Accuracy and efficiency in simulating equilibrium land-use patterns for self-organizing cities|Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg (L&RH) (2002, Econometrica, 70: 1445–1476) and Fujita and Ogawa (F&O) (1982, Regional Science and Urban Economics, 12: 161–196, 1989, Environment and Planning A, 21: 363–374) develop urban models in which economic activity self-organizes due to spillovers in production. However, F&O (1982, Regional Science and Urban Economics, 12: 161–196, 1989, Environment and Planning A, 21: 363–374) show that rents and employment density are flat or falling as the city center is approached, while in the simulations of L&RH (2002, Econometrica, 70: 1445–1476), rents rise at an increasing rate toward the center suggesting a concentration of employment near the center. For the Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg model, we prove that land rents and density must be flat or falling near the center. We explain how using a polar coordinate system when approximating a two-dimensional integral can create systematic imprecision in their simulations, and then present revised simulations. The proofs and simulations suggest that in urban models where economic activity self-organizes firms do not unduly cluster at the center of a central business district even in monocentric equilibria.
R13|Goods Prices and Availability in Cities|This article uses detailed barcode data on purchase transactions by households in 49 U.S. cities to calculate the first theoretically founded urban price index. In doing so, we overcome a large number of problems that have plagued spatial price index measurement. We identify two important sources of bias. Heterogeneity bias arises from comparing different goods in different locations, and variety bias arises from not correcting for the fact that some goods are unavailable in some locations. Eliminating heterogeneity bias causes 97% of the variance in the price level of food products across cities to disappear relative to a conventional index. Eliminating both biases reverses the common finding that prices tend to be higher in larger cities. Instead, we find that price level for food products falls with city size.
R13|Impact assessment of national and regional policies using the Philippine Regional General Equilibrium model|For the Philippines, a quantitative analysis is more useful for policy if it incorporates regional differences in welfare and economic structure. However, owing to the absence of key regional data, existing computable general equilibrium (cge) models offer limited analysis of regional effects or national impacts of region-specific interventions. This study formulates a regional cge model that overcomes these limitations. The applications of the model showed the following: (1) completion of the tariff reform program in agriculture will contract some import-competing sectors in lagging regions, but will improve welfare across all regions; (2) productivity growth in agriculture can more than offset these contractionary effects; (3) investments in marketing infrastructure promise significant pay-offs, though with a trade-off between the size and spread of welfare gains across regions; and (4) combining trade reform with marketing infrastructure investments slightly mitigates some of the contractionary effects from the former.
R13|Análisis del acoplamiento entre la riqueza y el desarrollo socioeconómico de las naciones<BR>[Analysis of the mismatch between wealth and socio-economic development of nations]|In this paper, the attributes and variables featuring the development of the World countries are reviewed. The relationship between wealth levels and some estimates using synthetic indices of social development is analyzed. With this aim, we firstly use the indicators estimated by UNDP. Afterwards, we turn to complementary estimators using UNDP methodology and multivariate statistical methods such us factor analysis. Results allow us to identify which countries do better (or worse) at turning economic growth into social development. They also contribute to detect the dimensions of development that are behind of changes in positions in several rankings.
R13|A Simple Model of Functional Specialization of Cities|Resorting to the method proposed by Matsuyama (2013), this paper develops a static equi- librium model of a system of cities in which ex ante identical locations specialize in stages of production different in the degree of dependence on routine and nonroutine local services sec- tors, the latter of which is tied to an agglomeration force due to monopolistic competition a ́ la Dixit and Stiglitz (1977). The model is simple in that the system is summarized by a second-order differential equation, which has a unique non-degenerate city size distribution with the comove- ment of income, population, factor prices, and urban diversity as observed for the U.S. cities. Two examples of use of the model are then illustrated: analyses of welfare gain from functional specialization and optimal income redistribution, the latter of which provides an important impli- cation of an increasing importance of interactive activities in a modern developed economy for income redistribution. Although extending the model makes the model analytically intractable, it is still characterized by a differential equation easily solved with a numerical method and thus useful for further analyses.
R13|Theoretical Approaches Of Endogenosu Regional Development|The territory affects how economic systems work, geographic proximity being a primary source of economic and social benefits. Generally speaking, territorial development is minimal determined by exogenous factors, while the main factors that influence the potential of local development are: endowment, resources, human and social capital, accessibility, infrastructure etc. These factors can be found in the regional growth theory which, by its scientific nature, is assimilated with macroeconomic theory. New economic geography emphasizes the importance of these factors, which focus on the lower production costs. At the same time, technological change and diffusion of technologies are considered endogenous variables which react to the market signals. Positive externalities are produced by using technological investment, employment and income redistribution in society. Research development, entrepreneurial skills, local production, innovation, knowledge, learning networks etc. are considered to be the engine of economic growth. In this paper, there are presented the main theoretical approaches of endogenous growth, which have contributed to understanding the implications and the effects of this process upon regional development.
R13|The Welfare and Employment Effects of Centralized Public Sector Wage Bargaining|In many countries, the government pays almost identical nominal wages to workers living in regions with notable economic disparities. By developing a two-region general equilibrium model with endogenous migration and search frictions in the labour market, I study the differences in terms of unemployment, real wages, and welfare between a regional wage bargaining process and a national one in the public sector. Adopting the latter makes residents in the poorer region better off and residents of the richer region worse off. Private sector employment decreases in the poorer region and it increases in the richer one. Under some conditions, the unemployment rate in the poorer region soars. Simulation results also show that a regional bargaining scheme may increase inequality.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R13|Harris And Wilson (1978) Model Revisited: The Spatial Period‐Doubling Cascade In An Urban Retail Model|Harris and Wilson (1978)'s retail location model is a pioneering work that utilizes the combination of the “fast” and “slow” dynamics to describe the space economy. This paper elucidates the model's previously unknown comparative static (bifurcation) properties in a many‐location setting beyond two. We show that the spatial structure's evolutionary path in line with decreasing transport costs exhibits a remarkable property, namely, a “spatial period‐doubling cascade.” Furthermore, we reveal strong linkages between the model and “new economic geography” models in terms of their model structures and bifurcation properties, offering a new theoretical perspective for understanding agglomeration behaviors in multilocation settings.
R13|The tourism seasonality in Romania|One of the problems which establishments managers must deal with is the seasonality from tourism. The seasonality causes may be natural (the seasons succession, climatic conditions), the variety and the cultural values attractiveness, the frequency of events (fairs, festivals, etc.) and economic and organisational (structure of the school year and university year, holidays, increasing the length of leisure time and its redistribution, habits, etc.). In this paper we pursued the seasonality calculation at the country level by calculating the coefficient of the seasonality of accommodation and overnight stays, resulting, for the period 2010-2013, for a total tourist structures an obvious seasonality. The magnitude of seasonal variation and their frequency of manifestation has consequences on the development of tourism and its efficiency, as well as other sectors of the economy, branches that tourism develops in interdependence.
R13|New trajectories of the Hungarian regional development: balanced and rush growth of territorial capital|The basic assumption of the paper is that numerous similarities exist between the patterns of economic growth and territorial capital growth. The rush economic growth and rush growth of territorial capital are compared empirically at Hungarian micro-regional level from 2004 until 2010. After normalizing the dataset, a very novel spatial econometric method is applied, called a penalty for bottleneck. The results show that the constant rush growth of territorial capital is as harmful as economic recession. On the other hand, the decrease of infrastructural and social capital caused the rush growth of territorial capital in this period. Moreover, the key findings of two case studies suggest that the balanced growth of territorial capital will be created by the falling social inequalities and increasing infrastructural capital.
R13|The Impact of Trade on Labor Market Dynamics|We develop a dynamic labor search model where production and consumption take place in spatially distinct labor markets with varying exposure to domestic and international trade. The model recognizes the role of labor mobility frictions, goods mobility frictions, geographic factors, and input-output linkages in determining equilibrium allocations. We show how to solve the equilibrium of the model without estimating productivities, reallocation frictions, or trade frictions, which are usually difficult to identify. We use the model to study the dynamic labor market outcomes of aggregate trade shocks. We calibrate the model to 38 countries, 50 U.S. states and 22 sectors and use the rise in China's import competition to quantify the aggregate and disaggregate employment and welfare effects on the U.S. economy. We find that China's import competition growth resulted in 0.6 percentage point reduction in the share of manufacturing employment, approximately 1 million jobs lost, or about 60% of the change in the manufacturing employment share not explained by a secular trend. Overall, China's shock increases U.S. welfare by 6.7% in the long-run and by 0.2% in the short-run with very heterogeneous effects across labor markets.
R13|Trade and the Spatial Distribution of Transport Infrastructure|This paper endogenizes the spatial distribution of infrastructure investment and transportation costs. Transportation costs between two addresses depend on cumulative infrastructure investment. In a continuous space setting with several independent countries or regions, consumers demand domestic and foreign goods, while central planners care only about welfare of their own constituencies. The equilibrium of the game between countries features under-investment and excessive spatial variation. The distribution of infrastructure is skewed towards central regions, rationalizing the non-linear trade-impeding role of distance in empirical gravity models and the so called border puzzle. We find that the endogenous allocation of infrastructure investment magnifies small discrete border frictions and creates `border regions' within countries. Privatizing infrastructure provision does not solve the problem. French data on transportation costs and an empirical gravity model for trade between US states motivate and corroborate our theory.
R13|The Impact of Gambling on Government Budget: A European Comparison with a Focus on Italy - L’impatto del gioco d’azzardo sul bilancio dello stato: un confronto europeo e analisi del contesto italiano|During the last decade most of the European countries started a process of liberalization of gambling with the aim of fighting against illegal gambling and collecting an increasing amount of tax revenues. In this paper, after providing a comparison on main gambling institutional and tax differences across a selection of European countries, we evaluate the impact of gambling on government budget in order to understand if gambling consumption cannibalizes other forms of consumption, making doubtful the net effect for the government revenues. Results of our empirical analysis show that the effect of gambling on state balance is very small and, in some cases, not significant. Considering also the relevant social costs connected to pathological gambling, this result is interesting for policy makers who often consider gambling revenues as a possible alternative source of tax revenues. - Nell’ultimo decennio, la maggior parte dei paesi Europei ha intrapreso un processo di progressiva liberalizzazione del mercato del gioco d’azzardo, allo scopo di disincentivare il gioco illegale e di ottenere un crescente ammontare di entrate erariali. In questo lavoro, dopo aver fornito un confronto sulle principali differenze istituzionali e fiscali all’interno dei paesi UE, sarà valutato l’impatto del gioco sul bilancio dello Stato al fine di comprendere se il gioco d’azzardo cannibalizzi altre forme di consumo rendendo dubbio l’effetto netto per lo Stato. I risultati mostrano come l’impatto del gioco d’azzardo sulle entrate erariali sia molto ridotto e in alcuni casi non significativo. Considerando gli elevati costi sociali connessi al gioco patologico questo risultato può essere di utilità per i decisori pubblici che spesso considerano il gioco d’azzardo come una possibile e importante fonte alternativa di entrate per le casse dello Stato.
R13|The Impact of Changing Lake Levels on Property Values: A Hedonic Model of Lake Thurmond|This study uses hedonic pricing models to examine the relationship between lake levels and property values for properties adjacent to Lake Thurmond. Lake Thurmond is located along the Savannah River Basin, bordering Georgia and South Carolina. Of the 1,030 properties from 2000-2009 for which data was reliable and available, 388 were lake front homes. The model of the effect of lake level on sales prices also includes home characteristics, home condition variables, lake attributes, and macroeconomic control variables. Results reveal a statistically significant change in sales price when the lake is closer to full pool. Results confirm that declining Lake Thurmond water levels have an impact on real estate values within some ranges below full pool. As climate variability places increasing pressure on communities, future research would benefit from further exploration into the relationship between economic activity and changing lake levels.

R13|Scenarios for regionalization: analysis on Romania’s population using Onicescu informational statistics|Regionalization is an important topic in Romania, as it is considered that it would help to obtain easy access to European funding and it would stimulate economic development. In order to meet this purpose, it is necessary to find the optimal formula for reorganizing Romania’s territory. It was shown that the decision regarding regionalization needs to be taken considering many criteria. One of them is population. This paper aims to study the homogeneity of the Romanian regions’ population, regarding age, area of residence and gender. With the help of Onicescu informational statistics it was shown that regions are homogenous from the mentioned points of view. This led to the conclusion that the decision on regionalization can only be taken after considering other aspects as well.
R13|Scenarios for regionalization: analysis on Romania’s industry using Onicescu informational statistics|We have shown that in order to make a decision regarding the optimal formula for Romania’s regionalization it is necessary to consider more than one criteria. The aim of this paper is to study one of these criteria – the industrial sector. Using instruments provided by Onicescu’s informational statistics we analyze the homogeneity of the Romanian regions regarding two variables, the industrial production index and the turnover value index in industry. We find out that from this point of view regions are not homogeneous, which leads to the conclusion that industry is an aspect that can be considered when deciding on regionalization.
R13|The Economic Case for Further Fiscal Decentralisation to Scotland: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives|This paper examines the background to calls for further fiscal decentralisation in Scotland in the light of theories of fiscal federalism. In particular, it examines whether spatial differences in preferences, which are central to â€˜first generationâ€™ theories of fiscal federalism can be argued to play a central role in the case for granting Scotland further tax and spending powers. â€˜Second generationâ€™ theories of fiscal federalism draw attention to the political economy of allocating tax powers to different levels of government. Some of the authors in this strand of theory argue that the case for allocating tax powers to subnational governments can be made in terms of â€˜accountabilityâ€™ â€“ the notion that local politicians can be better held to account for the outcomes of policy actions. Our empirical analysis suggests that there is no clear difference in preferences between Scotland and the rest of the UK along a number of key political dimensions. However, the Scottish parliament enjoys substantially higher levels of trust among the Scottish electorate than does the UK parliament.
R13|Unaffordable housing and local employment growth: Evidence from California municipalities|It is widely believed that unaffordable housing could drive businesses away and thus impede job growth. However, there is little evidence to support this view. This paper presents a simple model to clarify how housing affordability is linked to employment growth and why unaffordable housing could negatively affect employment growth. The paper then investigates this effect empirically using data on California municipalities. For various reasons, a simple correlation between unaffordable housing and employment growth cannot be interpreted as causal. Several empirical strategies are employed to identify the causal effect of unaffordable housing on employment growth. The estimation results provide consistent evidence that unaffordable housing indeed slows local employment growth.
R13|Regional Analysis of Domestic Integration in Egypt|We develop an interregional computable general equilibrium model to help assess the ex ante impact of transportation infrastructure policies in Egypt. The model is integrated with a GIS network. We illustrate the analytical capabilities of the model by looking at the domestic integration of the country. Improvements of transportation costs among Egyptian governorates and of their links to the broader world economy are considered in stylized simulations. The results provide quantitative and qualitative insights (general equilibrium effects) into trade-offs commonly faced by policy makers when dealing with transportation infrastructure projects in a spatial context. In the case of Egypt, there seems to be an important trade-off between efficiency and regional equity: projects that produce potential higher impacts on national GDP also tend to contribute more to regional concentration.
R13|Linking Hawaii’s Islands with wind energy|This study assesses the economic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions impacts of a proposed 400-MW wind farm (Big Wind) in Hawaii. Due to its island setting, this project is a hybrid between onshore and offshore wind development. An undersea cable would carry the power from Maui County, which has high-quality wind areas, to the population center of Oahu, which has fewer sites for wind power. The project is additionally motivated by Hawaii’s high electricity rates, which are nearly three times the national average, and a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) mandating that 40 % of the State’s electricity sales be met through renewable sources by the year 2030. Using an economy-wide computable general equilibrium model coupled with a fully dynamic optimization model for the electric sector, we find that the 400- MW wind project increases gross state product by $2.2 billion (in net present value) and average annual per capita income by $60 per year. Although there are potentially near-term welfare losses if there are capital cost overruns, fuel costs are a dominant factor in determining the cost-effectiveness of the project. However, without upgrades to Hawaii’s grid and/or its operations, there is a trade-off between investment in wind energy projects and solar PV. If higher levels of intermittent resources cannot be integrated into the system, higher-cost biofuels serve a more prominent role in meeting the RPS. Without upgrades, wind and solar PV generation are restricted, and hence, reduction in GHG emissions in excess of those present without the Big Wind project is negligible. With upgrades, the project is estimated to reduce GHG emissions by an additional $$\hbox {12 MMTCO}_{2}$$ 12 MMTCO 2 from 2020 to 2040. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
R13|Agglomeration, search frictions and growth of cities in developing economies|We study agglomeration economies from a dynamic search-matching perspective to account for the growth of cities in developing economies. Agglomeration economies are not only the cause but also the consequence of migratory inflows. Without frictions, however, agglomeration economies as a labor-pull factor will attract workers instantaneously to a region, which is inconsistent with the data. We argue that agglomeration benefits combined with search and additional frictions (e.g., fixed costs and imperfect recognition of the benefits) can generate a transitory endogenous growth path that is consistent with the set of empirical regularities observed over the economic development process: gradual rural-to-urban migration and the resulting urban concentration, productivity improvement, urban unemployment, and wage and unemployment gaps across regions, which diminish with economic development. We also characterize optimal urbanization and draw some policy implications including the necessity of regulating urban concentration. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
