O11|Public goods institutions, human capital, and growth: evidence from German history|What are the origins and consequences of the state as a provider of public goods? We study public goods provision established through new laws in German cities during the 1500s. Cities that adopted the laws subsequently began to differentially produce and attract human capital and to grow faster. Legal change occurred where ideological competition introduced by the Protestant Reformation interacted with local politics. We study plagues that shifted local politics in a narrow period as sources of exogenous variation in public goods institutions, and find support for a causal interpretation of the relationship between legal change, human capital, and growth.
O11|Labor shares in the EU - sectoral effects and the role of relative prices|The paper studies the labor share among countries of the European Union, with a particular attention to newer member states of Central and Eastern Europe (CEEU). After discussing methodological issues in the computation of the labor share, we present various stylized facts at the country level, and also for broad sectors within the aggregate economy. We find that CEEU countries typically have lower labor shares, both in the aggregate and at the sectoral level. Structural change, while quite pronounced among the CEEU economies, plays only a minor role in the evolution of the labor share. The exception is agriculture, which for some countries have a sizable impact on the level and dynamics of the labor share - partly because of important measurement problems. We also document links between productivity, the relative prices of consumption and investment, and the labor share. In particular, we find that a significant part of the difference in conventionally measured labor shares between the more developed EU countries and less developed CEEU countries can be attributed to differences in relative prices. We discuss possible explanations, and show that given reasonable assumptions, a simple two-sector model is able to account for the main findings.
O11|Beyond Miracle and Malaise: Social Capability in Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal during the Development Era 1930-1980|This paper investigates the outcome of the efforts to economically catch up during the so-called development era in French speaking West Africa. An attempt is made to measure and discuss key elements of social capability over the period 1930-1980 in Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal following Moses Abramovitz' interpretation of social capability. The paper distinguishes between four elements of social capability: degree of structural transformation, social and economic inclusion, the state's autonomy and its accountability. We find that there was significant but uneven progress in social capability in both countries during the development era. Despite their differences in economic performance both countries confronted fundamental shared challenges. Most notably, our analysis highlights how persistent lack of broad-based access to economic opportunities played a significant role in disrupting sustained economic and social progress in the two countries. This gives an opportunity to reflect on similarities and differences between the development era and the recent African growth phase.
O11|Ratio Working Paper No. 317: China’s Wind Power Development – An Anatomy of Mishaps|China has in recent decades expanded its wind power generation capacity and become the world leader. Still, despite robust government support, wind power in China is obstructed by various barriers (e.g. quality deficiencies, inability to export, missing grid connections, and permit delays from central government for grid construction etc.). This paper synthesises the literature that has discovered weaknesses in the Chinese wind power development and suggests improvements. One energy policy relevant observation is that when the Chinese government sets command-and-control construction targets over new installed capacity, actors delivered to target – but with several power plants without grid connectivity and severe quality problems. The article contributes to the academic debate over the role of policy making in renewable energy development and argues that China should improve their incentive structure and coordination of regulations.
O11|Childlessness and Economic Development: A Survey|This paper provides an introduction to the analysis of childlessness, first by describing the stylized facts and the relevant literature, and then by proposing a theoretical framework. We show that both poverty-driven childlessness and opportunity-driven childlessness matter and are essential to a thorough understanding of childlessness as a socioeconomic phenomenon.
O11|Education and Childlessness in India|In a developing setting like India, women have started their long way to emancipation both at the family and societal levels. In this context, we study what may be perceived as a key sign of emancipation regarding marriage and motherhood: childlessness. Using micro-level regressions, we show that the probability of a woman ending her reproductive life without children exhibits a U-shaped relationship with her educational attainment. This is indicative of the fact that poverty and sterility are not the sole determinants of childlessness, but that better economic opportunities and empowerment within couples also matter. This result is robust to the introduction of important control variables such as the development level of the state where women live, the husband’s education, age at marriage, religion, and caste. India seems to be joining a list of countries where adjustments to childlessness are much more than simple responses to boom-andbust poverty.
O11|Macroeconomic Consequences of Tariffs|We study the macroeconomic consequences of tariffs. We estimate impulse response functions from local projections using a panel of annual data that spans 151 countries over 1963-2014. We find that tariff increases lead, in the medium term, to economically and statistically significant declines in domestic output and productivity. Tariff increases also result in more unemployment, higher inequality, and real exchange rate appreciation, but only small effects on the trade balance. The effects on output and productivity tend to be magnified when tariffs rise during expansions, for advanced economies, and when tariffs go up, not down. Our results are robust to a large number of perturbations to our methodology, and we complement our analysis with industry-level data.
O11|What Explains the Volatility of India's Catch-up Growth?|Indian post reform growth rates have been higher but more volatile compared to transition periods forother comparable countries. The reasons are aggravation of shocks due to unaddressed criticalbottlenecks together with pro-cyclical macroeconomic policy that compressed aggregate demand.Reform is required to relieve constraints, but traditional reforms may be neither appropriate norachievable. Feasible reforms are discussed. Since diversity and resilience has increased and someconstraints have eased, the paper argues sustained high growth is reachable with the relevant policy support.
O11|Let the Data Speak? On the Importance of Theory-Based Instrumental Variable Estimations|In absence of randomized controlled experiments, identification is often aimed via instrumental variable (IV) strategies, typically two-stage least squares estimations. According to Bayes’ rule, however, under a low ex ante probability that a hypothesis is true (e.g. that an excluded instrument is partially correlated with an endogenous regressor), the interpretation of the estimation results may be fundamentally flawed. This paper argues that rigorous theoretical reasoning is key to design credible identification strategies, aforemost finding candidates for valid instruments. We discuss prominent IV analyses from the macro-development literature to illustrate the potential benefit of structurally derived IV approaches.
O11|Monetary Policy, Growth and Employment in Developing Areas: A Review of the Literature|"In this paper we review the literature on the impact that monetary policy has on growth and employment in developing countries. Much of the literature focusses on the impact of monetary policy on inflation levels and inflation volatility, and sometimes on output (GDP) levels and volatility of output. This survey of the literature on Monetary policy and growth shows that money plays a small role in developing countries and that monetary policy is not a very important influence on growth but may have some impact on inflation. Although there is much discussion about the merits of keeping inflation levels and volatility low, there is very little literature on studying the impact of low rates of steady inflation on the levels of private investment and technological change and hence on economic growth and on employment. There is very little research about the direct links between monetary policy and employment. The impact of growth on employment depends on what are the main drivers of economic growth and the initial state of the economy. Although growth may lead to increasing employment (formal and informal) there is little evidence showing that growth leads to an increase in ""decent employment""."
O11|Youth Labour Markets in Developing and Developed Countries: The Role of the Sectoral Composition of Production|"In this paper we explore the role of the sectoral composition of gross domestic product (GDP) in explaining the behaviour of youth labour markets. We provide a comparison of the behaviour of youth unemployment rates, employment-population rates, and labour force participation rates between developing countries and developed (rich) countries. In developing countries, open unemployment is less of a problem: the major problem faced by young people is employment in the informal sector that is poorly paid, intermittent, and insecure. A major part of employment in developing countries consists of ""vulnerable employment"". After a brief review of the literature, the paper uses panel data to estimate equations for unemployment rates, employment-population rates, and labour force participation rates for youths. We find that the sectoral composition of production and aggregate demand are important in explaining the behaviour of youth labour markets."
O11|A structural analysis of the U.S. financial economy|The Flow-of-Funds Accounts of the Unites States have been published on a quarterly basis since 1945 up to the present time. In this paper, we will construct ‘sector×sector’ Stone and Klein-formula asset-liability matrices fully exploiting the huge accumulation of data. It allows us to trace the changes in the roles of the institutional sectors over the years by application of useful input-output analytical tools, such as triangulation and dispersion indices. Although there is not too much change in the characteristics of non- financial sectors, the roles of financial institutions have been changing as the financial market develops and the deregulation advances.
O11|Does system instability harm development? A comparative empirical study of the long run|The paper looks at the effect of instability of political and economic institutions, using the Polity and the Fraser indices to characterize the two dimensions of society. The indices are used to derive three measures of instability: VP and VF are the average numerical annual change in each index, and ZP is the fraction of years under anarchy. All three have a negative correlation to growth. Two main theories are considered: One is the long-run transition-link: High growth in low- and middle-income countries gives a faster transition and hereby more system instability. The second is the short-run investment link: System instability gives an uncertain and unpredictable environment that harms investment, and hence growth. The combination of the two links is a main reason why the potential high growth of less developed countries is so difficult to achieve.
O11|Foreign aid, instability and governance in Africa|This study contributes to the attendant literature by bundling governance dynamics and focusing on foreign aid instability instead of foreign aid. We assess the role of foreign aid instability on governance dynamics in fifty three African countries for the period 1996-2010. An autoregressive endogeneity-robust Generalized Method of Moments is employed. Instabilities are measured in terms of variance of the errors and standard deviations. Three main aid indicators are used, namely: total aid, aid from multilateral donors and bilateral aid. Principal Component Analysis is used to bundle governance indicators, namely: political governance (voice & accountability and political stability/no violence), economic governance (regulation quality and government effectiveness), institutional governance (rule of law and corruption-control) and general governance (political, economic and institutional governance). Our findings show that foreign aid instability increases governance standards, especially political and general governance. Policy implications are discussed.
O11|Transfer Pricing and Corporate Social Responsibility: Arguments, Views and Agenda|The central thesis of the paper is that Multinational Companies (MNC) should invest in the use of â€œsoftâ€ methods (socially responsible behavior) to mitigate costs in society accrued due to use of â€œhardcoreâ€ tax evasion tactics (Transfer mispricing) to maximize profits from operations in developing countries and/or countries with weak or inefficient tax laws and tax collection institutions. Therefore, we articulate the argument of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as an indirect compensation for transfer mispricing. Our aim is not to present CSR as solution to transfer mispricing. An analytical approach is based on a content analysis of the existing literature with emphasis on a case study. We first discuss the dark side of transfer pricing (TP), next we present the link between TP and poverty and finally we advance arguments for CSR as a compensation for transfer mispricing. While acknowledging that TP is a legal accounting practice, we argue that in light of its poverty and underdevelopment externalities, the practice per se should be a strong defence for CSR because it is also associated with schemes that deprive developing countries of the capital essential for investment in health, education and development programmes.
O11|Sustaining cultural tourism through higher female participation in Nigeria: the role of corporate social responsibility in oil host communities|This paper adds to the gender discourse in sustainable African tourism development from the corporate social responsibility (CSR) perspective. Specifically, we examine the impact of CSR on the development of rural women in cultural tourism. A total of 600 rural women were sampled across the Niger Delta. Results from the use of a logit model indicate a significant relationship between CSR and cultural tourism development in oil host communities in Nigeria. This implies that CSR of a multinational oil company (MOC) is a critical factor for sustaining cultural tourism. The findings suggest increased female participation in General Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) interventions of MOC and the need to pay close attention to which extent the participation of rural women in the GMoU projects may be limited by cultural and traditional obstacles.
O11|A Survey on the Washington Consensus and the Beijing Model: Reconciling Development Perspectives|Reconciling the two dominant development models of the Washington Consensus (WC) and Beijing Model (BM) remains a critical challenge in the literature. The challenge is even more demanding when emerging development paradigms like the Liberal Institutional Pluralism (LIP) and New Structural Economics (NSE) schools have to be integrated. While the latter has recognized both State and market failures but failed to provide a unified theory, the former has left the challenging concern of how institutional diversity matter in the development process. We synthesize perspectives from recently published papers on development and Sino-African relations in order to present the relevance of both the WC and BM in the long-term and short-run, respectively. While the paper postulates for a unified theory by reconciling the WC and the BM to complement the NSE, it at the same time presents a case for economic rights and political rights as short-run and long-run development priorities respectively. By attempting to reconcile the WC with the BM, the study contributes at the same to macroeconomic NSE literature of unifying a development theory and to the LIP literature on institutional preferences with stages of development. Hence, the proposed reconciliation takes into account the structural and institutional realities of nations at different stages of the process of development.
O11|El proceso de cambio estructural de la economía española desde una perspectiva histórica|The historical experience and the economic literature show that the process of structural change of the economies towards more advanced stages of development is associated to a particular pattern in the evolution of the sectorial composition of economic activity. In a first stage, the share in manufacturing increases while the share in agriculture decreases. In a second stage, the share in manufacturing starts decreasing, and the share in services starts increasing. This work presents a brief overview of the available empirical evidence about this process of structural change at international level, highlighting the case of the Spanish economy. As a result of the rapid process of structural change during the last four decades, the productive structure of the Spanish economy has converged towards that of the European countries, with higher shares in services and manufacturing, and a lower share in agriculture. Beyond the impact of cyclical fluctuations, we can expect increases in the services share t the expense of manufacturing and agriculture share. According to the literature, these patterns can be related with demand forces (citizen’s preferences), supply forces (different trends in sectorial productivity), or a combination of both due to the openness to international trade, which can accelerate the process. Therefore, a deep investigation of the causes of this phenomenon of structural change in the Spanish case is essential inasmuch the future development of the process will determine long-run economic growth.
O11|Contracts, Firm Dynamics and Aggregate Productivity|We construct a framework of firm dynamics to evaluate the impact of the enforcement of contracts between final goods producers and their intermediate goods suppliers on firm life-cycle growth, technology accumulation and aggre-gate productivity. We build upon the tractable contracts model of Acemoglu et al. (2007), where the final goods firm chooses technology in contractible activi- ties conducted by suppliers of intermediate inputs. Suppliers select investments in noncontractible activities, anticipating the pay offs of a bargaining game with the producer of the final goods. We show that contractual incompleteness im-plies a wedge on profits for producers of final goods, potentially dependent on the level of technology of the firm, which disincentives technology accumulation at the firm level in our dynamic model. We evaluate this mechanism in general equilibrium to analyze its quantitative implications. Our model accounts for differences in output per worker of up to 33 percent across economies with complete and incomplete contracts. The impact on firm life-cycle growth, the age and size distribution of firms is quantitatively significant.
O11|Digital vulnerability and performance of firms in developing countries|This paper provides evidence of large positive effects of Internet use on local firm performance, using a sample of some 30,000 firms from 38 developing and transition countries. We adopt an IV approach emphasizing firm’s digital vulnerability to seismic shocks upon the telecommunications submarine cable network, and find that a 10% increase in Internet incidence raises by 36% their total annual sales, by 26% sales per worker, by 12% the number of permanent workers. Contrary to other studies on the effect of ICT adoption on trade, we do not find significant evidence on firms’ exports. A greater use of Internet by manufactures is also found to increase their number of production (unskilled) workers in a larger extent than non-production workers, which nuances recent evidence on a skilled-biased digital revolution. The concern for omitted variable bias, reverse causality or measurement error is lowered by proceeding to a wide range of restrictions upon the sample composition and the instrument set calibration, and by controlling for location, sector, year, country-by-year fixed effects.
O11|How does Caste Affect Entrepreneurship? Birth vs Worth|This paper examines the relative importance of the caste system in explaining the resource misallocation in India and quantifies its impact on aggregate productivity. I document that the historically disadvantaged castes (LC) are less likely to enter entrepreneurship even though they are more productive on average. At the intensive margin, the LC entrepreneurs are less capital-intensive but have higher marginal revenue product of capital relative to high castes. In a quantitative model of entrepreneurship, I find that the LC face higher entry cost and stricter financial constraints and that such asymmetries reduce aggregate TFP by 2.54% and output by 6%.
O11|The impact of financial development on income inequality: A quantile regression approach|In a panel of 121 countries, the impact of financial development on income inequality appears to change with a country’s level of income. It promotes equality across inequality quantiles in upper-middle income countries, and it promotes inequality across inequality quantiles in low- and high-income countries.
O11|Real exchange rate misalignments in CEECs: have they hindered growth?|We study the impact of exchange rate misalignment on economic activity in nine Central and Eastern European (CEE) economies. Exchange rate misalignments are computed from country-specific long-run exchange rate relationships with determinants suggested by open macroeconomic models such as interest rate differentials or the Balassa-Samuelson effect. There was a clear reduction in misalignments, but this has been reversed to some extent after 2008. Exchange rate overvaluation has a negative impact on economic activity. The effect of misalignments on economic activity seems to be nonlinear, as overvaluation has a stronger effect than undervaluation. Other factors of economic activity, including institutions, also show nonlinear effects
O11|The gains from catch-up for China and the US: An empirical framework|As China becomes more closely entwined with the US, positive shocks in the US translate into positive outcomes for China, but the extent of gain for the US during the convergence process is less clear. We develop an empirical framework of two interacting open economies in which Chinese GDP per capita moves towards convergence and cointegration with the US, resulting in a time-varying structural VAR model. As a result, the impulse responses of the two countries to shocks are sensitive to the timing of the shock. The changing effects of US shocks are evident in the analysis, which shows that over the convergence process both the US and China unambiguously benefit from the catch-up process.
O11|Linking Aid to the Sustainable Development Goals – a machine learning approach|Official Development Assistance amounted USD 146.6 billions in 2017 but do we know how much of this aid contributed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? And to what SDG in particular? This paper present a new methodology using machine learning designed to link project-based flows to the Sustainable Development Goals. It provide first estimates of DAC and non-DAC donors’ aid contribution for the goal and show that similar analysis can be done at the recipient level and for other type of textual database such as private sector reports; opening wide array for policy analysis.The methodology presented in this working paper uses semantic analysis of the text description of each project present in the Creditor Reporting System (CRS).
O11|Costa Rica’s perspective on Total Official Support for Sustainable Development (TOSSD)|This Working Paper summarises the main findings and recommendations of the pilot study carried out in Costa Rica as part of the development of the total official support for sustainable development (TOSSD) measurement framework. The Paper includes first approximations of TOSSD flows to Costa Rica. These flows in 2016 amount to around USD 559 million of official development finance and USD 60 million of private finance mobilised through official development interventions. These first estimations were reached using OECD DAC statistics. However, these figures are likely to be largely underestimated owing to a lack of available information, particularly concerning official support to Costa Rica from the People’s Republic of China and other non-DAC providers. The pilot study also indicated that the government is able to access, collect, collate, analyse and use data on external financing to the country using national data, thanks to its institutional and IT systems. However, the legislative framework requires adjustment and there is scope for improving co‑ordination in order to avoid duplication of effort.
O11|A Keynes + Schumpeter model to explain development, speculation and crises|Recently, Dosi and his co-authors have developed a ‘Keynes+Schumpeter’ model which “endogenously generates self-sustained growth patterns together with persistent economic fluctuations ...”. The aim of this work is twofold. First, to show that the K+S model developed by Dosi and his co-authors does not allow to explain the instability that characterizes a capitalist economy. This limitation is due to the fact that the model overlooks some key elements of Schumpeter’s analysis. The second objective is to show that a solid K+S model can be built starting from the elements of Schumpeter’s theory neglected by Dosi and his co-authors.
O11|North-South Uneven Development and Income Distribution under the Balance of Payments Constraint|This study builds a North-South trade and uneven development model, and investigates the effects of changes in income distribution (the profit share) on economic growth rates of both countries. How a change in the profit share affects both countries' growth rates differs for the short-run equilibirum and the long-run equilibrium. For example, in the short-run equilibirum, an increase in the profit share of the North deteriorates the terms of trade of the South, and then, decreases the growth rate of the South. On the other hand, in the long-run equilibrium, an increase in the profit share of the North either increases or decreases the growth rate of the South through Thirlwall's law.
O11|Terms of Trade Effects of Productivity Shocks and Economic Development|This paper studies the terms of trade effects from unexpected economy-specific productivity increases in both developing and advanced economies using a panel vector autoregression model with interactive fixed effects and the “max-share” approach developed by Francis et al. (2014). First, we find that the terms of trade of developing economies do not deteriorate after unexpected productivity increases and display similar dynamics to those of advanced economies. Second, studying these shocks in a more detailed classification of developing economies shows that the terms of trade worsen following an unexpected productivity increase in the least developed economies, implying that economic underdevelopment can result in unexpected productivity increases causing a deterioration in the terms of trade. However, this adverse effect of productivity increases disappears in the developing economies with some success in moving up the ladder of economic development, as implied by our finding that the terms of trade of these economies improve after an unexpected productivity increase.
O11|What stunts economic growth and causes the poverty trap?|In spite of an identical initial condition, why are some parts of the world so rich and others so poor? To address this question, this paper constructs a simple theoretical model that incorporates human infrastructure and child labor The first part of the paper shows that the condition of bifurcation from an identical initial condition depends on the technology level. We also show that current dynamic trends highly depend on initial endowments and productivity. The second part of the paper examines the effect of development assistance in recipient countries. By analyzing two types of programs; the elimination of child labor and support to strengthen human infrastructure, we show that the former (latter) program is effective for middle- (low-) income countries.
O11|Effect of external debt on Nigerian Economy: Further evidences|The study sought further evidences on the effect of external debt on economic growth in Nigeria. Time series data on external debt stock, real gross domestic product, trade openness, and gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of GDP as well as data on inflation and exchange rates were obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Statistical Bulletin and World bank indicators. The study set out to test for both the long run and short run relationship as well as presenting further evidences on the relationship between external debt and economic growth. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Model was employed as a technique of estimation in the study and the results led a finding that the external debt contribute negatively to growth in Nigeria based on data from 1981 through 2016 which was in line with Ayadi and Ayadi(2008). The study recommended amongst others, the need for accountability in governance, good macroeconomic policy environment, proper acquisition and use of debt solely for productive reasons and the enhanced exportation of domestic products.
O11|Dette Publique Extérieure Et Croissance Économique En République Démocratique Du Congo (Rdc)<BR>[External Public Debt And Economic Growth In The Democratic Republic Of Congo (Drc)]|The purpose of this article is to determine the effect of external public debt on the economic growth of the Democratic Republic of Congo. To achieve this objective, we used the error-correction model (Engle and Granger, 1987), estimated by the Least Squares method over a period from 1981 to 2015. The results indicate a nonlinear relationship between external public debt and economic growth, as well as an optimal threshold of 22.5 % of GDP. The external public debt has a positive effect on the economic growth of the DRC for any debt below this threshold. Therefore, to sustainably promote economic growth in the DRC, the management of external public debt will need to focus on good governance.
O11|SMEs Sector: A Key Driver to the Egyptian Economic Development|The focus of this paper is the discussion of the competitiveness facing SMEs in the global business environment by examining the opportunities and supports from the government. The purpose of this paper is to review the experiences of some countries that have benefited greatly from SME development and have been able to achieve high economic growth rates. On the other hand, presented the problems facing the Egyptian economy in order to achieve rapid growth rates at the level of small and medium enterprises and finally propose the strategies that can contribute effectively to the development of these projects.
O11|Export structure and economic growth in a developing country: case of Cote d’Ivoire|The aim of this paper is to examine the interactions between export structure and economic growth in Côte d'Ivoire. To reach this goal, we used a modeling based on the ARDL Bounds test of Pesaran (2001). We arrive at the results on the export basket of Côte d'Ivoire and the index of diversification act negatively on the economic growth both in short and long term. But this diversification seems to be concentrated in some sectors. These results suggest a diversification in the export basket by including other sectors and also a structural transformation of the Ivorian economy.
O11|"Parameter variation in the ""log t"" convergence test"|"This paper estimates a local linear version of the model used in Phillips and Sul's (2007, 2009) ""log t"" convergence test. It documents the economically and statistically significant within-sample variation in the estimated value of the key parameter of that test when applied to data for 18 OECD countries during the 20th century. This variation suggests the substantial waxing and waning of the forces driving convergence, possibly due to low-frequency shocks and changes in the level economic integration."
O11|Structural changes in economic growth and well-being. The case of Italy's parabola|The controversies on the relationship (or `gradient') between GDP and subjective well-being oppose those who claim that the gradient is positive and stable around the world to those who argue that long-run trends of subjective well-being are flat despite economic growth. The possible existence of structural breaks of the gradient within the same country is a challenge to both views. By focusing on the case of Italy, we show that the long-run trends of GDP and of well-being turned from increasing to decreasing, and the gradient exhibits a rise through two structural breaks. Macro and micro analyses explain why the gradient changes, and we find evidence consistent with the `loss aversion' hypothesis. In addition, the gradient changed because the erosion of trust in others, the increase of financial dissatisfaction and worsened health hinder well-being independently from income.
O11|The Impact of Trade Openness, Foreign Direct Investment and Domestic Investment on Economic Growth: New Evidence from Asian Developing Countries|The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of openness, foreign investment inflows, and domestic investment on economic growth for the case of 24 Asian economies over the time span 2002-2017 through the use of the fixed and random effect models. Our empirical results pointed out that domestic investment positively influences economic growth. However, we found that foreign direct investment and exports are negatively affecting the growth path. Also, the population, imports, and final consumption expenditure have no real impact on economic growth. Due to the importance of the positive externalities linked to the trade openness and foreign direct investments inflow, in terms of technology transfer bias, financial capacities, human expertise, large markets size, and spillover effect added to the domestic capacities and the national investment, the pace of the phenomenal economic performance of the Asian economies is very well justified.
O11|Directed social economics : China's complicated growth story|The entire globe has, in varying measures, experienced the good and the bad impact of China’s growth story this past decade. China is hastening to project itself such that, it be viewed as the ‘global growth engine’. Whether duly or unduly, like secretly many a country would want to, China is rushing all out to replace USA from the foray and become the sole unparalleled global leader. The Chinese have already compromised with Russia, by signing a long-term contract for oil supply. China’s economic numbers and the trend displayed so far, reasonably indicates its hunger for growth. China is ambitious to grow vertically on the economic scale and horizontally on the geographic scale. This is what is likely to spell disaster for the world, especially for the democratic countries.
O11|Economic Complexity, Human Capital and Income Inequality: A Cross-Country Analysis|This paper investigates the relationship between economic complexity, a measure of economic structures, and income inequality. Using a cross-country OLS regression, we show that countries with economic structures geared toward complex products enjoy a lower level of inequality. Human capital is found to magnify this correlation. Different measures of human capital also have differentiated interaction effects. Concerns about the endogeneity bias of OLS estimates motivate us to estimate a dynamic panel data model, using a system GMM estimator. We find that an increase in economic complexity provokes higher inequality.
O11|Measuring Macroeconomic Uncertainty in Zimbabwe|What matters to economic decision-making is whether the economy has become more or less predictable. People and businesses use information around them to form judgements about what might happen in the future. The rise in uncertainty might be associated with increased concern about extreme events, skewed towards worries about bad or disastrous events. The study seeks to measure macroeconomic uncertainty in Zimbabwe, using stock market indices - industrial index and mining index - for the period 2010M1 to 2019M3. Prevalence of macroeconomic uncertainty has been traced from the stock market index trend and stock market returns volatility. The squared residuals of the GARCH(1,1) regression model proxied macroeconomic uncertainty levels. The prevalence of significant macroeconomic uncertainty has been observed, with some periods highly uncertain. The study linked periods of uncertainty to some known political, social and economic events to derive meaning. The study found that some political, social and economic events have a contributing effect on the level of macroeconomic uncertainty. Good events and policies are accompanied by low levels of uncertainty while bad events and controversial policies match with high levels of uncertainty. The study recommends that to create a good economic climate, to attract investment and boost confidence in the economy, policymakers should dwell on reducing macroeconomic uncertainty. Reducing macroeconomic uncertainty require policy consistency, policy consultations, less frequent policy changes, avoiding numerous policies, avoiding policy reversals, among other measures. The observed macroeconomic uncertainty affects proper economic decision-making and is not conducive for high levels of investment for local and international investors; companies may struggle to hire labor, and employees and corporates may delay spending and saving pattern distorted.
O11|The Impacts of Domestic and Foreign Direct Investments on Economic Growth: Fresh Evidence from Tunisia|This paper aims to analyze the impact of domestic investment and Foreign Direct Investment on economic growth in Tunisia during the period 1976–2017. This study is based on the Auto-Regressive Distributive Lags (ARDL) approach that is proposed by Pesaran et al (2001). Bound testing approaches to the analysis of level relationships. According to the results of the analysis, domestic investment and foreign direct investment have a negative effect on economic growth in the long run. However, in the short run, only domestic investment causes economic growth. The findings are important for Tunisian economic policy makers to undertake the effective policies that can promote and lead domestic and foreign investments to boost economic growth.
O11|Revisiting the finance-growth nexus: A socioeconomic approach|Despite the fact that financial development is recognised as a vital determinant of countries’ economic growth path, many empirical studies fail to further isolate the role of socioeconomic indicators on accelerating growth. This study attempts to fill this gap by examining the statistical significance and the behavior of several socioeconomic indicators on economic growth. We apply parametric (System GMM estimators) and semi-parametric techniques along the lines of Baltagi and Li (2002) on a panel data set of 19 EU countries over the period 1995-2017. We test for nonlinear effects on economic growth for three banking indicators (domestic credit, non-performing loans and banking capitalization). In contrast to the related literature, our findings provide sufficient evidence of nonlinear relationships between several aspects of financial development and economic growth. Our results imply significant policy implications for policy makers and regulators in their effort of balancing banking development with a resurgence in economic growth within the EU periphery.

Pour cela, l’article utilise une mesure de synchronicité et de similarité permettant d’analyser l’asymétrie des cycles.

En outre, la méthodologie utilisée permet de savoir comment l’asymétrie des cycles économiques varie période par période plutôt que d'être mesurée comme un seul coefficient de corrélation sur toute la période d'étude. Enfin, l’étude tient compte des changements au fur et à mesure que les pays maintiennent ou transforment leurs régimes monétaires. Les résultats montrent un faible degré de synchronicité et de similarité dans la zone. De plus, les résultats indiquent que l’entrée du Mali et de la Guinée-Bissau dans l’Union Economique et Monétaire Ouest Africaine (UEMOA) n’a pas accru leurs degrés de synchronisation et de similarité. Enfin, les résultats montrent que le Nigéria n’est pas responsable du faible degré de symétrie dans la zone.
O11|The dynamic causality between ESG and economic growth: Evidence from panel causality analysis|The relationship between Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance and economic growth is a controversial topic in economic literature. This paper applies the Granger causality test developed by Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) with an optimal lag length selection technique proposed by Han et al. (2017) to examine the causality relationship between ESG performance and economic growth for a set of 118 countries over the period 1999-2015. The empirical results show the presence of a bidirectional relationship between environmental and social performance and economic growth, while a unidirectional relationship from governance to growth for all countries. Unlike the clear overall pattern of the full sample results, the empirical evidence for different income groups of countries is mixed.
O11|Explaining Differences in Income Levels of Africa’s Largest Economies – A Development Accounting Perspective|Drawing upon the experience of Africa’s largest economies, this paper examines the phenomenon of income discrepancies in Africa and applies the combined methodologies of Development Accounting (DA) à la Caselli (2005) and Business Cycle Accounting (BCA) à la Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2007) in a standard neoclassical, small open economy model. Classified into 2 equal-numbered groups – G1 and G2 – based on output size and region of location, the economies comprise Sub-Saharan Africa’s top 3 economies (G1: Nigeria, South Africa and Angola), and North Africa’s top 3 economies (G2: Egypt, Algeria and Morocco). Distortions in production efficiency, labour and capital, collectively termed wedges, are calculated, and the extent, evolution and impact of the wedges are determined for the period 1990 to 2013. Empirical results show that although efficiency wedge plays an important role in explaining income differences, labour wedge and investment wedge are also important for understanding income differences in Africa and, by extension, bridging the gap.
O11|Who Gained from India’s Demonetization? Insights from Satellites and Surveys|On November 8, 2016, the Indian government abruptly demonetized 86% of its currency in circulation in an attempt to reduce black money, corruption, and counterfeiting. Yet, 99% of the currency was eventually returned to banks. We exploit large regional variations in deposit growth as a result of demonetization to study the medium-term effects of this policy. Using night-light data, we show that districts which experienced higher deposit growth during the demonetization period recorded higher levels of economic activity in the year and a half that followed. We estimate a one standard deviation increase in deposits is associated with a 5% increase in district GDP per capita. Further, districts with larger rural population, agricultural and non-agricultural informal labor shares also recorded an increase in nighttime light activity. The results are also supported by household-level surveys on income and expenditures.
O11|Economy of Kalimantan: a Snapshot|This chapter aims to give a snapshot of the economies in Kalimantan provinces. Salient factors such as sharing common border with North Kalimantan, Kalimantan as Sabah’s backdoor neighbor with huge market size of over 4 times than Sabah and the relocation of Indonesia’s capital from Jakarta to Kalimantan, have stimulated the interests of many analysts to research on the structure of Kalimantan’s economy in general.
O11|Economic growth and well-being beyond the Easterlin paradox|Recent studies suggest that economic growth and well-being can grow together in the long run in presence of generous social safety nets, increasing social capital and declining income inequality. We put these conditions to a test in an attempt to explain the absence of a relation between economic growth and well-being in Luxembourg. To this aim we apply an error correction model to a panel of 15 Western European countries, and we use the results to predict life satisfaction in Luxembourg between 1991 and 2015. We find that the flat trend of life satisfaction in Luxembourg is likely the result of four forces acting in opposite directions. This suggests that the available list of moderating conditions -- although not exhaustive -- is a promising starting point to design new policies to durably improve well-being.
O11|The Impact of Unemployment on Economic Growth in China|Economic growth which is considered as one of the best indicator of measuring the robustness of every economy is essential in understanding its relationship with unemployment which is an important macroeconomic indicator that reflects the incompetence of any economy to make full use of its human resources. Hence, a macro-economic secondary and time series data was extracted from the World Development Indicator (WDI) for the period of 1991-2018 in China. In conducting the econometric analysis of the study, both the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test and Phillips Perron Test were employed to test and confirm the stationary level of the variables of study; the Autoregressive Distributed Lagged (ARDL) cointegration and the ARDL Bounds test were employed to test for the short-run and the long-run cointegration of the variables of study since both variable were stationary at first difference I (1). The finding of the study reveals that there are negative short-run and a long-run relationship between unemployment and economic growth. However, Granger causality Test also reveals that both unemployment and economic growth do not impact each other.
O11|An Empirical Investigation on associated linkage between Human Development and ICT: A South Asian Perspective|In the wake of industrial revolution in the late 18th and 19th centuries, technology as a seminal force has impacted everything and its effects are much more beyond the pertinent human comprehension. Most of the studies use per capita GDP as a measure to map the economic well-being of any nation but it is a narrower indicator. Human development could be considered to be the key that acts as a binding force to absorb the technological driven advancements. Taking this perspective, we contemplate the emergent prerequisite of finding the association between human capital development and information & communication technology (ICT) framework. The current study attempts to analyze how advancement in ICT could promote human capital development with special reference to South Asian Region (SAR) over the period 2000-16 by employing panel fixed effects modeling. Where, social human capital is proxied by the Human Development Index (HDI) and the the ICT penetration is measured by the parameters like technological readiness, mobile cellular subscriptions, and internet penetration. This is supplemented by other key macroeconomic control variables like population growth, urbanization sprawl, etc. in order to obtain an umbrella view. In order to have an in-depth understanding, individual component level linkages of HDI such as per capita GDP, birth life expectancy and school enrollment rate with ICT and other macroeconomic demographic indicators are also tested separately.The empirical analysis results hint towards the strong positive associations of internet penetration, technological readiness, and mobile usage with the human development index. The overall results are found to be in sync with the key findings. Therefore, the study recommends a cohesive ecosystem that could amalgamate technological space with HDI in the contemporary framework. The study further concludes with the key policy implications.

O11|Threshold Effects of Inequality on Economic Growth in the US States: The Role of Human Capital to Physical Capital Ratio|Theory suggests that the effect of inequality on growth varies with the level of economic development, as captured by the ratio of human capital to physical capital. In particular, the effect is shown to be positive at lower levels of this ratio, and turns negative beyond a threshold in such models. Using a comprehensive panel of annual data for the 48 contiguous US states over the period 1948 to 2014, we find overwhelming evidence in support of this theory, unlike prior work on this topic. Hence, our paper highlights the importance of accurately measuring the process of economic development using data on human capital and physical capital, instead of using proxies that are not theoretically consistent. Understandably, if not done so, policymakers would end up undertaking incorrect decisions.
O11|Materialism and Economic Progress|Most empirical studies on the impact of materialism have focused on its effects at the micro-level, such as on individual wellbeing. This paper explores one of the macroeconomic impacts of materialism: its relationship with economic progress. A new conceptualization of materialism based on self-identity construction is offered and used to hypothesize that materialism drives economic progress by encouraging consumption and innovation. This analysis is tested using a survey item from the World Values Survey as an index for materialism. The empirical results, based on a short panel of data covering 74 nations and two periods, provide sufficient support to the conclusion that materialism can be a positive force for economic progress.
O11|Convergence, Financial Development, and Policy Analysis|We study the relationship among inflation, economic growth, and financial development in a Schumpeterian overlapping-generations model with credit constraints. In the baseline case money is super-neutral. When the financial development exceeds some critical level, the economy catches up and then converges to the growth rate of the world technology frontier. Otherwise, the economy converges to a poverty trap with a growth rate lower than the frontier and with inflation decreasing with the level of financial development. We then study efficient allocation and identify the sources of inefficiency in a market equilibrium. We show that a particular combination of monetary and fiscal policies can make a market equilibrium attain the efficient allocation.
O11|Multinational Expansion in Time and Space|This paper studies the expansion patterns of the multinational enterprise (MNE) in time and space. Using a long panel of US MNEs, we document that: MNE affiliates grow by exporting to new markets; the activities of MNE affiliates persist during the affiliate's life, usually starting with sales to their host market and eventually expanding to export markets; and MNE affiliates' entry into new locations does not depend on the location of preexisting affiliates. Informed by these facts, we develop a multi-country quantitative dynamic model of the MNE that features heterogeneity in firm-level productivity, persistent aggregate shocks, and a rich structure of costs that affect MNE expansion. Importantly, MNE affiliates can decouple their locations of production and sales, and endogenously choose to enter or exit the host and the export markets. We introduce a compound option formulation that allows us to capture in a tractable way the rich heterogeneity that is observed in the data and that is necessary for quantitative analysis. Using the calibrated model, our quantitative application to Brexit reveals that export platforms are important for understanding the reallocation of MNE activity in time and space, and that the nature of the frictions to MNE activities matters for aggregate firm dynamics.
O11|Economic growth and convergence during the transition to production using automation capital|This paper examines the implications of automation capital in a Solow growth model withtwo types of labour. We study the transition from standard production to production usingautomation capital which substitutes low-skilled workers. We assume that despite advancesin technology, AI and machine learning, certain tasks can be performed only by high-skilledlabour and are not automatable. We show that under these assumptions, automation capitaldoes not generate endogenous growth without technological progress. However, assumingpresence of technological progress augmenting both effective number of workers and effectivenumber of industrial robots, automation increases rate of long-run growth. We analyse asituation in which some countries do not use robots at all and other group of countries startsthe transition to the economy where industrial robots replace low-skilled labour. We showthat this has potential non-linear effects on?-convergence and that the model is consistentwith temporary divergence of incomes per capita. We derive a set of estimable equationsthat allows us to test the hypotheses in a Mankiw-Romer-Weil framework.
O11|Does Schooling Cause Structural Transformation?|We study how the global schooling increase during the 20th century affected structural transformation by changing the supply of agricultural labor. We develop an analytical model of frictional labor reallocation out of agriculture to infer changes in birth-cohort characteristics from observed data on agricultural employment. Bringing the model to microdata from 52 countries, we find that the increase in schooling was accompanied by a large shift of the labor force’s comparative advantage away from agriculture. We bring empirical evidence to suggest this relationship was causal. With fixed prices, the resulting decrease in the supply of agricultural workers can account for almost half of the observed reallocation out of agriculture. However, in general equilibrium, the net effect is ambiguous.
O11|Intellectual Property Protection and Foreign Direct Investment into Less Developed Economies in the post-TRIPs Period|In this paper we study the relationship between the strength of intellectual property (IP) protection that less developed countries provide and foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into these countries, in the post-TRIPs period 2004-2015. Our sample period is highly appropriate insofar as it comes after the ten year period that the developing countries were allowed for implementing IP reforms in accordance with the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement. Further, it is long enough to permit the modelling of a delayed FDI response to the IP reform stimulus. Our modelling strategy attempts to capture the heterogeneity of the impact of the IP reform on the FDI inflows by estimating a conditional difference-in-differences specification. Thus, we allow for the fact that the impact of IP reform can vary significantly across countries depending on the magnitude of intellectual property that they own for which they seek such protection, for that would indicate the importance that they attach to IP protection. Estimating a varying coefficient model, our results do not provide evidence of a statistically significant effect of IP reform on FDI inflows into less developed countries, nor do we find that the effect of such reform is significantly stronger for countries that own relatively larger amounts of intellectual property. These results hold contemporaneously as well as with lags. Instead, FDI inflows appear to be driven by market size and domestic investment climate variables. Disaggregating our sample into the sub-groups of developing countries and least developed countries, we find that our overall results for less developed countries are driven by the sub-group of developing countries.
O11|The Demographic Transition in a Unified Growth Modelof the English Economy|A dynamic stochastic unified growth model is estimated from English economy data for almost a millennium. At the core of the (seven) overlapping generations, rational expectations structure is household choice about target number and quality of children. The trends of births, deaths, population and, the real wage, are closely matched by the estimated model. In the 19th century English fertility transition, the model shows how the generalized child price relative to the child quality price rose. The rising opportunity cost of education was as decisive for the transition as the parental shift to child quality.
O11|Atividade econômica e inovação na indústria brasileira: uma análise com dados em painel (2010-2016)|The aim of the present work is to analyze the relationship between the level of economic activity and technological innovation in Brazilian industry from 2010 to 2016. The central hypothesis of the paper is that the greater the economic activity, the higher the positive impact on the innovation rate, through channels such as the increase in investments in fixed capital and the improvement in the financing conditions for innovation activities. The analysis is based on a database of the first six years of the survey called Innovation Survey in which it was possible to obtain a panel segmented by four blocks of industrial sectors. These data were analyzed by means of panel data regression model that reveals the temporal evolution of the relation between the level of industrial activity and the rate of innovation of firms. The main result suggests that the overcoming of the current crisis and the consequent recovery of economic activity are important elements for the increase of innovation rates in the Brazilian industry.
O11|The Out of Africa Hypothesis of Comparative Economic Development: Common Misconceptions|"""The importance of the prehistoric migration of anatomically modern humans from Africa for comparative economic development has been the focus of a vibrant research agenda in the past decade. This influential literature has attracted the attention of some scholars from other disciplines, and in light of existing methodological gaps across fields, has perhaps unsurprisingly generated some significant misconceptions. This article examines the critical views expressed by some scholars from other disciplines, and establishes that they are based on fundamental misunderstandings of the statistical methodology, the conceptual framework, and the scope of the analysis that characterize this influential literature.."
O11|Let the Data Speak? On the Importance of Theory-Based Instrumental Variable Estimations|In absence of randomized controlled experiments, identification is often aimed via instrumental variable (IV) strategies, typically two-stage least squares estimations. According to Bayes' rule, however, under a low ex ante probability that a hypothesis is true (e.g. that an excluded instrument is partially correlated with an endogenous regressor), the interpretation of the estimation results may be fundamentally flawed. This paper argues that rigorous theoretical reasoning is key to design credible identification strategies, aforemost finding candidates for valid instruments. We discuss prominent IV analyses from the macro-development literature to illustrate the potential benefit of structurally derived IV approaches.
O11|Pandemics, Places, and Populations: Evidence from the Black Death|The Black Death killed 40% of Europe's population between 1347-1352, making it one of the largest shocks in history. Despite its importance, little is known about its spatial effects and the effects of pandemics more generally. Using a novel dataset that provides information on spatial variation in Plague mortality at the city level, as well as various identification strategies, we explore the short-run and long-run impacts of the Black Death on city growth. On average, cities recovered their pre-Plague populations within two centuries. In addition, aggregate convergence masked heterogeneity in urban recovery. We show that both of these facts are consistent with a Malthusian model in which population returns to high-mortality locations endowed with more rural and urban fixed factors of production. Land suitability and natural and historical trade networks played a vital role in urban recovery. Our study highlights the role played by pandemics in determining both the sizes and placements of populations.
O11|Ideologically-charged terminology: austerity, fiscal consolidation, and sustainable governance|Scholars have been active in investigating causes and consequences of austerity policies. We examine how economists use the term “austerity” in scientific studies and measure austerity in empirical analyses. The sample includes around 3,500 journal articles published in the top 400 journals (RePEc ranking) over the period 1990-2018. The results show that the term austerity is often used in heterodox journals. Papers published in mainstream journals use the term “fiscal consolidation” instead. The term austerity is ambiguous: scholars use manifold definitions of austerity and the empirical measures identify different country-year observations as periods of austerity. We employ panel data for 34 OECD countries over the period 1960-2014 and examine how austerity is associated with economic growth. The results show that depending on how austerity is measured, inferences change. Strategic selection of austerity measures allows scholars to arrive at any desired results about the economic effects of austerity periods.
O11|Labour Markets, Trade and Technological Progress: A Meta-Study|Technological progress and trade potentially affect wages and employment. Technological progress can make jobs obsolete and trade can increase unemployment in import competing sectors. Empirical evidence suggests that both causes are important to explain recent labour market developments in many OECD countries. Both causes are often mentioned in tandem, but the relative contribution of each cause is less clear. This study presents a meta-analysis to shed light on the relative contribution of technological progress and trade in recent labour market developments and allows us to identify the winners and losers of automation and globalization. Using a sample of 77 studies and 1158 estimates, we find that both effects are important. Automation is beneficial at the firm level, and is more likely to displace low-skilled employment. Trade is more likely to benefit high-skilled employment and affects industry negatively. Somewhat surprisingly, given the consensus in the literature, automation has a positive effect for estimates considering the period before 1995, and trade a negative effect. We also find some evidence of publication biases.
O11|Automation, Economic Growth, and the Labor Share - A Comment on Prettner (2019) -|Prettner (2019) studies the implications of automation for economic growth and the labor share in a variant of the Solow-Swan model. The aggregate production function allows for two types of capital, traditional and automation capital. Traditional capital and labor are imperfect substitutes whereas automation capital and labor are perfect substitutes. In this paper, we point to a flaw in Prettner’s analysis that invalidates his main analytical and computational findings. In contrast to Prettner, we argue that both kinds of capital are perfect substitutes as stores of value, and, therefore, must earn the same rate of return in equilibrium. Our computational analysis shows that the model dramatically overestimates the actual decline in the US labor share over the last 50 years.
O11|International Capital Allocations and the Lucas Paradox Redux|This paper studies the marginal product of private capital (MPK) with new data and a new framework to obtain a better understanding of international capital allocations and the Lucas Paradox (LP). Our point of departure is three influential studies of MPK’s and, based on the most recently available data, the LP is either sustained, inverted, or rejected. We then introduce three improvements in measuring spot MPK’s, and the LP clearly reemerges. While these results are provocative, they may be misleading because they do not recognize the dynamics of the capital accumulation process toward steady-states. We develop and estimate a model that allows us to map spot MPK’s into steady-state MPK’s. The LP remains; the steady-state MPK’s for poor countries is 48% to 77% higher than for rich countries. Four policy implications follow from these estimates. First, there is a great deal of misallocated capital globally: 14% to 21% of the global capital stock. Second, this misallocation is primary due to the difference between country-specific steady-state MPK’s and the global MPK that would maximize world output. Third, the benefits of optimally reallocating capital and eliminating the LP are modest: 1.0% to 1.5% of global output or $873 to $1,309 billions of 2019 US dollars. Fourth, the estimates for both misallocation and reallocation depend crucially on the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. Our empirical work uncovered three new puzzles that have emerged beginning in 1990, 1) the MPK’s for both poor and rich countries have been rising sharply, 2) the gap has been widening, and 3) the steady-state MPK’s exceed the average spot-MPK’s. The later result is inconsistent with the Dynamic Inefficiency, Saving Glut, or Secular Stagnation hypotheses.
O11|Corruption and Economic Growth: New Empirical Evidence|The nexus between corruption and economic growth has been examined for a long time. Many empirical studies measured corruption by the reversed Transparency International’s Perception of Corruption Index (CPI) and ignored that the CPI was not comparable over time. The CPI is comparable over time since the year 2012. We employ new data for 175 countries over the period 2012-2018 and re-examine the nexus between corruption and economic growth. The cumulative long-run effect of corruption on growth is that real per capita GDP decreased by around 17% when the reversed CPI increased by one standard deviation. The effect of corruption on economic growth is especially pronounced in autocracies and transmits to growth by decreasing FDI and increasing inflation.
O11|Taxation and the Superrich|This paper addresses the modern optimal tax progressivity literature, which clarifies the key role of the behavioral response to taxation and accounts for the incomes of the superrich being qualitatively different than others. Some may be “superstars,” for whom small differences in talent are magnified into much larger earnings differences, while others may work in winner-take-all markets, such that their effort to climb the ladder of success reduces the returns to others. We stress that pivotal tax-rate elasticities are not structural parameters, and will be smaller the broader and less plastic is the tax base and the more effective is the enforcement of tax evasion. For this reason, normative analysis of tax rates should be accompanied by attention to the tax base, with special attention to capital gains, which comprise a large fraction of the taxable income of the superrich.
O11|Does development aid increase military expenditure?|The diversion of development aid to the recipient’s military may be one explanation why aid is often found to be ineffective in promoting economic growth and development. Previous studies have not derived the causal effects of development aid on military expenditure. Using a new instrumental variable strategy, we examine whether bilateral development aid increases military expenditure in recipient countries. The instrument is the interaction of donor government fractionalization and the probability of receiving aid. The dataset includes new data on military expenditure for 124 recipient countries over the 1975-2012 period. While development aid has a positive effect on military expenditure in the full sample, the effect vanishes when we exclude outliers. However, we find that aid provided by coordinated market economies increases military expenditure in the full sample of recipient countries, even after controlling for outliers. Coordinated market economies have been found to deliver more government-to-government aid, which has a higher risk of capture compared to aid delivered through non-state development actors.

The effect of corruption on economic growth is especially pronounced in autocracies and transmits to growth by decreasing FDI and increasing inflation.
O11|Factor reallocation and growth: what if there are labor saving innovations?|We claim that the standard methodology to study the effects of the reallocation of factors on growth is not adequate in the presence of biased innovations. Labor-saving innovations increase output per worker and may decrease the marginal productivity of labor. Therefore, a reallocation of labor from a sector with higher output per worker to a sector with lower output per worker may be productivity enhancing.
O11|Birth Rates, Factor Shares, and Growth|Increases in capital shares affect the marginal productivity of capital, stimulating capital accumulation. Can a decrease in labor shares reduce the supply of labor? We explore this question using a model of fertility inspired by Caldwell (1982) and Boldrin and Jones (2002). Individuals may transfer wealth to the future in two ways: by saving and by having children. Raising children has a cost in terms of current consumption but generates future income through intergenerational transfers. In this setting, a redistribution of income from labor to capital affects the return of savings and children in opposite ways and generates incentives for more savings and fewer children. Two pieces of evidence motivate our model. First, recent historical evidence shows that the increases in capital shares that preceded the Industrial Revolution coincided with falling birth rates. Second, for current developed economies, changes in labor shares correlate positively with changes in fertility rates, and negatively with changes in saving rates.
O11|Sectoral amd Skill Contributions to Labor Productivity in Asia|Using a decomposition approach on data collected by the Asian Productivity Organization (APO) as well as World Input-Output data, it shows that in most Asian economies the services sector makes the largest contribution to labor productivity. Furthermore, it finds evidence of a major reallocation of labor from agriculture directly to services, bypassing the manufacturing sector. This finding challenges the traditional view that countries in their economic development need to have their workforce employed first in manufacturing before switching to services. Lastly, the paper studies how different skill levels contribute to labor productivity growth. It finds that high-skilled workers have contributed most to overall labor productivity growth in developing Asia. In services, high-skilled workers have mainly driven labor productivity, indicating that upskilling and training are instrumental in services-led development.
O11|EDB Macroreview, April 2019. Kyrgyz Republic: trends and forecasts|After two years of economic recovery, GDP growth slowed to 3.5% in 2018, from 4.7% in 2017. The economic slowdown was caused by a decline of production at the Kumtor gold mine and stabilization of the growth rates in other sectors at near potential levels. Domestic demand in 2018 showed unstable growth, reflecting the volatility of households’ real incomes. A slowdown in lending and remittances inflows growth rates in 2018 compared to 2017, as well as deferred demand of the public sector, also constrained domestic demand. The deviation of inflation from the target during 2018 resulted from weak prices in the world food markets as well as from the high base effect in the vegetables and solid fuel segments. The current account deficit expanded as the negative goods and services balance widened, while the net inflow of current transfers remained virtually the same as in 2017. The state budget posted a deficit of 1.1% of GDP in 2018, down from 3.1% of GDP the year before. The decreased State budget deficit resulted from lower public spending and slightly higher budget revenues. The slower growth in budget revenues was due to lower grants received from other countries’ governments and international organizations, while tax revenue growth was unchanged. Public debt decreased in nominal terms, mainly on account of the debt to the Russian Federation being written off pursuant to an agreement between the countries. In May 2018, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic reduced its policy rate from 5.0% to 4.75% as inflation was low, and took a number of decisions concerning the width of the interest band during the year. In 2019, economic activity in the Kyrgyz Republic is projected to accelerate, largely on account of optimistic assessments of its gold production volumes and moderate expansion of public sector demand. In the medium term the economy is expected to grow steadily at near potential rates. The inflation trends will depend on the world food market. According to our assessment, world food prices will start recovering in the 1st half of 2019 and stabilize by early 2020, which, in turn, will shape the growth trajectory of the consumer price index in the Kyrgyz Republic.
O11|EDB Macroreview, April 2019. Republic of Armenia: trends and forecasts|For the second consecutive year, Armenia remains the fastest-growing EAEU economy. In 2018, it grew by 5.2% after 7.5% the year before. The main factors behind the slowdown in its economic activity were the more moderate growth of household consumption than in 2017 and a decline of consumption in the public sector. The EDB projects Armenian GDP growth to accelerate somewhat in 2019, assisted by increasing investment activity as the extraction industry gradually adapts to the new requirements, a recovery in agricultural output, and Government policy that supports investment, exports, and improving social conditions. In the medium term, GDP will trend towards its potential rate, that we estimate at some 5% per annum. During 2018, inflation remained below the 4% CBRA target; in December 2018 it was 1.8% YoY. The main factor behind inflation trends in 2018 was food price volatility after a lower harvest. According to our estimates, inflation will accelerate to 2.8% in 2019, driven by increasing domestic demand as wages and lending grow. By the end of 2021 inflation will approach the CBRA target (4%). Given the economic background, the CBRA did not change its refinancing rate (6%) in 2018 and thus maintained a stimulative monetary policy. Interest rates on loans and deposits decreased during the year. According to our base scenario projection, as inflation gradually accelerates and approaches the CBRA target level, the CBRA will begin a series of rate rises that we expect to have a neutral impact on economic growth and inflation. In 2018, amid economic activity growth, the government pursued a tight fiscal policy to maintain debt and fiscal sustainability. In the medium term, the focus of fiscal policy will remain the same.
O11|EDB Macroreview, April 2019. Republic of Belarus: trends and forecasts|In 2018, the Belarusian economy showed a high growth rate as it recovered after the recession in 2015–2016. Economic growth was supported by increasing consumer and investment activity as lending expanded, the population’s income grew, and the real sector’s economic sentiment improved. The economic growth rate in 2018 gradually slowed down as the monetary conditions’ stimulating effect decreased and the low base effect petered out. The EDB predicts Belarusian GDP to increase annually by 1.5–2% in the medium term in the absence of additional stimulation. The Belarusian ruble was highly volatile in 2018. The Belarusian currency was affected by aggravating geopolitical tension that caused the exchange rate of the Russian ruble and other EDB member countries’ currencies to fluctuate. In the medium term, the Belarusian ruble will devalue at a moderate rate as inflation in Belarus stays higher than in its main trade partner countries. Inflation in 2018 kept within the NB RB’s target range, managed by a balanced monetary policy. Yet, after reaching its historic minimum in June and July 2018, inflation began accelerating in the second semester as food and fuel price growth increased and inflation in the RF accelerated while consumer demand remained high. The buildup of inflationary pressure led the NB RB to suspend its refinancing rate reduction cycle in 2nd half of 2018. In 2019, inflation is expected to accelerate temporarily and perhaps exceed its end-of-year target level of 5%. Consumer price growth may be brought about by inflation increasing in the RF, gradual evaluation of the Belarusian ruble, and the persistent inflationary influence of wages. We predict this to be a temporary process, however, and in 2020 and 2021 inflation will be close to the NB RB’s targets. The IBC rate is expected to be in the 10–11% range, which is consistent with its neutral level. The Republic’s budget surplus expanded considerably in 2018 due to temporary factors, including commodity price growth and a high recovery growth rate in the national economy. The budget surplus reduced the country’s need to refinance its public debt. In the medium term, the budgetary and fiscal policy will remain focused on the improvement of fiscal and debt stability.
O11|EDB Macroreview, April 2019. Republic of Kazakhstan: trends and forecasts|In 2018, Kazakh GDP grew by 4.1%, supported by increased oil production and a favorable price situation in the world energy market. Revival of credit activity fostered expansion in consumer and investment demand. Separate sectors’ contribution to overall economic growth changed during the year. In the 1st half of 2018, the GDP increase was driven by high rates of growth in oil production and the manufacturing sectors. In the 2nd half of 2018, industry reduced its contribution to GDP growth while trade turnover and construction activity growth accelerated. Inflation was 5.3% YoY in 2018, within the National Bank’s target range (5–7%). The decrease in motor fuel prices after the upgrade of major oil refineries was completed, as well as the reduction in electricity and heat tariffs for households, did much to slow down inflation. As inflation slowed in 2018, the National Bank reduced its base interest rate repeatedly, to reach 9.25% at the end of the year (compared to 10.25% a year before). The Kazakh tenge exchange rate vs. the U.S. dollar and euro decreased in 2018. Trends in the Kazakh currency were in line with those of developing economies’ currencies, i. e. a weakening as the U. S. Federal Reserve System increased its rate and the world’s economic and political risks overall grew. Kazakhstan’s consolidated budget posted a surplus in 2018, the first time since 2015. The factors behind the budget improvement included the State’s increasing incomes amid a relatively favorable external environment and economic growth, as well as decreased public spending on reviving the banking system compared to 2017. In 2019, we expect economic growth to slow down to 3.3% as oil production declines due to planned oilfield repair works. Next year, we forecast GDP growth at 3.5%. Inflation in 2019–2021 is projected to be within the National Bank’s target range (4–6%) and to gradually approach its lower limit by the end of the projection period, as the interest rate on interbank loans in tenge is kept near its neutral level, which we estimate at 7.5–8%.
O11|EDB Macroreview, April 2019. Republic of Tajikistan: trends and forecasts|2018 saw the highest economic growth rate since 2014. GDP increased by 7.3% after 7.1% in 2017. As a result, the economy continued along its steady growth acceleration path, somewhat above the potential level. Investment and consumer activity was the key factor behind the growth acceleration in 2018. The State infrastructural development programs continue to support investment demand and lay the basis of economic growth. The revival of domestic demand in 2018 was partially the effect of households’ deferred demand as inflation reached a record low. In the 2nd half of 2018, inflation reached the target range of 7% (±2 pp); it was 5.4% at the end of the year. The inflation trends were shaped by the world food market, the base effect in the fruit and vegetables sector, and transport and electricity tariff policy. The current account deficit expanded as the negative goods and services balance widened, partially due to growing imports of machines and equipment for the implementation of large-scale infrastructural projects. The expansion of the State budget deficit in 2018 also resulted from growing public investment. The State budget’s expenditures on the development of energy sector infrastructure grew 2.2 fold compared to 2017. Public debt stabilized in 2018, largely because most of the external funding was raised in the form of grants. In early 2018, the NBT reduced its refinancing rate from 16.0% to 14.0%. However, due to unforeseen external shocks that increased the volatility of EDB member countries’ currencies, inflationary risks increased again, and the monetary authorities suspended their rate reduction round. The banking system is moving in the direction of recovery, but the indicators remain weak. In 2018 the credit portfolio stopped shrinking and increased by 2.0%. In the projection period, the economic growth rate is expected to stabilize near 7%. The investment drive will continue to support the economy. Consumer demand expansion will slow down somewhat as remittance inflow decelerates and the low inflation background’s favorable effect on household income peters out. Inflation will depend on the situation prevailing in the world food markets. World food prices are expected to start recovering in the 1st half of 2019, and by the beginning of 2020 their trend will stabilize, which in turn will impact the trajectory of consumer price growth in the RT.
O11|EDB Macroreview, April 2019. Russian Federation: trends and forecasts|In 2018, the Russian economy grew at its highest rate since 2012. Higher net exports were the main factor behind accelerated growth. Consumer and investment activity remained positive contributors to economic growth. We expect Russia’s GDP growth to slow temporarily, constrained by the increased tax load and the impact of the key rate increase in late 2018. Increased investment expenditures of the federal budget and gradual normalization of monetary policy from 2nd half of 2019 will foster a mid-term economic recovery to the potential rate, that we estimate at 2% per annum. The Russian ruble’s exchange rate became more volatile in 2018 amid exacerbated geopolitical tension. Harsher U. S. sanctions rhetoric caused greater capital outflow from the Russian economy, reflected in quicker weakening of the ruble. Barring additional shocks, we expect the Russian currency to strengthen over 2019 from the level of late 2018, in particular because return on Russian assets will remain high. Inflation accelerated in 2018, driven by a weakening ruble, faster growth of some food prices and price correction in advance of the VAT increase. The increase in inflation in 2nd half of 2018, accompanied by growing inflationary expectations, led the CB RF to raise its key rate twice, by 0.25 pp in September and December, to 7.75% at the end of 2018. We expect the acceleration of inflation to continue into the 1st half of 2019, mainly driven by the VAT increase. Starting in 2nd half of 2019, inflationary pressure will decrease gradually and allow inflation to return to its target level in 2020. As inflation slows, the key rate is expected to return to its neutral level, that we estimate at 6.5– 7%, in 2020. In 2018, the federal budget posted a surplus for the first time since 2011, assisted by a favorable commodity price background in most of 2018. The budget is expected to remain in surplus in the medium term, with oil prices staying above USD 60 per barrel. The budgetary policy focus will gradually move towards higher investment expenses in the coming years, with effects including a higher potential economic growth rate.
O11|EDB Special report 2019. Exchange rate pass-through effects on inflation in EDB Member Countries|This Special Report examines the pass-through effect of the exchange rate on inflation in member countries of the Eurasian Development Bank. Special attention is paid to assessing pass-through effect changes that occurred in recent years and to analyzing asymmetric and non-linear relationships between exchange rates and inflation in the region’s countries. The results obtained confirm the exchange rates’ significance for inflation movements in EDB economies. That said, in 2015-2018 the exchange rate’s pass-through effect on inflation decreased in magnitude in most of the States under review, possibly on account of the monetary and exchange rate policy reforms implemented – in particular, a switch to a more flexible exchange rate and more effective monetary policies. In a number of Eurasian Development Bank member countries, the pass-through was noted to have an asymmetric effect, with consumer prices being more responsive to weakening than to strengthening of their national currencies.
O11|Trends in FDI and its role in Development and Convergence|The empirical study is based on 138 countries (and territories) for which there are available comparable data regarding FDI at UNCTAD, FDI/MNE database (www.unctad.org/fdistatistics) for 2000-2017. In order to analyse the relations between FDI and GDP per capita and the socalled Real Convergence, usually evaluated only based on expressing GDP per capita in international dollars PPP (Purchasing Power Parity), data for the global economy (represented by the group of 138 countries and territories, as W138), are for the period 2000-2018 from World Bank, and for the period up to 2024 from IMFforecast (IMF Report,April 2019).
O11|Foreign Direct Investment Spillovers Within and Between Sectors: Evidence from a Developing Economy|With volatile global capital flows, the stability of FDI and its emergence as an important source of foreign capital for developing economies has renewed interest in its linkages with sustainable economic growth in developing countries. FDI is crucial as it influences production, employment, income, prices, imports, economic growth, balance of payments and the general welfare of the recipient country. Nigeria has attracted huge inflows of FDI over the last decade?from $1.14 billion in 2001 to $4.4 billion in 2016. Though FDI has been concentrated in the oil and gas sectors, the government is now seeking to channel it into the communication, manufacturing and financial services sectors.The broad objective of this study is to examine the spillover effect from oil FDI on the Nigerian economy: (i) is there positive micro linkage from the oil FDI on the domestic economy in Nigeria? (ii) are there positive spillover effects from oil FDI to domestic labor markets in Nigeria?We will trace which sectors/subsectors are recipients of these linkages. How have foreign oil multinationals helped the domestic firms in terms of technology transfer, and employment linkages? What are the linkages between the foreign oil companies and the domestic Petroleum Training Institute in terms of technology transfer on one hand and employment of the Institute?s graduates on other hand? Are the policies embarked upon to attract FDI and ensure its spillover to other sectors of the Nigerian economy sufficient to stimulate economic growth?
O11|Controlling as driving force at today?s dynamic changing companies|The task of controlling is to support the management with reports, forecasts and analyses in order to be able to take economically rational decisions. In today?s fast changing economic and information technological environment the management has to react rapidly. This means new challenges for controlling. Due to digitalization, even more real time data is available, can be stored and shared fast. This lead to a change of controlling processes. The focus of reports changed from analysing past figures to current and future trends. Controlling become the strategic early warning system of the companies. This changes the role of controllers, as it is transforming into business partners of management, and also new roles, like Data Scientist will turn up and new skills are needed. Controlling support management to take more adequate decisions, what secure the long-term survival of the company, so in an indirect way the transformation of controlling is a driving force of the companies at today?s dynamically changing environment.
O11|Patterns of Economic Growth in Dependent Market Economies: The Case of Central Eastern Europe|The development pattern of certain Central Eastern European Countries has always represented a special case within Europe?s overall economic growth as well as social progress. Current paper examines the main growth tendencies of the so-called dependent market economies (DMEs) and also provides an extended definition for latter model. In frames of the comparative analysis, the research is based on investigating the relationship between the presence and activity of TNCs and MNCs through their FDI inflow contribution to the destination countries, the performance of the main investor economies and trading countries and also the GDP growth of the DMEs. According to the evidence, in certain countries ? e.g. Hungary ? a dual economic structure has emerged strongly relying on the multinational sector successfully being integrated into the world economy and a weak domestic sector that is in most cases, not capable of selling its goods and services in a global market. The lack of high value added production and the constant reliance on cheap labour force may further deepen the diverging tendency compared to the developed economies. Our main hypothesis assumes that integrated peripheries ? due to certain asymmetric interdependencies ? are not likely to produce significant long-term economic convergence to the centre economies with the current conditions of global capitalism and a strongly FDI based growth path they have developed.
O11|Are small farms really more productive than large farms?|We revisit the long-standing empirical evidence of an inverse relationship between farm size and productivity using rich microdata from Uganda. We show that farm size is negatively related to yields (output per hectare), as commonly found in the literature, but positively related to farm productivity (a farm-specific component of total factor productivity). These conflicting results do not arise because of omitted variables such as land quality, measurement error in output or inputs, or specification issues. Instead, we reconcile the findings emphasizing the role of farm-specific distortions and returns to scale in traditional farm production. We exploit unique regional variation in land tenure regimes in Uganda in evaluating the role of farm-specific distortions. Our findings point to the limited value of yields (or land productivity) in establishing the farm size-productivity relationship. More generally, we demonstrate the limitation of using farm size in guiding policy applications.
O11|Secular Trends in Wealth and Heterogeneous Capital: Land is Back... and Should Be Taxed|"The increase in wealth-to-income ratios in the second half of XXth century has recently received much attention. We decompose the trend in physical capital and housing, further decomposed into structures and land. In four out of five major countries analyzed, the positive trend in capital-income ratio arises from housing and specifically from its land component. We therefore revisit the question of wealth inequality and taxation in adopting a Georgist perspective (from Henry George, 1879) subsequently endorsed by prominent economists. We introduce land and housing structures in Judd’s optimal taxation framework. We show that an optimal taxation implies a property tax on land and no tax on capital. When the range of property taxes is politically constrained, taxing the product of housing rents is not optimal, even with additional taxes on ""imputed rents"". Rent taxes are however less distortive than a capital tax. The distortion depends on the share of housing structures and how they react to the tax on rents. However, a tax on rents complemented by a subsidy on structures investments in rental housing units does almost as well as a land tax. As a side result, we find that Judd’s result of no second best capital taxation extends to a larger range of parameters at the steady-state."

O11|Ghana's new national income data series: follow-up to M Huq and M Tribe's - The economy of Ghana: 50 years of economic development (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018)|This paper follows from the publication of our jointly authored book on the Ghanaian economy which was published in September 2018 (Huq and Tribe, 2018). This volume contains an extensive database which provides consistent series for most of the major macroeconomic features of the economy from 1960 to 2015. However, later in September 2018 the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) published a significant update of the national income statistics (GSS, 2018a) and in this paper we aim to explore some of the implications of this update. As originally published, the new national income data do not permit a direct comparison of the old and new series at constant prices of the same year, and the paper contains estimates which contribute to covering this omission. The calculations using the new data series also provide estimates for constant price data which demonstrate the structural changes reported by the GSS publications in more detail than was contained within the official data release. Using a range of new data sources (including the Integrated Business Enterprise Survey â€“ GSS, 2017b â€“ and the Labour Force Survey â€“ GSS, 2016) within the 2008 edition of the United Nations System of National Accounts (UN, 2008) the new national income series includes an upwards shift of approximately 30 per cent in GDP, and new estimates of manufacturing value added which amount to an increase of approximately 350 per cent. Statistical comparability of the new GDP series, particularly within sub-Saharan Africa, is an area which will need further consideration.
O11|Relative Prices and Sectoral Productivity|We develop a model of the structural transformation with three sectors: agriculture, industry, and services. In addition to reallocation across sectors over time, the model also features a reallocation of consumption across services that differ in their labor intensity and a distribution sector. We use the model to infer sectoral productivity levels across countries by imposing restrictions from data on sectoral employment and final expenditure relative prices. The model implies that productivity levels in services relative to industry are lower in poor relative to rich countries, even though the final expenditure price of services to goods is higher in rich relative to poor countries. These sectoral labor productivity implications across countries are broadly consistent with the available sectoral data. The results suggest that improving productivity levels in services is critical in the aggregate productivity catch up of poor relative to rich countries.
O11|Policy Distortions and Aggregate Productivity with Endogenous Establishment-Level Productivity|The large differences in income per capita across countries are mostly accounted for by differences in total factor productivity (TFP). What explains these differences in TFP across countries? Evidence suggests that the (mis)allocation of factors of production across heterogenous production units is an important factor. We study factor misallocation in a model with an endogenously determined distribution of establishment-level productivity. In this framework, policy distortions not only misallocate resources across a given set of productive units, but they also worsen the distribution of establishment-level productivity. We show that in our model, compared to the model with an exogenous distribution, the quantitative effect of policy distortions is substantially amplified. Whereas empirically-plausible policy distortions in our model generate TFP that is 14 percent that of a benchmark economy with no distortions, with an exogenous distribution the same policy distortions generate TFP that is 86 percent of the benchmark, a 6-fold amplification factor.
O11|Land Reform and Productivity: A Quantitative Analysis with Micro Data|We assess the effects of a major land policy change on farm size and agricultural productivity, using a quantitative model and micro-level data. In particular, we study the 1988 land reform in the Philippines, which was an extensive land redistribution program that imposed a ceiling of 5 hectares on all land holdings while at the same time severely restricting the transferability of the redistributed farm lands. We combine two sources of micro data to study the size and productivity effects of the land reform: (a) Decennial Agricultural Census Data, which offer a complete enumeration of farms, outputs, and inputs at the farm level in two separate cross sections, before and after the reform; (b) Philippines Cash Cropping Project, a panel of farm survey data, which tracks a much more limited number of rural households before and after the reform but offers a wealth of information at the parcel and farm level. We decompose the change in aggregate agricultural productivity, before and after the reform, into: (a) a reallocation effect, whereby farming activity is shifted from large farms to small farms and (b) a within-farm effect. The panel of farm surveys allows us to track a particular farmer over time and therefore to observe the source of the within-farm effect following the reform, such as a change in the crop mix or input mix. By focusing on a given country and tracking farmers over time, we control for farmer ability and for location since land quality and climate are constant. We develop a quantitative model with a non-degenerate distribution of farm sizes that features an occupational-choice decision for the farmer. The farmer chooses between two technologies: a ``cash crop'' and a ``food crop'' technology. The cash crop technology requires larger plots to be profitable, while the food crop technology can be operated at any scale. A land reform reduces aggregate agricultural productivity not only by reallocating resources from large/high productivity farms to small/low productivity farms, but also by altering the technology choice of farmers away from the more productive technology. We calibrate the model to the agricultural sector of the Philippines before the reform. We discipline the parameters of the technology choice from the farm-survey data on farm-cropping patterns. We then impose the land reform policy limiting farm size to 5 hectares and we study the consequences of this policy for average farm size, aggregate agricultural productivity, and the distribution of farm-level productivities. Contrary to the many empirical studies of land reforms that find inconclusive evidence of the policy on productivity, our preliminary results indicate that the land reform had a substantial negative impact on farm size and agricultural productivity.
O11|Are Small Farms Really more Productive than Large Farms?|We revisit the long-standing empirical evidence of an inverse relationship between farm size and productivity using rich micro data from Uganda. We show that farm size is nega- tively related with yields (output per hectare), as commonly found in the literature, but positively related with farm productivity (a farm-specific component of total factor pro- ductivity). These conflicting results do not arise because of omitted variables such as land quality, measurement error in output or inputs, or specification issues. Instead, we reconcile the findings emphasizing decreasing returns to scale in farm production and farm-specific distortions. We exploit regional variation in land tenure regimes in Uganda in evaluating the role of farm-specific distortions. Our findings point to the limited value of yields (or land productivity) in establishing the size-productivity relationship. More generally, we highlight farm size as an ineffective instrument for policy implementation since size is deeply con- founded by distortions in developing countries.
O11|The Effects of Land Markets on Resource Allocation and Agricultural Productivity|We assess the effects of land markets on misallocation and productivity by exploiting policy-driven variation in land rentals across time and space arising from a large-scale land certification reform in Ethiopia, where land remains owned by the state. Our main finding from detailed micro panel data is that land rentals substantially reduce misallocation and increase agricultural productivity. Our evidence builds from an empirical difference-in-difference strategy, an instrumental variable approach, and a calibrated quantitative macroeconomic framework with heterogeneous household-farms that replicates, without targeting, the empirical effects. These effects are nonlinear, impacting more farms farther away from efficient operational scale, consistent with our theory. Using our model, we find that more active land markets reduce inequality, an important concern for the design of land policy. We also find that the positive effects of land markets are mainly driven by formal market rentals as opposed to informal rentals. Finally, our analysis also provides evidence that land markets increase the adoption of more advanced technologies such as the use of fertilizers.
O11|Some Issues on the Vietnam Economic Growth|"We first consider the question of the productivity of the economy of Vietnam at the macro level. With theoretical models and empirical data, we find out the Leontief production function, and its associated TFP (Total Factor Productivity). We show that the TFP is one of the main engines of Vietnam economic growth. However when we move to the micro level with the capital productivity of 2,835 State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), we discover there exists an over utilization of the physical capital and more importantly, diversion of the capital stock. This diversion may be due to a waste of capital stocks or to a special form of bribery we call ""hidden overhead"". To summarize, economic growth in Vietnam my be enhanced by investing in the founding components of TFP such as new technology, Human Capital, better organisational system, but also by fighting the bribery and the over utilization of the physical capital."
O11|FDI, multinationals and structural change in developing countries|Economic development can be defined as a process in which output growth is accompanied by qualitative changes in the structures of production and employment. Can FDI affect this process? This paper looks for answers in two ways. First, it reviews the extant knowledge about the relationship between MNE activity and economic development in developing countries. Core theoretical and conceptual issues are presented and the key findings of both microeconomic (FDI linkages and spillovers) and macroeconomic (FDI-growth nexus) empirical studies are discussed. The main message of both streams of literature is that FDI has the potential to catalyse development, but actual outcomes are contingent on several factors, such as the absorptive capacity of domestic firms and the level of development of local financial markets. Second, the paper addresses the relationship between FDI and structural change more directly, in a cross-country context, using a two-step estimation approach that is consistent with both theoretical arguments and previous empirical findings which suggest that the FDI-development nexus is highly country-specific. The results confirm such heterogeneity and suggest that the interaction between the sectoral concentration of FDI and the development stage of the country plays a role in determining the development impact of FDI.
O11|Knowledge Economy and Economic Development in the Arab Region|This paper aims to discuss the relationship between knowledge, knowledge economy and economic development in the Arab region. It aims to contribute to improve understanding and provide valuable contribution to the increasing debate in the international literature concerning the relationship between knowledge economy and economic development in the Arab region. We use the descriptive and comparative approaches and methods of analysis and use the conceptual framework and indicators often used in the international literature to discuss the relationship between knowledge, knowledge economy and economic development in the Arab region. Different from previous studies in the Arab literature, we fill the gap in the Arab literature, we present an in-depth and a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between knowledge economy and economic development in the Arab region defined by income level using recent secondary data related to knowledge economy obtained from the Global Innovation Index Report (2018) and the World Bank (2012). Our results support the first hypothesis concerning the considerable variation in the promotion of knowledge economy depending on the level of economic development across the Arab countries. Our findings verify the second hypothesis that the relationship between knowledge economy and economic development in the Arab region is determined by several factors including economic development, economic incentives and institutional regime, education and human resources, innovation system and Information and Communication Technology. Our results support the third hypothesis that sound and coherent policies for the promotion of knowledge economy through the promotion of economic incentives and institutional regime, education and human resources, the innovation system and Information and Communication Technology would contribute to accelerate achievement of inclusive growth and sustainable development in the Arab countries. Our results in the Arab region show positive relationship between income level and knowledge index, knowledge economy index and knowledge economy index and most of knowledge economy indicators including knowledge workers, knowledge-intensive employment, knowledge absorption, knowledge and technology outputs, knowledge impact and knowledge diffusion. Our findings in the Arab region show positive relationship between income level and all knowledge economy index pillars (economic incentive and institutional regime pillar, education and human resources pillar, the innovation system pillar, and information and communication technology (ICT) pillar) and all factors facilitating the promotion of knowledge economy including institutions, human capital and research, education, tertiary education, research & development (R&D), infrastructure, information and communication technologies, and innovation. The major policy implication and recommendation that the promotion of knowledge economy depends on promotion of institutions, economic incentive and institutional regime, education, human resources and research (human capital, education, tertiary education, research & development (R&D)), innovation system (innovation input, output and efficiency) infrastructure, and information and communication technologies.
O11|Harmful Pro-Competitive Effects of Trade in Presence of Credit Market Frictions|We explore the consequences of international trade in an economy that encompasses technology choice and an endogenous distribution of mark-ups due to credit market frictions. We show that in such an environment a gradual opening of trade may -- but not necessarily must -- have a negative impact on productivity and overall output. The reason is that the pro-competitive effects of trade reduce mark-ups and hence make access to credit more difficult for smaller firms. As a result, smaller firms -- while not driven out of the market -- may be forced to switch to less productive technologies.
O11|SSP Long Run Scenarios for European NUTS2 Regions|In this paper we illustrate the development of a modeling framework aimed at producing detailed quantitative estimates for economic variables, consistent with Shared Socio-economic Pathways, and their assumptions about national income and population. Our model not only provides information on industrial production levels, employment, consumption patterns, trade flows and other macroeconomic variables, but disaggregates them further at the sub-national level, for European NUTS2 regions. Estimates are produced by an especially designed dynamic general equilibrium model (G-RDEM), augmented with a regional down-scaling module. The latter takes into account the different sectoral composition of the regional economies, their endowments of primary resources, as well as the possible existence of structural and agglomeration externalities. After describing the methodology, the paper presents an illustrative sample of results produced by the model, focusing on Italian regions and the Shared Socio-economic Pathway 1 in the period 2011-2051.
O11|Using structural diversity to measure the complexity of technologies|The paper introduces structural diversity as a new approach to quantify the complexity of technologies. By modeling technologies as combinatorial networks, a measure of technological complexity is derived that represents the diversity of (sub-)network topologies in these networks. It is further argued that this measure can be empirically approximated with the Network Diversity Score (NDS). The paper also presents an application of this approach to European patent data from 1980 to 2015. On this basis, the measure of structural diversity is shown to replicate a number of stylized facts commonly associated with technological complexity: Complexity increases over time and younger technologies are more complex than older technologies. Complex technologies are also associated to larger R&D efforts and require more collaborative R&D activities. Lastly, when controlling for technologies? size, technologies scoring high on structural diversity are also shown to concentrate in space.
O11|Technological regimes and the geography of innovation: a long-run perspective on US inventions|The geographical distribution of innovative activities is an emerging subject, but still poorly understood. While previous efforts highlighted that different technologies exhibit different spatial patterns, in this paper we analyse the geography of innovation in the very long run. Using a US patent dataset geocoded for the years 1836-2010, we observe that ? while it is true that differences in technologies are strong determinant of spatial patterns ? changes within a technology over time is at least as important. In particular, we find that regional entry follows the technology life cycle. Subsequently, innovation becomes less geographical concentrated in the first half of the life cycle, to then re-concentrate in the second half.
O11|Sectoral and Skill Contributions to Labor Productivity in Asia|Using a decomposition approach on data collected by the Asian Productivity Organization (APO) as well as World Input-Output data, we show that in most Asian economies the services sector makes the largest contribution to labor productivity. Furthermore, we find evidence of a major reallocation of labor from agriculture directly to services, bypassing the manufacturing sector. This finding challenges the traditional view that countries in their economic development need to have their workforce employed first in manufacturing before switching to services. Lastly, the paper studies how different skill levels contribute to labor productivity growth. We find that high-skilled workers have contributed most to overall labor productivity growth in developing Asia. In services, high-skilled workers have mainly driven labor productivity, indicating that upskilling and training are instrumental in services-led development.
O11|Foreign aid, instability and governance in Africa|This study contributes to the attendant literature by bundling governance dynamics and focusing on foreign aid instability instead of foreign aid. We assess the role of foreign aid instability on governance dynamics in fifty three African countries for the period 1996-2010. An autoregressive endogeneity-robust Generalized Method of Moments is employed. Instabilities are measured in terms of variance of the errors and standard deviations. Three main aid indicators are used, namely: total aid, aid from multilateral donors and bilateral aid. Principal Component Analysis is used to bundle governance indicators, namely: political governance (voice & accountability and political stability/no violence), economic governance (regulation quality and government effectiveness), institutional governance (rule of law and corruption-control) and general governance (political, economic and institutional governance). Our findings show that foreign aid instability increases governance standards, especially political and general governance. Policy implications are discussed.
O11|Transfer Pricing and Corporate Social Responsibility: Arguments, Views and Agenda|The central thesis of the paper is that Multinational Companies (MNC) should invest in the use of “soft” methods (socially responsible behavior) to mitigate costs in society accrued due to use of “hardcore” tax evasion tactics (Transfer mispricing) to maximize profits from operations in developing countries and/or countries with weak or inefficient tax laws and tax collection institutions. Therefore, we articulate the argument of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as an indirect compensation for transfer mispricing. Our aim is not to present CSR as solution to transfer mispricing. An analytical approach is based on a content analysis of the existing literature with emphasis on a case study. We first discuss the dark side of transfer pricing (TP), next we present the link between TP and poverty and finally we advance arguments for CSR as a compensation for transfer mispricing. While acknowledging that TP is a legal accounting practice, we argue that in light of its poverty and underdevelopment externalities, the practice per se should be a strong defence for CSR because it is also associated with schemes that deprive developing countries of the capital essential for investment in health, education and development programmes.
O11|Sustaining cultural tourism through higher female participation in Nigeria: the role of corporate social responsibility in oil host communities|This paper adds to the gender discourse in sustainable African tourism development from the corporate social responsibility (CSR) perspective. Specifically, we examine the impact of CSR on the development of rural women in cultural tourism. A total of 600 rural women were sampled across the Niger Delta. Results from the use of a logit model indicate a significant relationship between CSR and cultural tourism development in oil host communities in Nigeria. This implies that CSR of a multinational oil company (MOC) is a critical factor for sustaining cultural tourism. The findings suggest increased female participation in General Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) interventions of MOC and the need to pay close attention to which extent the participation of rural women in the GMoU projects may be limited by cultural and traditional obstacles.
O11|A Survey on the Washington Consensus and the Beijing Model: Reconciling Development Perspectives|Reconciling the two dominant development models of the Washington Consensus (WC) and Beijing Model (BM) remains a critical challenge in the literature. The challenge is even more demanding when emerging development paradigms like the Liberal Institutional Pluralism (LIP) and New Structural Economics (NSE) schools have to be integrated. While the latter has recognized both State and market failures but failed to provide a unified theory, the former has left the challenging concern of how institutional diversity matter in the development process. We synthesize perspectives from recently published papers on development and Sino-African relations in order to present the relevance of both the WC and BM in the long-term and short-run respectively. While the paper postulates for a unified theory by reconciling the WC and the BM to complement the NSE, it at the same time presents a case for economic rights and political rights as short-run and long-run development priorities respectively. By attempting to reconcile the WC with the BM, the study contributes at the same to macroeconomic NSE literature of unifying a development theory and to the LIP literature on institutional preferences with stages of development. Hence, the proposed reconciliation takes into account the structural and institutional realities of nations at different stages of the process of development.
O11|Cities of Workers, Children or Seniors? Age Structure and Economic Growth in a Global Cross-Section of Cities|A large literature documents the positive influence of a cityâ€™s skill structure on its rate of economic growth. By contrast, the effect of a cityâ€™s age structure on its economic growth has been a hitherto largely neglected area of research. We hypothesize that cities with more working-age adults are likely to grow faster than cities with more children or seniors and set-out the potential channels through which such differential growth may occur. Using data from a variety of historical and contemporary sources, we show that there exists marked variation in the age structure of the worldâ€™s largest cities, both across cities and over time. We then study how age structure affects economic growth for a global cross-section of mega-cities. Using various identification strategies, we find that mega-cities with higher dependency ratios - i.e. with more children and/or seniors per working-age adult - grow significantly slower. Such effects are particularly pronounced for cities with high shares of children. This result appears to be mainly driven by the direct negative effects of a higher dependency ratio on the size of the working-age population and the indirect effects on work hours and productivity for working age adults within a city.
O11|Economic and Political Factors in Infrastructure Investment: Evidence from Railroads and Roads in Africa 1960--2015|Transport investment has played an important role in the economic development of many countries. Starting from a low base, African countries have recently initiated several massive transportation infrastructure projects. However, surprisingly little is known about the current levels, past evolution, and correlates of transportation infrastructure in Africa. In this paper, we introduce a new data set on the evolution of the stocks of railroads (1862-2015) and multiple types of roads (1960-2015) for 43 sub-Saharan African countries. First, we compare our estimates with those from other available data sets, such as the World Development Indicators of the World Bank. Second, we document the aggregate evolution of transportation investments over the past century in Africa. We confirm that railroads were a ``colonial'' transportation technology, whereas paved roads were a ``post-colonial'' technology. We also highlight how investment patterns have followed economic patterns. Third, we report conditional correlations between 5-year infrastructure growth and several geographic, economic and political factors during the period 1960-2015. We find strong correlations between transportation investments and economic development as well as more political factors including pre-colonial centralization, ethnic fractionalization, European settlement, natural resource dependence, and democracy.
O11|Ethnic Inclusiveness of the Central State Government and Economic Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa|We estimate the effect of the share of ethnic groups included in the central government on economic growth, distinguishing between democracies and autocracies in a panel of 41 Sub-Saharan African countries over the period from independence to 1999. We exploit evidence from the Ethnic Power Relations database, which categorises the politically relevant ethnic groups regarding access to state power. We take advantage of the time variation of political participation, using Fixed-Effects and Difference-GMM estimations. Our dynamic-panel growth models display a robust positive effect of the proportion of included groups in democracies. Such an effect is offset in autocracies, and the difference is often significant. This finding withstands the introduction of various controls, outlier tests, and specification checks. Our results support the view that institutional improvements must accompany the promotion of inclusiveness in low-income and weakly-institutionalised countries.
O11|The volatility effect of diaspora's location|Remittances can transmit volatility from host to home countries for some common patterns of diaspora's geographical distribution. In a migration portfolio model, the overall risk of volatility of any set of diaspora location is decomposed into a contagion and a concentration risks: a diaspora located in more volatile destinations induces a higher contagion risk, while a diaspora located in few destination countries increases the concentration risk. A series of estimations on a large panel of developing countries over 1995–2015 provide evidence for these two risks. Estimation of a structural model confirms that the geography of diaspora has an indirect impact on the origin country's aggregate instability through remittances.
O11|Technological changes and population growth: The role of land in England|This paper emphasizes the role of land and technological progress in economic and population growth. The model is calibrated using historical data on England concerning both economic growth rate and the factor shares (land, capital, and labor) in total income, as well as mortality tables. It is able to reproduce the dynamics of population since 1760. Moreover, it is possible to disentangle the relative effect of technical changes and mortality fall on the evolution of population. We conduct a counterfactual analysis eliminating successively the increase in life expectancy and the technological bias. With no increase in life expectancy, population would have been respectively 10% and 30% lower in 1910 and in the long run. The figures would have been respectively 40% and 60% lower, with no bias in the technical progress. Finally, population would have been 45% smaller in 1910 and 70% smaller in the long run, neutralizing both the effect of life expectancy and technological bias. So the major part of population increase is due to the technological bias evolution between land and capital.
O11|Remittances and credit in developed and developing countries: A dynamic panel analysis|This article investigates the impact of remittances on credit in 30 developing (low and middle income) countries and 27 developed (high-income) countries during the period of 2000-2014. This paper differs from existing literature in two ways. First, we distinguish the impact of remittances on credit in both the short run and the long run. Second, we investigate whether remittances influence credit provided to households and credit provided to firms differently, thanks to a new dataset. Our results indicate that (i) remittances have a positive impact on credit in the long run but no impact in the short run; (ii) remittances have a stronger effect on household credit than on firm credit in developing countries; and, (iii) remittances stimulate credit provision through firm credit in developed countries.
O11|Contagion and bond pricing: The case of the ASEAN region|In this paper, we obtain explicit numerical formulas to price the defaultable bonds prices of firms. The possible default event of the firms happen in random time and not necessary in uniform time spread. For this purpose, we develop a Markov regime-switching Copula model that allows us to well-capture the economic behavior in some ASEAN region countries. The first regime represents the evidence that is used to support the standard economy. The second regime represents the crisis state. Based on various specifications, we obtain an explicit formula to evaluate the conditional Laplace transform of a regime switching Cox Ingersoll Ross model using the semi-affine property of this model. Our numerical results show strong evidence for increasing volatility parameter in crisis state, suggesting more possibility of contagion. Furthermore, statistically significant differences in terms of volatility of default across countries are reported. Indonesia and Malaysia exhibit particularly higher volatility than other markets, especially in the crisis state.

O11|Política industrial moderna: fundamentos e importancia para el crecimiento económico y la igualdad|Este capítulo presenta las virtudes, requerimientos, vigencia y potencialidades de una política de desarrollo industrial para Colombia. Inicialmente se señalan los pasos necesarios para implementar una política de desarrollo industrial exitosa. Expone este trabajo, además, los enfoques teóricos que sustentan un modelo heterodoxo de política industrial. Entre ellos se destacan las propuestas de Young-Currie-Kaldor, que muestran el vínculo de esta política con el crecimiento acelerado e inclusivo en términos de generación de empleo y mejoras en la distribución del ingreso. A lo largo del documento se presentan las evidencias empíricas de países que muestran las mencionadas potencialidades de la política industrial. El artículo explica cómo Colombia puede responder al objetivo de una paz estable y duradera a partir de una estrategia de crecimiento económico inclusivo que busque el pleno empleo como objetivo fundamental y que, sustentada en una mayor diversificación, complejidad y sofisticación de su estructura productiva, permita avanzar hacia la construcción de una sociedad más igualitaria. *** This chapter presents the virtues, requirements, validity and potential of an industrial policy for Colombia. The article shows how to implement a successful industrial policy and exposes the theoretical approaches behind a heterodox model of industrial policy. Among them is possible to point out the proposals of Young-Currie-Kaldor that show the link between industrial policy, accelerated economic growth, employment and income distribution. The document presents evidence of countries that have exhibited the potential of industrial policy. It also explains how to achieve the objectives of peacebuilding and social justice in Colombia based on an inclusive and full employment model of economic growth. To achieve those goals, a model of economic development based on a greater diversification, complexity and sophistication of the economic structure is necessary.
O11|El bicentenario: una mirada entre la historia económica y la economía política|En el marco del Bicentenario de la independencia de Colombia, el Centro de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo (CID), en alianza con el periódico Portafolio, ha presentado una serie de reflexiones sobre la trayectoria económica que ha atravesado el país, en aras de entender los retos del futuro y las lecciones aprendidas del pasado. El contenido es muy amplio incluyendo temas que han jugado un rol clave en la historia del país, como el café, la violencia, la tierra, hasta temas que son menos conocidos pero deberían formar parte de la reflexión colectiva, como el papel de la mujer, los estudios sectoriales, o el desarrollo de largo plazo. El lector no tiene que esperarse una narración univoca, ni un recorrido lineal: estos escritos son reflexiones que vienen de investigadores con enfoques teóricos y metodológicos muy diferentes, como tradición en la Universidad Nacional. Así, ensayos de análisis económico de las instituciones son acompañados por reflexiones de análisis marxiano aplicado, y la cliometría se entrelaza a la finanza pública. Por la misma razón, decidimos no proponer una estructura interpretativa o una organización del contenido, prefiriendo reportar los escritos en el orden cronológico en el cual aparecieron en el portal del periódico. *** In the framework of the Bicentennial of the independence of Colombia, the Centro de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo (CID), in alliance with the newpaper Portafolio, has gathered a series of reflections about the economic trajectory that the country has gone through, for the sake of understanding the challenges of the future and the lessons learned from the past. The content is very broad including issues that have played a key role in the history of the country, such as coffee, violence, land, and issues that are less known but should be part of collective reflection, such as the role of women, sectoral studies, or long-term development. The reader should not expect a univocal narrative, nor a linear perspective: these texts are reflections that come from researchers with very different theoretical and methodological approaches, as a tradition at the Universidad Nacional. As a result, economic analysis of the institutions goes hand by hand with applied Marxian analysis, and the cliometry is intertwined with public finance. For the same reason, we decided not to propose an interpretative structure or an organization of the content, opting for an order of presentation that follows the chronological order in which they appeared in the newspaper's portal.
O11|Heterogeneity, Measurement Error, and Misallocation: Evidence from African Agriculture| Standard measures of productivity display enormous dispersion across farms in Africa. Crop yields and input intensities appear to vary greatly, seemingly in conflict with a model of efficient allocation across farms. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for distinguishing between measurement error, unobserved heterogeneity, and potential misallocation. Using rich panel data from farms in Tanzania and Uganda, we estimate our model using a highly flexible specification in which we allow for several kinds of measurement error and heterogeneity. We find that measurement error and heterogeneity together account for a large fraction perhaps two-thirds to three-quarters -- of the dispersion in measured productivity. We suggest that the potential for efficiency gains through reallocation may be relatively modest.

O11|A theory of structural change that can fit the data|We propose a dynamic theory that is consistent with the long-run structural change of consumption expenditure shares in agriculture, manufacturing and services over more than a century. We first document three robust features in the long-run data for the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia: (i) a monotonic decrease in agriculture; (ii) a hump shape in manufacturing; and (iii) an accelerated rise of services. Using historical panel data on sectoral prices and nominal expenditures from 1900 to 2014, we then test what demand side theory can quantitatively explain the observed structural change. We find that the standard non-homothetic preference specifications used in the literature - the generalized Stone-Geary and the Price Independent Generalized Linearity (PIGL) specification - struggle to do so. Within our intertemporal framework, we then consider the entire class of preferences that allows for the aggregation of individual Euler equations - the class of intertemporally aggregable (IA) preferences. This general class nests the standard specifications and allows for the identification of preference parameters from aggregate data. Moreover, its expenditure system is flexible enough to capture the non-monotonic relationship between sectoral expenditure shares. Despite the flexibility, the IA preference specification is parsimonious and can be used in a multi-sector general equilibrium model with steady growth and heterogeneity in individual consumption expenditures. In the empirical analysis we show that the standard specifications are rejected against the more flexible parameterizations of IA preferences and we document the importance of flexible income effects.
O11|Pandemics, places, and populations: evidence from the Black Death|The Black Death killed 40% of Europe’s population between 1347-1352, making it one of the largest shocks in the history of mankind. Despite its historical importance, little is known about its spatial effects and the effects of pandemics more generally. Using a novel dataset that provides information on spatial variation in Plague mortality at the city level, as well as various identification strategies, we explore the short-run and long-run impacts of the Black Death on city growth. On average, cities recovered their pre-Plague populations within two centuries. In addition, aggregate convergence masked heterogeneity in urban recovery. We show that both of these facts are consistent with a Malthusian model in which population returns to high-mortality locations endowed with more rural and urban fixed factors of production. Land suitability and natural and historical trade networks played a vital role in urban recovery. Our study highlights the role played by pandemics in determining both the sizes and placements of populations.
O11|Harmful Pro-Competitive Effects of Trade in Presence of Credit Market Frictions|We explore the consequences of international trade in an economy that encompasses technology choice and an endogenous distribution of mark-ups due to credit market frictions. We show that in such an environment a gradual opening of trade may – but not necessarily must – have a negative impact on productivity and overall output. The reason is that the procompetitive effects of trade reduce mark-ups and hence make access to credit more difficult for smaller firms. As a result, smaller firms – while not driven out of the market – may be forced to switch to less productive technologies.
O11|Trade, Technology and the Great Divergence|"This paper develops a model that captures the key features of the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence between the industrializing \North"" and the lagging \South."" In particular, a convincing story is needed for why North-South divergence occurred so dramatically during the late 19th Century, a good hundred years after the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. To this end we construct a trade/growth model that includes both endogenous biased technologies and intercontinental trade. The Industrial Revolution began as a sequence of unskilled-labor intensive innovations which initially incited fertil- ity increases and limited human capital formation in both the North and the South. The subsequent co-evolution of trade and technological growth however fostered an inevitable di- vergence in living standards - the South increasingly specialized in production that worsened their terms of trade and spurred even greater fertility increases and educational declines. Biased technological changes in both regions only reinforced this pattern. The model high- lights how pronounced divergence ultimately arose from interactions between specialization from trade and technological forces."
O11|Diversity and Conflict|This research advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that interpersonal population diversity, rather than fractionalization or polarization across ethnic groups, has been pivotal to the emergence, prevalence, recurrence, and severity of intrasocietal conflicts. Exploiting an exogenous source of variations in population diversity across nations and ethnic groups, as determined predominantly during the exodus of humans from Africa tens of thousands of years ago, the study demonstrates that population diversity, and its impact on the degree of diversity within ethnic groups, has contributed significantly to the risk and intensity of historical and contemporary civil conflicts. The findings arguably reflect the contribution of population diversity to the non-cohesivnesss of society, as reflected partly in the prevalence of mistrust, the divergence in preferences for public goods and redistributive policies, and the degree of fractionalization and polarization across ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups.
O11|The Aggregate and Distributional Effects of Financial Globalization: Evidence from Macro and Sectoral Data|We take a fresh look at the aggregate and distributional effects of policies to liberalize international capital flows-financial globalization. Both country- and industry-level results suggest that such policies have led on average to limited output gains while contributing to significant increases in inequality. The country-level results are based on 228 capital account liberalization episodes spanning 149 advanced and developing economies from 1970 to the present. Difference-in-difference estimation using industry-level data for 23 advanced economies suggests that liberalization episodes reduce the share of labor income, particularly for industries with higher external financial dependence, higher natural propensity to use layoffs to adjust to idiosyncratic shocks, and higher elasticity of substitution between capital and labor.
O11|Childlessness and Economic Development: a Survey|This paper provides an introduction to the analysis of childlessness, first by describing the stylized facts and the relevant literature, and then by proposing a theoretical framework. We show that both poverty-driven childlessness and opportunity-driven childlessness matter and are essential to a thorough understanding of childlessness as a socioeconomic phenomenon.
O11|Access to Justice and Economic Development: Evidence from an International Panel Dataset|We empirically investigate the impact of access to justice (ATJ) on GDP per capita growth in a panel of 83 countries from 1970 to 2014. Our analysis relies on a new database documenting the number of judges per capita as a proxy for capturing the cross-country evolution of ATJ. The proxy measures the extent to which disputes between economic actors can be resolved at a relatively low cost, without dysfunctional delay and discrimination. In a dynamic panel setting using internal instruments, we find that increasing ATJ by 1% increases the five-year growth rate of GDP per capita by 0.86 p.p. (0.17 p.p. annually) with diminishing marginal returns. In line with the diminishing marginal returns argument, we find that the effect of ATJ is two times smaller in Europe compared to other regions due to higher levels of ATJ. We find no evidence of a differential effect of ATJ across other regions, income levels, legal origins, democracy, corruption of the judicial system or human capital levels.
O11|Business Cycle during Structural Change: Arthur Lewis' Theory from a Neoclassical Perspective|We document that the nature of business cycles evolves over the process of development and structural change. In countries with large declining agricultural sectors, aggregate employment is uncorrelated with GDP. During booms, employment in agriculture declines while labor productivity increases in agriculture more than in other sectors. We construct a unified theory of business cycles and structural change consistent with the stylized facts. The focal point of the theory is the simultaneous decline and modernization of agriculture. As capital accumulates, agriculture becomes increasingly capital intensive as modern agriculture crowds out traditional agriculture. Structural change accelerates in booms and slows down in recessions. We estimate the model and show that it accounts well for both the structural transformation and the business cycle fluctuations of China.
O11|Inflation Anchoring, Real Borrowing Costs, and Growth: Evidence from Sectoral Data|Central bankers often assert that anchoring of inflation expectations and reducing inflation uncertainty are good for economic outcomes. We test this claim and search for a relevant channel using panel data on sectoral growth for 22 manufacturing industries from 36 advanced and emerging market economies over the period 1990-2014. Our difference-in-difference strategy is based on the theoretical prediction that inflation uncertainty has larger effects in industries that are more credit constrained by increasing effective real borrowing costs. The results show that industries characterized by high external financial dependence, low asset tangibility, and high R&D intensity tend to grow faster in countries with well-anchored inflation expectations. The results are robust to controlling for the interaction between these characteristics and a broad set of macroeconomic variables over the sample period, including the level of inflation and output volatility. The results are also robust to IV techniques, using indicators of monetary policy transparency and independence as instruments.
O11|SMEs SECTOR : A KEY DRIVER TO THE EGYPTIAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT|The focus of this paper is the discussion of the competitiveness facing SMEs in the Egyptian business environment by examining the opportunities and supports from the banking sector, government and SME employers. The purpose of this paper is to review the experiences of group of countries that have benefited greatly from SME development and have been able to achieve high economic growth rates. On the other hand, presented the problems facing the Egyptian economy in order to achieve rapid growth rates at the level of small and medium enterprises and finally propose the strategies that can contribute effectively to the development of these projects. Therefore, in this study the importance of SMEs for developing countries is considered. First, the definition, strengths and weakness of SME's business are mentioned. In the second section, case studies from other countries for SMEs are considered. Then, the nature of business in the Egyptian economy is discussed. Finally, the results the questionnaire reflects the current situation and the conclusions were sets according to these results.
O11|Go east: On the impact of the Transiberian Railway on economic development in Eastern Russia|This paper addresses the question whether or not large-scale infrastructure investments have a causal effect of local economic development. By using a novel instrumental variable approach based on historical trade and travel routes across the Russian East, I am able to identify a causal and negative effect of remoteness to the Transsiberian Railway on local economic activity as measured by nocturnal lights emission.
O11|"A replication of ""The long-run impact of foreign aid in 36 African countries: Insights from multivariate time series analysis"" (Oxford Bulletin of Statistics and Economics, 2014)"|Macroeconomic data have been shown to vary substantially between sources, especially so for low-income countries. While the impact of data revisions on inference is well documented for cross-country studies, there is no systematic analysis of the robustness of results obtained from time series analysis. This is despite the fact that time series analysis is an integral part of the econometric toolkit of government analysts, and informs policy decisions in many areas of macroeconomics. This study fills this gap for the notoriously controversial aid-effectiveness debate using the statistical framework by Juselius et al. (2014, Oxf Bull Econ Stat): by adopting alternative sources of GDP data in 36 sub-Saharan African countries The author finds that results remain robust across datasets in two thirds of the countries, but sometimes drastically change in others. These findings suggest that robustness checks such as those carried out here should become standard procedure for macroeconomic analysis using single-country time series.
O11|The development of the German labour market after World War II|Labour market developments have Germany undergone two shocks: German reunification in the early 1990s, and the Hartz reforms in the early 2000s. They separated the German labour market into the traditional rather corporatist labour market segment, characterised by a high degree of coordination, and a new, less regulated labour market segment. The latter is characterised by low wages and precarious working conditions. A precariat living under conditions of high uncertainty developed. All these developments are mainly the result of legal changes in Germany - changes which, with respect to employment creation, were unneeded.
O11|Power generation and structural change: Quantifying economic effects of the coal phase-out in Germany|In the fight against global warming, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is a major objective. In particular, a decrease in electricity generation by coal could contribute to reducing CO2 emissions. Using a multi-region dynamic general equilibrium model, this paper studies potential economic consequences of a coal phase-out in Germany. Different regional phase-out scenarios are simulated with varying timing structures. We find that a politically induced coal phase-out would lead to an increase in the national unemployment rate by about 0.10 percentage points from 2020 to 2040, depending on the specific scenario. The effect on regional unemployment rates varies between 0.18 to 1.07 percentage points in the lignite regions. However, a faster coal phase-out can lead to a faster recovery. The coal phase-out leads to migration from German lignite regions to German non-lignite regions and reduces the labour force in the lignite regions by 10,000 people by 2040.
O11|Technological change, energy, environment and economic growth in Japan|A considerable amount of research has shown that that carbon tax combined with research subsidy may be regarded as an optimal policy in view of diffusing low carbon technologies for the benefit of the society. The paper exploits the macro economic approach of the endogenous growth models with technological change for a comparative assessment of these policy measures on the economic growth in the US and Japan in the medium and the long run. The results of our micro estimates reveal several important differences across the Japanese and US energy firms: lower elasticity of innovation production function in R&D expenditure, lower probability of a radical innovation, and larger advances of dirty technologies in Japan. This may explain our quantitative findings of stronger reliance on carbon tax than on research subsidies in Japan relative to the US.

O11|Inequality and Institutional Quality in a Growth Model|A macroeconomic growth model of an occupational choice between being a diligent worker and being a criminal is developed. Imperfect protection of property rights renders agents heterogeneous in their holding wealth over time even though they are homogeneous in the initial period. The model is so tractable that one can explicitly derive the distribution of individual wealth and compute the Gini coefficient analytically in the stationary state. Using the Gini coefficient, we investigate how institutional quality affects inequality across agents in the economy. Our ndings are as follows. In the case of a relatively higher capital share, as institutional quality improves, inequality widens in the early stage of development of institutional quality; in contrast, inequality shrinks once institutions have sufficiently matured. In the case of a lower capital share, inequality monotonically shrinks as institutional quality improves. Furthermore, we present government policies that reduce inequality and achieve the first-best outcome.
O11|Preparing for the next MFF: Where did the money go in the past?|This paper presents the state of play of the preparations for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) of the EU for the period 2021-2027. It then turns to an analysis of the allocation of regional support funding over the last two MFFs, using a standard growth model to interpret the results. It finds that: First, the distribution of Cohesion spending across regions (as proportion of regional GDP) can be explained to a large extent by a few variables, namely income per capita, unemployment and the importance of agriculture. However, there are also important differences across different clusters of regions. Regions in Southern Europe received less funding than those in Central and Eastern Europe even accounting for differences in these determinants. Second, regions in Southern Europe have a relatively high capital/output ratio and thus a lower productivity of capital. Moreover, their investment rates do not seem to be affected by the Structural Funds they receive. These results suggest the need for a change in emphasis from infrastructure investment to measures that improve overall allocation of resources.
O11|Digital Abundance and Scarce Genius: Implications for Wages, Interest Rates, and Growth|Digital versions of labor and capital can be reproduced much more cheaply than their traditional forms. This increases the supply and reduces the marginal cost of both labor and capital. What then, if anything, is becoming scarcer? We posit a third factor, ‘genius’, that cannot be duplicated by digital technologies. Our approach resolves several macroeconomic puzzles. Over the last several decades, both real median wages and the real interest rate have been stagnant or falling in the United States and the World. Furthermore, shares of income paid to labor and capital (properly measured) have also decreased. And despite dramatic advances in digital technologies, the growth rate of measured output has not increased. No competitive neoclassical two-factor model can reconcile these trends. We show that when increasingly digitized capital and labor are sufficiently complementary to inelastically supplied genius, innovation augmenting either of the first two factors can decrease wages and interest rates in the short and long run. Growth is increasingly constrained by the scarce input, not labor or capital. We discuss microfoundations for genius, with a focus on the increasing importance of superstar labor. We also consider consequences for government policy and scale sustainability.
O11|Health and Economic Growth: Reconciling the Micro and Macro Evidence|Micro-based and macro-based approaches have been used to assess the effects of health on economic growth. Micro-based approaches aggregate the return on individual health from Mincerian wage regressions to derive the macroeconomic effects of population health. Macro-based approaches estimate a generalized aggregate production function that decomposes output into its components. The microbased approach tends to find smaller effects than the macro-based approach, thus presenting a micromacro puzzle regarding the economic return on health. We reconcile these two strands of literature by showing that the point estimate of the macroeconomic effect of health is quantitatively close to that found by aggregating the microeconomic effects, controlling for potential spillovers of population health at the aggregate level. Our results justify using the micro-based approach to estimate the direct economic benefits of health interventions.
O11|Business Cycle during Structural Change: Arthur Lewis' Theory from a Neoclassical Perspective|We document that the nature of business cycles evolves over the process of development and structural change. In countries with large declining agricultural sectors, aggregate employment is uncorrelated with GDP. During booms, employment in agriculture declines while labor productivity increases in agriculture more than in other sectors. We construct a unified theory of business cycles and structural change consistent with the stylized facts. The focal point of the theory is the simultaneous decline and modernization of agriculture. As capital accumulates, agriculture becomes increasingly capital intensive as modern agriculture crowds out traditional agriculture. Structural change accelerates in booms and slows down in recessions. We estimate the model and show that it accounts well for both the structural transformation and the business cycle fluctuations of China.
O11|Heterogeneous Sectoral Growth Effects of FDI in Egypt|This paper is one of the first to investigate the sectoral dimension/perspective of FDI spillovers. It examines empirically the heterogeneous technology effects and efficiency gains of FDI across economic sectors in Egypt between 1990 and 2007. The results reveal many aspects of the aggregation bias of cross-country studies. In aggregate, inflows of FDI have no significant impact upon growth in Egypt; instead, growth is driven by government investment. The disaggregated analysis however, reveals that FDI has distinct sector-specific effects on the Egyptian economy that derive exclusively from investment in the Telecommunication & Information Technology. FDI in Services however, generates negative growth effects. The sectoral growth effects of FDI also depend upon the region of origin. Although the growth impact of FDI in Telecommunications from both the Middle East & North Africa (MENA) and Western economies is positive, the finding is primarily driven by investment from the latter nations. Further, there is some evidence to support the view that FDI into the Manufacturing & Petroleum sector from the MENA region has adverse growth effects. There is also limited evidence to suggest that â€˜market-seekingâ€™ Western (European and US) capital flows into the Services sector have conspicuous â€˜crowding-outâ€™ effects.
O11|Threshold Regressions for the Resource Curse|This paper analyzes the behavior of cross-country growth rates with respect to resource abundance and dependence. We reject the linear model that is commonly-used in growth regressions in favor of a multiple-regime alternative. Using a formal sample-splitting method, we find that countries exhibit different behaviors with respect to natural resources depending on their initial level of development. In high-income countries, natural resources play only a minor role in explaining the differences in national growth rates. On the contrary, in low-income countries abundance seems to be a blessing but dependence restricts growth.
O11|Corporate Debt in Latin America and its Macroeconomic Implications|This paper provides an empirical analysis of nonfinancial corporate debt in six large Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru), distinguishing between bond-issuing and non-bond-issuing firms, and assessing the debt's macroeconomic implications. The paper uses a sample of 2,241 firms listed on the stock markets of their respective countries, comprising 34 sectors of economic activity for the period 2009-16. On the basis of liquidity, leverage, and profitability indicators, it shows that bond-issuing firms are in a worse financial position relative to non-bond-issuing firms. Using Minsky's hedge/speculative/Ponzi taxonomy for financial fragility, we argue that there is a larger share of firms that are in a speculative or Ponzi position relative to the hedge category. Also, the share of hedge bond-issuing firms declines over time. Finally, the paper presents the results of estimating a nonlinear threshold econometric model, which demonstrates that beyond a leverage threshold, firms' investment contracts while they increase their liquidity positions. This has important macroeconomic implications, since the listed and, in particular, bond-issuing firms (which tend to operate under high leverage levels) represent a significant share of assets and investment. This finding could account, in part, for the retrenchment in investment that the sample of countries included in the paper have experienced in the period under study and highlights the need to incorporate the international bond market in analyses of monetary transmission mechanisms.
O11|Economic Freedom and Religion: An Empirical Investigation|There has been much study of the consequences of economic freedom but, outside of the role of political institutions, there has been little study of the determinants of economic freedom. We investigate whether religion affects economic freedom. Our cross-sectional dataset includes 137 countries averaged over the period 2001-2010. Simple correlations show that Protestantism is associated with economic freedom, Islam is not, with Catholicism in between. The Protestant ethic requires economic freedom. Our empirical estimates, which include religiosity, political institutions, and other explanatory variables, confirm that Protestantism is most conducive to economic freedom.
O11|The productivity puzzle and misallocation: an Italian perspective|Productivity has recently slowed down in many economies around the world. A crucial challenge in understanding what lies behind this ‘productivity puzzle’ is the still short time span for which data can be analysed. An exception is Italy, where productivity growth started to stagnate 25 years ago. The Italian case can therefore offer useful insights to understand the global productivity slowdown. We find that resource misallocation has played a sizeable role in slowing down Italian productivity growth. If misallocation had remained at its 1995 level, in 2013 Italy’s aggregate productivity would have been 18% higher than its actual level. Misallocation has mainly risen within sectors rather than between them, increasing more in sectors where the world technological frontier has expanded faster. Relative specialization in those sectors explains the patterns of misallocation across geographical areas and firm size classes. The broader message is that an important part of the explanation of the productivity puzzle may lie in the rising difficulty of reallocating resources across firms within sectors where technology is changing faster rather than between sectors with different speeds of technological change.
O11|Negative interest rates on deposit facility in the Eurozone: a failed attempt to revive the unsecured interbank market|The paper reviews the negative deposit facility introduction in the Eurozone and tries to explain the rationale behind that decision. The usual explanation that the negative rate on deposit facility improves the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and contributes to the economic recovery of the area is rejected. In turn the rationale for such a policy is found in the interbank market. The malfunctioning of the interbank market among European banks dates back to the inception of the global financial crisis in 2007. The negative deposit facility rate is inserted in the frame of the monetary policy conducted by the ECB since then. Rather than being a conventional policy as some scholars have argued that policy is considered in this paper deeply unconventional because it does not target any more the overnight interest rate as the interbank market has practically lost in importance and size. The negative policy rate thus appears as an extreme attempt at reviving the unsecured interbank market, which, however, has failed.
O11|The market Size Effect in Endogenous Growth Reconsidered|"This paper aims at disentangling two effects of the labor supply size on long-run growth that are traditionally undistinguishable under preference homotheticity: a scale effect, and a market size effect. To reach this goal, we present two horizontal-innovation models of endogenous growth with non-homothetic preferences. We demonstrate in particular that in such set-ups, keeping the economy's total effective labor supply constant, a ""richer"" country (i.e., with higher labor productivity and a smaller labor force) grows faster than a ""poorer"" country (i.e., with lower labor productivity and a larger labor force), leading the two countries to diverge"
O11|Social Interactions and Modern Economic Growth|This paper offers a theoretical framework to understand the coevolution of social interactions and long-term economic growth. It begins by considering that most traditional societies did not have educational markets. Thus, access to the required knowledge for transiting to a modern economy had to be transmitted through social interactions, in particular, through the interaction between heterogeneous groups of people–i.e. distant interactions. Once immersed in a modern economy, the productive system should have increased the demand for knowledge, promoting more distant interactions. Simultaneously, the emergence of distant interactions should have affected the connectivity of society, reducing its heterogeneity, making cheaper posterior interactions but reducing their profitability. Moreover, social interactions competed and benefited from other nonmarket activities, child rearing specifically. The model arrives at four basic predictions. First, modern economic growth brings a more cohesive society. Second, modern economic growth brings long-term reductions in fertility with potential short-term increases. Third, initial barriers to social interactions could explain the timing of modern economic growth arrival. Fourth, the timing of modern economic growth arrival could explain current output levels. I exploit different data sources to offer evidence in support of these predictions.
O11|The Welfare Effects of Encouraging Rural-Urban Migration|This paper studies the welfare effects of encouraging rural-urban migration in the developing world. To do so, we build a dynamic incomplete-markets model of migration in which heterogeneous agents face seasonal income fluctuations, stochastic income shocks, and disutility of migration that depends on past migration experience. We calibrate the model to replicate a field experiment that subsidized migration in rural Bangladesh, leading to significant increases in both migration rates and consumption for induced migrants. The model’s welfare predictions for migration subsidies are driven by two main features of the model and data: first, induced migrants tend to be negatively selected on income and assets; second, the model’s non-monetary disutility of migration is substantial, which we validate using newly collected survey data from this same experimental sample. The average welfare gains are similar in magnitude to those obtained from an unconditional cash transfer, and greater than from policies that discourage migration, though migration subsidies lead to larger gains for the poorest households, which have the greatest propensity to migrate.
O11|Demographics and FDI: Lessons from China’s One-Child Policy|Lucas (1990) argues that the neoclassical adjustment process fails to explain the relative paucity of FDI inflows from rich to poor countries. In this paper we consider a natural experiment: using China as the treated country and India as the control, we show that the dynamics of the relative FDI flows subsequent to the implementation of China’s one-child policy, as seen in the data, are consistent with neoclassical fundamentals. In particular, following the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the capital-labor (K/L) ratio of China increased relative to that of India, and, simultaneously, relative FDI inflows into China vs. India declined. These observations are explained in the context of a simple neoclassical OLG paradigm. The adjustment mechanism works as follows: the reduction in the (urban) labor force due to the one-child policy increases the savings per capita. This increases the K/L ratio and reduces the marginal product of capital (MPK). The reduction in MPK (relative to India) reduces the relative attractiveness of investment in China and is thus associated with lower FDI/GDP ratios. Our paper contributes to the nascent literature exploring demographic transitions and their effects on FDI flows.
O11|Geography and Agricultural Productivity: Cross-Country Evidence from Micro Plot-Level Data|What accounts for the extremely low agricultural productivity in poor countries? We assess the quantitative role of geography and land quality for agricultural productivity differences across countries using high-resolution micro-geography data and a simple spatial accounting framework. Our rich spatial data provide in each plot of land covering the entire globe actual yields for crops produced and potential yields for 18 main crops that account for soil quality, climate conditions, and terrain topography. There is considerable heterogeneity in land quality across space, even within narrow geographic regions. Yet, we find that low agricultural productivity in poor countries is not due to poor land endowments. If countries produced current crops according to potential yields, the rich-poor agricultural yield gap would virtually disappear, from more than 200 percent to less than 5 percent. If in addition countries produced in each location the crop with the highest potential yield, the yield gap turns into a gain of 23 percent. Our evidence indicates that the rich-poor yield gap is mostly due to low efficiency in producing existing crops within plots in poor countries, with a smaller role for the composition of crops within plots and the distribution of crop production across plots within countries.
O11|Financial frictions and the rule of law|Using cross-country micro establishment-level data we document that crime and lack of access to finance are two major obstacles to business operation in poor and developing countries. In an otherwise standard model of production heterogeneity that integrates institutional differences in the degree of financial development and the rule of law, we quantify the effects of these institutions on aggregate outcomes and economic development. The model accounts for the patterns across establishments in access to finance and crime as obstacles to their operation. Weaker financial development and rule of law have substantial negative effects on aggregate output, reducing output per capita by 50 percent. Weak rule-of-law institutions substantially amplify the negative impact of financial frictions. While financial markets are crucial for development, an essential precondition to reap the gains from financial liberalization is that property rights are secure.
O11|Structural Change in Investment and Consumption: A Unified Approach|Existing models of structural change typically assume that all of investment is produced in the goods sector. We show that this assumption is strongly counterfactual: in the postwar US, the share of services value added in investment expenditure has been steadily growing and now exceeds that of goods value added. We build a new model, which takes a unified approach to structural change in investment and consumption and yields to three new insights. First, for empirically plausible parameter values technological change is endogenously investment specific. Second, constant TFP growth in all sectors is inconsistent with structural change happening along aggregate balanced growth path. Third, the sector with the slowest TFP growth absorbs all resources asymptotically.
O11|Spatial Competition, Innovation and Institutions: The Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence|Why do some countries industrialize much earlier than others? One widely-accepted answer is that markets need to be large enough for producers to find it profitable to bear the fixed cost of introducing modern technologies. This insight, however, has limited explanatory power, as illustrated by England having industrialized nearly two centuries before China. This paper argues that a market-size-only theory is insufficient because it ignores that many of the modern technologies associated with the Industrial Revolution were fiercely resisted by skilled craftsmen who expected a reduction in earnings. Once we take into account the incentives to resist by factor suppliers' organizations such as craft guilds, we theoretically show that industrialization no longer depends on market size, but on the degree of spatial competition between the guilds' jurisdictions. We substantiate the relevance of our theory for the timing of industrialization in England and China (i) by providing historical and empirical evidence on the relation between spatial competition, craft guilds and innovation, and (ii) by showing that a model of our theory calibrated to historical data on spatial competition correctly predicts the timing of industrialization in both countries. The theory can therefore account for both the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence.
O11|Two Blades of Grass: The Impact of the Green Revolution|We examine the impact of the Green Revolution, defined as the discusion of high-yielding crop varieties (HYVs), on aggregate economic outcomes in developing countries during the second half of the 20th century. We use time variation in the development and discusion of HYVs of 10 major crops, and the spatial variation in agro-climatically suitability for growing them, to identify the causal effects of adoption. In a sample of 84 counties, we estimate that a 10 percentage points increase in HYV adoption increases GDP per capita by about 15 percent. This effect is fully accounted for by a combination of the direct effect on crop yields, factor adjustment in agriculture, and structural transformation. Our analysis also reveals that the Green Revolution reduced fertility and that the reduction was only partly ofset by decreasing mortality rates. The net effect on population growth was therefore negative.
O11|Misallocation in the Market for Inputs: Enforcement and the Organization of Production|The strength of contract enforcement determines how firms source inputs and organize production. Using microdata on Indian manufacturing plants, we show that production and sourcing decisions appear systematically distorted in states with weaker enforcement. Specifically, we document that in industries that tend to rely more heavily on relationship-specific intermediate inputs, plants in states with more congested courts shift their expenditures away from intermediate inputs and appear to be more vertically integrated. To quantify the impact of these distortions on aggregate productivity, we construct a model in which plants have several ways of producing, each with different bundles of inputs. Weak enforcement exacerbates a holdup problem that arises when using inputs that require customization, distorting both the intensive and extensive margins of input use. The equilibrium organization of production and the network structure of input-output linkages arise endogenously from the producers' simultaneous cost minimization decisions. We identify the structural parameters that govern enforcement frictions from cross-state variation in the first moments of producers' cost shares. A set of counterfactuals show that enforcement frictions lower aggregate productivity to an extent that is relevant on the macro scale.
O11|Unemployment and Development|This paper draws on household survey data from countries of all income levels to measure how average unemployment rates vary with income per capita. We document that unemployment is increasing with GDP per capita. Furthermore, we show that this fact is accounted for almost entirely by low-educated workers, whose unemployment rates are strongly increasing in GDP per capita, rather than by high-educated workers, whose unemployment rates are not correlated with income. To interpret these facts, we build a model with workers of heterogeneous ability and two sectors: a traditional sector, in which self-employed workers produce output without reward for ability; and a modern sector, in which firms hire in frictional labor markets, and output increases with ability. Countries differ exogenously in the productivity level of the modern sector. The model predicts that as productivity rises, the traditional sector shrinks, as progressively less-able workers enter the modern sector, leading to a rise in overall unemployment and in the ratio of low-educated to high-educated unemployment rates. Quantitatively, the model accounts for around one third of the cross-country patterns we document.
O11|Macroeconomic Consequences of Tariffs|We study the macroeconomic consequences of tariffs. We estimate impulse response functions from local projections using a panel of annual data that spans 151 countries over 1963-2014. We find that tariff increases lead, in the medium term, to economically and statistically significant declines in domestic output and productivity. Tariff increases also result in more unemployment, higher inequality, and real exchange rate appreciation, but only small effects on the trade balance. The effects on output and productivity tend to be magnified when tariffs rise during expansions, for advanced economies, and when tariffs go up, not down. Our results are robust to a large number of perturbations to our methodology, and we complement our analysis with industry-level data.
O11|Demographics and FDI: Lessons from China's one-child policy|"Following the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the capital-labor (K/L) ratio of China increased relative to that of India, and, simultaneously, FDI inflows relative to GDP for China versus India declined. These observations are explained in the context of a simple neoclassical OLG paradigm. The adjustment mechanism works as follows: the reduction in the growth rate of the (urban) labor force due to the one-child policy permanently increases the capital per worker inherited from the previous generation. The resulting increase in China's (domestic K)/L thus ""crowds out"" the need for FDI in China relative to India. Our paper is a contribution to the nascent literature exploring demographic transitions and their effects on FDI flows."
O11|Finland’s Growth Performance – The Lost Decade and the Prospects in the Near Term|Abstract In the report we analyse the reasons for the weakness of Finland’s economic performance over the past decade and assess the growth prospects in the coming 5 years. The weakness of Finland’s performance relative to comparative EU-countries since 2009 can largely be explained by the collapse of Nokia’s production and the deterioration of cost competitiveness. The recovery in turn stems from a stronger export market growth, the fading away of the negative Nokia shock, and the improvement of cost competitiveness. Of the rise of employment by some 100 000 jobs since 2015 about half can be explained by a number of policy measures to increase labour supply and the so-called competitiveness pact. Based on a realistic assumption on productivity growth, we estimate that Finland could achieve an annual growth rate of about 2 per cent in the coming 5 years. This requires, nevertheless, that the employment rate increases by 2023 to the level reached by comparative countries. Although such a change would not be greater than what is taking place during the current government period, ambitious reforms are needed to achieve this.
O11|Population Aging and the Possibility of a Middle-Income Trap in Asia| We present three conditions for a demography-driven middle-income trap and show that many economies in East, South, and Southeast Asia satisfy all of them. The conditions involve (1) the support ratio of workers to consumers has an impact on economic growth, (2) economic development accompanies more investment in human capital and lower fertility due to the quantity–quality trade-off, and (3) a current low level of fertility corresponds to very low support ratios for keeping up with frontier economies in the long run. Panel analysis for 178 countries shows that (1) and (2) are satisfied for Asia with higher elasticity than others. As for (3), we set up a dynamic model for simulations, showing that approximately two-third of Asia’s developing countries have an unsustainable level of support ratios, implying possibility of a middle-income trap due to future demographic headwinds.
O11|Financial Inclusion: New Measurement and Cross-Country Impact Assessment|This paper introduces a new index of financial inclusion for 151 economies using principal component analysis to compute weights for aggregating 9 indicators of access, availability, and usage. It then assesses the impact of financial inclusion on poverty and income inequality. The results provide evidence that high and middle-high-income economies with high financial inclusion have significantly lower poverty, while no such relation exists for middle-low and low-income economies. The nonlinearities in the cross-country determinants and impacts of financial inclusion on poverty and income inequality across income groups are important to choosing the appropriate policies for achieving inclusive growth in different development stages.
O11|Deriving Macroeconomic Benefits from Public–Private Partnerships in Developing Asia|The provision of infrastructure and related services in developing Asia via public–private partnership (PPP) increased rapidly during the late 1990s. Theoretical arguments support the potential economic benefits of PPPs, but empirical evidence is thin. This paper develops a framework identifying channels through which economic gains can be derived from PPP arrangement. The framework helps derive an empirically tractable specification that examines how PPPs affect the aggregate economy. Empirical results suggest that increasing the ratio of PPP investment to GDP improves access to and quality of infrastructure services, and economic growth will potentially be higher. But this optimism is conditional, especially on the region’s efforts to further upgrade its technical and institutional capacity to handle complex PPP contracts.
O11|Does Regional Integration Matter for Inclusive Growth? Evidence from the Multidimensional Regional Integration Index|This paper employs a multidimensional approach to gauge the degree of regional integration and analyze impact on growth, inequality, and poverty. It constructs a multidimensional regional integration index (MDRII) series that embodies six key facets of regional integration: (i) trade and investment, (ii) money and finance, (iii) regional value chains, (iv) infrastructure and connectivity, (v) movement of people, and (vi) institutional and social integration. The MDRII confirms that regional integration is most advanced in the European Union which scores high in all six dimensions; Asia comes second with the largest contribution from infrastructure and connectivity. Empirical analysis suggests significant and positive development impact of regional integration even when trade and financial openness is controlled. The regional value chain, movement of people, and institutional and social integration dimensions have been significant drivers of economic growth. Infrastructure and connectivity improve income distribution. Overall integration alongside the dimensions of trade and investment, money and finance, and institutional and social integration appear to significantly and robustly reduce poverty.
O11|Structural Change with Public Educational Expenditure: Evidence from the People’s Republic of China|We make an early attempt to analyze the comprehensive relationship between public educational expenditure and structural change, which is often measured by labor transfer from agricultural sector to industrial sector in developing economies. We construct a two-sector general equilibrium model, showing that in the short term, public educational expenditure mainly acts to crowd out industrial capital accumulation and thus temporarily hinders structural change, while there is an inverted-U relationship between them in the long run, as public educational expenditure helps reduce educational cost of rural residents permanently. The hukou system of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) provides appropriate data to empirically identify this comprehensive relationship. The empirical evidence confirms the theoretical interpretations when we control for confounding factors, take endogeneity of public educational expenditure into account, and investigate the mechanisms behind the relationship. The PRC’s current level of public educational expenditure is still far from its optimal value, as indicated by the inverted-U relationship with structural change, suggesting that the PRC should increase spending on public education, especially for rural residents.
O11|Edb Economies: Positive Trends In Mutual Trade|World economic growth in 2017 was driven by an increase in business activity in both developed and key developing economies. In the context of falling deflation risk, as well as an improvement in unemployment – an important macroeconomic parameter – there has been a trend towards normalization of the US Federal Reserve System's monetary policy. The European Central Bank is also moving in the direction of reducing its quantitative easing program. Thus, monetary policy's supporting effect is gradually ending, but the system retains a lot of fiscal incentives to help accelerate economic growth. The rise in investment and the recovery of world trade in developed economies was the third component driving higher than expected growth in 2017. The world's positive economic growth trend drove a return to favorable conditions on world commodity markets. The average price for Brent crude in 2017 grew by 23.5% YoY. Prices for precious metals rose by 0.4% on average for the year, and non-precious metals grew by an average of 24.4%. Monetary policy in the main global economies will cease to be the main factor in supporting growth, but in Russia and other EDB countries, given current conditions, there is a chance to stimulate economic growth due to unprecedented low inflation and the possibility of a further lowering of the key rate. A softening of monetary policy in most of the region's countries will support investment activity. If a favorable external environment is maintained, positive trends can be expected to develop, including the restoration of foreign investment and growth of mutual trade between EDB countries. The increase in labor migrants' remittances will stimulate domestic demand in the region's economies, whose balance of payments largely depends on these transfers.
O11|Edb Economies: In Search Of New Growth Drivers|The extent of global protectionism risks became obvious in the first half of 2018. The US’s escalating trade dispute with the EU and China creates considerable risks to global economic growth, which brings additional risks of an energy price correction for the EDB countries. Apart from external economic risks, weakening existing growth drivers and the need for new sources to boost economic development become new and growing challenges facing the EDB countries. One of the possible steps under the present conditions can be some softening in fiscal policy. Prospects of a fiscal stimulus emerged this year with the Russian President’s executive orders issued in May to provide additional financing to high-priority sectors. Additional expenditures can amount to up to RUB 8 trillion by 2020. Amid growing energy prices, there was an increase in spending in Kazakhstan in 1Q 2018, by 13.5% YoY, compared to almost zero growth in the same period of the previous year. At the same time, social expenditures (+20% YoY), particularly on healthcare (+23.6% YoY), outpace overall expenditure growth. However, using the budget mechanism to stimulate economic activity has some limitations, including budget rules established in oil exporting countries, such as the RF. On the other hand, some countries, like Belarus and Armenia, need to reduce government debt. An increase in spending amid a rise in commodity prices may also increase EDB countries’ dependence on global economic conditions. Thus, in order to find additional growth drivers, the EDB countries have to take measures to increase efficiency and labor productivity in their economies and to improve the investment climate. Diminishing the share of the shadow economy can be a potential economic growth driver for the EDB countries. According to the IMF, the shadow economy in the EDB countries constitutes 32.8% of Kazakhstan’s GDP, 30.1% of Kyrgyzstan’s GDP, 32.4% of Belarus’s GDP, 37.8% of Tajikistan’s GDP, 36% of Armenia’s GDP, and 33.7% of Russia’s GDP. These estimates do not correspond to the countries’ official data due to differences in assessment methods applied. According to the Kazakhstan Statistics Committee, the shadow economy amounted to 25.8% of Kazakhstan’s GDP in 2016 and 23.8% of Kyrgyzstan’s GDP. However, all conditions currently exist to decrease it. By decreasing the shadow economy, it will be possible to increase budget revenues, distribute revenues more equally, and improve the business climate and economy in general.
O11|Еабр Макрообзор, Август 2018. Страны Еабр: Курс На Устойчивое Развитие|В начале августа внешние условия для стран ЕАБР ухудшились на фоне дальнейшей эскалации торговых ограничений и санкционного давления со стороны США. Дополнительным негативным фактором стал рост волатильности на развивающихся рынках, прежде всего в Турции, где национальная валюта продемонстрировала рекордное обесценение. Среди стран ЕАБР основное давление на себе испытали обменные курсы России и Казахстана – российский рубль в августе превышал 68,8 рублей за доллар США, отклонившись от уровня начала месяца на 9,1%, в то время как максимальное обесценение тенге ограничилось 4,3%. Для нейтрализации негативных внешних факторов ЦБ РФ приостановил закупки валюты для Минфина, но с 17 августа возобновил приобретение валюты, сигнализируя таким образом о снижении рисков. Следует отметить: несмотря на трудности для рубля, макроэкономические индикаторы российской экономики отличаются в выгодную сторону от показателей Турции и большинства других развивающихся рынков. В настоящее время в российской экономике наблюдаются двойные профициты – положительный бюджетный баланс подкрепляется накоплением фискальных и валютных резервов в условиях благоприятных цен на нефть. При этом инфляция близка к историческим минимумам на уровне немногим выше 2%. В рамках специального доклада к макрообзору коллектив авторов Евразийского фонда стабилизации и развития (ЕФСР) приводит свои оценки долговой устойчивости ряда стран ЕАБР/ЕФСР. Проведенный анализ свидетельствует о том, что рост долга в этих странах за 2009–2017 гг. во многом является следствием активного применения фискального стимула, при котором расходы бюджета поддерживались за счет заимствований правительства, «компенсирующих» выпадающие вследствие экономического спада налоговые доходы. В исследовании были проанализированы риск-факторы, которые могут повлиять на долговую устойчивость экономик региона в среднесрочном периоде, и сделан ряд выводов. Что касается экономического роста в регионе, то прогноз для стран – участниц ЕАБР на 2018 г. остался без изменений и составляет 2,1%. Основным драйвером роста в большинстве стран региона в текущем году стало расширение потребительского спроса на фоне увеличения денежных доходов населения и роста кредитования. Наблюдаемое по итогам II квартала замедление инфляционных процессов нашло отражение в пересмотре прогнозов по инфляции в сторону снижения в 2018 г. Так, прогноз по инфляции в Армении снижен с 4,1% до 2,2%, в Беларуси – с 6% до 5,1% и Таджикистане – с 4,2% до 2%. При этом в 2019 г. прогнозируется некоторое превышение инфляцией целевого ориентира в России до 4,9%.
O11|EDB Macroreview, December 2018. Macroeconomic Stability Tested|In 2018, the EDB member countries faced a number of challenges to regional macroeconomic stability. The main risks resulted from the global economic slowdown, growing protectionist trends in world trade and increased volatility in developing markets. Higher geopolitical tensions also had an impact on the regional macroeconomic situation. Despite the growing external challenges, the macroeconomic situation remained stable in the region, with most EDB countries’ fiscal policies aimed at achieving more sustainable economic growth and a balanced monetary policy. The favorable oil price during most of 2018 was another factor behind the improvement in the region’s economy. All the EDB member countries recorded positive growth rates in 2018, which we estimate at 2.0% overall. Inflation reached a record low and will stay within the central banks’ target ranges for 2018. The EDB member countries’ mutual trade grew by 12.5% versus January to September 2017. The 2017 and 2018 economic growth in the region was significantly assisted by eased monetary policies. Yet the recovery cycle is ending, while the inflationary risks are high. These factors combine to limit monetary policy’s ability to continue stimulating the economy. With the external risks mounting, it is increasingly important to find new sources of sustainable growth, in particular, by means of reforms intended to raise the economies’ efficiency and improve the investment climate. In the special report the team of authors gives recommendations concerning economic policy measures that might help overcome an economy’s structural and institutional limitations, taking Armenia as an example. Analysis of the structural gaps existing in Armenia allows us to identify the areas of reform that are being successful – as well as those which are lagging. In 2018, some member-states’ authorities initiated structural reforms. The Government of the Russian Federation announced a package of structural changes intended to stimulate sustainable growth of investment activity and pursue long-term social objectives. In Kazakhstan, presidential initiatives announced in the spring and fall of 2018 are largely intended to enhance the population’s welfare by improving the business environment and developing human capital. Such reforms may help improve the quality of Kazakhstan’s economic growth in the long run by making it more sustainable and based on an inclusive model of economic development.
O11|Geographical Scale, Industrial Diversity and Regional Economic Stability|The empirical relationship between economic diversity and economic stability varies when it is measured at different geographical scales. This paper evaluates the role of geographical scales in assessing this diversity-stability relationship among counties, states, Economic Areas (EAs), metropolitan counties and metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the contiguous U.S. When choosing geographical units to analyze regional economic structure, it is necessary that the geographical units be large enough in population and employment to quantify effectively the regional economic structure. In addition, this paper proposes that geographical units also should be functionally aggregated regions as they better represent spatial interactions than formal regions do, and they consider the possible temporal variations in the boundaries of regional economic structures.
O11|Financial Inclusion: New Measurement and Cross-Country Impact Assessment|This paper introduces a new index of financial inclusion for 151 economies using principal component analysis to compute weights for aggregating nine indicators of access, availability, and usage. It then assesses the impact of financial inclusion on poverty and income inequality. The results provide evidence that high- and middle-high-income economies with high financial inclusion have significantly lower poverty, while no such relation exists for middle-low and low-income economies. The nonlinearities in the cross-country determinants and impacts of financial inclusion on poverty and income inequality across income groups are important to choosing the appropriate policies for achieving inclusive growth in different development stages.
O11|Ethnic Diversity, Stressful Living Environment and International Trade|Ethnic diversity plays a crucial role in sustainable development of any country. But segregation, discrimination and bigotry are increasing gradually across the world and making it not much difference from prejudice to social exclusion. This empirical study aims to investigate whether existing ethnic or religious diversity may create a more stressful living environment by using the data of 187-countries i.e. 56-high income, 102-middle income and 29-low income countries of the world. The study concludes that ethnic diversity creates a more stressful living environment. However, negative standing of stressful living environment with international trade is witnessed through empirical observations. The study also found positive and significant relationship between ethnic diversity and stressful living environment. Despite the fact that diversity cannot be reduced, however; its effects can be minimized by providing equal opportunities and peaceful society which later ensures well-being of people by means of cohesiveness.
O11|A VAR evaluation of classical growth theory|"Over the past two decades, there have been numerous attempts in economic theory to model the historical regime of a Malthusian trap as well as the transition to growth in one coherent framework, or in other words, a unified growth theory. However, in most of these models, an important effect suggested by Malthus has been frequently omitted. By including what he had called ""the great preventive check"" in the traditional Malthusian model which is based on the principle of population, the principle of diminishing returns and the principle of labor division, the transition can be modelled in a very simple dynamic macroeconomic framework. The aim of this paper is to first construct and calibrate the suggested classical model and to eventually employ a conventional VAR-Method to provide evidence of the above principles using country-specific annual historical data on crude birth rate, crude death rate and GDP per capita growth rate. As a result, it is argued that emerging economies follow a universal macroeconomic pattern of development. A decreasing death rate is succeeded by a decreasing birth rate which at the same time induces GDP per capita to rise sustainably. The correspondingly advanced microeconomic theory suggests that increasing life expectancy tends to create a demographic structure that is much less prone to overpopulation."
O11|The Effects Of Major Sports Events On Economic Growth And Foreign Direct Investment Inflows: The Results Of Empirical Estimation|In the modern literature there is no consensus on the effects arising in countries as a result of hosting major sports events, namely the Olympic Games, FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship. This paper focuses on two aspects of the major sports events effects in the hosting country: on economic growth and foreign direct investment inflows. The estimated database includes indicators for all countries that hosted major sport events during 1970?2015. This paper confirms the hypotheses of positive effects both on economic growth and foreign direct investment in the hosting countries. Positive significant effects are found not only during the period of preparation to the event, but (what is more important) during the 4 to 12 year period after the event.
O11|Fertility Shocks and Equilibrium Marriage-Rate Dynamics|Why did the marriage probability of single females in France after World War 1 rise 50% above its pre-war average, despite a 33% drop in the male/female singles ratio? We conjecture that war-time disruption of the marriage market generated an abnormal abundance of men with relatively high marriage propensities. Our model of matching over the lifecycle, when calibrated to pre-war data and two war-time shocks, succeeds in matching the French time path under the additional assumption of a pro-natalist post-war preference shock. We conclude that endogeneity issues make the sex ratio a potentially unreliable indicator of female marriage prospects.
O11|Improving Child Health and Cognition: Evidence from a School-Based Nutrition Intervention in India|We present experimental evidence on the impact of delivering double-fortified salt (DFS), salt fortified with iron and iodine, through the Indian school-feeding program called “mid-day meal” on anemia, cognition, and math and reading outcomes of primary school children. We conducted a field experiment that randomly provided a one-year supply of DFS at a subsidized price to public primary schools in one of the poorest regions of India. The DFS treatment had significantly positive impacts on hemoglobin levels and reduced the prevalence of any form of anemia by 20 percent but these health gains did not translate into statistically significant impacts on cognition and test scores. While exploring the heterogeneity in effects, we find that treatment had statistically significant gains in anemia and test scores among children with higher treatment compliance. We further estimate that the intervention was very cost effective and can potentially be scaled up rather easily.
O11|Geographical Origins of Language Structures |This research explores the geographical origins of the coevolution of cultural and linguistic traits in the course of human history, relating the geographical roots of long-term orientation to the structure of the future tense, the agricultural determinants of gender bias to the presence of sex-based grammatical gender, and the ecological origins of hierarchical orientation to the existence of politeness distinctions. The study advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that: (i) variations in geographical characteristics that were conducive to higher natural return to agricultural investment contributed to the existing cross-language variations in the structure of the future tense, (ii) the agricultural determinants of gender gap in agricultural productivity fostered the existence of sex-based grammatical gender, and (iii) the ecological origins of hierarchical societies triggered the emergence of politeness distinctions.
O11|The Origins of the Division of Labor in Pre-modern Times|This research explores the historical roots of the division of labor in pre-modern societies. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that intra-ethnic diversity had a positive effect on the division of labor across ethnicities in the pre-modern era. Exploiting a variety of identification strategies and a novel ethnic level dataset combining geocoded ethnographic, linguistic and genetic data, it establishes that higher levels of intra-ethnic diversity were conducive to economic specialization in the pre-modern era. The findings are robust to a host of geographical, institutional, cultural and historical confounders, and suggest that variation in intra-ethnic diversity is the main predictor of the division of labor in pre-modern times.

O11|Migrants, Ancestors and Foreign Investments|We use 130 years of data on historical migrations to the United States to show a causal effect of the ancestry composition of US counties on foreign direct investment (FDI) sent and received by local firms. To isolate the causal effect of ancestry on FDI, we build a simple reduced-form model of migrations: Migrations from a foreign country to a US county at a given time depend on (i) a push factor, causing emigration from that foreign country to the entire United States, and (ii) a pull factor, causing immigration from all origins into that US county. The interaction between time-series variation in origin-specific push factors and destination-specific pull factors generates quasi-random variation in the allocation of migrants across US counties. We find that doubling the number of residents with ancestry from a given foreign country relative to the mean increases the probability that at least one local firm engages in FDI with that country by 4 percentage points. We present evidence that this effect is primarily driven by a reduction in information frictions, and not by better contract enforcement, taste similarities, or a convergence in factor endowments.
O11|South Asia’s March Towards Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals|This paper, prepared by ESCAP South and South-West Asia Office, is based on the report of the Second South Asia Forum on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) organized by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), in collaboration with the NITI Aayog (successor of the Planning Commission in India) and a premier Indian think tank Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS), on 4-5 October 2018 in New Delhi, India. Senior government officials, international and regional experts, civil society representatives, think tanks, academia and other stakeholders discussed key challenges, progress and priorities for implementation of the 2030 Agenda in South Asia and opportunities that South Asian member States could pursue to increase regional cooperation for achieving the SDGs. This paper summarizes the highlights of the discussion at the event and the key conclusions and policy lessons. South Asian countries have an opportunity to tackle many of their common development challenges, and accelerate their progress towards the SDGs, through enhanced regional cooperation for building up productive capacities, strengthening statistical systems, enhancing market integration, improving connectivity, climate action, and tackling shared vulnerabilities and risks. Among the key takeaways from the Forum was the identification of potential areas for greater regional cooperation and articulating the need for a regional framework for achievement of SDGs in South Asia that will be prioritized and implemented as a mandate of ESCAP-SSWA and its work in the subregion.
O11|Endogenous Childlessness and Stages of Development|Although developing countries are characterized by high average fertility rates, they are as concerned by childlessness as developed countries. Beyond natural sterility, there are two main types of childlessness: one driven by poverty and another by the high opportunity cost of childrearing. We measure the importance of the components of childlessness with a structural model of fertility and marriage. Deep parameters are identified using census data from 36 developing countries. As average education increases, poverty-driven childlessness first decreases to a minimum, and then the opportunity-driven part of childlessness increases. We show that neglecting the endogenous response of marriage and childlessness may lead to a poor understanding of the impact that social progress, such as universal primary education, may have on completed fertility. The same holds for family planning, closing the gender pay gap, and the eradication of child mortality.
O11|The transition of China to sustainable growth – implications for the global economy and the euro area|China’s rise has been the economic success story of the past four decades but economic growth has been slowing and domestic imbalances have widened. This paper analyses the recent evolution of China’s imbalances, the risks they pose to the economic outlook and the potential impact of a transition to sustainable growth in China on the global and euro area economies. The paper documents China’s heavy reliance on investment and credit as drivers of growth, which has created vulnerabilities in a number of sectors and has been accompanied by increased complexity and leverage in the financial system. China retains some buffers, including policy space, to cushion against adverse shocks for the time being, but additional structural reforms would facilitate a shift of China’s economy onto a sustainable and strong growth trajectory in the medium term. China’s size, trade openness, dominant position as consumer of commodities and growing financial integration mean that its transition to sustainable growth is crucial for the global economic outlook. Simulation analysis using global macro models suggests that the spillovers to the euro area would be limited in the case of a modest slowdown in China’s GDP growth, but significant in the case of a sharp downturn. Sensitivity analysis underscores that the spillovers are dependent on the strengths of the various transmission channels, as well as the policy reaction by central banks and governments.

O11|Real convergence in central, eastern and south-eastern Europe|This paper analyses real income convergence in central, eastern and south-eastern Europe (CESEE) to the most advanced EU economies between 2000 and 2016. The relevance of this topic stems both from the far-reaching implications of real income convergence for economic welfare and the importance of convergence for economic and monetary integration with, and within the European Union. The paper establishes stylised facts of convergence, analyses the drivers of economic growth and identifies factors that might explain the differences between fast- and slow-converging economies in the region. The results show that the most successful CESEE economies in terms of the pace of convergence share common characteristics such as, inter alia, a strong improvement in institutional quality and human capital, more outward-oriented economic policies, favourable demographic developments and the quick reallocation of labour from agriculture into other sectors. Looking ahead, accelerating and sustaining convergence in the region will require further efforts to enhance institutional quality and innovation, reinvigorate investment, and address the adverse impact of population ageing.

O11|The role of factor substitution and technical progress in China's great expansion|We offer a macroeconomic assessment of China’s Reform Period, highlighting several neglected channels underlining its great expansion. Estimating the supply side of the post-Reform economy reveals the relatively high (above unity) value of the elasticity of factor substitution and the time-varying pattern of factor-saving technical change. The latter we relate to trade, human capital and reallocation factors. We then demonstrate how, in addition to factor accumulation and technical progress, the above-unity elasticity of substitution can be a source of growth (the ‘de La Grandville hypothesis’). We then draw upon our estimated framework to rationalize China’s high and rising savings ratio as well as the dynamic nature of its convergence path. JEL Classification: D24, E13, O11
O11|The quest for pro-poor and inclusive growth: the role of governance| This paper analyses the role of good governance in fostering pro-poor and inclusive growth. Using a sample of 112 countries over 1975–2012, it shows that growth is generally pro-poor. However, growth has not been inclusive, as illustrated by a decline in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution. While all features of good governance support income growth and reduce poverty, only government effectiveness and the rule of law are found to enhance inclusive growth. The investigation of the determinants of pro-poor and inclusive growth highlights that education, infrastructure improvement, and financial development are the key factors in poverty reduction and inclusive growth. Relying on the panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) model, the paper identifies a nonlinear relationship between governance and pro-poor growth, while the impact of governance on inclusive growth appears to be linear.
O11|The role of Foreign Direct Investment in higher education in the developing countries (Does FDI promote education?)|This paper studies the impact of FDI inflows on higher education in developing countries for the period 1998-2008. A large panel of developing countries is analyzed using different econometric techniques and specifications. We find evidence of short-term negative effect of the FDI on tertiary education measured by school enrolment. The negative effect of FDI is confirmed for both secondary and tertiary education when measured as the adult population having acquired the level. Among other control variables, GDP, demographic growth and the services sector value added seem to have a significant impact on higher education. GDP and services value-added show the expected positive impact, while population growth appears to affect education enrollment and attainment negatively. The study highlights the need for considering the differential aspects of foreign investments’ nature and characteristics, rather than treating them as a cure-all pill for the developing countries’ development problem.
O11|CO2 mitigation in developing countries: the role of foreign aid|This paper empirically investigates the link between foreign aid and pollution, specifically CO2 emissions in developing countries. We use a more complete and recent dataset to re-assess the environmental impact of foreign aid. Focusing on 112 aid recipient countries over the period 1980 - 2013, we find that the effect of aid depends on the donor, with multilateral aid more likely to reduce pollution than bilateral aid for which we find no effect. However, when we more precisely look at the composition of bilateral aid, we find it has an effect when specifically targeted toward environment. This effect is non-linear, since we observe a pollution-reducing effect only for important amounts of bilateral environmental aid.
O11|Still a long way to go: decomposing income inequality across Italy’s regions, 1871 – 2011|This article is the first study to explore to what extent labour productivity, structural change, participation rates and the age structure of the population contributed to the pattern of Italy’s regional economic inequality over the long run (1871-2011). We provide brand new regional estimates of participation rates and age structures, as well as the most updated figures on per capita GDP, per worker GDP and the employment rate (at ten-year intervals spanning from 1871 to 2011). First, regional inequality in per capita GDP (Y/N) is split into labour productivity (Y/L) and labour-market features (L/N). Then, the Caselli-Tenreyro decomposition is used to explore whether labour-productivity convergence (or divergence) at the NUTS-1 level was determined within or between sectors, and by labour reallocation. While labour productivity was central to the pattern of Italy’s regional development until the 1970s, since then the key factor of North-South divergence has been the participation rate. The results confirm the central role of national and local policies, influencing per capita GDP via productivity, employment, and participation rates.
O11|Resilience to Economic Shrinking: A Social Capability Approach to Processes of Catching up in the Developing World 1951-2016|This paper highlights and assesses the importance of the role of economic shrinking for the long-term growth process in the developing world over the period 1951-2016. On the basis of descriptive analysis it shows that resilience to shrinking, even among the miracle economies in Pacific Asia, plays a more important role for successful catching up than economic growth per se. The paper then proposes and elaborates on a novel way of how to understand resilience to shrinking and argues that five interrelated social capabilities are of special significance: inclusive and broad based economic growth; engagement in more complex and transformative economic activities; generation of social arrangements for conflict resolution; the state’s autonomy against vested interests; and the state’s accountability in delivering public goods. The implication of the paper is that economic development would be better encouraged by strengthening these social capabilities rather than focusing on the short-term growth rate.
O11|The Welfare Effects of Encouraging Rural-Urban Migration|This paper studies the welfare effects of encouraging rural-urban migration in the developing world. To do so, we build a dynamic incomplete-markets model of migration in which heterogenous agents face seasonal income fluctuations, stochastic income shocks, and disutility of migration that depends on past migration experience. We calibrate the model to replicate a field experiment that subsidized migration in rural Bangladesh, leading to significant increases in both migration rates and in consumption for induced migrants. The model’s welfare predictions for migration subsidies are driven by two main features of the model and data: first, induced migrants tend to be negatively selected on income and assets; second, the model’s non-monetary disutility of migration is substantial, which we validate using using newly collected survey data from this same experimental sample. The average welfare gains are similar in magnitude to those obtained from an unconditional cash transfer, though migration subsidies lead to larger gains for the poorest households, which have the greatest propensity to migrate.
O11|Unemployment and Development|This paper draws on household survey data from countries of all income levels to measure how average unemployment rates vary with income per capita. We document that unemployment is increasing with GDP per capita. Furthermore, we show that this fact is accounted for almost entirely by low-educated workers, whose unemployment rates are strongly increasing in GDP per capita, rather than by high-educated workers, whose unemployment rates are not correlated with income. To interpret these facts, we build a model with workers of heterogeneous ability and two sectors: a traditional sector, in which self-employed workers produce output without reward for ability; and a modern sector, in which firms hire in frictional labor markets, and output increases with ability. Countries differ exogenously in the productivity level of the modern sector. The model predicts that as productivity rises, the traditional sector shrinks, as progressively less-able workers enter the modern sector, leading to a rise in overall unemployment and in the ratio of low-educated to high-educated unemployment rates. Quantitatively, the model accounts for around one third of the cross-country patterns we document.
O11|Agricultural Productivity and Structural Change: Is Relative Sectoral Price the Mirror Image of Relative Sectoral Productivity?|We have examined the role of sectoral productivity in explaining the process of structural change and relative sectoral prices. Our simple two- sector general equilibrium model demonstrates that an improvement in agricultural productivity can relocate labour away from this sector. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that relative sectoral prices are a mirror image of relative sectoral productivities, we showed a U-shaped relation- ship between them. We estimated our model parameters using the simu- lated method of moments. Our model could largely replicate the farm versus non-farm relative price movement and the agricultural labour share of US economic history. JEL Classification: F43, O11, O41.

O11|Growth, Inequality, and Poverty : A Robust Relationship?|An extensive literature on poverty traps suggests that high levels of poverty deter growth. However, a seemingly basic implication of the underlying theoretical models, namely that countries suffering from higher levels of poverty should grow less rapidly, has remained untested. A parallel literature has suggested a variety of mechanisms through which inequality may affect growth in opposing directions. Because inequality and poverty are different aspects of the income distribution, inequality can also affect growth through poverty, an indirect channel that has not been explicitly analyzed. This paper contributes to fill both gaps. Using a large cross-country panel data set, it estimates a reduced-form growth equation adding both inequality and poverty to an otherwise standard set of growth determinants. Given inequality, the correlation of growth with poverty is consistently negative. In contrast, given poverty, the correlation of growth with inequality can be positive or negative, depending on the empirical specification and econometric approach used. Yet, the indirect effect of inequality on growth through its correlation with poverty is robustly negative. Closer inspection shows that these results are driven by the sample observations featuring high (but not extremely high) poverty rates. These empirical findings are consistent with the predictions from an analytical framework with learning-by-doing and knowledge spillovers, in which consumers cannot save and invest if their initial endowment is below a minimum consumption level.

O11|Does Country Size Affect the Relationship between Population Density and Labour Productivity? Theory and Evidence for Europe|The empirical literature on the relationship between labour productivity and urbanisation economies has considered the presence of variable returns to density, but it has not investigated the existence of a heterogeneous relationship according to country size. This paper proposes a theoretical model which can explain why the relationship between regional labour productivity and population density may differ in strength between small and large countries. To test the proposed theory, we carry out an empirical regression analysis using NUTS2-level data on GDP per capita and population density for the EU28 countries. The results from the empirical analysis corroborate the theoretical model and indicate the relationship is linear and stronger for regions in small countries compared to large countries.
O11|The Macroeconomic Effects of Public Debt: An Empirical Analysis of Mozambique|Public debt has been rising markedly over the years, which suggests an increase in public expenditure financed by debt instead of taxation. There is no consensus on the economic implications of borrowing to finance public expenditure. We assess empirically the macroeconomic effects of public debt for the case of Mozambique over the period of 2000Q1-2016Q4. We use a Vector Autoregression model to assess these effects through impulse response functions and variance decomposition. We conclude that debt service variables have much more negative effects on this economy than debt variables. Debt variables over the period of this study had no significant impact on the real output and the debt service component depressed the real output, increased the general price level and accounted for the depreciation on the domestic currency.
