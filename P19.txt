P19|Understanding the Course of Social Reality|This book offers a comparison between our earthly society and the society of a hypothetical twin planet with the aim to understand and deal with some of the main problems of our global society, as well as to advance interaction with some extra-terrestrial society no less advanced than ours that sooner or later will be discovered. The underlying premise of the book is that the contemporary world finds itself in what may well be the most confused age of human history. Growing technological changes and innovation make it difficult to understand the course of social reality, while the intensification of the relations between different regions of the Earth and the power achieved by financial capital on a world scale amplify the dimensions and visibility of disequilibria and iniquities, and sharpen frustration and sentiments of insecurity. Social thought, as it has developed at the service of a quasi-stationary world, lacks the ability to understand and govern the tumultuous economic and social processes in progress. The most efficacious way to meet this fleeting social reality is to scientifically highlight basic institutions and values and their steady changes caused by the accumulation of creative and choice processes. In doing so, long-run trends can be explored in order to understand and manage the disequilibrating-reequilibrating motion characterizing the life of dynamic societies. This book shows the ‘necessity’ of institutional and ethical transformations utilizing a utopian flavour.
P19|As Evidenced by Theage-old Dynamics of Indicators of Major Rail System<BR>[О Чем Свидетельствует Столетняя Динамика Показателей Крупнейших Железнодорожных Систем]|The article compared results of economic development in terms of market mechanisms and centralized planning, based on an analysis of key indicators of the domestic and North American railroads for the century-long period. It was revealed that the higher and more sustainable dynamics of volume indicators, achieved in certain periods in a centrally planned economy does not show its advantages in comparison with the market economy, which is characterized by cyclical. It is shown that on the basis of centralized planning and control can not be implemented the strategy of “catching up development”. At the same time it found that the degree of success ensuring productive use of various resources in the framework of centralized planning and control is inversely proportional to their importance in the modern economy. This demonstrates the impossibility of the effective implementation of such methods of economic management. In conditions of market relations ensured advancing more efficient use of the main economic resource of our time — human capital. It is showing positive results of economic reforms in the railway transport. Made the conclusion about the necessity of development of market mechanisms and institutional framework (in particular, the removal of restrictions on the involvement of private capital in the development of the existing rail infrastructure) for the successful solution of problems of the Russian railway sector and the entire economy
P19|Crecimiento económico colombiano, 1950-2010: Una aproximación desde los sistemas sociales de innovación y de producción|Este trabajo aborda, desde el enfoque de Sistemas Sociales de Innovación y de Producción –SSIP-, el crecimiento económico colombiano entre 1950-2010, periodo que se subdivide en los periodos 1950-1990 y 1990-2010. La investigación muestra que el crecimiento de largo plazo es el resultado de las características, las interacciones y las complementariedades que se dan entre los subsistemas que componen la economía. Entre 1950-1990, los subsistemas que componen la economía colombiana no siempre interactuaron o lo hicieron de forma débil, lo que implicó que éstos no siempre se complementaran o se complementaran débilmente, lo que explica el crecimiento promedio del 5% observado de la economía en este periodo. Desde finales de la década de 1980, el país introdujo un conjunto de reformas que significaron un viraje en el manejo de la economía que modificó las características, las interacciones y las complementariedades que existían entre los subsistemas, lo que significó un cambio del modelo de producción. Sin embargo, el viraje dado a la economía no dinamizó las interacciones y complementariedades entre los subsistemas. Para este segundo periodo, el crecimiento promedio de la economía fue de 3.6%. La investigación muestra que el crecimiento económico no es un problema del modelo económico que se adopte, sino de las características, interacciones y conjunto de complementariedades que se den entre los diferentes subsistemas que lo componen.
P19|The Limitations of Reductive Wealth Redistribution Strategies for Curtailing Inequality in the Era of Global Capitalism|Poverty and inequality are in all likelihood the most pernicious problems in contemporary life. They contribute greatly to a wide and diverse range of suffering, injustice, and social ills. They have existed since the incipient forms of society emerged, and have plagued nearly every society. They have provoked criticism and resistance across millennia and geographic regions, and were inciting factors for many revolutions and social movements. There is evidence that inequality is rising globally, with economic growth and global capitalism as the primary culprits. Marx’s theory of infinite accumulation and Ricardo’s scarcity principle relate inherent structural qualities of wealth in capitalism to inequality and divergence in income and wealth. Abundant evidence shows that inequality will continue to increase unless there are political and economic measures to oppose it, and that inequality has increased since industrialization. The aims of these strategies is to promote income convergence, usually via reforms to taxes, redistribution, or minimum wage. Two of the most prominent proposals to curtail inequality are Piketty’s global tax rate and Standing’s basic income. However, neither sufficiently accounts for structural limitations in capitalism, such as those described by Marx and Ricardo, as well as Piketty’s study of greater growth rate of capital over income (r>g) and free market ideology. They fundamentally rely upon reductive redistribution and particularly money and income, which do not necessarily contribute to parity in wealth. In structural Marxism, inequality is created and perpetuated by the structural base and super-structure, and both must be somehow reformed or altered to achieve lasting and significant equality. In this paper, I approach inequality with this in mind, and propose a form of paternalism as a means of ensuring wealth redistribution achieves lasting equality.
P19|The Crisis of the Prato Industrial District in the Works of Edoardo Nesi: a Blend of Nostalgia and Self-complacency|In 2011, Edoardo Nesi - a former industrialist of the Prato textile district - won the most prestigious Italian literary Prize for his autobiographical novel Storia della mia gente, a book centered upon Prato's past industrial success and present decline. Nesi has since become a regular contributor to the Corriere della Sera, and with his latest book, Le nostre vite senza ieri, he has further emphasized his role as a public intellectual. In Nesi's view, Italy's participation in the global economy has exposed Italian manufacturers to a level of competition that they were not ready to meet. Such disadvantage, Nesi contends, was exacerbated by the adoption of the euro, which put an end to the former practice of using monetary policy to offset trade deficits. As a result, many firms lost market shares, and the Prato textile district ended up being largely taken over by Chinese businesses. This paper criticizes Nesi's account of the Italian industrial decline. In particular, it argues that his sympathetic view of the former political-industrial system is mostly an expression of self-complacency and does not positively contribute to the current debates on the Italian economic crisis.
P19|The impact of local political applications on voter choices|Voters are under the influence of several factors when they vote at the local elections, so they determine the color of their vote and realize the act of voting considering these factors. Undoubtedly, the most important of these factors is the practice of political marketing. The concept of political marketing is a conceptual and factual matter entering into life of people and gaining importance with ever increasing competition in globalizing world, personal differences, diversify of expectations and requirements. This understanding, differently from the traditional marketing, aims at developing ideas and internalization of these ideas by the targeted group. Because this understanding constitutes the base of political marketing practices, in which ideas and opinions are marketed. Since political competition is very intensive at the present conditions and political parties struggle to create awareness in the minds of targeted voters by taking advantage of these political works, at the present time there is practically no party that doesn't put into effect its political marketing works in an effective way. It seems to be utopic to achieve success for political parties which donâ€™t use effectively these practices. Because political marketing sociology is fed with such science disciplines as psychology and social psychology that research and try to explain human and human behaviors. To understand voters and make acts and promises which will meet their expectations and requirements are the main indicators of political marketing practices. The conceptual and institutional framework for local political marketing is represented in this work, but the influence of political marketing practices on voters, which were applied at local elections, is tried to be determined by a public survey conducted in Isparta province.

P19|The European Cooperative Society - Juridical Adequate Instrument In The Development Of The Cooperatives? Transnational Activities. Possibilities Of Implementing The Concept Within Romania|The lack of public understanding regarding the role and impact of cooperatives upon welfare implies not recognizing cooperatives as a form of entrepreneurial activity. There is an obvious need to overcome the contradiction between reality and recognizing cooperatives. The European Community, wishing to guarantee equality of conditions in competition and to contribute to its economic development, should supply the cooperatives with adequate juridical instruments, capable to facilitate the development of their transnational activities. The current paper sets out to follow the implementation mode within the Romanian and European area of the regulation regarding the European cooperative society (SCE).
P19|The Development Of The Cooperative Sector Within The European And Romanian Area|The current study sets out to analyze the cooperative sector throughout several decades, both in the European and the Romanian area. After a presentation of the definitions and characteristics specific to the cooperative societies, as well as the principles and methods of the cooperative organization, this study goes through the defining elements of a cooperative in the European Union and Romania. Given the geo-political conditions encountered in the Romanian space, our attention was focused particularly on the opportunities and limitations encountered in the development of the sector for the future.
P19|Humanization: Explaining the Law of Cooperatives in India|International Cooperative Alliance defines a cooperative as an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise. Cooperatives are based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity, mutual cooperation, and solidarity. Members of the cooperative society believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring for others. Cooperatives enterprises across the globe provide economic values coupled with social flavor. Cooperatives provide an important channel for bridging market values and human values. If set within an agreed framework for inclusive growth, cooperative ideals and cooperative organization will be more effective in meeting their people-centered objectives. Cooperatives run for economic reasons but also enhance humanization. Several models of cooperatives across the globe are engaged in various activities. Cooperatives in one continent may be different in terms of size, business volume, model, economic emphasise and activities than other continents, but one thing is unique; cooperatives main axle is humanization. We discuss the provision of Cooperative Societies Act.
P19|Contracting for Innovation under Knightian Uncertainty|At any given point in time, the collection of assets existing in the economy is observable. Each asset is a function of a set of contingencies. The union taken over all assets of these contingencies is what we call the set of publicly known states. An innovation is a set of states that are not publicly known along with an asset (in a broad sense) that pays contingent on those states. The creator of an innovation is an entrepreneur. He is represented by a probability measure on the set of new states. All other agents perceive the innovation as ambiguous: each of them is represented by a set of probabilities on the new states. The agents in the economy are classified with respect to their attitude towards this Ambiguity: the financiers are (locally) Ambiguity-seeking while the consumers are Ambiguity-averse. An entrepreneur and a financier come together when the former seeks funds to implement his project and the latter seeks new profit opportunities. The resulting contracting problem does not fall within the standard theory due to the presence of Ambiguity (on the financier’s side) and to the heterogeneity in the parties’ beliefs. We prove existence and monotonicity (i.e., truthful revelation) of an optimal contract. We characterize such a contract under the additional assumption that the financiers are globally Ambiguity-seeking. Finally, we re-formulate our results in an insurance framework and extend the classical result of Arrow [4] and the more recent one of Ghossoub [24]. In the case of an Ambiguity-averse insurer, we also show that an optimal contract has the form of a generalized deductible.
P19|The Environmental Contingencies Of Knowledge Dissemination: The Case Of Consultancies In International Development|"This paper explores the impact of context on forms of knowledge dissemination using secondary data concerning the role of management consultants in international development. It identifies three forms of consultancy intervention (forced, invited, humanitarian) which differ considerably in the power of the client, the knowledge maturity of the consultancy, the frequency and complexity of the project. The combination of these factors, we argue, strongly influences the type of knowledge dissemination found in the different types of projects. It is hypothesised that knowledge transfer will be most common in ""forced projects"", knowledge translation in ""invited projects"" and knowledge evolution in ""humanitarian projects""."

P19|Avance para una Arqueología del Capitalismo en Chile (1880-1930)|This paper presents a brief story about the initial development of the capitalism in Chile emphasizing on the structural conditions that would have given as a result new social and political actors (industrial bourgeoisie and proletariat). This process should have been the basis if a deep reconfiguration of the economy, social relationship, politics and culture in Chile during the beginning or the XX century. Following in that direction we express the necessity of the elaboration of an interpretative and methodological model about the study of the material remains of capitalist societies. We propose a reinterpretation of the industrial material culture from a perspective that takes in account the relationship (not only in one way) among production mode, social relationships and the ways of perception and construction of the space, where the relationship between work-capital and nature-capital would be the basis of this statement. From this point of view the constitution of industrial landscape and its connection with working enforcement and the development of the first way of class struggle in the modern world should be understood from a new theoretical frame according to the social practices and the experience of each historical individual.
P19|Tengri on Mars|What would happen if every individual knew what to do, and did, without prompting or expecting a reward? Is that not what the authors of Republic and Utopia had in mind? Is that not the primary justification of theocracies? The immediate objection to that postulate is that human nature is not suitable for team activities at all times. There is such a conception as individualism and that is the quality abetting creativity that marks humanism. Besides, the definition of human rights guarantees freedom of choice not to cooperate if one chooses against it.
P19|Gobernanza y crisis del neoliberalismo|"The current financial crisis, hitting the very nucleus of capitalist metropolis and placing its roots and causes at the spheres (financial and commercial ones) that have been privileged by neo-liberals, is another sample of the scarce or nonexistent viability of neo-liberal projects, having in mind previous financial crisis in so-called ""Newly Industrialized Countries"" (Mexico, East Asia, Russia, Turkey, Argentina, etc.) Paradoxically, those defending social costs reductions and public expenditure, in favour to most vulnerable ones, and toward the reduction of public powers intervention with redistributional aims, now find themselves with the pocket full of public resources, thanks to politicians' decisions, once again obeying their actual mentors."
P19|Nonwaged peasants in the modern world-system: African households as dialectical units of capitalist exploitation and indigenous resistance, 1890-1930|Colonialism did not transform African peasants into waged labor. A majority of peasants worked as forced laborers, often unpaid, and they returned to their agricultural household labor as soon as they completed work assignments mandated by the colonizers. Colonial Africans resided in mixed livelihood households in which nonwaged labor forms (both free and unfree) predominated, and very few became dependent on wages. For a majority of colonial Africans, informal sector activities, tenancy, sharecropping, and subsistence production on communal plots were not temporary nonwaged forms on an inevitable path toward proletarianization. Wage earning was not the primary mechanism through which these households were integrated into the modern world-system. Instead, these households primarily provided nonwaged labors to capitalist commodity chains that, in turn, extracted surpluses from them and externalized costs of production to them.
P19|New requirements for higher education, academic freedom and business interests|"Academic freedom poses an important problem in the current higher education system, which has an European scope. As it has been granted as a fundamental human right in all countries belonging to the so-called ""common area"", academic freedom exercise opposes to specific features in the regulation reform, which seem to be aimed to favor certain private business interests. The pretended advanced and innovative teaching methodologies and the institutional actions and proceedings aimed to limit this right and guarantee face the constitutional order in these countries and harm the very right to education."
P19|Social Preferences and the Third Sector: Looking for a Microeconomic Foundation of the Local Development Path|The aim of the paper is to endorse the principle, recurrent in non-profit literature, that the third sector is an institution that supports the development process of economic systems. The third sector is considered as an institution that ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂfavors, transmits and cementsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the role of social preferences in a given economy and, in this way, it contributes to development. The paper thus considers two stances taken up in economic theory: (i) the theory of social preferences; (ii) the modern theory of development. These two stances do not exclusively and specifically refer to the third sector, and they generally follow parallel paths, rarely being aware of each other: in the paper, the third sector is assumed to form a bridge between them in that social preferences are supposed to be one of the driving forces in the change process of an economy.
P19|Goodwill Capitalism|Markets have been treating money as another commodity, trading it, speculating on its value and finding innovative ways to multiply its supply. In it's current form, it has lost it's power to regulate anything at all in the markets, including demand and supply. Combined with profit motives, it encourages short term strategies at the expense of depleting natural resources and discouraging long term investments in social and human capital. Goodwill Capitalism monetizes social capital and introduces a market mechanism to minimize social impact of economic crises.
P19|Una aproximación a la transición desde el capitalismo al postcapitalismo|This work intends to contribute to post-capitalism debate, by mean of an historical approach. Influent Features and Variables are analyzed in relation to transition processes toward post?capitalism. In post-capitalist rationality, priority is given to political issues above economic ones and participative democratic forms are fueled. Collective action is a response to the problem of the individual in post-industrial societies.
P19|Structural Violence as a Form of Genocide. The Impact of the International Economic Order|Structural violence is rarely seen as a form of genocide. Significant deficiencies in existing conceptualizations of both genocide and structural violence suggest that this is unwarranted. The concept of genocide must be expanded to include a wider variety of target human groups, whereas the concept of structural violence must be extended to include a greater appreciation of the role of agential intent in the production and reproduction of unequal violent structures. This reveals logical and analytical connections between structural violence and genocide in several historical cases, including episodes of capitalist imperialism and communist collectivization. Applying this theoretical framework to an analysis of the structural violence of the international economic order indicates that its impact possesses distinctly genocidal features.
P19|Precarity – Logical Consequence of Societies that Lost the Social|The essay proposes an alternative understanding of social policy, focussing on social quality and as such bringing together biographical and societal development and as well institutional and communal concerns. On this basis the author proposes a definition of precarity that goes far beyond insecurity of employment and its consequences for every day’s life. Thus, actually a definition of precarity is suggested that, while recognising the dimension of individual insecurity with its shortage of resources and the lack of power over the own life, points on a second and crucial dimension. This is the precarity of a society and its integrity due to the loss of its social dimension, being solely shaped by and engaged in individualism. Precarity, then, is the paradox of individuals loosing control in an otherwise individualistic, ‘privatised’ society.
P19|Inserción exterior, transformación y desarrollo en la periferia|Retomando una preocupación de la economía del desarrollo en América Latina, y en particular de los enfoques desarrollados por Prebisch, Furtado, Hirschman, se presenta un análisis de los elementos centrales en los que se fundamenta el crecimiento a largo plazo en los países de la periferia capitalista. La articulación orgánica a la dinámica comercial, técnica y productiva de los mercados capitalistas, marca la evolución estructural que las economías de la periferia emprenden en procesos de modernización y diversificación productiva, mediante los cuales pueden integrar la población a las dinámicas de progreso técnico, ganancias de productividad y elevación del ingreso. El crecimientoestá basado en procesos de cambio estructural (transformación productiva y equidad), que amplían y mejoran la capacidad productiva y permiten acortar la brecha productiva y técnica con el centro.
P19|Science and technology in today’s economy. the fourth stage in the organisation of production (Science et technologie dans l’economie contemporaine. Le quatreme moment de l’organisation de la production)|The historical context determines for most part the order of priority of the scientific phenomena to study, the techniques (methods and tools) to use, as well as the social use which will be made of the results. Classical Economists highlighted three stages in the transformation of the production forces of capitalism: meetings of workers isolated under the same management, followed by the division of the work and the differentiation of the tasks, then by the clear separation between intellectual and manual work. This paper presents the fourth stage in the productive organisation: an organisation based on the spatial de-concentration of the achievement of this production and on decisional, financial and informational centralisation that the applications of contemporary science allow. Concerning the organisation of labour, this fourth moment is characterised by the combination in the same group of staff paid by the company itself and a salaried staff paid by other organisations, but appropriated by the company which makes use of the said group. This fourth stage is the one of the unprecedented marketability of science, organised as a network by enterprises and states in a clear technological aim. Le contexte historique conditionne pour une grande partie l’ordre des priorités sur le plan scientifique et technique ainsi que sur le plan de l’application des résultats de la recherche. Les économistes classiques ont mis en évidence trois moments historiques durant lesquels les forces de production du capitalisme se sont transformées : le regroupement des travailleurs isolés sous le même commandement a été suivi par la division du travail et la différenciation des tâches, puis par la séparation claire du travail intellectuel du travail manuel. Ce document présente le quatrième moment de l’organisation productive : une organisation fondée sur la déconcentration spatiale de la réalisation de la production et sur la centralisation décisionnelle, financière et informationnelle permises par les avancées scientifiques et techniques actuelles. Concernant l’organisation du travail, ce quatrième moment est caractérisé par la combinaison dans un même collectif de salariés appartenant à une entreprise et d’autres qui appartiennent à d’autres entreprises mais dont le travail est réalisé pour le compte de la première entreprise. Le quatrième moment est lié à une marchéisation sans précédent de la science, organisée en réseau par les entreprises et les Etats dans un but clairement technologique.

P19|Another Look at Whether a Rising Tide Lifts All Boats|Periods of rapid U.S. economic growth during the 1960s and 1970s coincided with improved living standards for many segments of the population, including the disadvantaged as well as the affluent, suggesting to some that a rising economic tide lifts all demographic boats. This paper investigates the impact of U.S. business cycle conditions on population well-being since the 1970s. Aggregate employment and hours worked in this period are strongly procyclical, particularly for low-skilled workers, while aggregate real wages are only mildly procyclical. Similar patterns appear in a balanced panel of PSID respondents that removes the effects of changing workforce composition, though the magnitude of the responsiveness of real wages to unemployment appears to have declined in the last 20 years. Economic upturns increase the likelihood that workers acquire jobs in sectors with positively sloped career ladders. Spending by state and local governments in all categories rises during economic expansions, including welfare spending, for which needs vary countercyclically. Since the disadvantaged are likely to benefit disproportionately from such government spending, it follows that the public finances also contribute to conveying the benefits of a strong economy to diverse population groups.
P19|La gouvernance des entreprises en Italie: un exemple de non-convergence?|This paper aims to explain the Italian system peculiarities which cast some doubts on convergence of national corporate governance systems. Italian non-financial companies listed on the Stock Exchange play a relatively small role. Most Italian companies are organised as formal or informal groups. The market for corporate control is very small. Control, based on majority or minority, by a powerful individual will prevail in most Italian companies also in the foreseeable future. The real problem for the future of Italian corporate governance is the ability of the Italian economy to develop on the basis of small and medium firms.
