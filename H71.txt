H71|Carbon Taxes and Stranded Assets: Evidence from Washington State|The climate challenge requires ambitious climate policy. A sudden increase in carbon prices can lead to major shocks to the stock market. Some assets will lose part of their value, others all of it, and hence become “stranded”. If the markets are not ready to absorb the shock, a financial crisis could follow. How well investors anticipate, and thus how large these shocks may be, is an empirical question. We analyze stock market reactions to the rejection of two carbon tax initiatives by voters in Washington state. We build proper counterfactuals for Washington state firms and find that these modest policy proposals with limited jurisdiction caused substantial readjustments on the stock market, especially for carbon-intensive stocks. Our results reinforce concerns about “stranded assets” and the risk of financial contagion. Our policy implications support the inclusion of transition risks in macroprudential policymaking and carbon disclosure and climate stress tests as the main policy responses.

H71|La mejora de la situación de las finanzas públicas de las corporaciones locales en la última década|Las Corporaciones Locales han registrado desde 2012 un superávit fiscal, que contrasta con el déficit registrado en el resto de las Administraciones Públicas. A pesar de la heterogeneidad en la composición del sector, esta mejora en las finanzas públicas se extiende a una amplia mayoría de municipios. Su origen se remonta a la reducción y a la posterior contención de los gastos no financieros surgidas en 2012, especialmente relevantes en el caso del gasto en inversión pública. Las Corporaciones Locales han utilizado esta evolución favorable de sus presupuestos para mejorar significativamente su situación financiera. En particular, desde 2012 el sector ha iniciado un proceso de desendeudamiento, que, si bien presenta cierto grado de heterogeneidad, ha supuesto una reducción notable de su stock de deuda. Esta reducción del pasivo ha venido acompañada de una sustancial mejora de los activos financieros, materializada, en particular, en la acumulación de efectivo y depósitos. Si bien a escala agregada el sector presenta una situación financiera saneada, holgadamente compatible con los límites de deuda establecidos en la Ley Orgánica de Estabilidad Presupuestaria y Sostenibilidad Financiera, aún muestra cierto margen de mejora, en particular en el caso de los ayuntamientos de tamaño medio.
H71|Expected Effects of the US Tax Reform on Other Countries: Global and Local Survey Evidence|The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act constitutes the largest change to the US tax system since the 1980s and thoroughly alters the way in which multinational companies are taxed. Current assessments on the reform’s international impact vary widely. This article sheds light on the tax reform’s expected effects on other countries. We first use representative German business survey data to analyse the impact of the reform on German firms. Many firms with substantial US revenues or production capacities in the US intend to expand US investment in response to the reform, in particular large firms and manufacturing companies. The effects on investment in Germany are ambiguous: While some firms substitute between investment locations, others expand in both countries. We subsequently extend our analysis to the global level using worldwide survey data. The results suggest a negative impact on tax revenues and investment in countries with close economic ties to the US.
H71|Does progressivity always lead to progress? The impact of local redistribution on tax manipulation|The goal of this paper is to study the effects of introducing income redistribution at the municipal level, with the adoption of local tax progressivity. In particular, we analyse whether this complex fiscal tool modifies the incentives of local politicians to be strategic leading to higher tax manipulation, in the form of political budget cycle. We exploit an Italian reform of the local personal income tax (PIT), which was flat before the intervention, that allows mayors to introduce progressive schemes. First, we make use of the staggered timing of local elections to estimate a Difference-in-Differences model and we find that the reform consistently amplifies political budget cycle of local PIT. In terms of mechanism, progressivity allows mayors to target diverse income groups and to play different strategies: high income rates, indeed, are subject to larger manipulation than the moderate ones. Second, we exploit the fact that income concentration level is a valid predictor for the introduction of progressivity. The main results are confirmed in a Triple-Differences analysis. And finally, we show that manipulation is rewarding from an electoral point of view. These results reveal a negative side of decentralizing income redistribution as it may lead to consistent tax manipulation and large distortions in fiscal policy.
H71|Sales Taxation, Spatial Agglomeration, and the Internet|Technological innovations facilitating e-commerce have well-documented effects on consumer behavior and firm organization in the retail sector, but the effects of these new transaction technologies on fiscal systems remain unknown. By extending models of commodity tax competition to include urban spatial structure (agglomeration) and online commerce, one can analyze strategic tax-policy interactions among neighboring localities. Consumers buy different types of commodities, sold either by traditional or by online vendors. When the cost of online shopping falls, we show that equilibrium tax rates and revenues increase in small jurisdictions and decrease in large jurisdictions with retail shopping centers. Policy commentators warn that e-commerce erodes tax revenue - true enough for some localities - but, more accurately, changing transaction costs can generate entirely new commercial and fiscal equilibria that ultimately “redistribute” tax revenues from localities with concentrations of traditional vendors toward other, typically smaller, localities.

H71|Ties|This paper investigates whether the rare occurrence of a local election ending in a tie or being decided by a single vote generates informational spill-overs on nearby localities’ subsequent elections. First, based on the pivotal-voter theory, we develop a model of costly instrumental voting in sequential elections with private information, where voters update their beliefs regarding the distribution of political preferences and the probability of their vote being decisive upon observing the outcomes in earlier elections, and decide whether to turn out to vote accordingly. Next, by exploiting over a hundred exact ties or one-vote-difference results in Italian mayoral elections during the past two decades and the quasi-experimental conditions created by the staggered municipal electoral calendar, we test the model’s empirical predictions and find a substantial impact on voter turnout rates of exposure for geographical reasons to spill-overs from the localities experiencing those bizarre electoral outcomes.
H71|Fiscal Windfall Curse|We study the impact of a one-off exogenous fiscal windfall on local public finances in the canton of Zurich in Switzerland. The windfall was due to the IPO of Glencore on the London Stock Exchange in 2011. As a result, its CEO paid an extraordinary tax bill of approximately CHF 360 million. About CHF 238 million of that extra tax revenue entered the municipal resource equalization scheme and rained down on the municipalities of the canton of Zurich. This quasi-experimental setup and our unusually rich dataset allow us to estimate the causal effect of this one-off windfall on all municipal accounting positions. We show that it triggered large expenditure increases targeting particular groups (e.g., salaries of public employees) at the same time as general tax cuts and user charge hikes (e.g., nursing home fees). The resulting imbalances caused a 7.5-fold increase in gross debt relative to the windfall. This massive overreaction hints at a substantial fiscal windfall curse.
H71|Tax Avoidance through E-Commerce and Cross-Border Shopping|As e-commerce has grown over the last few decades so has states' concern for its use for sales tax avoidance. Using a panel of Washington State tax jurisdictions from 2005 through 2015, I estimate the effect of a sales tax regime change on the elasticities of taxable sales. I find the regime change, targeted at reducing sales tax avoidance through remote purchases, had a differential impact that varied by tax jurisdiction. I find that in tax jurisdictions near the border of lower-sales-tax states (Oregon and Idaho) consumers became more responsive to the difference in sales tax rates across borders than their counterparts in the interior of the state. I interpret this as a substitution by consumers along the Oregon and Idaho border from e-commerce purchases to cross-border shopping in order to avoid sales taxes.
H71|Do Corporate Tax Cuts Increase Income Inequality|We study the effects of corporate taxes on income inequality. Using state corporate taxes as a setting, we provide evidence that corporate tax cuts lead to increases in income inequality. This result is robust across regression, matching, and synthetic controls approaches, and to controlling for a host of potential confounders. We use Statistics of Income data from the IRS to explore mechanisms behind this result. We find tax cuts lead to higher income for both top and bottom earners, but the gains to capital income for top earners exceed the gains to total income for bottom earners. This result suggests that, while all earners appear to benefit from a corporate tax cut, the relation between tax cuts and inequality is positive, in part, because high income individuals shift their compensation to reduce taxes.
H71|The Real Estate Transfer Tax and Government Ideology: Evidence from the German States|In 2006, the reform of the German fiscal constitution realigned legislative powers between the federal and the state governments. Since 2007, the German state governments have been allowed to design real estate transfer tax rates. We investigate whether government ideology predicts the levels and increases in the real estate transfer tax rates; and show that leftwing and center governments were more active in increasing the real estate transfer tax rates than rightwing governments. The result is important because many voters were disenchanted with the policies and platforms of the established German parties in the course of the euro and refugee crisis. Disenchantment notwithstanding, the established political parties are still prepared to offer polarized policies.
H71|Who Bears the Burden of Real Estate Transfer Taxes? Evidence from the German Housing Market|This paper examines the effects of real estate transfer taxes (RETT) on house prices using a rich micro dataset on German properties covering the period from 2005 to 2018. We exploit a 2006 constitutional reform that allowed states to set their own RETT rates, leading to frequent increases in states’ tax rates in subsequent years. Our monthly event study estimates indicate a price response that strongly exceeds the change in the tax burden for single transactions. I.e., twelve months after a reform, a one percentage point increase in the tax rate reduces property prices by on average 3.5%. Effects are stronger for apartments and apartment buildings than for single family houses. We interpret these results in the context of a theoretical model that accounts for the effects of RETT on a property’s resale value. If a property is expected to be traded more frequently in the future, the decline in its price can exceed the in crease in the tax burden. Moreover, larger price effects can be explained by higher bargaining power of sellers.
H71|Immigration, fear of crime and public spending on security|We explore the relation between immigration, crime and local government spending on security in Italian municipalities. We find that immigration increases the share of public resources devoted to police protection, particularly when migrants are culturally distant from the native population. We uncover a misalignment between perception and reality, as immigration increases fear of future crimes rather than the actual probability of being victim of a crime. We also demonstrate that immigration from culturally distant societies is associated with a deterioration in civic cooperation and interpersonal trust, which can affect perceptions of safety and the demand for police services.
H71|Coca, Cocaine and Drug Trafficking|The increase in the area cultivated with coca in Colombia has cast doubt on the country’s anti-drug strategy and has encouraged skepticism about the possibility of a complete and definitive peace. Furthermore, this perception of failure has given rise to policy proposals based on the idea that illicit crops are a criminal issue, not a development one. This paper is a complete review of the available evidence and aims at organizing the information related to this debate and shedding light on the convenience or inconvenience of certain policies. There are six highly relevant facts: (i) With respect to reducing cocaine supply, the efforts in seizures and destruction of infrastructure are more efficient than the efforts in eradication. (ii) Seizures and destruction of infrastructure may help in reducing coca plantations. (iii) There is no evidence to support the hypothesis that the consumption of cocaine in Colombia has increased. (iv) Most regions of the country have seen a decrease in the amount of coca crops. However, at least one armed group is present in the regions where the cultivated area has increased. (v) Coca growing municipalities are, on average, poorer than the rest of the country. These municipalities have a low tax revenue, and reduced levels of connectivity and institutional development. (vi) The increase in the consumption of cocaine in the United States is concentrated in a specific age group and in certain states. This fact makes it difficult to relate the increase in consumption to an exogenous increase in the supply.
H71|Concentración de tierras, paz territorial e impuesto predial rural en Antioquia|Resumen: Tras la firma del Acuerdo de Paz entre el Gobierno y las Farc se han promovido múltiples políticas que permitan la transformación del campo en aras de la construcción de paz en los territorios. Una de ella es usar la política tributaria, aumentando las tarifas prediales rurales, en los municipios como vía para modificar la alta concentración de la propiedad rural. En este trabajo, se muestra que, por lo menos en Antioquia, adoptar este mecanismo –que resulta práctico- podría, por el contrario, aumentar la concentración de la propiedad. Se usa una metodología cuantitativa con un panel de datos de los 125 municipios en el periodo 2014- 2017 estimado por efectos fijos. Los resultados obtenidos evidencian una relación positiva y significativa entre tarifa predial rural e índice Gini de tierras. Finalmente, se discuten los canales por los cuales podría ser entendida esta relación. / Abstract : After the signing of the Peace Agreement between the Government and the Farc, multiple policies have been promoted that allow the transformation of the countryside in order to build peace in the territories. One of them is to use the tax policy, increasing the rural property rates, in the municipalities as a way to modify the high concentration of rural property. In this paper, it is shown that, at least in Antioquia, adopting this mechanism, which is practical could, on the contrary, increase the concentration of property. A quantitative methodology is used with a panel data of the 125 municipalities in the period 2014-2017 estimated by fixed effects. The results obtained show a positive and significant relationship between rural property rate and land Gini index. Finally, the channels through which this relationship could be understood are discussed

H71|Cognitive Hubs and Spatial Redistribution|In the U.S., cognitive non-routine (CNR) occupations associated with higher wages are disproportionately represented in larger cities. To study the allocation of workers across cities, we propose and quantify a spatial equilibrium model with multiple industries that employ CNR and alternative (non-CNR) occupations. Productivity is city-industry-occupation specific and partly determined by externalities across local workers. We estimate that the productivity of CNR workers in a city depends significantly on both its share of CNR workers and total employment. Together with heterogeneous preferences for locations, these externalities imply equilibrium allocations that are not efficient. An optimal policy that benefits workers equally across occupations incentivizes the formation of cognitive hubs, leading to larger fractions of CNR workers in some of today's largest cities. At the same time, these cities become smaller to mitigate congestion effects while cities that are initially small increase in size. Large and small cities end up expanding industries in which they already concentrate, while medium-size cities tend to diversify across industries. The optimal allocation thus features transfers to non-CNR workers who move from large to small cities consistent with the implied change in the industrial composition landscape. Finally, we show that the optimal policy reinforces equilibrium trends observed since 1980. However, these trends were in part driven by low growth in real-estate productivity in CNR-abundant cities that reduced welfare.
H71|Making moves matter: experimental evidence on incentivizing bureaucrats through performance-based postings|Bureaucracies often post staff to better or worse locations, ostensibly to provide incentives. Yet we know little about whether this works, with heterogeneity in preferences over postings impacting effectiveness. We propose a performance-ranked serial dictatorship mechanism, whereby bureaucrats sequentially choose desired locations in order of performance. We evaluate this using a two-year field experiment with 525 property tax inspectors in Pakistan. The mechanism increases annual tax revenue growth by 30–41 percent. Inspectors whom our model predicts face high equilibrium incentives under the scheme indeed increase performance more. Our results highlight the potential of periodic merit-based postings in enhancing bureaucratic performance.
H71|Subsidy Bidding Wars and the Structure of Multi-Plant Firms| Governments spend large amounts of money to attract firms to their territory, often resulting from bidding wars against other regions. Previous papers show that such bidding wars can improve social welfare by allocating the investment to the regions that value it the most. In this paper, we depart from the usual assumption of exogenous, single-plant investment. We show that in this context, bidding wars incite the firm to allocate its investment strategically, by investing more and differentiating the plants. In turn, the firm receives larger subsidies. Despite these distortions, bidding wars may remain socially optimal, as in simpler models.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H71|Did the 2017 Tax Reform Discriminate against Blue State Voters?|The Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) made significant changes to corporate and personal federal income taxation, including limiting the SALT (state and local property, income and sales taxes) deductibility to $10,000. States with high SALT tend to vote Democratic. This paper estimates the differential effect of the TCJA on red- and blue-state taxpayers and investigates the importance of the SALT limitation to this differential. We calculate the effect of permanent implementation of the TCJA on households using The Fiscal Analyzer: a life-cycle, consumption-smoothing program incorporating all major federal and state fiscal policies. We find that the average percentage increase in remaining lifetime spending under the TCJA is 1.6 percent in red states versus 1.3 percent in blue states. Among the richest 10 percent of households, this differential is larger. Rich households in red states enjoyed a 2.0 percent increase compared to a 1.2 percent increase among the rich in blue-state households. This gap is driven almost entirely by the limitation on the SALT deduction. Excluding the SALT limitation from the TCJA results in a spending gain of 2.6 percent for rich red-state households compared to 2.7 percent for rich blue-state households.
H71|Time-Geographically Weighted Regressions and Residential Property Value Assessment|In this study, we develop and apply a new methodology for obtaining accurate and equitable property value assessments. This methodology adds a time dimension to the Geographically Weighted Regressions (GWR) framework, which we call Time-Geographically Weighted Regressions (TGWR). That is, when generating assessed values, we consider sales that are close in time and space to the designated unit. We think this is an important improvement of GWR since this increases the number of comparable sales that can be used to generate assessed values. Furthermore, it is likely that units that sold at an earlier time but are spatially near the designated unit are likely to be closer in value than units that are sold at a similar time but farther away geographically. This is because location is such an important determinant of house value. We apply this new methodology to sales data for residential properties in 50 municipalities in Connecticut for 1994-2013 and 145 municipalities in Massachusetts for 1987-2012. This allows us to compare results over a long time period and across municipalities in two states. We find that TGWR performs better than OLS with fixed effects and leads to less regressive assessed values than OLS. In many cases, TGWR performs better than GWR that ignores the time dimension. In at least one specification, several suburban and rural towns meet the IAAO Coefficient of Dispersion cutoffs for acceptable accuracy.
H71|Heterogeneous Capital Tax Competition in a Federation with Tax Evasion|In a federal country with two regions, consumers can decide not only the region where to invest, but also the type of capital investment. We analyse how such decision is affected by two sources of asymmetry: a first type of capital is taxed at a regional level while a second one is taxed at a federal level, and for the latter a different degree of tax evasion may arise across regions. We show how tax evasion arising at a federal level affects not only the federal tax policy but also the regional tax policies both directly and indirectly because of vertical tax competition. In particular, we show under which conditions a decrease in the level of tax compliance on the second type of capital can lead to a reduction in its federal tax rate, and simultaneously to an increase in the regional tax rate on the other type of capital investment.
H71|Russia’s Municipal and sub-federal debt market in 2018|According to the 2018 year-end data, the regional consolidated budgets and local government off-budget funds’ budgets ran a surplus of RUB 512.9 billion or 0.49 percent of GDP. To compare, the regional consolidated budgets and local government off-budget funds’ budgets ran a deficit of RUB 61.5 billion or 0.07 percent of GDP in 2017. In 2018, the budgets of subjects of the Russian Federation ran a surplus of RUB 491.5 billion, urban districts’ budgets ran a deficit of RUB 0.8 billion, federal-status cities’ inner-city municipalities’ budgets ran a surplus of RUB 0.4 billion, municipal areas’ budgets ran a surplus of RUB 16.0 billion, urban and rural settlements’ budgets ran a surplus of RUB 3.5 billion, local government off-budget funds’ budgets ran a surplus of RUB 2.7 billion.
H71|Taxes, traffic jam and spillover in the metropolis|This paper studies local governments' public policies in a metropolitan area plagued by traffic congestion, where both residents and workers consume local public goods. We develop a new spatial sub-metropolitan tax competition model which features a central city surrounded by suburban towns linked by mobile capital and mobile residents who commute to work. We show that Pareto-efficiency is achieved if towns can retain their workers using labor subsidies. Otherwise, traffic congestion in the city is inefficiently high and local governments respond by setting inefficient public policies: (1) the city over-taxes capital and under-taxes residents, which leads to too little capital and too many residents in the city; (2) local public goods are under-provided in the city and over-provided in the towns.
H71|Un impôt immobilier tout en un : rendement, progressivité et faisabilité|We examine the feasibility of a single property tax on the property and real estate holdings of households that would replace all the existing taxes on this type of wealth, in particular, the property tax, the IFI tax, the DMTO tax, the tax on real estate capital gains and the tax on rental income received by landlords. Net property worth, after deducting real estate debt and 50,000 euros for the value of the principal residence, would be taxed at a rate of 1% up to the threshold of the IFI (1.3 million euros) and at 1.5% beyond that. The revenue would be shared between the State and the local authorities through an equalization fund. After presenting the reasons underlying our reform proposal, we first assess the profile of the tax yield and tax burden according to income, family size and age by drawing on the INSEE wealth survey (enqu?te Patrimoine). The partial decorrelation of real estate income and assets makes a large tax yield difficult, even if the expected tax revenue is equivalent to the revenue lost from the taxes replaced. A cap on a single property tax in terms of disposable income would bring down its yield fairly quickly. JEL?classification: H23, H61, H71, R51

H71|Optimal policies for electromobility: Joint assessment of transport and electricity distribution costs in Norway|We observe a rapidly rising share of the passenger car fleet becoming electric as policy makers keep making the purchase and use of electric vehicles (EVs) more favorable in the pursuit of reducing pollution. The electrification of transport will make the transport and energy systems more intertwined: EV-friendly transport policies increase the demand for power, thus challenging the distribution grid’s capacity, while electricity policies immediately impact on the generalized costs of driving EVs. This paper develops a stylized economic model for passenger transport in the greater Oslo area where the agents’ endogenous choice of car ownership, transport pattern and EV home charging is determined jointly in equilibrium. If enough EV-owning agents charge during power peak hours, costly grid expansions may be needed. We examine how the distribution grid company can respond in order to mitigate these costs with different pricing schemes and how this in turn affects the transport equilibrium. We find that applying peak tariffs for the grid will help strike a better balance between investment costs and EV-owners’ disutility of charging during off-peak hours.
H71|2019/01 Merging city and suburban governments: A public choice perspective on the Norwegian local government reform|The administrative boundaries of the central city almost universally cover a smaller area than its functional boundaries. As mobility patterns go mainly into the central city, local governments in central cities supply public goods beyond their own residents. They should want to extend their boundaries in order to internalize more of these externalities, while suburban municipalities should oppose this. This implication is clear from a theoretical perspective, but can rarely be tested given that local government reform is infrequent and typically top-down. However, the 2014-2017 Norwegian municipal reform offers a rare opportunity for empirical evidence to test this proposition. The paper examines the merger decisions made by municipalities in all city regions in Norway. The analysis provides support for the proposition that central cities want to internalize more of the externalities from their public goods production, while suburban municipalities oppose this: First, central cities tend to have higher property tax rates and to provide more public goods compared to suburban municipalities. Second, central cities were much more interested in merging than suburban municipalities: while the central cities wanted to merge with a total of 75 suburban municipalities, only 15 of the latter were positive to merging with the central city.
H71|Effects of multilevel policy mix of public R&D subsidies: Empirical evidence from Japanese local SMEs|Regional innovation policies have been implemented in several countries. In Japan, controlled decentralization of traditionally centralized innovation policy is ongoing, so that we can observe multilevel policy mix of public R&D subsidies by national, prefecture and city governments. Based on original survey data and financial data of manufacturing SMEs, we empirically estimate their TFP (Total Factor Productivity) and investigate the effects of public R&D subsidies by national, prefecture and city governments. We employ firm-level fixed effect panel estimation in order to control for the effects of any time-invariant factors. We find that only the prefecture subsidy has a positive and significant impact on the TFP of recipient firms, while interactive effect with city subsidy is also positive and significant, if we consider remaining effects after subsidy period. These results suggest that multilevel policy mix of R&D subsidies significantly increase recipients' productivity and that this effect if durable.
H71|Property Tax Reform and Land Use: Evidence from Japan|It is often said that farmland conservation in urban areas (i.e., cities and inner suburbs) is not desirable because it hinders converting farmland into residential areas, thereby deterring urbanization. If the preferential treatment of property taxes on farmland is rectified, these problems can be solved. In this paper, we study two property tax preferential treatment reforms that took place in Japan during the 1990s. We examine the effects of these reforms by theoretical and empirical investigation. The econometric results are consistent with our theoretic modelâ€™s main predictions; the proportion of farmland in the major cities in the three metropolitan areas (Tokyo, Chubu, and Kansai) decreased following the reforms. However, since landlords did not replace all the farmland with housing lots, the problem of obstructed urbanization remains to be solved.
H71|Do Tax Incentives Affect Business Location and Economic Development? Evidence from State Film Incentives|"I estimate the impacts of recently-popular U.S. state film incentives on filming location, film industry employment, wages, and establishments, and spillover impacts on related industries. I compile a detailed database of incentives, matching this with TV series and feature film data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and Studio System, and establishment and employment data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages and Country Business Patterns. I compare these outcomes in states before and after they adopt incentives, relative to similar states that did not adopt incentives over the same time period (a panel difference-in-differences). I find that TV series filming increases by 6.3 to 55.4% (at most 1.50 additional TV series) after incentive adoption. However, there is no meaningful effect on feature films, and employment, wages, and establishments in the film industry and in related industries. These results show that the ability for tax incentives to affect business location decisions and economic development is mixed, suggesting that even with aggressive incentives, and ""footloose"" filming, incentives can have little impact."
H71|Autonomous, Connected, Electric Shared vehicles (ACES) and public finance: an explorative analysis|This paper discusses the implications of autonomous-connected-electric-shared vehicles (ACES) for public finance, which have so far been widely ignored. In OECD countries, 5-12% of federal and up to 30% of local tax revenue are currently from fuel and vehicle taxation. The diffusion of ACES will likely reduce these important sources of government revenues, while also affecting transport-related government expenditures. We argue that the realization of socioeconomic benefits of ACES depends on the implementation of tailored public finance policies. In particular, the introduction of road tolls in line with ‘user pays’ and ‘polluter pays’ principles will become more attractive. Moreover, innovation in taxation schemes to fit the changing technological circumstances may alter the (relative) importance of levels of governance in transport policy making, likely shifting power towards local (in particular urban) governmental levels. We finally argue that due to path-dependencies, and the risk of lock-in effects in sub-optimal public finance regimes, further research and near-term policy action regarding ACES is required.
H71|Riflessioni sullâ€™autonomia finanziaria dei comuni italiani|Italian local governmentsâ€™ fiscal authonomy since the early 1990s heavily relied on the local tax on immovable property (ICI â€“ imposta comunale sugli immobili). Local governmentsâ€™ fiscal authonomy in the last 25 years however has not developed linearily, but has suffered from various pressures and reforms often prompted by other and different concerns and priorities. Hence local governmentsâ€™ fiscal authonomy has been affected by three main processes. First the wider development of the process of fiscal decentralisation in Italy, second political concerns for the reduction of fiscal pressure, and finally the wider economic developments, in particular the economic and financial crisis of 2008 and the related problems of public budget balance and growht of the Italian public debt. The purpose of this paper is to anayse the pillars of local governmentsâ€™ fiscal authonomy, starting with local governmentsâ€™ tax on immovable property, and then analysing other sources of financing such as special contributions, ear-marked taxes and urban development charges (oneri di urbanizzazione) with reference also to the tool of partecipatory budgeting.
H71|Government Policy and Land Price Dynamics: A Quantitative Assessment of China's Factor Market|This paper examines the role played by government policy regarding factors of pro- duction in shaping the dynamics of a growing economy. Using land as an example of an important productive factor, we develop a quantitative model with endogenous land price policy regimes to rationalize the following three economic reforms in China: introduction of non-SOEs (state-owned enterprises); reform of SOEs characterized by their retreat from the competitive manufacturing sector and the establishment of state monopolies in factor markets around 2000; and a regime switch from dual-track land pricing to land price discrimination by use. We calibrate our model to key economic indicators for China and quantify the e ects of these reforms. Our calibrated mo- del can match several stylized facts for China after 2000 such as widening disparity in land prices by use, rapid growth in housing price, land revenue, and government expenditures on public goods, and the steep decline in labor share for income.
H71|Bodengebundene Einkommensteuern in einer strukturschwachen ländlichen Gemeinde|In diesem Bericht wird für eine ländliche Gemeinde im Landkreis Stendal (Sachsen-Anhalt) die Höhe der Steuern abgeschätzt, die auf Einkünfte aus der Verpachtung und Bewirtschaftung von Landwirtschaftsfläche im Gemeindegebiet zu entrichten sind. Zudem wird ermittelt, welcher Anteil dieser Steuern der Gemeinde selbst zukommt und welcher Anteil ihr dadurch entgeht, dass Teile der Landwirtschaftsfläche Eigentümern mit auswärtigem Wohnsitz gehören bzw. von auswärtigen Landwirten bewirtschaftet werden. Die Untersuchung beruht auf Daten aus den Liegenschafts- und Grundsteuersystemen der Gemeinde, die im Hinblick auf die Wohnsitze der Steuerpflichtigen ausgewertet wurden. Die Untersuchung zeigt, dass mehr als die Hälfte des privaten landwirtschaftlichen Flächeneigentums auf nicht Ortsansässige entfällt und mehr als die Hälft der Landwirtschaftsfläche von auswärtigen Landwirten bewirtschaftet wird. Die Steuereinnahmen, die der Gemeinde dadurch entgehen, sind aber relativ gering im Verhältnis zu anderen Finanzierungsquellen im Gemeindehaushalt. In agrarstruktureller Hinsicht zeigt diese Untersuchung erstmals an einem konkreten Beispiel eine Methode zur Ermittlung von Eigentums- und Bewirtschaftungskonzentration landwirtschaftlicher Flächen auf Gemeindeebene.
H71|Does accrual accounting alter fiscal policy decisions? Evidence from Germany|Many governments have replaced traditional cash-based accounting with some form of accrual-based accounting system. However, empirical evidence on the effects of the public accounting system on fiscal policy is scarce. Following rules by the federal states, municipalities in Germany have adopted accrual-based accounting systems gradually. By exploiting variations over time and across states I find no evidence for an impact on the overall financial balance. However, my findings suggest that accrual accounting has altered the structure of the budget. Revenues from the sales of non-financial assets have decreased significantly. This supports the hypothesis that municipalities had used these one-off measures before to meet fiscal constraints. Using data on entities controlled by the municipalities, the analysis provides no evidence for repercussions on these public funds, institutions or enterprises.
H71|Taxes, traffic jam and spillover in the metropolis|This paper studies local governments' public policies in a metropolitan area plagued by traffic congestion, where both residents and workers consume local public goods. We develop a new spatial sub-metropolitan tax competition model which features a central city surrounded by suburban towns linked by mobile capital and mobile residents who commute to work. We show that Pareto-efficiency is achieved if towns can retain their workers using labor subsidies. Otherwise, traffic congestion in the city is inefficiently high and local governments respond by setting inefficient public policies: (1) the city over-taxes capital and under-taxes residents, which leads to too little capital and too many residents in the city; (2) local public goods are under-provided in the city and over-provided in the towns.
H71|Does tax competition drive cooperation in local economic development policies? Evidence on inter-local business parks in Germany|An increasing number of municipalities cooperates in the field of economic development. In this paper, we focus on a specific instrument in this field, namely the development of joint business parks. We apply a hazard model to data from West-German municipalities between 2000 and 2015. We find inter-local business parks to be more frequent among small municipalities and in constellations where suitable land is scarce. Our main focus rests on the role of tax competition. An analogy building on the literature on international tax coordination supports the hypothesis that inter-local business parks are more likely in regions where tax competition is intense. The evidence is affirmative: We find that the likelihood of inter-local business park formation to increase in the intensity of local tax competition.
H71|Holding Hospitals Accountable? Evidence on the Effectiveness of Minimum Charity Care Provision Laws| What can governments do to encourage nonprofit hospitals to provide greater benefits to their communities? Recent efforts by the federal and state governments seek to hold hospitals accountable for community health, in part by incentivizing charity care provision. Laws that set benchmarks for charity care spending are increasingly used, but their efficacy is uncertain. In this study, we examine the extent to which Illinois’ minimum charity care provision (MCCP) law increases nonprofit hospital charity care. Importantly, we differentiate between responses for hospitals required to provide minimal charitable spending (nonprofits) and those that are not (for-profit and public). We use detailed panel (2009-2015) data from Illinois' Annual Hospital Questionnaire and county-level data from the American Community Survey. We exploit a discrete change in charitable care requirements for nonprofit hospitals to identify the effect of the MCCP law on charity care, controlling for hospital characteristics, county demographics, and year and county (or hospital) fixed effects. Employing a differences-in-differences model, we find no evidence that the MCCP law increases charity care on average. Instead, we find some evidence that the law’s effects vary by how much charity care hospitals provided previously – charity care increases for those providing lower levels at baseline, narrowing the gap in charity care provision with those that provide high levels at baseline. The results suggest that setting low benchmarks does not create sufficient incentives for nonprofit hospitals to provide greater charity care on average, but instead may narrow the gap between high and low charity care hospitals.
H71|Employment Structure and the Rise of the Modern Tax System|This paper studies how the transition from self-employment to employee-jobs over the long run of development explains growth in income tax capacity. I construct a new database which covers 100 household surveys across countries at different income levels and 140 years of historical data within the US (1870-2010). Using these data, I first establish four new stylized facts: 1) within country, the share of employees increases over the income distribution, and increases at all levels of income as a country develops; 2) the income tax exemption threshold moves down the income distribution as a country develops, tracking employee growth; 3) the employee share above the tax exemption threshold is maximized and remains constantly high; 4) movements in the tax exemption threshold account for the observed variation in tax collection across development. These findings are consistent with a model where a high employee share is a necessary condition for effective taxation and where the rise in income covered by information trails through increases in employee shares drives expansion of the income tax base. To provide a causal estimate of the impact of employee share on the exemption threshold, I study a state-led US development program implemented in the 1950s-60s which shifted up the level of employee share. The identification strategy exploits within-state changes in court-litigation status which generates quasi-experimental variation in the effective implementation date of the program. I find that the exogenous increase in employee share is associated with an expansion of the state income tax base and an increase in state income tax revenue.
H71|Taxation and Migration: Evidence and Policy Implications|In this article, we review a growing empirical literature on the effects of personal taxation on the geographic mobility of people and discuss its policy implications. We start by laying out the empirical challenges that prevented progress in this area until recently, and then discuss how recent work have made use of new data sources and quasi-experimental approaches to credibly estimate migration responses. This body of work has shown that certain segments of the labor market, especially high-income workers and professions with little location-specific human capital, may be quite responsive to taxes in their location decisions. When considering the implications for tax policy design, we distinguish between uncoordinated and coordinated tax policy. We highlight the importance of recognizing that mobility elasticities are not exogenous, structural parameters. They can vary greatly depending on the population being analyzed, the size of the tax jurisdiction, the extent of tax policy coordination, and a range of non-tax policies. While migration responses add to the efficiency costs of redistributing income, we caution against over-using the recent evidence of (sizeable) mobility responses to taxes as an argument for less redistribution in a globalized world.
H71|Did the 2017 Tax Reform Discriminate against Blue State Voters?|The Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) made significant changes to corporate and personal federal income taxation, including limiting the SALT (state and local property, income and sales taxes) deductibility to $10,000. States with high SALT tend to vote Democratic. This paper estimates the differential effect of the TCJA on red- and blue-state taxpayers and investigates the importance of the SALT limitation to this differential. We calculate the effect of permanent implementation of the TCJA on households using The Fiscal Analyzer: a life-cycle, consumption-smoothing program incorporating all major federal and state fiscal policies. We find that the average percentage increase in remaining lifetime spending under the TCJA is 1.6 percent in red states versus 1.3 percent in blue states. Among the richest 10 percent of households, this differential is larger. Rich households in red states enjoyed a 2.0 percent increase compared to a 1.2 percent increase among the rich in blue-state households. This gap is driven almost entirely by the limitation on the SALT deduction. Excluding the SALT limitation from the TCJA results in a spending gain of 2.6 percent for rich red-state households compared to 2.7 percent for rich blue-state households.
H71|Do Tax Incentives Affect Business Location and Economic Development? Evidence from State Film Incentives|"I estimate the impacts of recently-popular U.S. state film incentives on filming location, film industry employment, wages, and establishments, and spillover impacts on related industries. I compile a detailed database of incentives, matching this with TV series and feature film data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and Studio System, and establishment and employment data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages and Country Business Patterns. I compare these outcomes in states before and after they adopt incentives, relative to similar states that did not adopt incentives over the same time period (a panel difference-in-differences). I find that TV series filming increases by 6.3 to 55.4% (0.67 to 1.50 additional TV series) after incentive adoption. However, there is no meaningful effect on feature films, and employment, wages, and establishments in the film industry and in related industries. These results show that the ability for tax incentives to affect business location decisions and economic development is mixed, suggesting that even with aggressive incentives, and ""footloose"" filming, incentives can have little impact."
H71|Do Local Governments Represent Voter Preferences? Evidence from Hospital Financing under the Affordable Care Act|A mainstream motivation for decentralized government is to enable public service investments to better align with political preferences that may differ by geographical region. This paper examines how political preferences determine local government provision of hospital services. We find that local governments in areas more supportive of public insurance expansion responded to such state action by increasing expenditures on hospitals, whereas those in areas that voted against such expansions used the savings to reduce property taxes. This finding suggests that local government financial responses indeed align with political preferences.
H71|Can Pigou at the Polls Stop Us Melting the Poles?|Surveys show majority U.S. support for a carbon tax. Yet none has been adopted. Why? We study two failed carbon tax initiatives in Washington State in 2016 and 2018. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we show that Washington's real-world campaigns reduced support by 20 percentage points. Resistance to higher energy prices explains opposition to these policies in the average precinct, while ideology explains 90% of the variation in votes across precincts. Conservatives preferred the 2016 revenue-neutral policy, while liberals preferred the 2018 green-spending policy. Yet we forecast both initiatives would fail in other states, demonstrating that surveys are overly optimistic.
H71|Oakland’s Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Tax: Impacts on Prices, Purchases and Consumption by Adults and Children|Several cities in the U.S. have implemented taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in an attempt to improve public health and raise revenue. On July 1, 2017, Oakland California introduced a tax of one cent per ounce on SSBs. In this paper, we estimate the impact of the tax on retail prices, product availability, purchases, and child and adult consumption of taxed beverages in Oakland, as well as of potential substitute beverages. We collected data from Oakland stores and their customers and a matched group of stores in surrounding counties and their customers. We collected information in the months prior to the implementation of the tax and again a year later on: (1) prices, (2) purchase information from customers exiting the stores, and (3) a follow-up household survey of adults and child beverage purchases and consumption. We use a difference-in-differences identification strategy to estimate the impact of the tax on prices, purchases, and consumption of taxed beverages. We find that roughly 60 percent of the tax was passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. There was a slight decrease in the volume of SSBs purchased per shopping trip in Oakland and a small increase in purchases at stores outside of the city, and we find some evidence of increased shopping by Oakland residents at stores outside of the city. We do not find evidence of substantial changes in the overall consumption of SSBs or of added sugars consumed through beverages for either adults or children after the tax.
H71|Cognitive Hubs and Spatial Redistribution|In the U.S., cognitive non-routine (CNR) occupations associated with higher wages are disproportionately represented in larger cities. To study the allocation of workers across cities, we propose and quantify a spatial equilibrium model with multiple industries that employ CNR and alternative (non-CNR) occupations. Productivity is city-industry-occupation specific and partly determined by externalities across local workers. We estimate that the productivity of CNR workers in a city depends significantly on both its share of CNR workers and total employment. Together with heterogeneous preferences for locations, these externalities imply equilibrium allocations that are not efficient. An optimal policy that benefits workers equally across occupations incentivizes the formation of cognitive hubs, leading to larger fractions of CNR workers in some of today's largest cities. At the same time, these cities become smaller to mitigate congestion effects while cities that are initially small increase in size. Large and small cities end up expanding industries in which they already concentrate, while medium-size cities tend to diversify across industries. The optimal allocation thus features transfers to non-CNR workers who move from large to small cities consistent with the implied change in the industrial composition landscape. Finally, we show that the optimal policy reinforces equilibrium trends observed since 1980. However, these trends were in part driven by low growth in real-estate productivity in CNR-abundant cities that reduced welfare.
H71|State of Public Finance and Fiscal Management in India during 2001-16|During 2001-16, State Finances in India have undergone significant changes in both revenue mobilization and controlling expenditures which helped states to contain deficits (revenue as well as fiscal). Introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) helped states to augment revenue mobilization whereas adoption of Fiscal Responsibility Budget Management (FRBM) Act helped states in prudential fiscal management. During the period, the improvement in union finances was not as good as state finances. There were two significant shocks to Indian public finances during 2001-16 - firstly, introduction of pay revision for the union as well as majority state government employees, in response to recommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission and secondly, global financial crisis (2008-09). States experienced revenue shocks mostly through fall in states' share in central taxes and a mild fall in own tax revenue mobilization during 2008-10. Higher pressure on revenue expenditure due to implementation of the pay commission recommendations (including revision of pensions and payment of arrears) and falling share in central taxes resulted in rise in revenue deficits for states during 2008-10. As a strategy to combat fiscal shocks, different states adopted different measures and some of the measures have inter-temporal implications. The objective of the present paper is to assess the impact of the shocks in Indian public finances and identify challenges for the times to come. Though increasing revenue (`front loading') and reducing expenditure (`back loading') are common responses to any fiscal shock, understanding inter-temporal implications of those responses with specific to changing structure of inter-governmental fiscal transfers could be an interesting exercise.
H71|Tax Revenue Efficiency of Indian States: The case of Stamp Duty and Registration Fees|The Federal structure of India divided taxation powers between Union government and state government on certain principles. But, due to the goods and service tax (GST) implementation, states have lost jurisdiction over many taxes, since many state taxes were subsumed into GST. The extent of revenue losses to states due to subsuming certain taxes is not clear. On the other hand, the revenue situation of the states has not improved sufficiently. Despite of states tax efforts, improvement in own tax revenues are marginal. Under this back ground, states need to focus on the other existing taxes to improve its own tax revenues. The major revenue yielding taxes to states in the post GST regime are excise tax and stamp duty and registration fees. This study attempts to measure tax capacity and tax effort of stamp duty and registration fee for 16 major Indian states from 2001 to 2014 using stochastic frontier analysis. It is found that Bihar is operating at high efficient levels with efficiency and Odisha and Jharkhand are operating with low efficiency. State government's needs to focus on the relevant stamp duty policy changes and potential determinants of the model, which will help them improve their efficiency. The gap between predicted tax revenue and frontier tax revenue is more the case of Gujrat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and West Bengal.
H71|Améliorer l’efficience de l’investissement public en France|L’investissement public a le potentiel de stimuler la demande à court terme, et des infrastructures appropriées peuvent aussi entraîner des gains de productivité et contribuer à rendre la croissance économique plus inclusive en garantissant une égalité d’accès au marché du travail, à l’éducation et aux soins de santé. Les investissements publics de la France sont élevés, et son stock de capital public est important. En particulier, le réseau d’infrastructures de la France est bien développé, et très bien classé si on le compare à celui d’autres pays. Pour autant, dans certains secteurs, le manque d’investissements d’entretien et de modernisation a sans doute nui à l’efficacité du capital investi dans les infrastructures existantes. Pour pouvoir bénéficier pleinement de ses investissements publics, la France doit renforcer et développer l’ensemble de sa stratégie pour relever plusieurs défis, consistant notamment à promouvoir les considérations d’efficience socio-économique dans le choix de ses projets d’investissement, à harmoniser les procédures s’étalant sur toute la durée de vie des investissements entre les différents secteurs et niveaux administratifs, et à concentrer les investissements de certains secteurs sur l’entretien et la qualité du stock de capital. En outre, comme les collectivités locales sont responsables de la plupart des investissements publics, il sera utile de poursuivre les efforts visant à répartir clairement les responsabilités entre les différents échelons administratifs pour pouvoir bénéficier d’économies d’échelle et de gamme. L’investissement public devrait aussi viser à atteindre les objectifs fixés dans les domaines de l’environnement, du numérique, de la recherche et de l’innovation pour permettre à la France de respecter ses engagements nationaux et internationaux et garantir une croissance plus vigoureuse et plus durable. Les choix opérés devront faire une place à l’investissement privé pour permettre la réalisation de ces objectifs et stimuler la croissance potentielle, notamment en développant une liste de projets prêts à financer et en ajustant de manière dynamique le soutien public aux politiques en matière d’énergie et de changement climatique. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de la France 2019 (http://www.oecd.org/fr/economie/france-en-un-coup-d-oeil/)
H71|Vnímání daně z nemovitých věcí v ČR| Příspěvek se zabývá zdaněním nemovitých věcí v České republice.

H71|Delegation of Taxation Authority and Multipolicy Commitment in a Decentralized Leadership Model|This paper examines to what extent taxation authority should be delegated to local or lower-level government. Delegation of taxation authority can be regarded as a commitment to the local tax rate ex ante in a decentralized leadership model, in which local governments set policies ex ante and the central government decides transfer policies ex post. Previous papers point out that the ex post interregional transfers of the central government distort the ex ante regional policies of local governments. However, Silva (2014, 2015) clarify the case where efficient expenditure by local governments is achieved. This paper examines the delegation of taxation authority by extending Silva's model to include commitment to taxation and generally derives the conditions when efficient public expenditure by local governments can be achieved in relation to the delegation of taxation authority. The model adopted in this paper allows various levels of spillovers of local public goods and various types of multipolicy commitments of taxation and/or expenditure.
H71|Der Einfluss von organisatorischer Gerechtigkeit auf das berufliche Engagement in den jordanischen Ministerien<BR>[The Influence of Organizational Justice on Job Commitment in the Jordanian Ministries]|The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of organizational justice on job commitment in Jordanian ministries. Data were collected through a questionnaire distributed to 450 employees in three Jordanian ministries, namely, the Ministry of Education; Ministry of Health; and Ministry of Awqaf Islamic Affairs and Holy Places. Data were analyzed via descriptive, simple linear regression analysis, and stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. The hypotheses of the research were tested and the probabilities of their acceptance were rejection. Findings revealed a statistically significant impact between organizational justice and job commitimnt. Results also indicated that informational justice has the highest influential effect on employee job commitmint, while procedural justice had the lowest impact on it. Furthermore, this study reports differences between the dimensions of the (OJ) in their impacts on the dimensions of job commitment. Moreover, the study found that the three dimensions of organizational justice (information justice, personal justice, and distributive justice) combined had a higher predictive capacity of job commitment than that of any independent dimension or two dimensions of organizational justice. In view of the results, the researcher gives some recommendations to the decision makers in Jordanian ministries that may guide them to promote the concept and practice of organizational justice in their ministries such as the need for increasing the levels of organizational justice, especially the distributive justice, and focusing on compatibility of income of the employee with their academic level and practical experience, in addition to necessity of improving the system of rewards in the Jordanian ministries because the rewards have a significant impact on the employees' perception of justice and on her/his interest in supporting her/his colleagues when doing additional work in the ministry. In other respects, this study has practical implications for future research such as attracting attention to the need to study job satisfaction and job engagement as mediatingvariables of association of employee’s job commitment with organizational justice. This is in addition to conducting studies similar to the present one in different environments inside and outside Jordan.
H71|The Effect of Trade Liberalization on Expenditure Structure of Pakistan|Demand side public policy plays a risk reducing role for imperfect sectors of the developing economies through public investment during liberalization. Public sector investment, composition and structure play an important role to determine the comparative advantage for the productive sector. This study explores the effect of trade liberalization and trade tax revenue on the expenditure structure of Pakistan during 1975-2016. Autoregressive Distributed Lag approach has been used for examining the long run co-integration among the expenditure structure and trade liberalization and Vector Error-Correction model is used for short run dynamics of the concerned variables. The empirical result shows that trade tax revenue has a positive impact on the expenditure structure in the long run but not in the short run. Trade liberalization, budget deficits and defense expenditure have negative associations with expenditure structure.
H71|Improving Subnational Government Development Finance in Emerging and Developing Economies: Toward a Strategic Approach|Considerable attention has been given to enhancing subnational development finance in response to the 2008 global financial crisis and recent global development agendas, including the Sustainable Development Goals, Financing for Development, and Habitat III/New Urban Agenda. Much work on this topic is fragmented, focusing on specific elements of development finance: fiscal transfers, capital market access, public-sector lending agencies, or public–private partnerships. Most countries, however, have a range of subnational governments with varying needs and capacities that require different and evolving mixes of development finance mechanisms. Enabling greater subnational borrowing is often desirable but requires adoption of other reform policies to improve the fiscal capacity and creditworthiness of subnational governments over time. We review the rationale and potential for improving subnational development finance, outline the overall landscape of institutional arrangements available for this purpose, and consider broad challenges involved. Based on a review of global practice and experience in selected Asian developing countries with a range of special entities and innovations to enhance subnational investment, we propose a more integrated, strategic approach to building subnational development finance.
H71|Quality Infrastructure Investment: Ways to Increase the Rate of Return for Infrastructure Investments|Private–public partnerships in infrastructure have been advocated for many years. Investors currently receive a low rate of return on infrastructure investment. This is because the main sources of revenue from infrastructure investment are user charges. For example, user charges for a water supply cannot be increased since water is a necessary good for everyone. However, a water supply can help to develop regions. For example, new apartments can be constructed, and new businesses can be created in the region where the water is supplied. From this, property tax, corporate income tax, and income tax revenues will rise. In the past, these increased tax revenues have gone to the government rather than being returned to infrastructure investors. If these increased tax revenues were to be returned to investors, the rate of return would rise significantly. Hometown investment trust funds can also provide financing for start-up businesses along with the new infrastructure investments. Land acquisition creates huge difficulties for completing infrastructure investment. Land trusts will solve the issue of owners not wanting to sell their land by giving them the option to keep it and instead lease the land to infrastructure companies and receive long-term rent income, for example for 99 years. In this way, land trusts will smoothen the use of land and transfer the usage rights to infrastructure companies.
H71|EU28 legal and fiscal readiness for the adoption of an on-tax financing mechanism - EuroPACE|EuroPACE is an innovative financial mechanism inspired by an American building improvement initiative called Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE). The innovative character of the EuroPACE mechanism is that financing through EuroPACE is linked to the taxes paid on a property. In other words, the financing lent by a private investor is repaid through property taxes and other charges related to the buildings. EuroPACE is therefore in line with the EC’s objectives of (1) putting EE first, (2) contributing to the EU’s global leadership, and (3) empowering consumers to enable MS to reach their energy and climate targets for 2030. Last but not least, EuroPACE could contribute to the democratisation of the energy supply by offering cash-flow positive, decentralised EE solutions. The EuroPACE mechanism engages several stakeholders in the process: local government, investors, equipment installers, and homeowners. To establish the EuroPACE programme, several conditions must be satisfied, each of which are relevant for different stakeholder at different stages of the implementation. For the purpose of this report, we divided these criteria into two categories: key criteria, which make the implementation possible, and complementary criteria, which make the implementation easier. For the time being, it is a pure hypothesis to be tested with potential EuroPACE implementation.
H71|Role of the Distribution Structure in Responsible Trade|Aware of the high importance of consumers' private information concerning their willingness-to-buy fair trade goods and taking into account the superior price they are willing to pay for this kind of goods with respect to conventional ones, we choose to feed the debate relative to the appropriateness of the different potential retailing channels. We use a common agency game framework to analyze the changes in the price level according various forms or distribution organization : direct competition between upstream producers or manufacturers (or cooperatives of producers / manufacturers), creation of a cooperative at the downstream stage, delivery of the final good to classical retailing networks. It appears that the private information parameter as well as the nature of the relationship between suppliers on the one hand and the retailer on the other hand are the key variables that determine the price paid by consumers. The conventional retailing channel brings excessively high prices with respect to a distribution made by an entity likely to be assimilated to a cooperative because of a double margin effect that is lessened in the cooperative case since the latter objective function involves additional elements such as providing services to upstream actors.
H71|Relevance of Potential Supply Structures in Frameworks involving Consumer's private Information: the Case of Fair Trade|Fair trade actors have to deal with a signicant degree of information asymmetry as regard their willingness-to-buy such goods and their willingness-to-pay for them. Many debates and controversies have paved the way for the development of fair trade, in particular concerning the distribution channel that had to be preferred. We use a common agency game framework to analyze the changes in the price level according various schemes of upstream-downstream organization and relationships. Both the private information parameter and the nature of the relationship between suppliers are the key variables that determine the price paid by consumers. If the choice of a dedicated structure does not appear relevant when costs or the number of competing producers are high, the framework of a sequential contracting process always results sub-optimal. What really matters is the nature of the firms involved and the convergence of interests. An equilibrium close to the socially optimal issue may emerge.
H71|The Assignment of a CSR Level of Action: Rule vs Discretion|Socially responsible behaviors represent a growing concern for consumers, employees, investors. Beyond their economic impact, companies are made accountable and responsible for the social, the environmental incidence of their activities. Their governance, their processes, the security of their products and the working conditions they offer are more and more carefully examined (as, for instance, the increasing importance of the duty of vigilance for multinational enterprises). Public policies, especially through regulation, seek to avoid - or at least limit some of the negative impacts that can be related to firms' activity and choices. Yet, many drawbacks may prevent regulation from succeeding : lack of information or of expertise, capture by interest groups... In some cases, companies can even turn more efficient in making the decisions that better suit stakeholders' expectations, essentially as they may have better information about their preferences, which is an essential piece. As a by-product it is worth examining whether some decisions must be taken by regulators or should rather be delegated to firms. Through a mechanism without transfer approach in a setting involving information asymmetries, we study under which conditions the decision is best assigned to the regulator. We show that for relatively low values of the private parameter, a binding rule will be preferred, and it is even stronger when asymmetry of information is introduced w.r.t. the knowledge the firm will get from the representative stakeholder. The divergence between the decision-maker and the firm strengthens and less communication takes place, which corresponds to a lower degree of delegation granted to companies. Thus, the optimal scheme is made of a combination of a rigid policy and a more flexible one over signicant values of the private parameter.
H71|Who Seeks Re-Election: Local Fiscal Restraints and Political Selection|This paper analyses the consequences of local fiscal autonomy for political selection. We propose a model of political careers where both decisions to become candidates and seek re-election are endogenous. Market and political ability are private information, and the latter is revealed to the incumbent during her first period in office. Following an unanticipated reduction in the returns from holding office, we show that incumbents with high market ability are more likely to refrain from running again for office than their lower ability counterparts. We test this prediction exploiting an unexpected reduction in the upper bound of the municipal property tax rate, announced by the Portuguese Prime Minister in July 2008, just 15 months before the local elections. We rely on a comprehensive dataset on all Portuguese mainland municipalities for the 2005 and 2009 elections, including municipality and individual mayor characteristics. We follow a difference-in-differences strategy to show that affected mayors – those who were forced to decrease the property tax rate, and thus faced a sharp tax revenue decrease – are less likely to seek re-election. This effect is driven by high quality incumbents, as proxied by their previous occupation.
H71|Climate Finance for Canadian Cities: Is Debt Financing a Viable Alternative?|Municipalities are crucial stakeholders in the response to climate change. Cities are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions and, due to their higher building and population densities, will bear the brunt of the economic and social costs imposed by extreme weather and the impact of climate change. Ontario municipalities have traditionally funded their investments from property taxes, user fees, and transfers from higher levels of government, but these sources will not be sufficient to fund both current expenditures and future capital needs. This paper explores an alternative: climate finance, the provision of financing by private actors for projects intended to decrease carbon emissions or make cities more resilient to the impacts of climate change. It analyzes four climate financing tools used in other jurisdictions â€“ green bonds, environmental impact bonds, catastrophe bonds, and green banks â€“ and their feasibility under current Ontario regulations. Not all instruments would be equally suitable to Ontario municipalities; each offers trade-offs that must be weighed before implementation. Still, the potential for climate financing is huge and it has a role to play in long-term climate infrastructure projects requiring large upfront investments.
H71|The Public Finance Challenges of Fracking for Local Governments in the United States|Fracking has revolutionized international oil and gas markets practically overnight, but its impact on local public finance and governance have largely been overlooked. While operating under federal and state constraints, the key ongoing policy question is whether and to what extent local governments can â€“ and should â€“ have the power to manage the industryâ€™s effects on their communities. This IMFG Paper explores the fiscal health risks associated with the industry, its local revenue generation implications, and what local governments can do to address the spatial and temporal mismatches between the two. As the industry expands internationally, including to Canada, lessons from the United States can inform future regulatory response in other places.
H71|The Platform Economy and Regulatory Disruption: Estimating the Impact on Municipal Revenue in Toronto|Platform economy firms such as Uber and Airbnb have attracted attention in cities around the world, given the impact of these firms on the existing taxi industry or the rental market, but little has been written about the effects of the platform economy on municipal fiscal health. This paper estimates the regulatory cost and potential revenue opportunities of the platform economy, examining the impact of three firms in Toronto: Uber, Airbnb, and Rover. Overall, I expect that the approaches that the City of Toronto has taken to regulate the activities of firms, such as Uber and Airbnb, will be revenue-neutral. Since neither of these services directly competes with other city services, I examine only the costs of the regulatory scheme put in place. The third platform firm, Rover, does compete with the Cityâ€™s Green P parking service. However, Roverâ€™s operations are not at the scale necessary to meaningfully disrupt Green P services. If regulated effectively, the platform economy would have a minimal impact on municipal revenue. However, regulatory delay has a cost. The lesson learned from Torontoâ€™s experience is to not delay the creation of a regulatory regime. Municipalities need to be proactive in researching the appropriate regulatory approach and matching the regulatory reach to the platform in question, namely a digital regulatory approach for a digital service.
H71|Designing Dynamic Subsidies to Spur Adoption of New Technologies|We analyze the efficient subsidy for durable good technologies. We theoretically demonstrate that a policymaker faces a tension between intertemporally price discriminating by designing a subsidy that increases over time and taking advantage of future technological progress by designing a subsidy that decreases over time. Using dynamic estimates of household preferences for residential solar in California, we show that the efficient subsidy increases over time. The regulator's spending quintuples when households anticipate future technological progress and future subsidies.
H71|Do Corporate Tax Cuts Increase Income Inequality?|We study the effects of corporate taxes on income inequality. Using state corporate taxes as a setting, we provide evidence that corporate tax cuts lead to increases in income inequality. This result is robust across regression, matching, and synthetic controls approaches, and to controlling for a host of potential confounders. We use Statistics of Income data from the IRS to explore mechanisms behind this result. We find tax cuts lead to higher income for both top and bottom earners, but the gains to capital income for top earners exceed the gains to total income for bottom earners. This result suggests that, while all earners appear to benefit from a corporate tax cut, the relation between tax cuts and inequality is positive, in part, because high income individuals shift their compensation to reduce taxes.
H71|Optimal Spatial Policies, Geography and Sorting|We study optimal spatial policies in quantitative trade and geography frameworks with spillovers and sorting of heterogeneous workers. We rst characterize ecient spatial transfers and the labor subsidies that would implement them. Then, we quantify the aggregate and distributional eects of implementing these policies in the U.S. economy. Under homogeneous workers and constant-elasticity spillovers, a constant labor subsidy over space restores efficiency regardless of micro heterogeneity in fundamentals and trade costs. In that case, the quantification suggests that the observed spatial transfers in the U.S. are close to ecient. Spillovers across heterogeneous workers create an additional rationale for place-specific subsidies to attain optimal sorting. Under heterogeneous workers, the quantication suggests that optimal spatial policies may require stronger redistribution towards low-wage cities than in the data, reduce wage inequality in larger cities, weaken spatial sorting by skill, and lead to signicant welfare gains. Spillovers across dierent types of workers are a key driving force behind these results.
H71|Distributing the Green (Cards): Permanent residency and personal income taxes after the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|We explore how permanent residency affects personal income tax participation and net personal income tax payments using variation from the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), which authorized the largest U.S. amnesty to date. We exploit the timing and geographic unevenness of IRCA's legalization programs alongside newly digitized data on personal income taxes in California, home to the majority of applicants. Green Cards induced the previously unauthorized to file state income tax returns at rates comparable to other California residents. While the new returns generated little additional revenue through the end of the 1990s, they did raise the incomes of families with children through new claims of the federal Earned Income Tax Credit.
H71|The Impact of the Philadelphia Beverage Tax on Purchases and Consumption by Adults and Children|In this paper, the authors examine the effects of the beverage tax of 1.5 cents per ounce that was implemented in Philadelphia starting January 1, 2017.
H71|Majority Choice of Taxation and Redistribution in a Federation|We provide a model with a federal government and multiple local governments, the former with power to levy an income tax for redistribution, and the latter choosing a local income tax, property tax, lump-sum tax or subsidy, and a local public good. Policy is set by majority choice at each tier of government by households that differ by income and ability to move across communities. We provide sufficient conditions for existence of equilibrium and examine its properties. Central findings are federal income distribution, little local redistribution, and local preference for property taxation over income taxation to fund local public goods.
H71|Subsidizing Mass Adoption of Electric Vehicles: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from California|Little is known about demand for EVs in the mass market. In this paper, we exploit a natural experiment that provides variation in large EV subsidies targeted at low- and middle-income households in California. Using transaction-level data, we estimate two important policy parameters using triple differences: the subsidy elasticity of demand for EVs and the rate of subsidy pass-through. Estimates show that demand for EVs amongst low- and middle-income households is price-elastic and pass-through is complete. We use these estimates to calculate the expected subsidy bill required for California to reach its goal of 1.5 million EVs by 2025.
H71|Asymmetric regional dynamics: from bust to recovery|Regional convergence stands out in the severe adjustment of the Portuguese economy that followed the international financial crisis. This result contrasts with increasing regional inequality in other European countries. We show that regions’ GDP growth rates of the Portuguese economy were driven by debt and exports. Our estimates suggest that differences in regional debt-to-GDP and exports-toGDP ratios resulted in asymmetric regional economic dynamics. Highly indebted regions had a more severe recession and a slower recovery. Regions more open to trade had a milder recession and a stronger recovery. Finally, our results suggest that fiscal decentralization may improve regions’ resilience.
H71|Fiscal Rules for Sub-central Governments: Design and Impact|Against a background of mounting demands for spending on services provided by sub-central governments, this paper examines how fiscal rules can help to ensure that pressure on resources is minimised and available resources are used efficiently. Drawing on questionnaire responses and other sources, this paper gives a detailed picture of fiscal rules for sub-central governments in place among a number of OECD countries. The paper examines the rationales for using fiscal rules, the various impacts fiscal rules can have, the factors making for effective implementation and the interactions between the various types of rule. It then constructs a number of synthetic sub-indicators designed to assess the extent to which sub-central government fiscal frameworks exhibit favourable characteristics for the achievement of fiscal objectives. It concludes with the construction of a composite indicator based on the combined impacts in the different areas of fiscal policy. Règles budgétaires des collectivités territoriales : Leurs caractéristiques et leur impact Face à l’augmentation des dépenses au titre des services assurés par les collectivités territoriales, cette étude examine comment les règles budgétaires peuvent contribuer à atténuer les pressions sur les ressources et à garantir une utilisation efficiente des ressources disponibles. S’appuyant sur les réponses à des questionnaires et sur d’autres sources, elle présente une description détaillée des règles budgétaires applicables aux collectivités territoriales dans plusieurs pays de l’OCDE. Elle analyse les raisons qui motivent l’utilisation de règles budgétaires, les divers effets que ces règles peuvent avoir, les facteurs qui contribuent à l’efficacité de leur mise en œuvre et les interactions entre les divers types de règles. Un certain nombre d’indicateurs synthétiques sont ensuite élaborés dans le but de déterminer dans quelle mesure les règles budgétaires des collectivités territoriales présentent des caractéristiques favorisant la réalisation des objectifs de finances publiques. L’étude s’achève par la construction d’un indicateur composite des effets combinés dans les différents domaines de la politique budgétaire.
H71|Market mechanisms in public service provision|This paper compares and analyses the use of market mechanisms in core sub-central policy areas, namely education, health care, transport, social protection, and environment. Arrangements like tendering, outsourcing, user choice and competition, user fees and performance-related funding can help to improve quality of service provision or lower its cost. With around 32% of total public expenditure and often wide-ranging spending powers, sub-central governments (SCG) have considerable leeway for improving their services by relying on market mechanisms. The decentralised and often fragmented nature of sub-central government poses some special challenges to efficient arrangements, however, and may require central government support or stronger inter-jurisdictional co-operation. And while market mechanisms are being harnessed ever more broadly, limits to a more extensive use have become apparent, particularly in the potential trade-off between greater efficiency and equity objectives, or between efficiency and sub-central accountability..
H71|The spending power of sub-central governments: A pilot study|This pilot study presents indicators that assess sub-central government (SCG) spending power by policy area. Traditional indicators – such as the share of SCG in total government spending – are often misleading as they underestimate the impact of central government regulation on sub-central spending patterns. In order to gauge true spending power, a set of institutional indicators is established, based on a detailed assessment of institutional, regulatory and administrative control central government exerts over various SCG policy areas. Results tend to confirm the limited discretion of SCGs over their own budget. Education in particular – the main SCG budget item in most countries – is strongly shaped by central government regulation. Federal countries tend to grant more spending power to SCGs than unitary countries.
H71|Voting in the Goods and Service Tax Council of India|In 2017, India enacted a new taxation law called the Goods and Services Tax (GST). This law created a GST Council with representatives of the Union government and the Provincial governments. The decision making procedure in the GST Council is specified to be by weighted voting. This work performs a detailed study of such a mechanism using the framework of formal voting games. On a theoretical note, we introduce several new notions regarding blocking dynamics of voting games. These are then applied to the study of voting in the GST context. We identify a set of basic desiderata and propose some modifications to the voting rule in the GST Act.
H71|Study on financial performance of da Afghanistan Bank 2015 and 2016|This study attempts primarily to measure the financial performance of Da Afghanistan Bank which one of the largest government bank of Afghanistan for the period 2015-2016 and to identify whether any difference exists between a banks’ years of operation and its performance classifying two period (2015-2016). To complete my task I have to use various materials and take help form online source. Analyses the ratio here used financial ratio analysis (FRA) method which help to draw a overview about financial performance of the Da Afghanistan bank in terms of profitability, liquidity. These analyses helps to see the current performance condition of this bank compare past performance. Because now a day’s banking sector of Afghanistan is suffering the disease of default culture which is the consequence or result of bad performance of most banks. The performances of banks are dependent more on the management’s ability in formulating strategic plans and the efficient implementation of its strategies. The study findings can be helpful for management of Da Afghanistan, Always for private commercial banks in Afghanistan to improve their financial performance and formulate policies that will improve their performance. The study also identified specific areas for bank to work on which can ensure sustainable growth for these banks.
H71|Can the visible and invisible hands coexist in land pricing?|This study addresses state intervention in land pricing. Theoretical modelling identifies risk aversion as the determining factor for the coexistence of the visible and invisible hands. Our empirical tests using Chinese data confirm the absence of this coexistence. Exploring the micro-foundation of this “two-hand” model and extending the Lucas critique, we illustrate the impossibility of this coexistence under the land regime of state ownership in a market environment: state interference in land pricing causes people to drastically alter their expectations and neutralizes their risk aversion, leading to the deactivation of the stochastic discount factor and the market mechanism. This work provides a “risk aversion” approach to the causes of “state failure” and implies that under state ownership of land, the distortion of land prices is inevitable.
H71|An Economic Impact Analysis of Oil and Natural Gas Development in the Permian Basin|This study analyzes the economic impact of oil and natural gas development in the Permian Basin with a focus on the NM part of the Basin. The analysis looks at the impacts on state revenue, local employment and income levels. Several existing economic impact reports from other states have been criticized by the peer-review literature that the impact estimates are very likely overstated due to questionable methodologies. In this analysis, a panel data regression model with county fixed effects and year effects is deployed to identify the impact of oil and natural gas production on employment and per job annual income at the county level. The analysis covers 62 counties (12 counties in NM and 50 counties in TX) for the time period of 1998 – 2016. The main findings of the analysis can be summarized as: 1. Over the last decade, according to different estimates the state revenue generated by the oil and natural gas industries in NM has been consistently exceeding one billion dollars per year. In the meantime, a large amount of intensive direct investment has been capitalized into the southeast NM. 2. In aggregate, per job annual income (in the real term) and the number of jobs have both experienced significant growth in the last two decades of active oil and natural gas development in the region. It is reasonable to speculate that much of the growth can be attributed to the ongoing energy development. 3. It is estimated that on average additional one million BBLs of oil equivalent production brings 54 jobs and about $170 (2015 dollar) extra annual income per job (or a 0.5% increase) in the county of production. 4. The intensive oil and natural gas production around the center of the basin (Lea County and Eddy County in NM) have had significant spatial spillover effects to the surrounding counties. Depending on the distance from the given county to the center of the Basin and for additional one million BBLs of oil equivalent production, the employment effect ranges from 35 to 10 jobs and the income effect ranges from $170 to $90 (2015 dollar) extra annual income per job. The paper also provides details on methodology and guidelines on how to interpret estimation results. The estimated economic impact coefficients can be used for prediction purpose with available future production scenarios. The paper includes instructions and suggestions on how the prediction may proceed.
H71|Government Support and Firm Performance in Vietnam|Using a sample of private manufacturing SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) in the period 2007-15, we analyze the effect of government support on firms’ financial performance in Vietnam. Contrary to many previous studies, we find that government support affects firms’ financial performance after controlling for heterogeneity, unobservable factors and dynamic endogeneity. The finding supports the viewpoint of institutional theory. Also, the study reveals that assistance measures, such as tax exemptions, soft loans and investment incentives to promote financial performance, are vital for the development of Vietnamese private SMEs.
H71|The corporate tax, apportionment rules and employment: Evidence using policy discontinuity at U.S. state borders|A recent set of empirical works highlights a puzzling asymmetric response of labor market outcomes to the corporate tax. This paper explores a potential source of this disparity, using differentials in profit accounting rules across U.S. states. I exploit policy discontinuities at state borders by pairing counties in states featuring a tax change with their contiguous counterparts in control states. I notice that corporate tax cuts do not boost employment while tax hikes reduce job creation. The incidence of tax increases on employment seems limited in states with a single sales factor apportionment formula and pronounced in states that use a triple factor apportionment rule. I present a basic conceptual framework that explains this pattern.
H71|On the political economy of state corporate tax reforms in the U.S|This paper discusses the political economy of U.S. state corporate tax reforms. Using a unique dataset of state effective corporate tax rates over the period 1969-2015, I observe that business tax changes are associated with tax competition, swings in economic cycles, and left-right political ideology. In contrast, long-term debt and budgetary pressures do not correlate with state corporate tax policies. Moreover, I document a regional heterogeneity and notice a slowdown in state tax changes after the Federal Reform Act of 1986. These findings matter for the empirics of corporate tax incidence, which is increasingly concerned with the endogeneity between tax reforms and other economic developments.
H71|Optimal Spatial Policies, Geography and Sorting|We study optimal spatial policies in a quantitative trade and geography framework with spillovers and spatial sorting of heterogeneous workers. We characterize the spatial transfers that must hold in efficient allocations, as well as labor subsidies that can implement them. There exists scope for welfare-enhancing spatial policies even when spillovers are common across locations. Using data on U.S. cities and existing estimates of the spillover elasticities, we find that the U.S. economy would benefit from a reallocation of workers to currently low-wage cities and from a greater mixing of high and low skill workers in these locations. Inefficient sorting may lead to substantial welfare costs.
H71|“Causes of Sprawl”: A (Further) Public Finance Extension|There are good reasons to expect that attributes of local public finance may impact urban land use and, specifically, sprawl. A detailed and novel investigation of U.S. metropolitan areas (Burchfield et al., 2006) provides substantial insights into the causes of sprawl, but it overlooks the main characteristics of local public finance (taxes and user charges). Using a subset of the data matched to city public finance data, a parallel analysis yielded evidence that greater reliance on local property taxes reduces sprawl and suggested that user charges (primarily for water, sewerage and solid waste services) could have a similar effect (McMillan, 2016). Expansion of the local public finance data set allowed extension of the data analyzed from 83 to 109 observations. The subsequent analysis was expected to enable a refinement of the estimates made in the 2016 paper. However, analysis of the extended data set as reported in this paper indicates more nuanced results. In particular, the impacts of property taxes on sprawl depend upon the population of the metropolitan area.
H71|An assessment of local fiscal autonomy: facts and myths|"The presentation deals with the problem of shaping the decentralized system of public finance and interpretation of fiscal autonomy indicators. The analysis is theoretical and empirical. In the theory we can discuss two extreme scenarios: decentralised (60% own revenue, 40 % external revenue) and centralised system of public finance (40% own revenue, 60 % external revenue). If we assume only 40% share of own revenue, taxes, in the structure of financing sources for local government units, the consequence of this is low budget resilience to unfavourable external and internal factors and high probability of occurrence of broadly understood negative income shocks. The aim of the discussion is to analyse the trends in the practice of local government finances in Poland and selected countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The literature of the subject, studies by international institutions as well as data from Eurostat and EC are used in the deliberations. The discussed countries differ significantly in the scope of fiscal decentralisation. Latvia, the Czech Republic and Poland seem to be most advanced in the process. However the example of Poland shows limits and difficulties with interpretation of statistical measures. It is necessary to look at the categories of revenues which belong to the so-called ""own revenues"". It is questionable that in Poland we treat in the statistics the shares in Personal Income Tax and Corporate Income Tax as own revenues. Local government units do not exert any influence on the structure and amount of PIT and CIT (category of shared taxes). The autonomy in expenditure without real fiscal autonomy and responsibility leads to fiscal illusions and undermine the local democracy."
H71|Does Congressional experience in US governors influence state transfers?|This paper examines the relationship between US governors who have previously served as a member of Congress and the federal transfers to their state. I assemble a novel dataset of governors political background and match this to federal transfer data from 1950 to 2008. Governors with Congressional experience have 0.8 percentage points more transfers to their state. I find no evidence of problematic trends or selection issues. Moreover, the result is robust to outliers in the data and many robustness checks.

H71|Energy Price Reform in China| The Chinese leadership has determined to assign the market a decisive role in allocating resources. To have the market to play that role, getting the energy prices right is crucial because this sends clear signals to both producers and consumers of energy. While the overall trend of China’s energy pricing reform since 1984 has been moving away from the prices set by the central government in the centrally planned economy and towards a more market-oriented pricing mechanism, the pace and scale of the reform differ across energy types. This article discusses the evolution of price reforms for coal, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity and renewable power in China, and provides some analysis of these energy price reforms, in order to have the market to play a decisive role in allocating resources and help China’s transition to a low-carbon economy.
H71|The stimulative effect of an unconditional block grant on the decentralized provision of care|Understanding the impact of central government grants on decentralized healthcare provision is of crucial importance for the design of grant systems, yet empirical evidence on the prevalence of flypaper effects in this domain is rare. We study the decentralization of home care in the Netherlands and exploit the gradual introduction of formula-based equalization to identify the effect of exogenous changes in an unconditional block grant on local expenditure and utilization. A one euro increase in central government grants raises local expenditure by twenty to fifty cents. Adjustments occur through the number of hours as well as through substitution between basic and more advanced types of assistance. These findings suggest that conditioning of grants is not required for the central government to retain a moderate degree of control over the decentralized provision of care.
H71|Bribes vs. Taxes: Market Structure and Incentives|Firms in developing countries often avoid paying taxes by making informal payments to tax officials. These bribes may raise the cost of operating a business, and the price charged to consumers. To decrease these costs, we designed a feedback incentive scheme for business tax inspectors that rewards them according to the anonymous evaluation submitted by inspected firms. We show theoretically that feedback incentives decrease the equilibrium bribe amount, but make firms with more inelastic demand more attractive for inspectors. A tilted scheme that attaches higher weights to the evaluation of smaller firms limits the scope for targeting and decreases the bribe amount to a lesser extent. We evaluate both schemes in a field experiment in the Kyrgyz Republic and find evidence that is consistent with the model predictions. By decreasing bribes, our intervention reduces the average cost for firms and the price they charge to consumers. Since fewer firms substitute bribes for taxes, tax revenues increase. Our study highlights the role of firm heterogeneity and market structure in shaping the relationship between firms and tax inspectors, and provides clear evidence of pass-through of bribes to consumers.
H71|Tarification incitative et gestion des Déchets Ménagers : études du comportement des collectivités locales françaises|Although the evidence of the incentive-based pricing effectiveness to reduce the production of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and to increase the recycling, its adoption in France has been barely developed over the two last decades. This paper analyses the determinants of incentive-based pricing adoption by French local governments. We investigate the effect of the MSW management cost on the decision of the local government in two ways. First we estimate the effect of the variation of the MSW management total cost on the probability to observe an incentive-based pricing and second, we estimate the effect of the incentive-based pricing on the MSW management total cost. Results highlight that the decision of the local government is subjected to the cost-benefit analysis and the decision of neighboring local governments. Further, results show that the French regulation has skewed the cost-benefit analysis of local government and consequently has slow down incentive-based pricing adoption.

H71|Regional Consumption Responses and the Aggregate Fiscal Multiplier|We use regional variation in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009-2012) to analyze the effect of government spending on consumer spending. Our consumption data come from household-level retail purchases in Nielsen and auto purchases from Equifax credit balances. We estimate that a $1 increase in county-level government spending increases consumer spending by $0.18. We translate the regional consumption responses to an aggregate fiscal multiplier using a multi-region, New Keynesian model with heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets. Our model successfully generates the estimated positive local multiplier, a result that distinguishes our incomplete markets model from models with complete markets. The aggregate consumption multiplier is 0.4, which implies an output multiplier higher than one. The aggregate consumption multiplier is almost twice the local estimate because trade linkages propagate government spending across regions.
H71|Entrepreneurship and State Taxation|Entrepreneurship plays a vital role in the economy, yet there exists little well-identified research into the effects of taxes on startup activity. Using recently developed county-level data on startups, we examine the effect of states' corporate, personal and sales tax rates on new firm activity and test for cross-border spillovers in response to these policies. We find that new firm employment is negatively—and disproportionately—affected by corporate tax rates. We find little evidence of an effect of personal and sales taxes on entrepreneurial outcomes. Our results are robust to changes in the tax base and other state-level policies.

H71|Local taxation and tax base mobility: Evidence from a business tax reform in France|This paper investigates the impact of tax base mobility on local taxation. We first develop a theoretical model in order to examine the connection between local business property taxation and tax base mobility within a metropolitan area. We find that decreasing capital intensity in the tax base increases the business property tax rates unambiguously. We then test this result using a French reform, which changes the composition of the main local business tax base in 2010. Estimations using Difference-in-Differences show that the reduction in the mobility of the tax base indeed results in higher business property tax rates. Housing tax rates were not affected by the reform.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

H71|Fiscal decentralisation and the distributive incidence of the great recession|We argue that fiscal decentralisation is one important explanation for variation in distributive outcomes following the Great Recession. Using a difference in differences approach, we examine how fiscal decentralisation mediated the link between spatial distribution, redistributive effort, and interpersonal inequality in 21 OECD cases in the years following the Great Recession. We find that fiscally decentralised nations saw increased interpersonal inequality and lower redistribution, but lower inter-regional inequality. We attribute these results to the weaker redistributive mechanisms in fiscally decentralized nations, which increased interpersonal inequality while preserving market-driven productivity declines in high productivity areas that temporary increased regional convergence.
H71|The impact of the 2014 increase in the real estate transfer taxes on the French housing market|[eng] This paper estimates the effects of an increase in the share of the real estate transfer taxes (RETT) going to the French départements from 3.80% to 4.50%. Not all the départements voted the RETT increase on the same date, which is the starting point of a natural experiment. Using a difference-in-differences design, we estimate two main effects. (1) An anticipation effect, one month before the implementation of the reform, in order to avoid the RETT increase. (2) A retention effect in the post-reform period. In the end, the net effect (retention minus anticipation) corresponds to an average drop in transactions of around 6% over the first three months after the reform, that is, approximately 15,000 transactions lost at national level. If we find a short term effect of the reform, we do not find evidence of a medium- or long-term effect.

H71|Vehicle choices and urban transport externalities. Are Norwegian policy makers getting it right?|Norway has the world’s highest share of electric vehicles in its vehicle stock – in particular battery electric vehicles (BEVs). BEVs have reached a 20% share of the new car sales in Norway, thanks to a set of policies that include high purchase taxes for fossil fueled cars, and for BEVs, free parking, no tolls, and the right to drive on the bus lanes. This paper uses a stylized model of the transport market in the greater Oslo area (1.2 million inhabitants) to analyze transport policies. First, we explore the medium-term effects of the current BEV friendly policies. Second, the model is used to explore the potential of better pricing of car and public transport use, and of better car purchase taxes. We find that the current policies lead to massive penetration of BEVs and therefore to a strong reduction of CO2 emissions. However, they also lead to much more congestion and a decrease in the use of public transport. Better policies require efficient pricing of road congestion, a better use of public transport, and provide incentives for consumers to choose the most efficient combinations of cars. Such policies lead to a less extreme penetration of BEVs, and lower CO2 emissions reductions than the current transport policies. However, they do achieve a better transport equilibrium and substantial resource cost savings, leading to higher welfare levels.
H71|What Shapes Local Innovation Policies? Empirical Evidence from Japanese Cities|Increasing attention has been paid to regional innovation systems. However, previous studies have so far only focused on (the regional impact of) national policies or specific regions. To date, no studies have been carried out on the implementation and variety of local research and development (R&D) subsidy programs at the municipality level. Our research fills this gap by using information on R&D subsidy programs from local authorities in Japan collected via websites and our original survey. Our research confirms 151 R&D subsidy programs conducted by 131 cities among all cities in 2015 and investigates the determinants of the implementation and design of local R&D subsidy programs at city level (length and upper limit of subsidies, and flexibility of subsidy conditions) considering both demand- and supply-side factors. The empirical results suggest that, after controlling for city type and population size, supply-side factors including local government conditions significantly affect the implementation of public R&D subsidy programs. In contrast, we find that demand-side factors matter more for the design of subsidy programs than supply-side factors.
H71|Recovering Social Networks from Panel Data: Identification, Simulations and an Application|It is almost self-evident that social interactions can determine economic behavior and outcomes. Yet, information on social ties does not exist in most publicly available and widely used datasets. We present methods to recover information on the entire structure of social networks from observational panel data that contains no information on social ties between individuals. In the context of a canonical social interactions model, we provide sufficient conditions under which the social interactions matrix, endogenous and exogenous social effect parameters are all globally identified. We describe how high-dimensional estimation techniques can be used to estimate the model based on the Adaptive Elastic Net GMM method. We showcase our method in Monte Carlo simulations using two stylized and two real world network structures. Finally, we employ our method to study tax competition across US states. We find the identified network structure of tax competition differs markedly from the common assumption of tax competition between geographically neighboring states. We analyze the identified social interactions matrix to provide novel insights into the long-standing debate on the relative roles of factor mobility and yardstick competition in driving tax setting behavior across states. Most broadly, our method shows how the analysis of social interactions can be usefully extended to economic realms where no network data exists.
H71|Porezna autonomija gradova u Hrvatskoj u razdoblju 2002.–2016|In this research, the index of all Croatian cities’ tax autonomy (128) in the 2002-2016 period was calculated. The aim of this research is to show how many Croatian cities control their tax revenues. It is also the goal to determine whether cities have the ability to independently finance local public services to citizens and entrepreneurs. The OECD methodology in the classification of tax revenues was used. The results of the analysis showed that Croatian cities had a relatively low level of tax autonomy, except in the period from 2010 to 2014, when the index of tax autonomy was above 54, while in 2016 it amounted to 41.36. The research results showed that only a small number of cities-without the aid of state government grants-can finance their existing level of public services for residents and entrepreneurs and manage their development. This is an important conclusion in considering the future role of cities in taking over new public functions and increasing the decentralization of public administration and territorial organization of the state.
H71|The determinants of local police spending| Since 1995, police forces in England and Wales have obtained the right to raise revenues locally to supplement central government grants in order to fund their activities. The extent to which they have used these local revenue-raising powers varies signi cantly across area and time. We seek to explain this variation in locally raised police revenues over the 2000s, unpicking the role of local differences in preferences, central government funding, the production of public safety given police inputs, and certain political economy features of the local decision making process. We find that around three-quarters of the variation in local revenues per capita can be explained by differences in incomes, prices and preferences. We also examine whether changes in service provision by other agencies spillover into the local demand for policing by affecting the local tax price of police activities.
H71|Revisiting yardstick competition and spillover effects in in the new era of spatial econometrics: evidence from Italian cities|This paper exploits political features of Italian local governments to identify the presence of spatial interactions in spending decisions over the period 2001-2011. In particular, I take advantage of the political cycle to isolate the effect of spending decisions of one municipality on neighbors’ municipalities. The results of this analysis point to the presence of strategic interaction between neighboring municipalities, and indicate that such a fiscal behavior is more pronounced during electoral years, that is municipalities are engaged in yardstick competition. Moreover, to isolate any other source of spatial interactions from yardstick competition, I rely on a sample of municipalities experiencing a council dismissal, for which the political process is expected to be less marked - as they are led by a commissioner, who does not have any political concern. In this case, I build a measure of intensity of commissioner to induce variation in the spending decisions, finding, however, no evidence of spatial dependencies. Taken together these results suggest that the observed spatial dependence in spending decisions is unlikely to be driven by spillover e?ects, rather, it seems to be consent with the yardstick competition hypothesis.
H71|Who Sent You? Strategic Voting, Transfers and Bailouts in a Federation|Lower-level governments often receive federal support through transfers or bailouts. We study how the regional or local ties of federal politicians can steer this process. We build a two-tier model of government, where regionally elected federal legislators bargain over federal support aimed at their own constituency. This leads to strategic voting on the regional level. Federal legislators are strategically elected to watch over the interests of their own region, cushioning shocks to local consumption and driving down borrowing costs. Lower-level legislators anticipate this, which sets the stage for regional over-borrowing both if they receive annual grants, or when a bailout scheme is introduced during periods of crisis. Voters strategically select federal representatives with more extreme positions than the median voter, as long as federal co-funding schemes imply some degree of interregional redistribution. These theoretical predictions are confirmed by our empirical analysis, where we compare the political extremism of representatives elected to the EU Parliament with that of representatives elected to national Parliaments.
H71|Bribes vs. Taxes: Market Structure and Incentives|Firms in developing countries often avoid paying taxes by making informal payments to tax officials. These bribes may raise the cost of operating a business, and the price charged to consumers. To decrease these costs, the author has designed a feedback incentive scheme for business tax inspectors that reward them according to the anonymous evaluation submitted by inspected firms. It shows theoretically that feedback incentives decrease the equilibrium bribe amount, but make firms with more inelastic demand more attractive for inspectors. A tilted scheme that attaches higher weights to the evaluation of smaller firms limits the scope for targeting and decreases the bribe amount to a lesser extent. The paper evaluates both schemes in a field experiment in the Kyrgyz Republic and find evidence that is consistent with the model predictions. By decreasing bribes, our intervention reduces the average cost for firms and the price they charge to consumers. Since fewer firms substitute bribes for taxes, tax revenues increase. Our study highlights the role of firm heterogeneity and market structure in shaping the relationship between firms and tax inspectors, and provides clear evidence of pass-through of bribes to consumers.
H71|La evolución de la financiación de las comunidades autónomas de régimen común, 2002-2016|En este trabajo se construyen series homogeneizadas de financiación regional a competencias homogéneas e igual esfuerzo fiscal desde 2002 hasta 2016, así como series complementarias de financiación por caja y financiación destinada a competencias singulares. También se recopilan otros agregados de interés que pueden servir para relativizar la financiación autonómica, incluyendo la población ajustada regional. Estas series se utilizan para ilustrar algunos rasgos de interés de la evolución de la financiación agregada regional y de la posición relativa de las distintas comunidades autónomas en términos de financiación por unidad de necesidad. En la presente edición del informe se incorporan estimaciones de las subvenciones recibidas por las CCAA a través de la bonificación de los intereses de los préstamos estatales canalizados a través de los llamados mecanismos adicionales de financiación y del aplazamiento de la devolución de los saldos favorables al Estado de las liquidaciones del SFA correspondientes a los años 2008 y 2009. También se revisan las series de recaudación homogénea para las tasas afectas a los servicios traspasados y el impuesto sobre sucesiones y donaciones utilizando una nueva metodología.
H71|The tourist tax in the Italian municipalities|We study the implementation of the tourist tax in Italian municipalities, highlighting the link between its reach and the inbound tourist flows. The reference period is the year 2016. Municipalities with the tourist tax in 2016 are only one ninth of all Italian municipalities and one sixth of those eligible to do so, but they attract 70 per cent of inbound tourists. Revenues are on average about 4 per cent of all local taxation (around €20 per resident). Rome, Milan, Florence and Venice head the municipalities in terms of revenues. In fact, although these four towns only account for 7 per cent of total nights spent by tourists in Italy, their revenue share is over 50 per cent. A simple econometric estimation shows that the probability of introducing a tourist tax in a municipality is highly correlated to the tourist attractions of the local area and to the same tax being applied in the neighbouring municipalities, suggesting possible strategic interaction between them

H71|Can Facebook Ads and Email Messages Increase Fiscal Capacity? Experimental Evidence from Venezuela|Tax compliance is an important challenge in weakly institutionalized countries, in which citizens do not trust the State and prefer to evade taxation. However, e-government strategies may improve fiscal capacity, as the transaction costs of compliance are reduced and more information from taxpayers is gathered and exploited. Can compliance be increased, and hence fiscal capacity strengthened, using online communication strategies that exploit these tools and sources of information? We perform a randomized field experiment in the capital of Venezuela, Caracas, to determine if online strategies, namely email reminders and targeted Facebook advertisements, can increase tax compliance. We vary the mechanism used to approach taxpayers to test if more direct and personalized methods, such as email messages, are more effective than general advertisement tools, such as Facebook ads. Moreover, our design allows us to test potential complementarities between these strategies thus boosting the capacity of the local government to increase compliance. We find that these strategies are cost-effective methods for increasing tax revenues, but that the effects vary across different types of taxpayers.
H71|Revisión de tendencias y perspectivas de las finanzas públicas del Distrito Capital y de sus fuentes de financiación|Bogotá enfrenta grandes retos de mediano y largo plazo en términos de financiación. Esto como consecuencia de las crecientes necesidades de gasto en infraestructura y provisión de servicios públicos y de un crecimiento lento, en los últimos años, de sus fuentes principales de financiamiento. El presente trabajo estudia las fuentes de financiación del distrito de Bogotá. La capital ha logrado incrementar su capacidad de generación de recursos propios y cada vez depende menos de las transferencias del nivel central. Estos recursos propios representan hoy en día el 53% de los ingresos totales del distrito. Además, como la estructura tributaria de la ciudad depende en una proporción del 65% de los impuestos a la actividad económica, esto la hace vulnerable a los ciclos económicos. Adicionalmente, se ha dado una recomposición de la importancia de los impuestos en la capital. Al analizar los principales impuestos, se encontró que el predial ha tomado fuerza mientras que ICA ha perdido la dinámica que tenía en el pasado. De otra parte, aunque Bogotá sigue concentrando la mayor parte del recaudo de la región, otros municipios de la Sabana han aumentado su participación pues han tenido recientemente altas tasas de crecimiento en su recaudo. Esto resultados son similares al efectuar una comparación con las otras cuatro ciudades más grandes del país. Con base en estos resultados, se hacen sugerencias de política, principalmente centradas en que es necesario promover las simplificaciones a la estructura tributaria de la ciudad para generar un crecimiento dinámico de sus principales fuentes de financiamiento. Adicionalmente, se reconoce la necesidad de integrar a Bogotá con los municipios de la Sabana, con el fin de promover la potencialidad existente en términos económicos. Además, para evitar episodios de competencia tributaria y mejorar las distribuciones de los impuestos departamentales, se requiere una mayor coordinación entre los territorios. Hay avances en este camino, pero falta mucho por recorrer.

Lo anterior indica que nuestra unidad de análisis son las empresas de diez o menos trabajadores; las definiciones y medidas de la informalidad empresarial y tributaria que se van a utilizar en el resto del trabajo, y la relación que existe entre estas dos variables se presenta a continuación.
H71|Tasa efectiva de tributación para Bogotá|El presente trabajo se propone analizar la presión tributaria generada por las empresas grandes y medianas. Para este fin, se obtuvieron las tasas efectivas de tributación impuestos locales y nacionales. Adicionalmente, para profundizar en el análisis de las problemáticas sectoriales, también se caracterizaron algunas grandes empresas, y por último, se entrevistaron empresas para entender la percepción de las empresas acerca de la evasión, sus decisiones de localización y para ejemplificar los costos de cumplimiento de las obligaciones tributarias locales. Los resultados en muestras representativas muestran que, pese a una gran dispersión en el segmento de las empresas grandes y pequeñas, las tasas de tributación efectiva del ICA ponderada por activos varían entre el 5.25% y el 9.43, mientras que en Cundinamarca está entre el 6.05% y el 9.36% (El ICA, además, parece ser un impuesto regresivo). Respecto a los tributos nacionales, en promedio la tasa efectiva del impuesto de renta en Bogotá es siete p.p. mayor que en Cundinamarca para el promedio ponderado, tal vez debido a que en la base departamental no quedan incluidos sectores con alta tributación y, en segundo lugar, se puede deber a las menores tasas estatutarias para las zonas francas. La ejemplificación de empresas constata las particularidades sectoriales y diferencias con los promedios obtenidos de las bases de datos, encontrando tasas efectivas de tributación de renta y de ICA inferiores a las obtenidas en el análisis agregado, y también resalta el alto costo de cumplimiento tributario y el carácter antitécnico del ICA al usar como base los ingresos brutos. Respecto a las decisiones de localización en Bogotá y en Cundinamarca, pesan más el tamaño del mercado, la disponibilidad de mano de obra y materiales y, de infraestructura y logística que los impuestos locales. De manera similar a lo que había encontrado una encuesta de la Cámara en 2011. Finalmente, se realizan recomendaciones de política con base en lo encontrado en el trabajo.
H71|Heterogeneity in the tax pass-through to spirit retail prices: Evidence from Belgium|On 1st November 2015, the Belgian government increased the excise tax on alcoholic beverages. For spirits with 40% of alcohol and bottle size of 70cl, this tax change is equivalent to an amount of 2,43€ per bottle of spirits. This paper studies the impact of this tax reform on the retail price of six major brands of spirits, using a difference-in-differences method. The estimation is based on a balanced panel of scanner data from a major supermarket chain and uses the retail prices of the same brands sold in France by the same supermarket chain as a control group. Having information on each store geographical location, we can further test for heterogeneity in tax pass-through according to the intensity of local competition and the scope for cross-border shopping. We find that the tax was quickly passed through spirit retail prices already during the first month of tax implementation and that it was mostly over-shifted. Unlike the (nearly) uniform pricing in US retail chains, we show spatial variation in prices across stores, and we find a large heterogeneity in tax pass-through linked to variation in local competition and price elasticity of demand. Although the tax reform has considerably increased the relative price of Belgian spirits with respect to all its neighboring countries, we find a lower tax shifting only in stores bordering on Luxembourg. Which is the neighboring country with the lowest spirit prices before the alcohol tax reform. These findings have important implications for alcohol control policies as they highlight the risk that the health benefits of alcohol taxation can vary greatly across households according to where they live.
H71|Recovering social networks from panel data: identification, simulations and an application| It is almost self-evident that social interactions can determine economic behavior and outcomes. Yet, information on social ties does not exist in most publicly available and widely used datasets. We present results on the identification of social networks from observational panel data that contains no information on social ties between agents. In the context of a canonical social interactions model, we provide sufficient conditions under which the social interactions matrix, endogenous and exogenous social effect parameters are all globally identified. While this result is relevant across different estimation strategies, we then describe how high-dimensional estimation techniques can be used to estimate the model based on the Adaptive Elastic Net GMM method. We showcase the method and its robustness in Monte Carlo simulations using stylized and real world network structures. Finally, we employ the method to study tax competition across US states. We find the identified network structure of tax competition differs markedly from the common assumption of competition between geographically neighboring states. We analyze the identified social interactions matrix to provide novel insights into the long-standing debate on the relative roles of factor mobility and yardstick competition in driving tax setting behavior across states. Most broadly, our results show how the analysis of social interactions can be extended to economic realms where no network data exists.
H71|Fossil fuel subsidies, income inequality and poverty. Evidence from developing countries|The past two decades have witnessed widespread attempts to reform fossil fuel subsidies in developing countries. If the reforms are likely to improve economic efficiency, the expected effects on income distribution and poverty are more controversial. This paper reviews the recent literature that examines the impacts of fossil fuel subsidies and their reform on income inequality and poverty. It identifies the different channels that have been explored in the literature and surveys the empirical evidence on the importance ofthese channels in practice. Drawing on diverse country experiences, it also discusses why fossil fuel subsidies are particularly challenging to reform and highlights several ways in which efforts to reform may be feasible and successful.
H71|Fiscal equalization and the tax structure|Sub-national governments often finance substantial parts of their budgets via taxes on capital or other mobile factors – despite having access to alternative, less distortionary, revenue sources. This paper develops three hypotheses to explain this pattern and tests them in a natural experiment from Germany. The first hypothesis is that fiscal redistribution between jurisdictions lowers the perceived excess burden of distortionary taxation and thereby raises its attractiveness from the perspective of local governments; the second is that a desire for redistribution within jurisdictions induces a shift away from less distortionary tax instruments, despite their superior efficiency properties; the third is that distortionary taxation serves as a Pigouvian intervention to correct externalities. The empirical analysis supports redistribution between jurisdictions as important, but insufficient, to fully explain the observed reliance on distortionary taxation. Among the remaining two hypotheses, the data favour Pigouvian over distributional motives as a further rationale for the local taxation of mobile factors. JEL Classification: H23, H25, H71, H77

H71|"""But For"" Percentages for Economic Development Incentives: What percentage estimates are plausible based on the research literature?"|This paper reviews the research literature in the United States on effects of state and local “economic development incentives.” Such incentives are tax breaks or grants, provided by state or local governments to individual firms, that are intended to affect firms’ decisions about business location, expansion, or job retention. Incentives’ benefits versus costs depend greatly on what percentage of incented firms would not have made a particular location/expansion/retention decision “but for” the incentive. Based on a review of 34 estimates of “but for” percentages, from 30 different studies, this paper concludes that typical incentives probably tip somewhere between 2 percent and 25 percent of incented firms toward making a decision favoring the location providing the incentive. In other words, for at least 75 percent of incented firms, the firm would have made a similar decision location/expansion/retention decision without the incentive. Many of the current incentive studies are positively biased toward overestimating the “but for” percentage. Better estimates of “but for” percentages depend on developing data that quantitatively measure diverse changes in incentive policies across comparable areas.
H71|Fiscal multipliers of central, state and local government and of the social security funds in Germany: Evidence of a SVAR|By applying a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) approach this paper estimates the effects of fiscal policy shocks of different government sub-sectors on aggregate GDP in Germany. From a general government perspective, the results show that besides investment, it is particularly changes in social contributions that yield significant output effects. The GDP response to fiscal policy shocks of the various government sub-sectors turns out to be very heterogeneous. Investment expenditures at all public authorities (central, state and local) trigger positive and statistically significant output effects at least on impact. By contrast, it is only government consumption at state government level and monetary benefits at state government and social security level that induce statistically significant and positive effects on economic activity. Overall, the disaggregated results suggest that besides investment, it is chiefly expenditure with a large share of personnel-related outlays that can have positive effects on aggregate output.
H71|Fiscal disparity, institutions and asymmetric yardstick competition|Fiscal disparity leads to a yardstick bias, in that incumbents in fiscally-rich jurisdictions can provide more public goods, extract more rents and yet have a higher probability to be reelected. This study further emphasizes disparity among jurisdictions, not only in terms of fiscal resources but also of costs of rent appropriation. In a setting in which jurisdictions with a higher fiscal capacity have lower costs of rent appropriation whilst those with a lower fiscal capacity have higher costs of rent appropriation, the difference in costs of rent appropriation might moderate the bias caused by the fiscal disparity.
H71|Taxes, Wage Capitalization and the Ability of States to Redistribute Income|Local and state governments attempt to lessen after-tax income inequality via progressive taxation. Migration responses of capital and labor undermine such attempts. Location theory predicts that cross-state migration will continue until the redistributive effects from taxation are fully capitalized into gross wages leaving after-tax wages unchanged. Empirical evidence has not reached a consensus on this issue. At one extreme, Feldstein and Wrobel (1998) report evidence of full tax capitalization for US states. At the other extreme, Leigh (2008) reports very little to no wage capitalization. We revisit this question by creating a pseudo panel from CPS data spanning years 1997 to 2015. Our “best” estimate is that pre-tax wages adjust in response to redistributive state and local taxes, negating roughly 50 percent of effect compared to counterfactual with no behavioral responses.
H71|Voting with your wallet? Municipal budget policy and election results|In this paper, the authors examine the impact of municipal budget policy on the percentage of votes for the incumbent majority parties in subsequent elections. They contribute to the academic literature by examining the combined influence of taxes, expenditures and debt. Based on data for Flanders (Belgium) between 1994 and 2012, they find no significant association between these budget variables and the actual election results.
H71|Regional tax effort in Spain|This work examines in depth the hypotheses explaining the tax capacity of regional governments, also determining their tax effort and explanatory factors. The study is done for the Spanish regions, using different techniques which have rarely been applied in this area. The results show that these jurisdictions have exercised their tax autonomy responsibly, in response to different budget and demographic factors and to the economic cycle. Also, an asymmetrical tax behaviour linked to income is observed: some regions have practically exhausted the possibilities of current sub-central taxes, while others still have ample fiscal space.
H71|Equalization transfers and the pattern of municipal spending: An investigation of the flypaper effect in Germany|"We investigate how lump-sum equalization transfers affect expenditures and taxes in the municipalities of the largest German state North Rhine-Westphalia. In general, those general-purpose transfers cannot be treated as exogenous variables. Thus, for the identification of causal effects, two exogenous adjustments in the transfer allocation formula are used as instrumental variables. Findings suggest the existence of the ""flypaper effect"" - municipalities use transfers to increase expenditures but do not reduce tax rates. Extra money from transfers is mainly used to finance social expenditures and public facilities. A set of robustness checks, including a spatial dependence model, confirm the results."

H71|Fiscally Responsible Mafia-clans|To work as an accountability mechanism, fiscal decentralization requires the democratic mechanism to function well. This is generally not the case where the quality of the institutional environment is weak, and local governments might be captured by local oligarchs. We explore this issue by studying how Italian municipalities reacted to an unexpected tax reform reducing tax autonomy at the local level. Focusing on three Southern provinces, where some municipal governments are captured by Camorra clans, our estimates suggest that captured municipalities are less responsive to incentives stemming from re-centralization. We also observe a different recomposition of spending between the two groups, which we interpret - according to our theoretical model - considering the different degrees with which clans can extract rents from public expenditure.
H71|New Evidence on State Fiscal Multipliers: Implications for State Policies|"When state and local governments engage in balanced budget changes in taxes and spending, what fiscal multiplier effects do such policies have on creating local jobs? Traditionally, the view has been that possible job-creation effects of such state and local ""demand-side” policies are smaller, second-order effects. Such effects might be worthwhile to take into consideration when a state or local government balances its budget during a recession, but the effects were believed to be of modest magnitude, and not of major importance for more general state and local public policies. However, recent estimates of fiscal multiplier effects of state and local spending and tax policies suggest much larger demand-side effects of such policies on local jobs. These fiscal multiplier effects are large enough to suggest relatively low costs per job created of some tax and spending policy combinations, sufficient to alter the net benefits of many public policies. In particular, this recent research suggests that policies that use tax increases on the top 10 percent of the income distribution to finance either public spending expansions or tax relief for the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution may offer some job creation benefits that are large enough to alter state and local policy decisions. Furthermore, the cost per job created of state business tax incentive policies or business tax cuts may be significantly altered after taking into account the opportunity costs of financing such policies by cutting public spending or raising taxes on the bottom 90 percent."
H71|Do local governments tax homeowner communities differently?|"This paper investigates whether and how strongly the share of homeowners in a community affects residential property taxation by local governments. Different from renters, homeowners bear the full property tax burden irrespective of local market conditions, and the tax is more salient to them. ""Homeowner communities"" may hence oppose high property taxes in order to protect their housing wealth. Using granular spatial data from a complete housing inventory in the 2011 German Census and historical war damages as a source of exogenous variation in local homeownership, we provide empirical evidence that otherwise identical jurisdictions charge significantly lower property taxes when the share of homeowners in their population is higher. This result is invariant to local market conditions, which suggests tax salience as the key mechanism behind this effect. We find positive spatial dependence in tax multipliers, indicative of property tax mimicking by local governments."
H71|Do National Basketball Association players need higher salaries to play in high tax states? Evidence from free agents| This article investigates the impact of taxes on the salaries received by National Basketball Association free agents from 2010 to 2014. High state income tax rates affect the after-tax income received by players from their team as well as on any ancillary income. Using data on 576 free agents, we find statistically significant evidence that free agents signing in high tax states receive higher salaries, ceteris paribus. Our results suggest that a one-unit increase in the Average Tax Rate experienced by a free agent in a state leads to free agent salaries being over $60,000 higher.
H71|Professional Sports Events, Concerts, and Urban Place Based Policy: Evidence from the Staples Center|We analyze the relationship between sports events and concerts, important hospitality demand drivers and key components of many urban renewal projects, in the Staples Center in Los Angeles, an arena home to three pro teams, and nearby hotel performance, exploiting exogenous daily variation in the timing of games and concerts from 2002 to 2017. Results show a small positive impact on revenue per available room at hotels within one mile of the arena and an offsetting decrease at hotels located one to four miles away. Granting nearby hotels exemptions from Los Angeles hotel taxes reduces potential tourism-generated hotel tax revenue increases.
H71|Tax competition and the political economy of public employment: a model for Austria|Abstract In this work, we simulate the effects of the tax autonomy of the Austrian states on the levels of public employment in each state. We show that depending on the strength of the public sector lobby, tax autonomy would require a reduction of employment in the public sector of between 25 and 35% of the current level. We also show that tax autonomy increases welfare levels by 1–1.5%; that is, the positive change in the disposable income of the workers more than offsets the welfare loss resulting from the lower provision of public goods. Finally, we show that the reduction of public employment is superior in terms of welfare to an alternative scenario in which employment levels are held constant but the wage levels in the public sector are adjusted.
H71|Formula apportionment: Factor allocation and tax avoidance|This paper addresses the question of how firms react to tax incentives in a formula apportionment (FA) tax regime. Under FA, the profits of all consolidated entities of a business group are summed and then allocated according to a formula based on FA factors. We hypothesize that firms may change the allocation of real production factors and/or manipulate the FA factor through tax avoidance strategies. Analysing FA tax effects of the German local business tax with payroll expense as the exclusive FA factor, we find empirical evidence consistent with both hypotheses. Regarding the allocation of production factors, we observe significant tax effects on labour input at the intensive margin but not on labour input at the extensive margin. In addition, we find evidence of an indirect FA spillover effect on capital investment. Our findings on tax avoidance proxies are consistent with tax-induced manipulations of payroll expense as an FA factor to save tax payments.

H71|The effect of land consumption on municipal tax revenue: Evidence from Bavaria|This paper aims to quantify the municipal tax revenue effects of built-up area increases. The assumed existence of these effects is one of the key reasons for ongoing land consumption on the side of the municipalities. Some previous case studies however suggested that these effects might be not large enough especially in rural municipalities and would thus make land development not profitable. We estimate the effect of built-up industrial and commercial (BIC) area change on the business tax revenues in cross-sectional instrumental variable (IV) estimations. Based on detailed data for Bavaria, we find a significant and positive tax revenue effect of an increase in municipal BIC area. There exist strong differences in the size of this effect between urban and rural municipalities. The largest effects are generated by the BIC area in the large cities and become substantially smaller when these are dropped from the sample. Based on these findings, we reflect on the tradable planning permits (TPP) scheme recently discussed in the land use literature in the context of policies aiming to limit land consumption. Furthermore, we relate our estimates to the average municipal costs for land development and execute a number of robustness checks.
H71|Political fragmentation and fiscal policy: Evidence from German municipalities|The government fragmentation hypothesis (GFH) states that coalition governments spend more than single-party governments due to an underlying common pool problem. Using a large panel data set on 604 local governments in the German state of Baden-Württemberg for the 1994-2014 period, I test the GFH for tax rates, the growth in government debt as well as expenditures and its sub-categories. Studies using standard regression methods fail to identify causal effect as the type of government is generally not random. I apply a RDD, that exploits quasi-random variation generated by close elections. I add external validity to the recent quasi-experimental literature by investigating the GFH for a mayor-council system. I find that contrary to the theoretical prediction, coalition governments do not increase taxes and government debt. There is a non-robust, negative effect on total expenditures, which is mainly driven by administrative expenditures and material expenditures.
H71|The German real estate transfer tax: Evidence for single-family home transactions|This paper uses recent data for single-family home purchases to study the effects of the German real estate transfer tax. We aim to separate the tax's anticipatory effects from its lock-in effects on real estate transactions. The data indicate that an increase in the transfer tax is negatively correlated with the number of transactions that take place in the market for single-family homes. We estimate that an increase in the transfer tax produces enormous anticipation effects: 41% more transactions for the month just before and 42% fewer transactions just after. In addition, a one-percentage-point increase in the transfer tax yields approximately 7% fewer transactions due to the lock-in effect.
H71|Entwicklung eines Indifferenzsteuersatzes für den European Tax Analyzer|Zur Messung von Effektivsteuerbelastungen hat sich in den vergangenen Jahren ein umfassendes Instrumentarium entwickelt, das auf unterschiedlichen Methoden basiert. Der European Tax Analyzer verwendet vollständige Finanzpläne und besitzt insbesondere Stärken durch eine sehr detaillierte Abbildung von steuerlichen Vorschriften. Als Maßgröße werden bisher absolute Steuerbelastungen verwendet, die lediglich eine ordinale Rangordnung alternativer Investitionsstandorte ermöglichen. Aufbauend auf den Arbeiten von Schreiber/Ruf (2004) und Ruf (2005) wird im Rahmen der Untersuchung ein sogenannter Indifferenzsteuersatz für den European Tax Analyzer entwickelt. Diese zusätzliche relative Maßgröße erlaubt einen unmittelbaren Vergleich mit dem tariflichen Körperschaftsteuersatz eines Landes. Eine erste Anwendung des Konzepts zeigt, dass der neue Indifferenzsteuersatz insbesondere in Ländern, in denen die Effektivsteuerbelastung nicht nur von der Körperschaftsteuer bestimmt wird, eine genaue und zugleich leicht verständliche Abschätzung der zu erwartenden Steuerbelastung erlaubt.

H71|Public subsidies, TFP and efficiency: A tale of complex relationships|This paper evaluates the impact of subsidies on the different components of TFP for granted firms’ long-term growth. The impact of capital subsidies is captured by a quasi–experimental method (Multiple RDD), exploiting the conditions for a local random experiment created by an Italian industrial policy. Results show that capital subsidies negatively affect TFP growth in the short term, and signals of positive effects appear only after 3–4 years. This positive medium-long term impact comes especially through technological change and not through scale impact change, as may have been expected.
H71|Las aglomeraciones urbanas y los impuestos: algunas ideas derivadas de la aplicación de la curva de Laffer al impuesto sobre la renta español en diferentes escenarios espaciales|Background: Optimal tax rates have been a recurrent theme in tax policy discussions. In particular, the link between tax structure and economic growth has revived the Laffer hypothesis that implies the existence of a parabolic relationship between level of taxation and achieved revenues. Our own hypothesis is that urban areas have an equally significant impact on willingness to pay taxes and that there can be as much or even more heterogeneity among urban sizes as there is among different territories. Methods: We contrast the Laffer hypothesis for the Spanish case under different spatial scenarios using microdata for 2009 provided by the country’s Institute for Fiscal Studies (IEF). We employ a cross-sectional sample of tax filers, estimated by means of least squares. Results: The presence of a parabolic relationship between the tax burden and tax collection enables us to obtain a revenue-maximizing tax rate of around 30%, twice the average rate currently applied. In our analysis by regions, we find significant variations that justify the existence of a high level of fiscal decentralization. However, this variability is also found to be significant in our analysis by size of city. The maximum tax revenue of the two main cities —Madrid and Barcelona— is obtained at a tax rate of 34%, with all other cities reaching their maximum revenue levels at similar rates. Conclusions: The smaller the city, the lower the rate that maximizes tax revenue, with the gap between the real rate and the optimal rate being greater the smaller the city.// Antecedentes: La búsqueda de las tasas impositivas óptimas ha sido recurrente en las discusiones de política fiscal. En particular, la relación entre la estructura tributaria y el crecimiento económico ha hecho resurgir la hipótesis de Laffer que implica la existencia de una relación parabólica entre el nivel de impuestos y los ingresos obtenidos. Nuestra hipótesis es que las zonas urbanas tienen un impacto igualmente significativo sobre la disposición a pagar impuestos y puede existir igual o más heterogeneidad entre los tamaños urbanos que entre los diferentes territorios. Metodología: En este artículo se contrasta la hipótesis de Laffer para el caso español utilizando microdatos del Instituto de Estudios Fiscales (IEF) para el año 2009 en diferentes escenarios espaciales. Para ello, se utiliza una muestra de declarantes de corte transversal estimada con mínimos cuadrados ordinarios. Resultados: La presencia de una relación parabólica entre la carga tributaria y la recaudación de impuestos permite obtener una tasa impositiva que maximiza los ingresos fiscales en torno a 30%, el doble del promedio aplicado. Por regiones, hemos observado variaciones importantes que justifican la existencia de un alto grado de descentralización fiscal. Pero esta variabilidad es también importante según el tamaño de las ciudades. Los ingresos fiscales máximos de las dos principales ciudades, Madrid y Barcelona, se obtienen con una tasa impositiva de 34%, mientras que todas las demás ciudades alcanzan el máximo de ingresos fiscales a tasas similares. Conclusiones: Cuanto menor es el tamaño de la ciudad, menor es la tasa impositiva que maximiza los ingresos fiscales, abriendo una brecha más grande cuanto más pequeña es la ciudad.
H71|Changing Tax Capacity and Tax Effort of Indian States in the Era of High Economic Growth, 2001-2014|Growing demand for public expenditures, limitations in expanding fiscal space and limited scope to deviate from common harmonized tax system under the proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime may induce the states to look for opportunities to xpand revenue mobilization through alternative channels (e.g. non-tax revenue mobilization). An assessment of the existing tax efficiency (or tax effort) and strengthening tax administration could be one of such alternatives available for states to pursue. Tax administration is as important as tax base to augment revenues of a state. Efficiency of tax administration helps a state to achieve a stable tax regime which is conducive for introduction of tax reforms measures like GST. Buoyancy of tax revenues of a state is not only dependent on growth in tax base and structure of taxes but also on the state of tax administration. Many papers have been written to estimate tax effort of Indian states. Taking this exercise to the next level, this paper focuses on measuring tax effort and identifying factors that explain variations in the tax effort across states. In measuring tax potential, an attempt has been made to differentiate between factors that determine the tax base and factors that constrain the state from utilizing the available base. The exercise looks at comprehensive revenue collection under Value Added Tax of general category states for the period 2001-02 to 2013-14.

H71|The Porter Hypothesis Goes to China: Spatial Development, Environmental Regulation and Productivity|We examine the relationship between environmental regulation and competitiveness in China. Exploiting exogenous changes in national pollution standards for three industries—ammonia, paper and cement—we test whether environmental regulation increases industry productivity. Our results show that the strong version of the Porter hypothesis does not hold, but that regulation might reallocate productivity spatially. We show that regulated industries that are located in newly developing cities see an increase in their productivity as compared to the same industries in other cities. This means that environmental regulation is more likely to drive the spatial distribution of productivity changes than it is to drive the pace and direction of technological change.
H71|How Does Environmental Regulation Shape Economic Development? A Tax Competition Model of China|We propose a novel theoretical framework to study how environmental regulation shapes economic development in a developing country such as China. We develop a dynamic tax competition model in which local governments, located in development zones, use variation in taxes to attract workers to their jurisdictions. Their objective is to maximize tax revenue less local health costs that are proportional to local pollution. Our main result is that competition generates a reallocation of productive factors when national regulation is introduced. Local governments in more productive regions set greater production taxes than in other regions. This makes workers and output to shift from more to less developed regions of the country.
H71|Local taxation and tax base mobility: Evidence from a business tax reform in France|This paper investigates the impact of tax base mobility on local taxation. We first develop a theoretical model in order to examine the connection between local business property taxation and tax base mobility within a metropolitan area. We find that decreasing capital intensity in the tax base increases the business property tax rates unambiguously. We then test this result using a French reform, which changes the composition of the main local business tax base in 2010. Estimations using Difference-in-Differences show that the reduction in the mobility of the tax base indeed results in higher business property tax rates. Housing tax rates were not affected by the reform.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H71|The Impact of a Rise in the Real Estate Transfer Taxes on the French Housing Market|This paper estimates the effects of an increase in the real estate transfer taxes (RETT) rate from 3.80% to 4.50%, following an optional reform implemented in March 2014 by French départements. Not all the départements implemented the RETT increase, which is the starting point for a natural experiment: using a difference-in-differences design, we estimate two main effects. (1) An anticipation effect a month before the implementation of the reform in order to avoid the RETT increase (timing response). The total tax base increased by 28% just the month before. (2) The classic depressing effect of a tax on the equilibrium quantity (extensive margin response) is estimated to be 7% on average from March 2014 to October 2015. All in all, the average net effect corresponds to a drop of the transactions of 4.6% over a period of ten months following the implementation date. Furthermore, we estimate that the elasticity of the tax revenue to the tax increase is about 0.65, meaning that départements’ tax revenues are still on the increasing side of the Laffer curve.
H71|Hidden Subsidies and the Public Ownership of Sports Facilities: The Case of Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara|Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California is an example of a private financing / public ownership arrangement. While the stadiumï¿½s construction resulted in no direct tax increases, this ownership arrangement allows the San Francisco 49ers to avoid many types of taxes on the income generated from Leviï¿½s Stadium. We estimate the total tax savings to the 49ers at between $106 and $213 million over the first 20 years of Leviï¿½s Stadium compared with a privately financed and owned option. We argue that tax savings inherent in private financing / public ownership arrangements represent indirect and hidden subsidies.
H71|Revenue Nodes in South India and Central Java|Studies of relations binding ruled and ruler over the form and content of revenue assessment during the colonial era are not lacking. Rather, the intellectual challenge lies in ascertaining the degree to which the relevant economic institutions of the subjected regions in southern Asia constituted continuity of tradition, modifications thereof, or completely alien constructs. Meeting that challenge is hindered by inequality of information revealing ‘before’ and ‘after’ conditions; an embarrassment of riches in information on the latter contrasts to poverty of the former. The present paper aims at least partially filling that gap by ascertaining in comparative perspective the basis of the revenue assessment systems prevailing in South India (Karnataka) and Central Java (Yogyakarta) during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. What makes such an undertaking not only desirable from a scholarly point of view but also possible in practice is the near unique finds of virtually untapped original source materials deriving from the respective institutions’ function.
H71|Hospital centralization and performance in Denmark - ten years on|Denmark implemented a major reform of the administrative and political structure in 2007 when the previous 13 counties were merged into five new regions and the number of municipalities was reduced from 271 to 98. A main objective was to create administrative units that were large enough to support a hospital structure with few acute hospitals in each region and to centralize specialized care in fewer hospitals. This paper analyses the reorganization of the somatic hospital sector in Denmark since 2007, discusses the mechanisms behind the changes and analyses hospital performance after the reform. The reform emphasized an improved acute service and high quality. The number of acute hospitals was reduced from about 40 to 21 hospitals with joint acute facilities. The restructuring and geographical placement of acute hospitals took place in a democratic process subject to central guidelines and requirements. Since the reform, hospital productivity has increased by more than 2 per cent per year and costs have been stable. While the overall indicators point to a successful reform, it has also been criticized that some people in remote areas feel “left behind” in the economic development and that hospital staff are under increased workload pressure. Concurrent with the centralization of hospitals municipalities strengthened their health service with an emphasis on prevention and health promotion.

H71|Does Inter-municipal Cooperation promote efficiency gains? Evidence from Italian Municipal|Inter-municipal cooperation is a widespread phenomenon among municipalities as a way to provide local public services, exploit economies of scale and internalise externalities. While the determinants driving the decision to cooperate have been deeply analyzed in the literature, little is known about possible efficiency gains. We test their existence in terms of local public expenditures reductions by investigating the Italian experience of Municipal Unions. We exploit unique administrative data on 335 municipalities located in the Emilia Romagna region, for the period 2001-2011. Using a difference-in-differences approach combined with matching models, we find that being in a Municipal Union reduces the total per capita current expenditures by around 5%. The effect is robust, persistent and increasing up to nine years after entrance. Furthermore, joining a Municipal Union does not reduce the level of local public services. Hence, the Municipal Union is an effective tool that allows municipalities to gain efficiency.
H71|Tax competition among U.S. states: Racing to the bottom or riding on a seesaw?|Dramatic declines in capital tax rates among U.S. states and European countries have been linked by many commentators to tax competition, an inevitable “race to the bottom,” and underprovision of local public goods. This paper analyzes the reaction of capital tax policy in a given U.S. state to changes in capital tax policy by other states. Our study is undertaken with a novel panel data set covering the 48 contiguous U.S. states for the period 1965 to 2006 and is guided by the theory of strategic tax competition. The latter suggests that capital tax policy is a function of “foreign” (out-of-state) tax policy, preferences for government services, and home state and foreign state economic and demographic conditions. The slope of the reaction function – the equilibrium response of home state to foreign state tax policy – is negative, contrary to casual evidence and many prior empirical studies of fiscal reaction functions. This result, which stands in contrast to most published findings, is due to two critical elements that allow for delayed responses to foreign tax changes and responses to aggregate shocks. Omitting either of these elements leads to a misspecified model and a positively sloped reaction function. Our results suggest that the secular decline in capital tax rates, at least among U.S. states, reflects synchronous responses among states to common shocks rather than competitive responses to foreign state tax policy. While striking given prior empirical findings, these results are fully consistent with the implications of the theoretical model developed in this paper and presented elsewhere in the literature. Rather than “racing to the bottom,” our findings suggest that states are “riding on a seesaw.” Consequently, tax competition may lead to an increase in the provision of local public goods, and policies aimed at restricting tax competition to stem the tide of declining capital taxation are likely to be ineffective.
H71|Why not fully spend a conditional block grant?|Abstract This paper studies a conditional block grant that Dutch municipalities receive for welfare-to-work programs. Many municipalities do not fully use this grant, although programs are beneficial for them. We argue that municipalities incur expenses to use the grant. If these costs are substantial, then it is optimal not to fully use the grant. Based on municipality-specific data on grants and actual expenditures, we estimate that municipalities have to add about 90 cents from their own resources to spend 1 euro of the grant. As a result, the conditional block grant is de facto a closed-ended matching grant.
H71|Az adózói magatartás különféle magyarázatai<BR>[Various explanations for tax compliance]|A kockázat melletti egyéni adózói döntés klasszikus modellje az adózó jogkövetés és adócsalás közötti egyéni választásaként kezeli a problémát. Szakirodalmi áttekintésünkben e modell tömör bemutatása után megvizsgáljuk, hogy az empirikus eredmények mennyiben vágnak egybe a modellben szereplő magyarázó tényezők elméleti alapon várt hatásaival. Az eredmények - elsősorban a jövedelem, de kisebb mértékig az adókulcsok nagysága tekintetében is - ellentmondásosak, in kon klu zí vek. Az ellenőrzés valószínűsége és a jogkövető adózói magatartás közötti pozitív kapcsolat ugyanakkor általában empirikusan igazolható. A büntetések nagyságának elrettentő hatása azonban a vártnál gyengébb, bár felerősödhet, ha nagy az ellenőrzés valószínűsége. Mindezek alapján kimondható, hogy szükség van más, valósághűbb modellekre. Bemutatjuk az adózói magatartás magyarázatára kidolgozott fontosabb új paradigmákat: a hozzájárulási dilemma által meghatározott adózói viselkedés, az adózói heterogenitás mint a viselkedést meghatározó tényező, valamint az implicit pszichológiai szerződés paradigmáit, illetve az e megközelítések pozitívumait szintetizálni képes csúszóslejtő-paradigmát, amely integrálja az adózói jogkövetés gazdasági és pszichológiai szempontú magyarázatát. A területen megjelent, egyre népszerűbb módszertani innováció, az ágensalapú szimuláció elterjedése azzal magyarázható, hogy ez a modellezési megközelítés jól használható az adózói viselkedést leíró új paradigmák vizsgálatához.* Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) kód: H26, H71, O17, C63, C91.

H71|Land Value Capture and Social Benefits: Toronto and SÃ£o Paulo Compared|This paper describes and compares land value capture (LVC) tools in SÃ£o Paulo and Toronto. LVC refers to the public sectorâ€™s recovery of part or all of the land value increments or â€œwindfallsâ€ accruing to new development through taxes, fees, exactions, or improvements that benefit the wider community. In SÃ£o Paulo, a tool known as the onerous grant of the right to build (OODC) allows developers to pay for development rights in exchange for providing urban improvements of social interest to the community. In Toronto, a tool known as Section 37 allows developers certain development rights in exchange for cash or in-kind contributions. The paper has three goals: (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of, challenges to, and benefits derived from land value capture for generating urban financing; (2) to explore where such funds are allocated and how these allocation decisions are made; and (3) to identify who benefits from such decisions. The paper uses quantitative data to determine the benefits derived from the tools and expert interviews that explore the political and historical background associated with the use of both tools.
H71|Financing Urban Infrastructure in Canada: Who Should Pay?|The poor state of municipal infrastructure is the subject of frequent complaint in Canada. Roads are congested, transit systems are in need of major investments, bridges are crumbling, and water treatment plants need to be replaced. Municipalities continue to seek financial assistance from the federal and provincial governments, but are transfers really the best way to pay for municipal capital investments? This paper provides an overview of how municipal infrastructure is funded in Canada with an emphasis on the extent to which the users of infrastructure pay the costs. The paper concludes that although user fees are increasing in Canadian municipalities, better pricing is needed to link those who benefit with those who pay for municipal infrastructure.
H71|Paying for Water in Ontario's Cities: Past, Present, and Future|Throughout much of the 20th century, water was seen as plentiful and water rates did not promote conservation. Today, water is treated as a relatively scarce resource and governments are concerned about financing new and rehabilitated infrastructure. However, most municipalities still do not set prices for water at levels that would encourage conservation, thereby allowing the overconsumption of water, and leading to increased demand for expensive infrastructure. Setting efficient prices for water, sewage collection and treatment, and stormwater runoff would include (1) multi-part pricing for water to accommodate capacity constraints, economies of scale, and peak-load demand; (2) greater use of meters and volumetric pricing for residential and commercial sewer usage; and (3) stormwater user fees based on the volume of runoff. In smaller or remote municipalities, the amalgamation, regionalization, or privatization of water and sewer systems could lead to greater efficiencies. Meanwhile, the Province should set water safety standards, coordinate water utility systems, and put in place a regulatory framework that would support necessary but unpopular increases in water rates.
H71|Tax Mimicking in Local Business Taxation: Quasi-experimental Evidence from Portugal|I exploit an exogenous reform introducing a local business tax in Portugal to study tax mimicking among jurisdictions. The identiï¬ cation strategy relies on a quasi-experimental diï¬€erence-in-diï¬€erences methodology and heterogeneity in treatment intensity. Results provide evidence of signiï¬ cant short-run tax mimicking that decreases over time. I study possible generating processes underlying the strategic interaction among municipalities and ï¬ nd signiï¬ cant evidence of electoral concerns. These electoral concerns are not met with electoral consequences at the local elections, which may be behind the diï¬€usion of local business taxation in the long run.
H71|Economies of Density in E-Commerce: A Study of Amazon’s Fulfillment Center Network|We examine the economies of density associated with the expansion of Amazon’s distribution network from 2006 to 2018. We demonstrate that, in placing a fulfillment center in a new state, Amazon faces a trade-off between the revenue implications of exposing local customers to sales tax on their purchases and the cost savings from reducing the shipping distance to those customers. Using detailed data on online transactions, we estimate a model of demand for retail goods and show that consumers’ online shopping is sensitive to sales taxes. We then use the demand estimates and the spatial distribution of consumers relative to Amazon’s fulfillment centers to predict revenues and shipping distances under the observed fulfillment center roll-out and under counterfactual roll-outs over this time period. Using a moment inequalities approach, we infer the cost savings from being closer to customers that render the observed network roll-out optimal. We find that Amazon saves between $0.17 and $0.47 for every 100 mile reduction in the distance of shipping goods worth $30. In the context of its distribution network expansion, this estimate implies that Amazon has reduced its total shipping cost by over 50% and increased its profit margin by between 5 and 14% since 2006. Separately, we demonstrate that prices on Amazon have fallen by approximately 40% over the same period, suggesting that a significant share of the cost savings have been passed on to consumers.
H71|Tax Advantages and Imperfect Competition in Auctions for Municipal Bonds|We study the interaction between tax advantages for municipal bonds and the market structure of auctions for these bonds. We show this interaction can limit the ability of bidders to extract information rents and is a crucial determinant of state and local governments' borrowing costs. Reduced-form estimates show that increasing the tax advantage by 3 pp. lowers mean borrowing costs by 9-10%, consistent with a greater-than-unity passthrough elasticity. We estimate a structural auction model to measure markups, and to illustrate and quantify how the interaction between tax policy and bidder strategic behavior leads to large passthrough elasticities. We use the estimated model to evaluate the efficiency of Obama and Trump administration policies that limit the tax advantage for municipal bonds. We find that the resulting increase in municipal borrowing costs is 2.8 times as large as the tax savings induced by these policies.
H71|The Taxation of Recreational Marijuana: Evidence from Washington State|The median United States voter supports the legalization of marijuana, at least in part due to a desire to increase state tax revenues. However, states with legal markets have implemented wildly different regulatory schemes with tax rates ranging from 3.75 to 37 percent, indicating that policy makers have a range of beliefs about industry responses to taxes and regulation. We examine a policy reform in Washington: a switch from a 25 percent gross receipts tax collected at every step in the supply chain to a sole 37 percent excise tax at retail. Using novel, comprehensive administrative data, we assess responses to the reform throughout the supply and consumption chain. We find the previous tax regime provided strong incentives for vertical integration. Tax invariance did not hold, with some types of firms benefiting much more than predicted. Consumers bear 44 percent of the additional retail tax burden. Finally, we find evidence that consumer demand for marijuana is price-inelastic in the short-run, but becomes price-elastic within a few weeks of a price increase.
H71|The structure of state corporate taxation and its impact on state tax revenues and economic activity|This paper documents facts about the state corporate tax structure — tax rates, base rules, and credits — and investigates its consequences for state tax revenue and economic activity. We present three main findings. First, tax base rules and credits explain more of the variation in state corporate tax revenues than tax rates do. Second, although states typically do not offset tax rate changes with base and credit changes, the effects of tax rate changes on tax revenue and economic activity depend on the breadth of the base. Third, as states have narrowed their tax bases, the relationship between tax rates and tax revenues has diminished. Overall, changes in state tax bases have made the state corporate tax system more favorable for corporations and are reducing the extent to which tax rate increases raise corporate tax revenue.
H71|The Long-Run Effects of the Earned Income Tax Credit on Women’s Earnings|We use longitudinal data on marriage and children from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to characterize women’s exposure to the federal and state Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) during their first two decades of adulthood. We then use measures of this exposure to estimate the long-run effects of the EITC on women’s labor market outcomes as mature adults. We find evidence indicating that exposure to a more generous EITC when women were unmarried and had children leads to higher wages, earnings, and hours in the longer-run. We also find evidence that exposure to a more generous EITC when women had children but were married leads to lower earnings and hours in the longer-run. These longer-run effects are consistent with what we would expect if the short-run effects of the EITC on employment that are documented in other work, and predicted by theory, are reflected in effects of the EITC on cumulative labor market experience and other consequences of labor market attachment that influence earnings.

H71|Making income and property taxes more growth-friendly and redistributive in India|Tax reforms are crucial to promoting inclusive growth in India. The replacement of a myriad of consumption taxes by a Goods and Services Tax (GST) will boost India's competitiveness, investment, job creation and tax compliance. The potential to raise additional revenue from taxes on goods and services is however limited. In contrast, reforming income and property taxes should help to i) raise more revenue to finance much needed social and physical infrastructure while keeping public debt under control; ii) reduce inequality by increasing the redistributive effect of taxation; iii) promote productivity by reducing distortions in the allocation of resources which emanate from the corporate income tax; iv) boost job creation by eliminating the bias against labour-intensive activities; v) promote confidence, and thus investment, by improving clarity and certainty regarding tax rules and their application and vi) reinforce the ability of states and municipalities to provide key public infrastructure and services. This paper presents the main characteristics of the tax system as well as the rationale and options for reform.
H71|Two tales of two U.S. states: Regional fiscal austerity and economic performance|The recent fiscal austerity experiments undertaken in the states of Kansas and Wisconsin have generated considerable policy interest. Using a variety of identification approaches within a difference-in-differences framework and examining a wide range of economic indicators, this paper assesses whether the experiments have spurred growth in the states as promised by the governors and legislatures which enacted them into law. The overall conclusion from the paper is that the fiscal experiments did not spur growth, and if anything harmed state economic performance. Among the identification approaches used, the synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003; Abadie et al., 2010) is demonstrated to provide the most compelling evidence.
H71|Uplatnění DPH v zemích OECD| Příspěvek se zabývá vzájemnou závislostí vybraných ukazatelů daně z přidané hodnoty v zemích OECD (koeficient výkonnosti, DPH jako procento z HDP, podíl DPH na celkových daňových výnosech a základní sazby daně). Metodicky se výzkum opírá zejména o statistická data OECD. Na základě korelace byla zjištěna silná závislost mezi základní sazbou daně a DPH jako podílu na HDP. Statisticky významná je také závislost mezi DPH jako podílu na HDP a podílu DPH na celkových daňových výnosech. Ve vztahu k výkonnosti DPH nebyla zjištěna významná závislost na zkoumaných faktorech.
H71|What drives vertical fiscal interactions? Evidence from the 1980 Crude Oil Windfall Act|In economies with multi-level governments, why would a change in the fiscal rule of a government in one level lead to a fiscal response by a government in a different level? The literature focused primarily on the standard common-pool problem, while giving little attention to the potential role of complementarity or substitutability (CS) between the public goods supplied by the two governments. This paper fills this gap by focusing on the latter channel. First, we illustrate its potential key role in determining the sign of the vertical reaction through a generic model of vertical fiscal interactions. Second, we propose a novel strategy for identifying it, by considering an empirical design that confines the common-pool channel to specific locations. We implement this design through a quasi-natural experiment: the 1980 U.S. Crude Oil Windfall Act, which increased federal tax collections from sale of crude oil, thereby affecting the tax base of oil rich states specifically. This latter feature enables attributing the vertical fiscal reactions of the remaining states to the CS channel. Following this strategy, via a difference-in-differences approach, we decompose the sources of the vertical fiscal reactions arising from this federal tax change and find that those attributed to the CS channel: (i) account for approximately 38% of the overall vertical fiscal response; (ii) point at complementarity between state and federal public goods, most notably in transportation and welfare expenditures; (iii) are manifested primarily via changes in states' sales and income taxation.
H71|Realisation of the Revenue Equalisation Function in Local Government by a General Grants - the Polish Case|Research background: General grants should pursue five different functions. One of them is revenue equalization. This function is achieved if the revenue gap is reduced after the application of the subsidising mechanism. The size of the support should be inversely proportional to own revenues. Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to analyse the fulfilment of the revenue equalization function by general subsidies. Beside the theoretical analysis, which presents the general grants structure and the functions assigned to them, the article discusses the results of studies showing changes in the revenue gap after the application of the grant mechanism and the correlation between per capita own revenue and the amount of funds from selected parts of the general grant. The following tentative research hypothesis was adopted: general grants fail to fulfil the revenue equalisation function. Methodology/methods: Two research methods were applied: descriptive statistics and correlation – calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient. Findings & Value added: It was concluded that, once the corrective and equalising mechanism was applied, the range between the extreme per capita revenue values was reduced by 40–50% on average, at all local government levels, i.e. at commune, county and province levels, in each year from the period analysed, i.e. 2012–2015. The correlation between the sizes of revenue before and after budget subsidising is always negative, whereas the strength of the relationship ranged between low and significant, depending on the local government level. It was found that general grants do fulfil the revenue equalisation function, which contradicts the initially formulated research hypothesis.
H71|Property tax autonomy and tax mimicking in major metropolitan areas in Poland|Research background: Real estate and urban economics literature is abundant in studies discussing various types of property taxes and their characteristics. Growing area of research focused on tax equity, tax competition, and tax mimicking. Recently, due to substantial developments in spatial and regional economics more attention was drawn to spatial effects. Empirical results are focused on spatial interaction and diffusion effects, hierarchies of place and spatial spillovers. Property tax system in Poland differs from those utilized in the majority of developed countries. As a consequence, property tax policy at local government level (including tax competition and tax mimicking effects) in Poland can differ substantially from those found in previous research in US and other European countries. There are few studies addressing the problem of tax competition and tax mimicking in Poland from empirical perspective. Purpose of the article: In the article we explore spatial dependences in property taxation. We identify clustering or dispersion of high and low values of the tax rates within major metropolitan areas in Poland. The effects can indicate presence of tax mimicking among municipalities in given metropolitan areas. Methodology/methods: We analyze the panel data from 304 municipalities in 10 metropolitan areas in Poland from year 2007 to 2016. The data covers four property tax rates: (1) on residential buildings (2) on buildings used for business purpose (3) on land used for business purpose (4) on land for other uses. To explore spatial distribution of rates we used global and local spatial autocorrelation indicators (Moran’s I statistic and LISA). Findings: The results suggest the presence of spatial correlation within metropolitan areas. We also found significant differences between metropolitan areas. The results of the study fill the gap in empirical research concerning property tax mimicking in Poland.
H71|Yardstick competition and fiscal disparities: An experimental study|Recent theoretical research suggest that yardstick competition may be biased by the presence of fiscal disparities between local governments and that fiscal equalization may help in correcting this bias. This paper provides an empirical test of these theoretical predictions by means of a laboratory experiment.
H71|Tax Competition with Heterogeneous Capital Mobility|An ongoing debate in the tax competition literature is whether a system of countries or regions should restrict the preferential tax treatment of different types of firms or capital. We further investigate this issue by departing from the bulk of the literature in three ways: (1) rather than maximize only tax revenue, governments also put positive weight on the income generated by resident-owned firms; (2) under preferential taxation, firms are distinguished by their country of origin; and (3) the competing regions are allowed to differ in size. Under the assumption of uniformly-distributed moving costs, identical regions always prefer the non-preferential regime. But when a small and large region compete, the small region prefers the preferential regime in some cases. We also identify non-uniform distributions of moving costs where the preferential regime is preferred by identical competing regions. This finding is related to differences in tax-base elasticities.
H71|Locational efficiency in a federal system without land rent taxation|Abstract We show that in a federal state with mobile population labor and capital income taxes do not suffice to achieve efficiency in general, but that they do suffice if the federation consists of just two types of regions. In the general case we study the resulting second-best problem and find that in the second-best optimum the level of public good provision is efficient, but neither capital nor labor is allocated efficiently.

H71|Tax Me, but Spend Wisely? Sources of Public Finance and Government Accountability|Existing evidence suggests that extra grant revenues lead to little improvements in public services in developing countries--but would governments spend tax revenues differently? This paper considers a program that invests in the tax capacity of Brazilian municipalities. Using variations in the timing of program uptake, I find that it raises local tax revenues and that the increase in taxes is used to improve both the quantity and quality of municipal education infrastructure. In contrast, increases in grants over which municipalities have the same discretion as taxes have no impact on any measure of local public infrastructure. These results suggest that the way governments are financed matters: governments spend increases in tax revenues more toward expenditures that benefit citizens than increases in grant revenues.
H71|Housing Supply Elasticity and Rent Extraction by State and Local Governments|Governments may extract rent from private citizens by inflating taxes and spending on projects benefiting special interests. Using a spatial equilibrium model, I show that less elastic housing supplies increase governments' abilities to extract rents. Inelastic housing supply, driven by exogenous variation in local topography, raises local governments' tax revenues and causes citizens to combat rent seeking by enacting laws limiting the power of elected officials. I find that public sector workers, one of the largest government special interests, capture a share of these rents through increased compensation when collective bargaining is legal or through corruption when collective bargaining is outlawed.
H71|An Experimental Economics Investigation of the Land Value Tax: Efficiency, Acceptability, and Positional Goods|This research offers the first economic experiment investigating the land tax, where landowners invest under different property tax regimes. A voting treatment assesses the relative acceptability of land value taxation. Results show a land tax produced greater overall welfare in only 37.5% of the experiment sessions. Systematic overinvestment arises from the positional-good characteristic of residential land investment, but this effect vanishes when the positional-good indicator is removed. The experiments show that the participants unexpectedly voted in favor of the land tax, suggesting that the efficiency and acceptability of the land tax may be more complex than in nonbehavioral economics modeling.
H71|The Impact of a Rise in the Real Estate Transfer Taxes on the French Housing Market|This paper estimates the effects of an increase in the real estate transfer taxes (RETT) rate from 3.80% to 4.50%, following an optional reform implemented in March 2014 by French départements. Not all the départements implemented the RETT increase, which is the starting point for a natural experiment: using a difference-in-differences design, we estimate two main effects. (1) An anticipation effect a month before the implementation of the reform in order to avoid the RETT increase (timing response). The total tax base increased by 28% just the month before. (2) The classic depressing effect of a tax on the equilibrium quantity (extensive margin response) is estimated to be 7% on average from March 2014 to October 2015. All in all, the average net effect corresponds to a drop of the transactions of 4.6% over a period of ten months following the implementation date. Furthermore, we estimate that the elasticity of the tax revenue to the tax increase is about 0.65, meaning that départements' tax revenues are still on the increasing side of the Laffer curve.
H71|La liquidación de 2015 del sistema de financiación de las comunidades autónomas de régimen común|En esta nota se analiza la liquidación del sistema financiación de las comunidades autónomas de régimen común correspondiente a 2015, que ha sido hecha pública recientemente por el Ministerio de Hacienda y Función Pública. Con los datos que se aportan en este documento, se calcula la financiación definitiva a competencias homogéneas de 2015, introduciéndose también algunos ajustes a las cifras oficiales con el fin de hacerlas más comparables entre comunidades. Finalmente, se analiza la evolución de los recursos sujetos a liquidación aportados por sistema entre 2015 y 2017 y las previsiones del Ministerio para 2018.

H71|¿Está Afectando el Impuesto Predial el Precio de la Vivienda en Bogotá? Un Análisis Basado en la Econometría Espacial|Este documento provee evidencia sobre los efectos del impuesto predial en los precios de la vivienda nueva en Bogotá para el período 2009-2016. Se utiliza información fiscal y de los atributos físicos y de localización de 6.013 predios residenciales de estratos medios y altos, ubicados en las tres localidades de mayor urbanización y contribución al fisco (Chapinero, Suba y Usaquén). Mediante el uso de modelos espaciales para datos de panel, el trabajo encuentra que los aumentos registrados en la tarifa efectiva del predial han impactado negativamente los precios de los inmuebles y que dicho efecto ha venido aumentando en los últimos años. Los resultados son robustos tanto a cambios en la matriz de pesos espaciales como a cambios en las metodologías de estimación. Los ejercicios controlan por los impactos sobre los precios debidos a los atributos físicos de las viviendas, su estrato y ubicación, con resultados coherentes con la evidencia internacional sobre precios hedónicos.
H71|The Territorial Fiscal Gap in Colombia|This paper presents an estimation of expenditure needs and fiscal capacity of Colombia’s municipalities and departments in 2014. We use standard per capita norms to estimate the spending needs and data envelopment analysis for the local fiscal capacity. The results show that: (i) there are high horizontal fiscal disparities in Colombia, with greater incidence in municipalities than in departments; (ii) these disparities favor more developed territories; and (iii) there is evidence of a centerperiphery pattern in the horizontal fiscal disparities, causing central regions of the country to have a lower imbalance between expenditure needs and fiscal capacity. An equalization transfers system is an option for public policy to eliminate these disparities.
H71|Las finanzas públicas de Valledupar, 2005-2015|La situación de insolvencia registrada llevó a que Valledupar firmara un Acuerdo de Reestructuración de Pasivos en 2014. Este trabajo analiza la evolución de las finanzas públicas de este municipio antes y después de firmado el acuerdo, comparando dicha evolución con lo que se registró en ciudades de similar desarrollo y población. Con base en información de las ejecuciones presupuestales se evidencia que, si bien los ingresos totales del municipio han crecido a tasas similares a las de los municipios comparables, los gastos en Valledupar muestran una tendencia insostenible en el mediano plazo, lo que ha repercutido en un déficit de capital que comprometen la viabilidad fiscal del ente territorial y el cumplimiento de los compromisos adquiridos con el acuerdo de reestructuración. ******ABSTRACT: The situation of insolvency led Valledupar to sign a Restructuring Agreement of Liabilities in 2014. This work analyzes the evolution of public finances of this municipality before and after signing the agreement, comparing this evolution with what was recorded in cities of similar development and population. Based on information from the budget executions, it is evident that expenditures in Valledupar show an unsustainable trend in the medium term. Although the total income of the municipality has grown at rates similar to those of comparable municipalities, the capital deficit of Valledupar compromises the fiscal viability and the fulfillment of the commitments acquired in the restructuring agreement of this territorial entity.
H71|¿Hay pereza fiscal territorial en Colombia?|La descentralización colombiana fue profundizada por la Constitución Política de 1991, donde se establecieron las transferencias a los municipios y departamentos para financiar los gastos que debían asumir. Desde entonces los esquemas de transferencias han sido reformados y se argumenta que han generado pereza fiscal en los entes territoriales. A través de un modelo de dobles diferencias y un panel con efectos fijos, este documento evalúa la hipótesis de pereza fiscal en los municipios colombianos. La investigación discrimina por tipo de municipios y por los dos fondos de transferencias vigentes (SGP y SGR). Adicionalmente, cubre un periodo de tiempo más amplio que estudios previos, permitiendo observar los efectos de los cambios en los sistemas de transferencias. Los resultados muestran que, en el agregado, no hay evidencia de que el SGP y el SGR hayan afectado negativamente el recaudo municipal. Sin embargo, este comportamiento es diferencial por tipo y tamaño de la entidad territorial. Adicionalmente, el efecto positivo resulta ser menor con las regalías que con las transferencias del Situado Fiscal, participaciones municipales y SGP. *****ABSTRACT: Colombia's decentralization was extended by the Political Constitution of 1991, which established the formula to transfer funds for municipalities and departments to finance their own expenses. Since then, the transfer's systems have been reformed and it is argued that they have become a source of fiscal laziness in subnational governments. Through a model of double differences and fixed effects panel data, this document revises the hypothesis of fiscal laziness in Colombian municipalities. The analysis distinguishes between types of territorial entities and between the two current schemes of funds transferring (SGP and SGR). Further, this document covers a broader period of time than previous studies, hence, it illustrates the effects of changes in the systems through time. All in all, the results show that there is no evidence that the increasing intergovernmental transfers have affected municipal tax collections negatively. However, this pattern varies between types and sizes of territories. Additionally, the positive effect is lower in terms of royalties than for transfers from the Situado Fiscal, municipal shares, and the SGP.

H71|Does fiscal decentralization enhance citizens’ access to public services and reduce poverty? Evidence from a conflict setting|This paper investigates whether, and how, the devolution of revenue raising responsibilities to municipalities enhances access to public services and contributes to reducing poverty in Côte d’Ivoire. The analysis uses a local government’ revenue and expenditure dataset from 2001 to 2011 for 115 municipalities in 35 departments. An adjusted multidimensional poverty index and a headcount poverty index are calculated at the local level using the Household Living Standard Survey. The empirical analysis uses a grouped fixed effect approach, combined with a two-stage least squares methodology with panel corrected standard errors clustered by department, to address both time-varying heterogeneity and local revenue endogeneity. The results suggest that increased local revenue positively affects access to public services and reduces poverty. However, there is evidence that fiscal decentralization has a more robust effect on access to public service, than on poverty. This effect seems to work mainly through enhancing access to education more than access to health, water, and sanitation services. Contrary to existing literature, our results indicate that municipalities are more likely to improve access to public services in less ethnically diverse localities and in rural zones. The study provides evidence that the effect of the conflict experienced by the country has been limited statistically.
H71|Effect of central transfers on municipalities' own revenue mobilization: Do conflict and local revenue management matter?|This paper analyzes the effect of the transfers from central government to municipalities on the revenue mobilization by municipalities in Côte d'Ivoire over the period 2001-2014. The analysis is based on a new carefully-constructed dataset covering the conflict and post conflict periods for 115 municipalities. A two-stage least squares estimator is combined with the Grouped Fixed Effects estimator to address a potential endogeneity bias and to allow for unobserved heterogeneity varying over time. The results show a statistically significant and positive effect of central transfers on revenue mobilization by municipalities for both tax revenue and non-tax revenue. The effect of transfers is found to be higher for tax revenue than for non-tax revenue. The conflict eroded the capacity of municipalities to raise revenue. During the conflict, a 10 percent increase in transfers is associated with a 3.3 percent increase in revenue mobilized by municipalities, while this increase reaches 5.9 percent after the conflict.
H71|Petchey's (2015) Extension of Oates & Schwab's (1988) Efficiency Result Revisited|Oates and Schwab (1988) consider an economy with mobil capital and jurisdictions that suffer from local pollution. They show that welfare-maximizing jurisdictions implement the first-best, if they take prices as given and have at their disposal a capital tax and an environmental standard. Petchey (2015) claims that the efficiency result of Oates and Schwab can be extended to a large price-influencing jurisdiction. In the present note we show that the concept of Pareto efficiency cannot be applied in Petchey’s model. Next, we expand his model by a second jurisdiction and prove that Petchey’s claim is false, i.e. we show that the allocation implemented by a large price-influencing jurisdiction that sets an environmental standard and a capital tax fails to be (Pareto) efficient.
H71|Local Economic Consequences of Investment in Children: Capitalization of Child Care Services|Recent analyses of intergenerational mobility show that investments in children pay big dividends. The priority of resources in early childhood also affects the working of the local economy. Geographic variation in child care services motivates location of families and thereby influences housing markets. In this paper we analyze this local dimension of universal child care during a period of national reform to raise and equalize the child care coverage across Norway. We apply a rich dataset of housing transactions and characteristics for six years (2001-2006) and combine them with local government level data about quantity and quality of child care and various community controls. Given a reform driving the expansion of child care coverage with central government financing, we investigate the relationship between child care and housing prices using a variety of panel models. The robustness of the results are studied under the stronger assumption that only changes in coverage were mandated. The results show that housing prices respond to child care and are consistent with the recent literature on capitalization of schooling. In the first difference model, 10% increase in child care coverage, about one standard deviation, raises house prices by 3%. We conclude that child care reform initiates adjustments at housing markets and confirms the role of geographic sorting as part of local fiscal allocations.
H71|Why the Current Tax Rate Tells You Little: Competing For Mobile and Immobile Firms|This paper analyses if, and to which extent, firms anticipate future tax rate changes. The weight of future tax rates in firms' location decisions may explain differences in the sensitivity of firms' location decision to current tax rates. Firms with high relocation costs, for example, are more sensitive to expected future changes in the tax rate, as they find it more costly to react to tax rate increases later. Governments react to this behavior by increasing the corporate tax rate if the share of firms with high relocation costs is high. We first derive these effects in a simple model and then test for them empirically, using the evolution of a new and highly immobile industry (wind turbines) for identification.
H71|Der Demographieansatz im kommunalen Finanzausgleich|Zwischen den einzelnen Gemeinden der Flächenländer entwickelt sich die Bevölkerung teils sehr heterogen. Während die Bevölkerungszahl in einigen Gemeinden zunimmt, geht sie in den meisten Gemeinden zurück. Mit rückläufiger Bevölkerung stehen die Gemeinden vor der Herausforderung, ihre Ausgaben ebenfalls zu reduzieren. Die Anpassung der Ausgaben an eine sinkende Bevölkerungszahl kann jedoch einige Zeit in Anspruch nehmen. Damit finanzielle Engpässe während des Anpassungsprozesses in schrumpfenden Gemeinden vermieden werden, ist im kommunalen Finanzausgleich mancher Länder ein Demographieansatz implementiert. Dadurch wird den Gemeinden ein gewisses Zeitfenster zur Anpassung ihrer Ausgaben eingeräumt. In diesem Artikel wird die ökonomische Rechtfertigung des Demographieansatzes diskutiert. Es wird aufgezeigt, dass der Wissensstand über unvermeidbare Anpassungskosten und gerechtfertigte Anpassungszeiträume nach wie vor gering ist.
