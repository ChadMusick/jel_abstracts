M39|The Effect of Product, Service, and Customer Satisfaction on Word-of-Mouth Behavior|Objective - Banks are financial intermediaries which are vital to support the economy of a country. Banks can be interpreted as the financial institutions whose activities are collecting funds from the community, distributing the funds back to the community, and providing other banking services. The development and improvement of service quality from the banks should be the center of public attention. This is because of the tight competition in terms of quality of the services, products, and marketing strategies undertaken by the banks. In an environment of tight competition, the top priorities of service companies such as banks are customer satisfaction and excellent service quality in order to improve customer loyalty and word-of-mouth behavior. This research aims to study, analyze, and explore the effect of product, service, and customer satisfaction on word-of-mouth (WOM) behavior at PT Bank Jakarta.

M39|The Influence of User Generated Content and Purchase Intention on Beauty Products|Objective - The thrive of social media enables everyone to share their purchase and consumption experiences, including beauty product consumption. The study aims to determine whether the attitude towards UGC, perceived credibility and user activity of UGC on YouTube influences the purchase intention toward a beauty product. Methodology/Technique - Questionnaires were distributed online to 200 people who had watched beauty product review videos on YouTube at least once and who were minimum 18 years old. The data was analyzed using multiple regression. Finding - The results indicate that attitudes towards UGC content on YouTube and perceived credibility affect purchasing intentions. Whereas user activities does not correlate with purchase intentions on beauty products. UGC content usually provides information and provides tips and tricks about using beauty products. The more attractive the content is, the more people want to see it and the more likely they will be to use the content to fulfill their information needs. Beauty vloggers are considered more credible than producer-generated content. Activities such as searching for, liking, subscribing or commenting does not necessarily indicate purchase intentions. This simply represents people fulfilling their social needs to interact with each other in a social environment. Novelty – Companies could provide training or facilities for UGC creators in order to create more attractive content. The most important finding of this study is that companies should continually improve the quality of their products, because the credibility of content makers relies on their experience with the products themselves. Marketers should monitor community discussions to find out more about the public interest in their products. In addition, marketers can also identify the shortcomings of their products to better enable them to fix them by reviewing comments on UGC. Type of Paper - Empirical.

M39|Encouraging appropriation: immersion as a strategy to enhance the online video, watching experience appraisal|"To set up successful experiences, academics and managers need to identify and promote the ""positive"" experiential trajectories that lead to the enjoyable experiences such as flow states, presence, or immersion, and limit ""negative"" processes such as hedonic adaptation (HA) (Carù & Cova, 2007; Hoffman & Novak, 2009). Hedonic adaptation is psychological mechanism that occurs following prolonged exposure to a stimulus (Alba & Williams, 2013; Bao & Lyubomirsky, 2012). This process is often inferred, or measured with physiological apparatus like galvanic skin response (GSR) (Brechman, Bellman, Robinson, Rask, & Varan, 2016) but to our knowledge there is currently no measurement scale for hedonic adaptation despite its importance, most of the papers remain conceptual only. In this article, we distinguish between two types of digital contents: (a) contents with a narrative structure (ie: presence of storytelling like films), and (b) contents with non-a narrative structure (ie: rhetorical and information based, like documentaries). The literature suggests that both these contents can be negatively affected by the hedonic adaptation (HA). In this paper, we first propose a conceptualization for this concept and demonstrate through two empirical studies the reliable psychometric properties of the new developed (HA) measurement instrument. In the second part of this paper, we demonstrate that consumers prefer longer contents with a narrative structure (ie: based on storytelling), and shorter ones when they are rhetorical because of the hedonic adaptation."
M39|Challenges Associated with Running A Green Business in India and Other Developing Countries|Running a green business in India and other developing economies is indeed a challenging job for the producers involved in this business. In a green business environment, the company may re-design the product attributes since the usage of the harmful chemical may be prevented and scarce resources may not be exploited. The main objective of this case study is to assess the factors that are associated with running a green business in India and other developing economies. This case study also highlights the issues related to the green business. This case study is developed by using secondary data to assess the factors that influence green business. The secondary data was obtained from another exhaustive literature review of journals and internet sources. The developing economies strive hard to achieve green business since it has been a necessity for these countries to depend on natural resources. The important aspect here is developing countries depend on both the economic and social factors which have a major impact on environmental factors. Moreover, developing countries are mainly dependent on natural resources for their potential and growth so as to give stiff competition for the developed economies in a global market. In addition, many developing economies face challenges basically related to power, water, ecological problems, social and economic problems and also problems related to weather and climate change. The challenges associated with green business also depends on cost analysis, where it is quite expensive for a poor and developing economy to reach the initial cost too since the usage of basic technology is lacking. Moreover, the treatment for wastewater, water resource management, treatment for disposal of effluents and toxic waste are not successfully utilized. The developed economies need to import modern technology and technical knowledge from other countries because of the lack of their own technology and technical skills. Now a day’s many countries have the knowledge of green growth which thereby helps to improve the economic standards of the countries. The government has to take certain measures such as the provision of subsidies which may support the challenges of green growth and development. The short-term subsidies may not benefit more since it may hamper the production and demand by raising the price and cost. But as for the long term is considered these reforms may provide more effectiveness in productivity and thereby lead to changes in technologies.

M39|The Mediating Role of Actual Self-Congruity on the Relationship between Religion and Store Loyalty: A Case of Mauritius|Objective - This study develops a mediation model to test the link between religious affiliation, religiosity and store loyalty through the inclusion of Actual Self-Congruity (ASC) as a mediating variable. The theoretical frameworks underpinning this study are drawn from literature related to religion, self-congruity theory, and more specifically Sheth's (1983) Shopping Preference Theory. Methodology/Technique - The data was collected through telephone interviews among a random sample of 409 Mauritian grocery shoppers. The sample was divided as follows: Hindus (n= 202), Muslims (n=71) and Catholics (n= 136), in line with the religious proportion of the population. Findings - The mediation model was tested using regression analysis. The findings indicate that religiosity is positively related to store loyalty. Moreover, ASC fully mediates the link between religiosity and customers' store loyalty. Research Limitations/Implications – This research is confined to Mauritian grocery shoppers. The generalisation of the results could be extended to include high and low involvement products. Future research may also consider dual congruity approaches (functional and self –congruity) so as to reflect a more balanced view of congruity in explaining store loyalty. A larger number of religious groups could also be considered. Novelty - The inclusion of consumer religiosity and ASC as antecedents of store loyalty as proposed in the mediation model is one of the distinctive features of this research. To date, this area is under-researched. The results provide new and valuable insights into how ASC is instrumental in developing store loyalty in the grocery sector in a devoutly religious population.

M39|Experiential Learning in a Marketing Travel Study Course|This presentation describes an undergraduate International Marketing travel study course and site visit at La Salle University in Philadelphia, PA, USA. In 2012, a collaboration began with La Salle University and Beaufort 8, an advertising agency in Stuttgart, Germany. We have worked together for seven years and during that time, we have improved the learning experience for the students by making the site visit more comprehensive. Now, two of the site visits for the trip are coordinated: in one day we visit the advertising agency in Stuttgart and we visit one of their client?s marketing offices and their manufacturing facility.In March 2018 we met Beaufort 8?s client Blanco, a luxury sink brand near Stuttgart, Germany. In the morning, students met the client marketing team and visited the nearby factory. The afternoon creative session at the agency was like previous years; the students worked on creating original advertising content for Blanco. This year, the client marketing team attended the student?s presentations of their work at the agency, so the feedback of their ideas came from two perspectives: the creative team at the ad agency and the client.The literature supports experiential learning like this because the site visit creates an authentic experience which is a more effective way to learn (Montrose, 2002). Hands on learning, project-based learning, and engagement in a direct experience also improves learning (Carlson, Wurdinger, 2009)Students love this activity and learn about both the advertising business and international marketing. Experiential learning benefits students studying abroad or doing a travel study course. Presenting students with a real brand problem integrated with a company visit to an international office increases knowledge and comprehension. The assigned projects integrated with the company visit increases learning about impact of culture on marketing decisions. The extension of the site visit to include coordinated visits to an ad agency and their client also allows us to assign a more comprehensive project at the site visit because the longer the site visit, the larger the project. (Duke, 2000)An added benefit to creating a more immersive experience for marketing students like the one described in this presentation is that the immersion into the client?s brand simulates the steps in the creative process: immersion, digestion, incubation, illumination, verification. Students learn about the creative process in their marketing courses and this experience applies the concept to a real brand and a real advertising agency.

M39|Possibilities for socially responsible entrepreneurship at Croatian natural and organic cosmetics market|This paper focuses on somewhat underused window of opportunity and unrecognized entrepreneurial possibilities at Croatian natural and organic cosmetics market. There is a unique opportunity for starting a company in Croatia which will produce and sell cosmetic products of natural and organic origin. The aim of this research is to analyse the existing market situation and entrepreneurial climate for starting such a business, and to define general business goals and correct positioning of the new brand. The global natural and organic cosmetics market will grow up to 22 billion USD in 2024. The attractiveness of this industry in Croatia is influenced by barriers to entry such as consumers’ price sensitivity and strong competitive brands. By choosing the optimal sales and communication channels, the company will be able to reach the consumers, achieve greater brand awareness and larger market share. Marketing and financial goals should be related to social goals, such as opening of job vacancies, rising of awareness with Croatian citizens on the importance of conscientious treatment of nature, and educating them on toxic substances in regular cosmetic products. The main risks which the entrepreneur can expect include unwillingness of consumers in Croatia to accept the new brand and a general incomprehension of ecological business focus. If the company implements new technologies and integrates in its business environmentally friendly actions along with ethics in branding, advertising and marketing activities, it will be able to develop competitive advantage through recognizable reputation which will affect consumers' attitudes and purchase intentions. Developing a socially responsible business strategy should include a list of social projects that will be supported by the company and most appreciated by the community. In this research, online sources covering natural and organic cosmetics were used, together with books and scientific articles on social responsibility, marketing ethics, entrepreneurship and branding.
M39|Empirische Studie zum Messeverhalten von kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|[Einleitung - Ausgangslage und Zielsetzung] Messen sind eines der wichtigsten Marketinginstrumente. Auf Messen werden nicht nur Geschäfte vorbereitet und abgeschlossen, sie sind auch ein zentraler Ort des Wissensaustausches und der Kommunikation. Entscheider aus dem Bereich Einkauf und Beschaffung nutzen insbesondere Messen zur Informationsgewinnung.1 Außerdem ist festzustellen, dass wie zu erwarten, die Onlinenutzung an Bedeutung stark zunimmt, dies aber nicht zulasten von Messebesuchen bei Entscheidungsträgern führt.2 Im Beschaffungsprozess von Unternehmen sind Verlässlichkeit und Kompetenz einerseits und persönlicher Kontakt für Entscheider von zentraler Bedeutung.3 Gerade diese Merkmale werden in besonderer Weise durch das Austellerverhalten auf Messen widergespiegelt. Außerdem ist festzustellen, dass viele internationale Leitmessen in Deutschland stattfinden, daher haben Messen in Deutschland für die Exportförderung eine bedeutende Funktion. Vor diesem Hintergrund hat das Messeverhalten von Unternehmen für deren wirtschaftliche Entwicklung eine zentrale Bedeutung. Sowohl die Landesregierung des Landes Mecklenburg-Vorpommern als auch die IHKs und HWKs des Landes Mecklenburg-Vorpommern unterstützen daher mit wirtschaftspolitischen Förderprogrammen und verbandspolitischen Maßnahmen die aktive Messebeteiligung der Unternehmen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Die vorliegende Studie, die sich an der Messestudie 20094 orientiert, wurde ebenfalls von der Hochschule Wismar durchgeführt. An der aktuellen Studie haben insgesamt 456 Unternehmen teilgenommen, dabei wurde die Befragung getrennt nach IHK- und HWK-Mitgliedschaft in den jeweiligen Kammergebieten durchgeführt. Das Ziel der vorliegenden Studie besteht darin, die Motive der Unternehmen zu analysieren, die zu einer Teilnahme und Nichtteilnahme an Messen als Aussteller führen. Die Analyse der nichtausstellenden Unternehmen ist ein zentrales Problem der messewissenschaftlichen Analysen. Es liegt außer der Messestudie MV aus dem Jahr 2009 erst eine weitere empirische Studie vor, die der AUMA im Herbst 2017 veröffentlicht hat.5 Darüber hinaus wurde geprüft, ob sich das Messeverhalten seit 2009 signifikant verändert hat. Um einen derartigen Vergleich der Messestudien 2009 und 2017 zu ermöglichen, wurden der Aufbau der Studie und die Struktur des Fragebogens im Wesentlichen beibehalten.

M39|Can Price Sway Children Preference? Preliminary Experiment among Malay Children|This study deals with young Malay children’s behavior concerning money. The objectives are to determine the children knowledge of money value, source of their money knowledge and whether price can sway their preference. The literature on Children Socialization and Information Processing Theory in consumer behavior suggests that most young children under 8 are not cognitively skilled about pricing and to use price in decision making. An interview has been conducted to gain the children insight about their money value and the source of money knowledge. In order to test for the effects of price, an experiment has been conducted to determine their preference. The study has found that children didn’t have strong knowledge of money value and pricing of products not dependably influence their preference. In order to conclude for a better generalization, this preliminary finding could be used as a initial point for a larger scale of research in term of sample size, range of aged group and ethnicity

M39|Innovative solutions in traceability to improve the competitiveness of a local fruit and vegetable retailing system|The aim of the research is to investigate the network of local fruit and vegetable products from “farm to fork”, to uncover the hidden processes in traceability and to advise innovations in the retailing system to improve the competitiveness of the sector. Traceability is an ability to track any food that will be consumed throughout the processes of production, processing and distribution. The research investigates what the customer knows about the origin and treatments of purchased products and what further information would satisfy the consumer. The study explores the flow of information amongst the chain members: producers, wholesalers, small-scale retailers, and customers. Based on interviews and questionnaires, regression analysis and ordinal regression procedure were performed. Innovative solutions to make the retailing competitive should be aligned with the precise knowledge of the consumer. The results of the research show that deficiencies in data collection, data erosion, low level of cooperation of supply chain partners, not paying more attention for more detailed information, and inadequate control are the main problems of the traceability in fruit and vegetable chains.
M39|Clustering of Respondents for Developing a Recommender and Targeting System: The Case of Assigning Education, Training and Employment Services|"The context of recommendation of education and employment services, for example in the so called ""on-demand job markets"", provides various marketing implications. Our study is based on empirical data from respondents to the questionnaires, the issuers of demand for training and employment, mainly students, as well as on answers of employers from the western part of Romania. We present an alternative analysis of the data without the use of socio-economic assumptions to guide results: using a simple evolutionary search enables explorative cluster formation. The comparison of clusters for student and employers opinions is based on the answer scores and illustrated by the emergence of distinct correlation structures for both types of respondents. At the end of our analysis we obtain the following information: the size of clusters, the comparison of cluster representatives, which turn out to be relative scores, which lead to cluster pairs with different degrees of opinion discrepancies between students and employers. High opinion discrepancies in cluster pairs inform which sub-population should be approached by educational re¬com¬men¬dation while low discrepancies would conduct to job placement recommendations or services."
M39|Mobile Game Advertising Recall in Pre- and Post-Game Experience|The mobile channel is a prominent way to reach an ever-increasing number of customers, and games designed for mobile devices are the most prominent form of mobile entertainment. This research examines players’ attitudes, advertising recall and service quality in a pre- and post-game advertising context by extending and modifying Tsang, Ho, and Liang (2004) research framework to a new mobile service context. A real-life test followed by focus group discussions are used to evaluate players’ attitudes, explicit memory and experiences while they use the mobile game service. Additionally, six managers of mobile marketing companies were interviewed to increase managerial relevance. The results revealed that the attitudes toward pre- and post-game advertising are not only dependent upon message content and user demographics, as in text message advertising, but also the quality of the game service itself. An explicit memory test indicated that players can recall advertisement but struggle to memorize specific brands advertised. The research concludes by indicating future research avenues.
M39|Funkcionális Élelmiszerek Fogyasztását Befolyásoló Attitűdök Vizsgálata| A funkcionális élelmiszerek stratégiai fontosságú élelmiszer-kategóriaként definiálhatók, gazdaságilag éppúgy, mint társadalmilag. Számos előnyük ellenére nagyon szűk az a szegmens, aki a mindennapi táplálkozás részeként fogyaszt funkcionális élelmiszereket. Felmerül a kérdés, hogy hogyan növelhető a kategória népszerűsége. A kérdés megválaszolásához abból indultam ki, hogy az attitűdök jelentősen befolyásolják az egyén magatartását, ezáltal alkalmasak a fogyasztók élelmiszer választásának tanulmányozására. Ezek alapján kutatásom célkitűzése a funkcionális élelmiszerekkel kapcsolatos attitűdök hatásának vizsgálata a funkcionális élelmiszerek fogyasztására. A célkitűzés elérése érdekében 500 fő bevonásával kérdőíves megkérdezést végeztem. Az adatokat faktor- és diszkriminanciaanalízis segítségével elemeztem. Eredményeim szerint a funkcionális élelmiszerekkel kapcsolatos attitűdök három dimenzióba különülnek el: (1) észlelt előnyök és bizalom, (2) szükségesség, (3) biztonság. Ezek közül az első faktornak van meghatározó szerepe a fogyasztási gyakoriság alapján képzett csoportok elkülönítésében. Ez azt jelenti, hogy növeli a funkcionális élelmiszerek fogyasztási gyakoriságát, amennyiben az egyén tisztában van a funkcionális élelmiszerek nyújtotta előnyökkel és bízik a termékkategóriában. A funkcionális élelmiszerek szükségessége és biztonságossága nem tekinthetők a termékek specifikus jellemzőinek. Összességében kijelenthető, hogy az attitűdök segítségével előrejelezhető a magatartás, ennek következtében a funkcionális élelmiszerek fogyasztásának növekedése attitűdváltozással elérhető, melyhez kiváló alapot szolgáltatnak a kutatás eredményei. ------------------------------------------------- Functional foods can be defined as a food category of strategic importance both economically and socially. Despite their numerous benefits the segment consuming functional foods every day is very small. The question is how the popularity of this category can be increased. To answer this question I started out from that attitudes influence the individuals’ behavior significantly, and as a result they are suitable to study the consumers’ food choice. Based on this the aim of my research is to examine how the attitudes connected to functional foods influence the consumption of functional foods. To reach this aim a survey was carried out involving 500 people by me. The data were analyzed with factor and discriminant analysis. According to my results the attitudes connected to functional foods can be separated into three dimensions. They are (1) detected benefits and trust, (2) necessity and (3) safety. Of these, the first factor has a decisive role in the separation of groups made based on consumption frequency. It means that it increases the consumption frequency of functional foods if the individual is aware of the benefits provided by functional foods and if he or she trusts the product category. The necessity and safety of functional foods cannot be considered specific characteristics of the products. As a whole it can be stated that with the help of attitudes behavior can be anticipated, and as a result, an increase in the consumption of functional foods can be reached with a change in attitudes and a good basis for this is provided by the results of the research.

M39| Comprehending the Marketing Strategies of Microfinance Institutions: Case of Selected Institutions within Multan District of Pakistan|The study focuses on fi nding whether microfi nance institutions (MFIs) within Multan district of Pakistan use marketing approaches and strategies in credit delivery and savings mobilization. The objectives of the study are measuring the degree of marketing orientation among MFIs and probing the application of marketing in credit delivery and savings mobilization. The research aims to test the hypothesis that “whether or not MFIs in Multan district are market oriented in delivery of credit and mobilizing the savings.” Primary data has been used as the main source of data for the study. The data was drawn from credit offi cers and management team (in some cases) of the MFIs. Descriptive statistics have been used for analyzing the data by using excel sheets and SPSS software. The survey revealed that the certain MFIs are not market-oriented in services’ delivery. One of the main fi nding is that marketing activities are poorly organized in MFIs. Moreover, little focus has been placed on marketing in corporate plans, and a very low budget has been allocated to promotional activities. In some cases no separate marketing promotional activities have been found. Unavailability of data is there and while conducting the survey lack of data transparency issue has been faced. The evidence in the paper suggests that MFIs should make marketing departments, develop the customer service packages in an easy approachable manner, and reinforce their marketing planning capabilities particularly in environmental awareness area. The paper is informative when planning for the establishment of proper marketing departments in MFIs.
M39|Viral Marketing|"The focus of this paper is viral marketing – the process of creating, receiving, sending and forwarding “virus”-marketing messages. Model “5C” is presented according to which the passing on of viral marketing messages depends on consumers, category, company, content (of message) and context. Viral messages can be created by both the representatives of a company and consumers (like individuals or in communities), but they are being passed on by consumers. When a company creates a viral message, it is “only” necessary to create “the right marketing message” (with the right content) - with a viral potential – virus and pass it on to the “right users-consumers” in the “right context”. Since the users of digital media and/or consumers also create and pass on messages, companies have to check and ""direct"" all viral communications (related to the company) in a desired direction."

M39|The media construction of identity in anti-immigration discourses|This paper will analyse the role of the Romanian press in the debate about the migration of the Romanian people, in the context of the freedom of movement for workers in Great Britain. The theme of Romanian migrants in the UK is a public issue which involves, among others, the country image of Romania. Considering these facts, the discussion will focus on the national symbols used by Romanian mass-media, as a response to the campaigns from the British tabloid press, and on the way in which stereo - types of Romanian people, spread in quality and tabloid newspapers (“beggars”, “murderers”, “criminals”, “fraudsters”, “corrupt”) shape the discursive construction of Romania’s nation brand.
M39|Export Inhibitors In The First Stage Of The Internationalization Process: Evidence From Mexico|This paper identifies export inhibitors in the first stage of the internationalization process of companies. Evidence indicates export inhibitors have the strongest effects on small and midsized manufacturing companies (SMEs) in the state of MichoacÃ¡n, Mexico. Some 191 managers or owners of different industrial SMEs were interviewed for this study. I found the lack of information about government agencies involved in the export process, lack of knowledge about government support for companies intending to export, lack of information about international agreements that Mexico has and lack of information about the procedure to export are export inhibitors with the strongest impact on the surveyed SMEs. One possible explanation for this finding could be that information is not effectively reaching key stakeholders. This implies it is necessary for the Mexican government to develop new strategies that allow information to accomplish its goal. By doing so, companies may broaden their horizons through international markets

M39|Impact assessment of national and regional policies using the Philippine Regional General Equilibrium model|For the Philippines, a quantitative analysis is more useful for policy if it incorporates regional differences in welfare and economic structure. However, owing to the absence of key regional data, existing computable general equilibrium (cge) models offer limited analysis of regional effects or national impacts of region-specific interventions. This study formulates a regional cge model that overcomes these limitations. The applications of the model showed the following: (1) completion of the tariff reform program in agriculture will contract some import-competing sectors in lagging regions, but will improve welfare across all regions; (2) productivity growth in agriculture can more than offset these contractionary effects; (3) investments in marketing infrastructure promise significant pay-offs, though with a trade-off between the size and spread of welfare gains across regions; and (4) combining trade reform with marketing infrastructure investments slightly mitigates some of the contractionary effects from the former.

M39|The Revisitalization of the Querença Market: Exploring the Visitor Experience|Within the paradigm of the experience economy, the literature has recently focused on the importance of creating the conditions to provide individuals with positive, meaningful and memorable consumption experiences. The consumption experience model proposed by Pine and Gilmore, which is based on four dimensions –entertainment, aesthetics, education and escapism – has been operationalized and adapted in several settings. This study presents the results obtained from the analysis of participants’ experiences at the Querença Market, from the perspective of visitors. This initiative is part of a pilot project for territorial intervention – the Querença Project - which was implemented by nine young graduates in the region of Algarve, Portugal. Through a diversified offering of products and cultural and nature-related activities, based on the co-creation process with the local community, it was possible to revitalize the traditional village market, which became extinct 70 years ago. The results of the questionnaires presented to visitors of the market highlighted the multi-sensory nature of the event, which is related to the wide diversity of sensory stimuli associated with food, agricultural products and human interaction. Visitors described an overall positive and memorable experience, emphasizing the dimensions related to “aesthetics” and “entertainment.”
M39|Service Excellence als Marketingfaktor innerhalb des europäischen öffentlichen Auftragswesens – Ergebnisse eines Literatur-Reviews|„Qualität hat ihren Preis.“ – Gilt dieser Grundsatz a u c h f ü r D i e n s t l e i s t u n g e n i n n e r h a l b d e s infrastrukturellen Facility Managements (iFM)? Das europäische öffentliche Auftragswesen (eöA) gemäß Vergabe- und Vertragsordnung für Leistungen (VOL) besitzt eine erhebliche wirtschaftliche Bedeutung. Neben vorherrschendem Preiskampf und Konkurrenzdruck rückt die Qualität scheinbar mehr und mehr in den Vordergrund. Auftraggeber verlangen Service. Es ist zu beobachten, dass sich aktuell in den vergangenen drei bis vier Jahren die Themen Service Excellence, Kundenbegeisterung und auch Mitarbeiterbegeisterung stark entwickeln. Der Zweifel an deren Bedeutung für den unternehmerischen Erfolg ist heutzutage weitestgehend ausgeräumt. Nun stellt sich die Frage, wie sich Service Excellence, Kundenbegeisterung und Mitarbeiterbegeisterung implementieren, managen und messen lassen (vgl. Gouthier, 2013). Innerhalb der Branche iFM interessiert die Beantwortung der Frage, ob sich Elemente von Service Excellence im Rahmen öffentlicher Vergabeverfahren finden, inwiefern sie sich für eine erfolgreiche Teilnahme an solchen Vergabeverfahren nutzen lassen und ob somit eine Service Excellence-Zertifizierung für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) marketingtechnisch sinnvoll bzw. empfehlenswert sein kann. Dieser Artikel spiegelt die Ergebnisse eines aktuellen, systematischen und kritischen Literatur- Reviews wider.
M39|Consumers? Attitudes Towards Brand Extensions: An Analysis On Food And Textile Industries In Turkey|Brand extensions refer to use an established brand name in new product or product categories and are extensively applied as a marketing strategy. Brand extension success factors vary according to cultures. Consumers? attitude towards extensions is modified on the basis of their cognitional reactions and relations between the parent brand and extended product and/or product categories. This study aims at conducting an exploratory research and revealing the relationship between the parent brand and the extended brand. More specifically, the impact of parent brand loyalty on the extension is explored. Therefore, the main objective is to evaluate the attitudes of consumers towards brand extensions through brand loyalty. The study analyzes consumers? attitudes towards brand extensions specifically in food and textile industries. This is in particular to portray that consumers respond positively to brand extensions in various industries due to different motivations.During the methodology application process, in-depth interviews were carried out with 16 participants who were selected from employees working for public and private institutions in Ankara, the capital of Turkey. The interviews were conducted in two stages. During the first stage, the interviews lasted approximately 45 minutes and consisted of open-ended questions about participants? brand choices, reasons for choosing the brands they use. The goal was to evaluate their brand loyalty levels. In addition, the participants were provided with the definition of brand extension and their reactions towards extension were noted. In the second stage, the participants were asked to evaluate their attitudes towards brand extensions in food and textile industries along with the factors that have impact on their evaluations. The participants were specifically observed in terms of their approach to brand extensions where the extension was in a totally different sector from the parent brand. The results indicate that brand awareness has a significant impact on brand extensions with regards to quality and trust. However, this impact is at the highest level when the extension is within the same sector with the parent brand. Whenever the extension is in a different sector, consumers not only have negative attitudes toward that extension but also become suspicious about the parent brand. Thus, quality and trust are pivotal factors influencing consumers? positive attitudes towards brand extensions.
M39|A Study of Green Marketing Practices in the Food Processing Industry of India|: Green marketing initiatives focus on the values and efforts that various companies incorporate into their marketing portfolio. The practice is driven by environmentally-conscious-consumers, who demand eco-friendly, healthy and sustainable products and services from organizations that they perceive to be socially-responsible and do business with. This article analyses the green marketing process and practices prevalent in the food industry of India. Green marketing, along with greening the product and the firm by converting the 4Ps (price, product, promotion and place) of marketing into 4Ps of green marketing, involves a careful understanding of consumer preferences and purchase decision process. An in-depth review of the recent literature indicates that most of the aspects of green marketing align synergistically with the framework in the developed nations and, though it may appear to lag behind momentarily, it is catching-up quickly among Asian countries, including India. With the conscious-consumer at the helm, green marketing is increasingly viewed as a relevant marketing strategy in India towards sustainable development of the food industry. A questionnaire-based survey method was used for the data collection from food companies in India. The data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and made use of other statistical tools and evaluations as well.The data presented in this study was also drawn from the World Bank repository of food processing companies of India. In India, the demand for environmentally-safe and green food products has been at the lower level, as the consumers perceive these options to be expensive and not offering much special benefits to them. In the long-term, both the consumers and the food processing industry stand to benefit greatly from such green marketing initiatives and awareness but the policies and strategies need to be formulated and implemented accordingly. This article recommends that the Government of India and various business organizations work together to adjust and promote the marketing elements to Indian consumers so as to increase the acceptance, accessibility and affordability of the green products.
M39|Armed Conflict's Influence on Marketing|The article deals with some of the modern trends in the development of the marketing concept and the military impact on them. The end of the Cold War dramatically changed the perception about the international security environment concept. The downfall of the Eastern Bloc led to the growth of initial wave of hope and reductions in the military spending, but not long after that it became obvious that the world was still a dangerous place and there were many other conflicts that were not resolved and just waiting to escalate. The essence of conflicts has changed. They were domestic rather than international and many scholars focused upon the influence of civil wars over economics. However, those conflicts remained isolated and in the absence of major conflicts such as the Cold War, the path to the development of the global economy and marketing was clear.The simplest attempt for classification of the military conflicts would divide them into two characteristic types: more likely political (i.e. to impose a specific model of policy, political regime, ideological domination or some form of dictatorship?), or rather economical (for seizing and redistributing of markets, of strategic logistic locations or areas rich in raw materials and resources?). Most often the questions circle around/about clarifications who against who, where, with what ways and what purposes it gives one (or several) military conflicts and in the matter of this circle begins the upgrading - for the motives, interests, the ?aggressor? and the ?aggrieved party? are defined, inevitably some conclusions are made for the ratio justice/injustice etc. ? this provides an incentive for conversations, which are too often emotional and make an endless subjective spiral. In the article the argument is presented that classical marketing is losing its importance; the defining characteristics of the future marketing model are discussed: global consumer?s culture - globalization through higher mobility, mass media, music, sport are studied. Further studies are made into the nature of similar and different types of consumer behavior during military conflicts. Some of the applications of new culture in marketing are shown, along consequences of the development of the marketing concept in Bulgaria.

M39|The determinants of Polish movies’ box office performance in Poland|This paper provides an empirical analysis of financial performance of movies produced in Poland between 2000 and 2011. To understand the reason for a motion picture’s success in the theatrical channel various factors concerning total domestic box office performance were regressed from the box office results of 207 movies. This study proposes that the success of a movie can be determined by three elements: product attributes, distribution-related variables and information sources. The results show that the production budget, movie type – sequel or adaptation, star power, genre, scope of the movie’s release and audience rating are closely related to box office, influencing it in a positive way. On the other hand, critics’ rating, release date (April, July, August) and strong competitive pressure from other movies have a substantial negative influence on box office. The results suggest that the overall movie quality (product-related variables) has an economically and statistically significant effect on total demand for Polish movies.

M39|Does a global young consumer exist? A comparative study of South Korea and Poland|In this paper we analyse the phenomenon of the global young consumer. Taking the example of young people from South Korea and Poland, we show similarities and differences in their reaction to modern socio-cultural trends influencing consumption patterns. The globalization process is believed to affect most young people designated Generation Y. They were brought up in the Internet age, which ease homogenization of cultural values, attitudes and consumer behaviour. On the other hand, the impact of local culture on their behaviour as consumers must still be considered. The results of quantitative studies conducted among 200 young Korean and Polish consumers were investigated. A research tool, in the form of six indices measuring the attitudes towards modern socio-cultural trends influencing consumer behaviour, was used (materialism, impulsive consumption, greening, virtualization, virtual tribalism, tribalism in real space). The findings suggest that there are significant differences in the level of materialism, greening and tribalism in real space between young Poles and Koreans while their attitudes to behaviour connected to Internet usage are similar. Therefore, the assumption can be made that the widespread use of new technologies is a characteristic feature that bonds Generation Y on a global scale while other aspects of consumer behaviour remain strongly influenced by local cultures. This makes a significant contribution to knowledge of marketing strategy planning in global companies targeting young consumers. It seems that the ethnocentric approach can be implemented only in the new technologies sector while for other products and services the polycentric strategy is more appropriate.
M39|Using the SERVQUAL model to evaluate the quality of services for a farm school store|The main objective of this paper is to present and analyse the findings of research which aims to measure the services that a locally-based SME (Small-Medium Enterprise) campus store of a farm school provides to its customers. The examined start-up store is operated by the College students in the context of their entrepreneurship, business and marketing classes. After one year of operation students decided to evaluate the quality of the store’s services and measure the customers’ satisfaction by applying the well-known SERVQUAL model. The deployment of the model revealed at first the importance of the store know-how to measure services from the consumers’ perspective so as to better understand their needs. Secondly, the findings of the research highlighted ‘Security’, ‘Reliability’ and ‘Empathy’ as the most significant dimensions. The findings of this research can help small and medium enterprises to improve the services they provide to their customers by focusing on these three important dimensions.
M39|Generation Y on the e-commerce market. Comparison between Polish and South Korean young consumers’ behaviour|This article investigates the problem of Polish and South Korean Millennials’ consumer behaviour on the e-commerce market. There were arguments about whether Generation Y members as Digital Natives are rather a coherent or diversified cohort of consumers. They were raised in the culturally diversified world, but the trend of globalization and the use of the Internet may in fluence their consumer behaviour in a similar way. The aim of this paper is to reveal particular patterns crucial to understanding their way of making an online purchase. An online survey was conducted among Polish and South Korean respondents from Generation Y in order to investigate this issue. Besides being the representatives of culturally distant cultures, the two groups from the research sample revealed mostly convergent preferences and attitudes towards making an online purchase. Also, Polish and South Korean respondents revealed different attitudes online and of fline, when compared to the cohort general analysis. In terms of making an online purchase via their mobile phones, Poles and Koreans remained coherent outside their national group and diversified inside their national group in terms of e-commerce but patterns slightly differed. Since this research was limited by too general e-commerce context, the aspect of making m-purchase should be investigated in the future.

M39|Az 50+ Generáció Fenntarthatósággal Kapcsolatos Félelmei| Az időskorú vásárlók fogyasztói döntései számos tényezőtől függnek. Feltételezésünk szerint a magyar szeniorok fogyasztási szokásait a fenntartható fejlődéssel kapcsolatos aggodalmaik alapvetően befolyásolják. Jelen tanulmányban a Szent István Egyetem Gazdálkodás- és Társadalomtudományi Kar Marketing Intézetének 2013-as adatbázison végzett kutatás eredményeit vetjük egybe az azonos összetételű svájci mintán felvett kérdőívezés eredményeivel. Két hipotézist állítottunk fel. H1: A magyar és svájci szeniorok fenntarthatósággal kapcsolatos félelmeik tekintetében lényegesen különböznek egymástól. H2: A magyar szeniorok fogyasztási szokásait a fenntartható fejlődéssel kapcsolatos aggodalmaik alapvetően befolyásolják. Következtetésünk szerint a vizsgálatba bevont magyar szeniorok aggodalmai túlságosan általánosak, és nem különösebben látják az egyén felelősségét a környezeti károkkal, és cselekvési lehetőségeit a fenntartható fejlődéssel kapcsolatban. Ebből következően, bár aggodalmaik jól elkülöníthetők, nem látjuk bizonyítottnak, hogy a fenntarthatósághoz köthető jellemző félelmeik különösebben erős kapcsolatban lennének fogyasztói szokásaikkal. Ezzel szemben a svájci megkérdezettek aggodalmai jobban definiáltak. Emiatt nyugodtan állíthatjuk, hogy a magyar és svájci szeniorok fenntarthatósággal kapcsolatos félelmeik tekintetében lényegesen különböznének egymástól.-----------------------------------------------------------------The consumer decision making of the senior customers depends on many factors. We have estimated that the consumer behavior of the Hungarian seniors are largely influenced by their concerns regarding the sustainable development. In this paper we compare the results of an analysis of a 2013 database of the Szent István University, Faculty of Economic and Social Science, Institute of Marketing with the results of a survey carried out on a Swiss sample of the same composition. We have set two hypotheses. H1: The concerns regarding sustainability of the Hungarian and Swiss seniors are significantly different. H2: The consumer behavior of the Hungarian seniors are essentially influenced by these concerns regarding sustainability. According to our conclusions, the Hungarian seniors involved in this study have mainly general fears, and don’t see the individual’s responsibility in the avoidance of the environmental damages, nor their window of opportunity for sustainable development. For this reason, although their concerns are well identified, we can see no evidence that these fears regarding sustainability have any significant effect on their consumer behavior. On the contrary, the concerns of the Swiss respondents are better defined. Hence, it is safe to say that the Hungarian and Swiss seniors in terms of their concerns regarding sustainability are significantly different from each other.

M39|Relationship Between Mobile Number Portability And Consumer Choice Of Active Multiple Mobile Phone Numbers In Ghana|The use of multiple mobile phone numbers in Ghana has become a dominate phenomenon in recent years. The introduction of mobile number portability (MNP) makes it possible for a subscriber to conveniently switch from one mobile network to another without losing his or her number. Because of mobile number portability, we expected that use of multiple numbers would become less attractive. This study examines how mobile number portability has affected the use of multiple phone numbers. We use top, middle and lower level managers of both private and public formal sectors of the economy for examination. Thousands of multiple mobile phone number subscribers were surveyed from Accra where all the mobile networks operate and porting is well known. This study uses the mean and standard deviation to measure the relationship between mobile number portability and multiple phone number use. The study revealed low customer appreciation for mobile number portability, and customersâ€™ negative perception of service quality since introduction of mobile number portability. The article further showed weak or no relationship between number portability and use of multiple mobile numbers. Further, we show the introduction of number portability cannot be a panacea to the use of multiple phone lines even in the near future.

M39|Benchmarking For The Romanian Heavy Commercial Vehicles Market|The globalization has led to a better integration of international markets of goods, services and capital markets, fact which leads to a significant increase of investments in those regions with low labor cost and with access to commercial routes. The development of international trade has imposed a continuous growth of the volumes of transported goods and the development of a transport system, able to stand against the new pressure exercised by cost, time and space. The solution to efficient transport is the intermodal transportation relying on state-of-the-art technological platforms, which integrates the advantages specific to each means of transportation: flexibility for road transportation, high capacity for railway, low costs for sea, and speed for air transportation. Romania's integration in the pan-European transport system alongside with the EU's enlargement towards the east will change Romania's positioning into a central one. The integrated governmental program of improving the intermodal infrastructure will ensure fast railway, road and air connections. For the Danube harbors and for the sea ports, EU grants and allowances will be used thus increasing Romania's importance in its capacity as one of Europe's logistical hubs. The present paper intends to use benchmarking, the management and strategic marketing tool, in order to realize an evaluation of the Romanian heavy commercial vehicles market, within European context. Benchmarking encourages change in a complex and dynamic context where a permanent solution cannot be found. The different results stimulate the use of benchmarking as a solution to reduce gaps. MAN's case study shows the dynamics of the players on the Romanian market for heavy commercial vehicles, when considering the strong growth of Romanian exported goods but with a modest internal demand, a limited but developing road infrastructure, and an unfavorable international economical context together with medium and long term growth perspectives. Important efforts are being made in Romania in order to align the national transportation system, weather railway, sea, road, air or pipelines to the European network, by supporting big modernization projects, the development and integration of national transportation infrastructure into the European network.

M39|Marketing Specific Communication – A Support in Establishing the Connection with the Personnel of the Organization|Communication influences the development of society in general and of the organizations that compose it in particular. Human beings, their actions, the way they communicate provide the meaning and the value of the organizations they are part of. In the marketing field, this aspect is particularly complex and in most of the cases even vital for the existence of the organizations. The educational, cultural and social diversity of the public that makes up the partner with which the organization has to relate imposes a series of requirements that have to be met by all the communication undertakings conducted by the organization. The environment in which the organization carries out its activity - namely the customers, suppliers, transport operators, funders, state institutions, public opinion, its own employees - requires the establishment of a system of mutually beneficial relationships, specific to each of the above-mentioned categories. These relationships are built and reinforced through communication. The aim of such undertakings is to support lucrative, safe and sustainable business.

M39|Value Co-creation, Dynamic Capabilities and Customer Retention in Industrial Markets|The paper analyses how value co-creation processes can influence the generation of dynamic capabilities and the retention of industrial customers. The authors explore its influence with the support of Social Exchange Theory, Resource-Based View and Service-Dominant Logic. The methodology applied was qualitative research, based on 29 semi-structured in depth interviews with owners, managing directors, and technical managers with previous experience in co-creation processes. The research was performed in four different European countries and is focused on the mobile crane industry. The findings confirm that co-creation processes promote the generation of dynamic capabilities linked to adaptation, knowledge, innovation and relationship management. In addition, the closer contact with customers and the availability of their expertise favour the development of solutions that better meet their needs, bridging the cognitive gap which often exists between partners. Regarding customer retention, the results show that there is a correlation between the co-creation processes and the customers’ predisposition to buy and cross selling. Although value co-creation is a topical subject, research in industrial marketing literature analysing the effects of co-creation processes has been scarce up to now. This paper aims to contribute to the debate by analysing how the co-creation of value can influence the generation of dynamic capabilities in companies and how it affects the retention of industrial customers. Through an eclectic approach, based on social exchange theory and the resource-based view as well as service-dominant logic, the researchers can address the dual challenge associated with the main research question: on the one hand encouraging cooperation and on the other managing relations to seek mutual benefit.
M39|Exploring Brand Experience Dimensions for Cities and Investigating Their Effects on Loyalty to a City|The competitive environment in terms of tourists and investment attraction requires the strategic management of cities. The marketing literature in this topic relates to different dimensions, most importantly, the image, identity, and branding of a city, satisfaction, and the degree of loyalty that the city inspires. This study, as the major contribution to literature, aims to introduce a new competitive tool, ‘brand experience’ dimension to the city marketing literature based on Schmitt’s (1999) and Brakus et al.’s (2009) experience dimensions, and to reveal its use in measuring loyalty to a city. For this purpose, two consecutive studies have been conducted. The first study aims to explore the dimensions of brand experience in cities, and the second investigates the effects of these dimensions on “loyalty to a city”. The findings of the study reveal that city experiences consist of five dimensions: Social Activities & Leisure Time Experience, Affective Experience, and Taste Experiences, Disturbing Sensory Experience and Nature-Related Experience. Three of these dimensions (Affective experience, taste experience (food identified with city), nature-related experience) are found to positively affect loyalty to a city.

M39|The importance of social networks? weak ties in business development|This paper aims to present the importance of weak ties in social networks for sharing information at personal level, across departments in a company, as well as between managers that seek business opportunities. Also, the paper shows that complex knowledge requires strong ties in order to be properly shared and used. Weak ties between departments in a company make information diffusion faster only if the knowledge shared is simple, otherwise if the information is complex, the communication between departments and the development of projects will encounter difficulties.The article analyses the structure and the dynamic of business social networks starting from Granovetter's theory and Burt?s social capital theory and offers practical examples of how to develop a business using the weak ties in social networks, such as the well-known Facebook platform or the professional oriented LinkedIn platform.

But there is relationship between sexuality and ignored of food and quality legislation.
M39|Optimal price setting during a currency changeover: theory and evidence from french restaurants| This article studies firms' price-setting decision during a currency changeover. Buyers' difficulties with the new nominal price level may create incentives to raise prices temporarily but doing so comes at the risk of damaging a seller's standing as a fair retailer. We model firms' trade-off and study conditions under which increasing or decreasing prices is optimal. A difference-in-differences analysis based on micro-data of French restaurants strongly supports the model's predictions. Prices during the 2002 changeover in the European Monetary Union were less likely to rise in larger restaurants, nontourist restaurants and when prices were advertised.

M39|Critical Factors Of Apparel Retail Service Quality-A Case Study Of Select State In India|The Indian Retail Industry is transforming and is the fastest growing sector contributing around 10 percent of the country’s GDP. Indian retail market is estimated to grow from $427 billion in 2010 to $637 billion by 2015. India became the prime destination for the global retailers because of its favorable demographics, high disposable income levels, changing life styles and increased customer awareness. The fast pace of the Indian retail industry presents many companies with a host of daily challenges. In today’s competitive environment and with the growing importance of services, delivering high quality services has become the basic retailing strategy. Deficiencies in service delivery certainly cause customer dissatisfaction and also affect profitability in the long run. In order to deliver high quality of services and to outperform the competition it becomes essential to all service managers to measure and manage their service quality. It is evident from the earlier studies that littler research has been done in Indian retail service quality and very litter research was evident in apparel retail service quality. So the present study was focused to identify the critical factors of apparel service quality in Indian context. The sample consists of 1012 respondents from four major cities having high potential for Retail Growth in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India. A structured questionnaire was administered for data collection. Secondary data was collected from research databases, reports, journal articles etc. SPSS 17.0 was used for statistical analysis. Factor Analysis was applied to know the critical factors of service quality, the study helps the retailers to focus on critical areas of service - where to improve, where to modify and where to cut down and enables them to take effective service strategies. The study helps to understand which Service dimensions are very important at what places, so that the marketer can develop service strategies accordingly.

M39|The Determinants Of E-Government Relational Models Construction: Interaction, Communication, Participation And Collaboration|In recent decades the integrating approach of new information and communication technologies in the public sector grew faster. Worldwide, most states have made and still make substantiate efforts towards the coherent strategies implementation in order to favor the complex process of integrating the new information and communication technologies. Regardless of the objectives - maximizing efficiency, increase transparency in the decision process, improve service quality or citizen participation in decision making - what we call today e-Government has become an essential mechanism in administrative reforms, independent of aggregation level. The article presents an analysis of the factors that define the outline of the e-government relational model.
M39|The Coordinates And Typology Of Relationship Between The Public System And The Different Categories Of Stakeholders|The development of the new information and communication technologies, which favored the modern societies transformation into knowledge-based society, forced a reconsideration of the governance principles based on what Abraham Lincoln said “Governance of citizens by citizens and for citizens''. The knowledge society coordinates raises new challenges for the public system, offering, at the same time, the opportunity to do activities more efficient and to development those approach that brings the citizen closer to public systems. Basically, by reconsidering and by emerging in the public system of concepts such as ethics, social responsibility and sustainable development it has been created the coordinates of oriented citizens implementation framework. Governments around the world are making significant efforts towards e-governance assimilation and implementation. These efforts are not focused only on the digitization process itself, but also target a broader reorganization of the public services process and of the participation processes based on the new information technologies. The article presents, based on a detailed analysis of the literature, different models that capture and define the relationships developed by public institutions with various categories of stakeholders.
M39|Using The General Electric / Mckinsey Matrix In The Process Of Selecting The Central And East European Markets|Due to limited resources a company cannot serve all potential markets in the world in a manner that all the clients to be satisfied and the business goals achieved, which is why the company should select the most appropriate markets. It can focus on a single product market serving many geographic areas, but may also decide to serve different product markets in a group of selected geographic areas. Due to the large number and diversity of markets that can choose, analyze of the market attractiveness and the selection the most interesting is a complex process. General Electric Matrix/McKinsey has two dimensions, market attractiveness and the competitive strength of the firm, and aims to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the company in a variety of areas, allowing the company to identify the most attractive markets and to guide managers in allocating resources to these markets, improve the weaker competitive position of the company in emerging markets, or to draw firm unattractive markets. We can say that it is a very efficient tool for the company being used by international market specialists, on one hand to select foreign markets for the company, and on the other hand, to determine the strategy that the firm will be using to internationalize on those markets. At the end of this paper we present a part of a larger study in which we showed how General Electric Matrix/McKinsey it is used specifically in select foreign markets.
M39|Social economy marketing: a new age in marketing field|Along with the evolution of society, the classical economic models are confronted with serious challenges regarding continuous diminishing of resources, social pressure and limited capacity in satisfying people’s needs. Searching for alternatives that could solve social problems led to the promotion of new alternative economic models, like social economy or economy of solidarity. Based on social solidarity and placing the people in center of the economic activity, the social economy entities need a new marketing trend for developing their social businesses. The social economy marketing mixes the principals of social and non for profit marketing with goods and services marketing assuring the community development and integration of vulnerable categories.

M39|El marketing al servicio de las organizaciones del tercer sector|El objetivo del presente artículo es revisar el verdadero significado del marketing al servicio de las organi- zaciones cuya finalidad es neta y exclusivamente social. El artículo toma distancia del mercadeo social —tan ampliamente investigado— y evita en todo momento una adopción discrecional de herramientas y procesos del marketing comercial; busca en consecuencia, consolidar un enfoque acorde con la naturaleza, acti- vidades y público de las organizaciones sociales. A partir del análisis de literatura especializada de las cien- cias sociales y políticas, como institucionalismo, política social, bienes públicos, pobreza y vulnerabilidad, se deduce un lenguaje pertinente para esta tipología mercadológica, y se trasciende a su respectivo contraste con la realidad social colombiana. Estas claridades permiten, finalmente, proponer el contenido de un curso sobre asuntos sociales y de marketing.
M39|Diseño del plan de comunicación para la unidad de emprendimiento de la Corporación Universitaria Adventista de Colombia|El propósito de este estudio es realizar un diagnóstico comunicacional de la Unidad de Emprendimiento (UE) de la UNAC, a partir del análisis general de la situación comunicacional de la institución. El proyecto se realizó desde un enfoque cualitativo de tipo investigación-acción. La muestra del estudio es intencional, con 216 estudiantes de la UNAC. Las técnicas de recolección de información utilizadas fueron: la ficha de diagnóstico comunicacional, la matriz DOFA y el cuestionario. Los resultados obtenidos indican que los procesos comunicacionales de la UE dirigidos hacia su público objetivo, no han tenido el efecto deseado y se requiere replantear los medios y mensajes enviados para este fin. Por lo anterior, se propone diseñar un plan de comunicación basado en el Modelo de Comunicación Intencionado, que permita llegar a los estudiantes de forma apropiada, motivando en ellos la participación en los diferentes eventos y convocatorias que realiza la Unidad de Emprendimiento.
M39|Dimensions Affecting the Purchasing Behavior of Nepalese Women|The purpose of this study is to identify the various dimensions of buying behavior of Nepalese women while making purchasing decisions. A total of 100 women of different background were surveyed through a questionnaire consisting of 22 questions related to the buying behavior. Various factors such as Value Identification, Customer Service and Lifestyle are most influential for Nepalese women’s purchasing decisions. So, by providing, at affordable price, high value product that match the personality of the targeted women and by providing superior customer care, Nepalese women can be attracted easily. Besides these, price, brand awareness and accurate information also influence their buying behavior to a certain extent. Age also plays a role in the purchasing decisions she makes, since women of different age group behave differently while purchasing items for their homes, for their offices or for personal use. Difference in the demographic factors such as personal status, religious belief, occupation and income level however do not bring difference in the buying behavior of Nepalese women, in general.
M39|The Moderating Effect of Strength of Manufacturer's Brands on the Relationship between Retailer’s Relationship Satisfaction and Commitment: A Theoretical Model|Many recent studies emphasized the importance of retailer's satisfaction and commitment to manufacturer/supplier. These studies investigated the relationship between them as an overall relationship. However, there is a dearth of studies that investigated the dimensions of retailer's satisfaction on commitment, and analyzed the mysterious relationship via strength of manufacturer's brands as a moderating effect. Therefore, this study is an attempt to provide a value conceptual model that explains the theoretical linkages existing between dimensions of retailer's satisfaction and commitment, and tries to explain the in-depth meaning of this relationship through the moderating effect of manufacturer's brand strength in the context of social exchange theory. Additionally, hypotheses on the association between the constructs are presented as a basis for further study.
M39|When comparative ads are more effective: Fit with audience’s regulatory mode|According to regulatory fit theory (Higgins, 2000, 2005), people experience regulatory fit when the manner in which they pursue a goal sustains (vs. disrupts) their regulatory orientation, and this fit strengthens their engagement in what they are doing. We tested whether the relative effectiveness of comparative and noncomparative ads varied as a function of their fit with the audience’s regulatory mode concerns, either assessment concerns with making critical evaluations or locomotion concerns with maintaining movement, with these concerns being situationally induced (Studies 1a and 1b) or chronic predispositions (Study 2). As predicted, three studies found that for participants with assessment concerns comparative ads were more effective than noncomparative ads, whereas for participants with locomotion concerns noncomparative ads were more effective than comparative ads. Supporting the mechanism predicted by regulatory fit theory, the studies also found that these fit effects on purchase intentions were mediated by strength of engagement with the message.
M39|Using Preferred Outcome Distributions to estimate Value and Probability Weighting Functions in Decisions under Risk|In this paper we propose the use of preferred outcome distributions as a new method to elicit individuals' value and probability weighting functions in decisions under risk. Extant approaches for the elicitation of these two key ingredients of individuals' risk attitude typically rely on a long, chained sequence of lottery choices. In contrast, preferred outcome distributions can be elicited through an intuitive graphical interface, and, as we show, the information contained in two preferred outcome distributions is sufficient to identify non-parametrically both the value function and the probability weighting function in rank-dependent utility models. To illustrate our method and its advantages, we run an incentive-compatible lab study in which participants use a simple graphical interface - the Distribution Builder (Goldstein et al. 2008) - to construct their preferred outcome distributions, subject to a budget constraint. Results show that estimates of the value function are in line with previous research but that probability weighting biases are diminished, thus favoring our proposed approach based on preferred outcome distributions.
M39|The Impact of Cultural Symbols and Spokesperson Identity on Attitudes and Intentions|In today’s multicultural societies, ethnic targeting is increasingly important for marketing. Two main approaches to target ethnic minorities have emerged: messaging consumers when their ethnic identity is most salient, and featuring spokespeople who have the same heritage as the target. We conduct replications of two articles representative of these research streams: Forehand and Deshpandé (2001) and Deshpandé and Stayman (1994). Our findings identify generational status as an important boundary condition for these ethnic targeting strategies.
M39|The Effect Of Social-Media Communication On Consumer Perceptions Of Brands|Researchers and brand managers have limited understanding of the effects of firm-created and user-generated social media communication on brand equity, brand attitude, and purchase intention. Thus, we investigated 504 Facebook users using a standardized online survey across Poland. To test the proposed model, we analyzed 60 brands across three different industries: non-alcoholic beverages, clothing, and mobile operators. In the data analysis, we applied the structural equation modeling technique. The results of our empirical studies showed that user-generated social media communication had a positive influence on brand equity and brand attitude. In addition, the analysis indicated that firm-created social media communication affected only brand attitude. Both brand equity and brand attitude showed a positive influence on purchase intention. Moreover, measurement invariance was assessed using a multi-group structural modeling equation. The findings revealed that the proposed model was invariant across the researched industries
M39|The Impact of Brand Communication on Brand Equity Dimensions and Brand Purchase Intention Through Facebook|Companies are now using social networking sites, such as Facebook, to enhance their brand communication and to promote and disseminate their product information among consumers. Such brands as Coca-Cola, Converse, and Starbucks reach millions of people through their social media communication; however, companies do not have complete control over this phenomenon. Consumers actively “like” brands, comment on posts, share information and share their opinions with other people on the Internet. The purpose of this study is to fill the gaps in the discussion of the ways in which firm-created and user-generated social media communication techniques impact consumer-based brand dimensions through Facebook. Moreover, we studied brand purchase intentions to achieve a behavioral understanding of the influence of these two communication instruments. We evaluated 302 data sets that were generated through a standardized online-survey to investigate the impact of social media communication on brand equity metrics. We subsequently applied structural equation modeling techniques for data analysis. The results of our empirical studies showed that user-generated social media communication had a positive impact on two measures of consumer-based brand equity, which included brand loyalty and perceived brand quality. In addition, the analysis indicated that firm-created social media communication had no influence on consumers’ brand purchase intention. This study also offers valuable insights for brand managers and scholars.[For the full version please see the paper published in: Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing 9/1 http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/JRIM-02-2014-0007 ]

The created instrument can be applied to any Romanian city.
M39|The Effectiveness of Dual Branding in the Agricultural Sector|The study deals with the concept of a dual-branding strategy by investigating the market awareness of two brands: the Roundup herbicide, DEKALB seed products and biotechnology traits and Montana SA. 281 respondents completed a tailor-made questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and a Varimax rotated factor analysis informed the data analysis. Reliability was verified by determining the Cronbach alpha coefficient. Currently, agreement exists between the two identities, but it could easily result in confusion; therefore, care should be taken. Regarding the brand DEKALB, only one factor contributes to the brand image, namely dynamism. For Monsanto SA, two factors contribute to the organisation image, namely dynamism and visual identity. The research concludes that although brand identities are similar, the market views Monsanto SA more defined. Most importantly, the conclusion drawn is that dual branding in the marketing strategy influences corporate identity and image, and vice versa.
M39|Measuring Results of New Product Development|It is necessary to measure the results of new product development in order to establish the current level of product innovation and define what has to be done for its improvement. The subject of research in the article is measuring the results of product innovation. The article is aimed at identifying the directions in terms of which the measuring of results is to be considered. Our goal is to shed light on the different points of view thereon. The need of measuring results of new product development is justified. It is shown that each determinant of product innovation performance serves three functions: of a goal; of an indicator and of grounds for personnel motivation. It is proved that, albeit different, the said three functions are interrelated. The article defines the difficulties in measuring the results of new product development. It is proved that the main difficulties in measuring results are related to their use by a broad circle of managers, to the intangible nature of the new product development performance, to the fact that product innovation is related to nonstandard and extraordinary tasks and the development of a new product is related to both insecurity and the organizational complexity and of lack of concentration on the new product development activities. A system of indicators for measuring the results of new product development where different indicators are used at each company level is proposed. There are three levels of measurement using their relevant indicators: level of the separate new product project; level of the product innovation process and strategic level. The concept that it is necessary to choose an optimal number of indicators that could facilitate the efficient management of product innovation within the company is defended
M39|Application of the Price Discrimination in Marketing|The issue of price discrimination is widely discussed in microeconomic theory and antitrust legislation in the study of the behavior of monopolistic firms. In this article price discrimination is considered from a marketing perspective. This paper holds the view that price discrimination can be successfully practiced not only by monopolistic companies but by companies that have accepted the marketing approach of management. It upholds the idea that third-tier price discrimination, whether alone or jointly with second-tier price discrimination, has its place in company marketing management. Price discrimination from first degree is regarded as inapplicable in marketing because it runs counter to its basic principles. Market segmentation has been proposed based on the criterion of the perceived product value as well as on the determination of different prices for a given product offered to different consumer segments
M39|The Effects Of Ambient Scent On Consumer Behavior: A Review Of The Literature|The main purpose of this paper is to present an extended literature review of relevant empirical studies which examine the effect of ambient scent on consumers’ perception, consumers’ emotions and consumers’ behavioral responses in the context of retailing. Compared with other atmospheric stimuli (such as background music), ambient scent has received little attention from researchers. This paper is also concentrated on identifying de principal dimensions of ambient scent (presence versus absence; congruity versus incongruity and pleasantness versus unpleasantness) and examined how these dimensions of ambient scent have an impact on evaluation of a product, of a store or of a shopping mall and their impact on shopping behavior within a store. The paper also presented the Gulas and Bloch (1995) model, a complex conceptual framework on the influence of ambient scent on consumer responses, in their model the authors introduced the influence of mediating factors on behavioral responses to scent. Their model is a first step on the understanding the role of ambient scent in influencing consumer behavior. Davis, Kooijman and Ward (2003) extending and elaborating the Gulas and Bloch (1995) model by introducing concepts from cognate disciplines and examines mediating factors that help shape the emotional and behavioural responses that are stimulated to encompass current research on human olfaction and brings another specific points for future research. Based on the results of the relevant studies the authors of the present paper concludes by identifying gaps in the literature and suggest future research to explore how the use of scent help to create an overall store atmosphere which influence shopping behavior in the context of retailing.
M39|Global Competition And Romania'S National Competitive Advantage|Analyzing products and services around us it is clear that most of them are the result of production factors, labor and capital becoming more international and increasingly less and less national. We are witnessing the globalization of markets and production, to a large global integration and interdependence, increase personalization of production and services as a result of new communication systems interaction and flexible production processes. Markets will continue to homogenize and diversify at the same time, so it is important that as a global marketer one addresses a market segment defined by income, age, and consumption habits and not by membership of a nation. The most visible and polarized is the premium segment fighting for high income clients where brand value plays an important role. Instead identification of large segments of customers offers the advantages of scale economy in production and marketing for global enterprises. Consumer profile is the dominant global consumer requesting and accepting global products and services easily. In fact, what can force an economic alignment to achieve the best performance, rather than the global consumer. The research methodology used includes literature review, comparative analysis, synthesis of data based on bibliographic resources and official documents.The aim of the paper is to highlight current models that underlie the competitive advantage of nations and assess the competitive advantage of Romania in the context of the global market. A case study is used to offer an overview of competitive advantage of Antibiotice Iasi SA, a competitive player, in a global pharmaceutical market with strong global competition. Countries moderate companies' achievements of global efficiency objectives due to the countries' rivalry. Romania has to understand that it is in competition with other countries in order to fulfill economic, political and social objectives. The scope in the end is the well-being of a country's people.

M39|"Comparación de los modelos formativo, reflexivo y de antecedentes de evaluación estudiantil del servicio de docencia || Comparison of Formative, Reflective, and Antecedents Models of Students Evaluation of Teaching Service"|"Se ha llevado a cabo un análisis comparativo entre un modelo con enfoque de medición formativo, otro reflexivo y un tercero de antecedentes, de las dimensiones de la calidad de servicio de docencia. Previamente se diseñaron instrumentos válidos y fiables para la medición de la calidad de servicio y sus constructos relacionados, a través de un estudio exploratorio para obtener validez de contenido. Además, se llevaron a cabo un análisis factorial exploratorio (AFE) y otro confirmatorio (AFC), para obtener la estructura dimensional adecuada e ítems relevantes. Usando modelos de estructuras de covarianza (MEC) se comprobó que el modelo de antecedentes, aunque presenta igual poder predictivo, tiene mejores índices de ajuste que los modelos reflexivo y formativo. || A comparative analysis between three measurement models (with formative, reflective, and antecedents approach) has been conducted to measure the dimensions of the teaching service quality. Previously valid and reliable instruments have been designed to measure the service quality and related constructs. An exploratory study has been performed to obtain content validity. Additionally, both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (EFA and CFA, respectively) have been conducted to obtain the appropriate dimensional structure and relevant items. Using structural equations modeling (MEC) has been found that the antecedent model, although it has the same predictive power, has better fit indices than reflective and formative models."
M39|‘Welcome to the experience economy’: assessing the influence of customer experience literature through bibliometric analysis|Some publications strongly influence how research in a field evolves and in which direction, particularly by introducing and developing new concepts and insights. The analysis of such seminal publications is an interesting way to examine a scholar’s or a theory’s influence on a discipline. It is a sound and valuable method for introducing newcomers to a field, while also providing incumbent researchers with thorough and encompassing updates. In the last few years there has been increasing interest from both academia and practitioners in the topic of customer experience. Pine II and Gilmore’s article published in 1998 in the Harvard Business Review (‘Welcome to the experience economy’) is seen by many as a key forerunner in this area of research. The present paper explores the ‘small world’ of Pine II and Gilmore, based on bibliometric tools. An in-depth analysis of the scientific influence of this article was performed, based on the citations it has received since it was published (1998) to 2012. The results confirm the broad scope of influence of the concept of ‘customer experience’. Indeed, Pine II and Gilmore’s article has been cited by authors from a wide range of scientific areas, not only in business and management but also tourism, sport, leisure and hospitality. Moreover, measurement and innovation emerge as underrepresented sub-topics within customer experience research. Finally, an appeal is made for more quantitative-led research in this field of study.
M39|Marketing Research: The Role Of Sentiment Analysis|This article promotes sentiment analysis as an alternative research technique for collecting and analyzing textual data on the internet. Sentiment analysis is a data mining technique that systematically evaluates textual content using machine learning techniques. As a research method in marketing, sentiment analysis presents an efficient and effective evaluation of consumer opinions in real time. It allows data collection and analysis from a very large sample without hindrances, obstructions and time delays. Through sentiment analysis, marketers collect rich data on attitudes and opinion in real time, without compromising reliability, validity and generalizability. Marketers also gather feedback on attitudes and opinions as they occur without having to invest in lengthy and costly market research activities. The paper proposes sentiment analysis as an alternative technique capable of triangulating qualitative and quantitative methods through innovative real time data collection and analysis. The paper concludes with the challenges marketers can face when using this technique in their research work.
M39|Aspects and Importance of Digital Media in Pakistan|Digital Media has gained importance over the years, around the world. It has created impact in Pakistan too. This paper draws comparison in usage and impact of Digital Media in developed worlds with Pakistan and identifies the flaws, the potential and scope of digital media in Pakistan. Pakistan as the world’s 7th largest country has tremendous potential for digital media. However lack of knowledge, interest and resources has held Pakistan in attaining advancement in development of digital media. Though the technology has been there since 1990s yet, fewer people properly understand aspects and importance of digital media. In fact there are hardly any research papers on digital media by Pakistani authors. In this research paper we have limited our research to the limited application of digital media in Pakistan but we have discussed in detail the upcoming trends and marketing tactics adopted by marketers.

M39|Adding Value to Customers and Developing Brands through Electronic Newsletters|Online communication is highly efficient for contemporary business, in most market sectors. In this context, companies use several online instruments in order to achieve a wide array of objectives. Among these, online newsletters (e-newsletters) are widely used, since they offer a lot of benefits for companies. Since they are flexible in terms of format and content, they are suitable to address a wide variety of publics. Therefore, e-newsletters could be not just informative (as they are widely seen), but also could add-value to customers and support branding processes and relationship development. The present paper investigated various benefits of e-newsletters in this context and highlights some rules to ensure an effective added-value e-newsletter. The research made on the e-newsletters of 5 of the leading publishing-houses in Romania shows that, at least in this market sector, this instrument is not used at its full potential. It is considered in most cases a way to stimulate sales, either directly by announcing sales, or indirectly by announcing new books releases. In some cases news on events and on the activity of the publishing-houses are presenting, leading to image development.
