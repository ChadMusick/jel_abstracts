J44|Regulated occupations in Italy: extent and labor market effects|This work provides a descriptive assessment of regulated occupations in Italy and examines the impact of regulation on the labor market. First, we construct, on the basis of law provisions, a set of novel indicators measuring both the extensive and the intensive margin of regulation. We then show that regulated occupations represent a significant and increasing fraction of total employment (24%), their incidence being significantly larger among workers with a college degree (52%). Moreover, these occupations are characterized by lower mobility and entry rates and by a wage premium of about 9%, which raises to 18% for the professioni ordinistiche. Finally, we provide causal evidence that the reduction of entry requirements and the repeal of tariff restrictions lead to an increase in entry into regulated occupations and to a reduction of the wages of the incumbents.
J44|Do male managers increase risk-taking of female teams? Evidence from the NCAA|We analyze the effect of the coach's gender on risk-taking in women sports teams using data taken from National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball games. We find that the coach's gender has a sizable and significant effect on risk-taking, a finding that is robust to several empirical strategies, including an instrumental variable approach. In particular, we find that risk-taking among teams with a male head coach is 5 percentage points greater than that in teams with a female head coach. This gap is persistent over time and across intermediate game standings. The fact that risk-taking has a significantly positive effect on game success suggests that female coaches should be more risk-taking.
J44|Improving Estimation of Labor Market Disequilibrium Using Shortage Indicators, with an Application to the Market for Anesthesiologists|While economic studies often assume that labor markets are in equilibrium, there may be specialized labor markets that are likely in disequilibrium. We develop a new methodology to improve the estimation of a reduced form disequilibrium model from the existing models by incorporating survey-based shortage indicators into the model and estimation. Our shortage-indicator informed disequilibrium model includes as a special case the foundational model of Maddala and Nelson (1974). We demonstrate the gains in information provided by our methodology. We show how the model can be implemented by applying it to the market for anesthesiologists, a profession susceptible to disequilibrium. In this application, we find that our new disequilibrium model informed by a shortage indicator fits the data better than the Maddala-Nelson model, and has better out-of-sample predictive power.
J44|Twelve eyes see more than eight. Referee bias and the introduction of additional assistant referees in soccer|We are the first to investigate whether the introduction of additional assistant referees in the UEFA Europa League (in season 2009-2010) and the UEFA Champions League (in season 2010-2011) was associated with lower referee bias. To this end, we analyse a unique database with pre- and within-game characteristics of all games in seven recent seasons in these leagues by means of bivariate probit regression models. We find evidence for substantial referee bias before the introduction of additional referees, while no such evidence is found after the introduction. Furthermore, additional assistants go hand in hand with more yellow cards for both home and away teams. We show that these findings are robust to multiple operationalisations of referee bias and that they are not just picking up a general time evolution towards less referee bias or the effect of parallel reforms.
J44|Home advantage in European international soccer: Which dimension of distance matters?|We investigate whether the home advantage in soccer differs by various dimensions of distance between the (regions of the) home and away teams: geographical distance, climatic differences, cultural distance, and disparities in economic prosperity. To this end, we analyse 2,012 recent matches played in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. We find that when the home team plays at a higher altitude, they benefit substantially more from their home advantage. Every 100 meters of altitude difference is associated with an increase in expected probability to win the match, as the home team, by 1.1 percentage points.
J44|Selecting or Rewarding Teachers? International Evidence from Primary Schools|Using data from three waves of PIRLS, this paper examines the effect of teacher quality on fourth-grade students' literacy test scores by exploiting variations induced by reforms in teachers' selection and/or reward schemes. We construct an original data set of relevant reforms taking place at the national level over the last century and affecting the working conditions of primary school teachers, matching them by the year they entered the profession. After showing that teacher experience/age and qualification are significantly correlated with student competencies, we study the correlation between teacher working conditions (including recruitment, pay and retirement policies) and pupil achievement. Our identifying assumption is that the impact of reforms dissipates with the distance between the reform's introduction and entry into the profession. The results point to a more selective recruitment process and, to a lesser extent, more generous reward policies as effective ways to enhance student performance.
J44|Gender Equality and Positive Action: Evidence from UK Universities|This paper examines the impact of the Athena Scientific Women's Academic Network (SWAN) Charter on the wages and employment trajectories of female faculty. The Athena SWAN Charter is a gender equality initiative that formally recognises good practice towards the representation and career progression of women in Science, Technology, Engineer, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) through an accreditation process. We find that the gender wage gap closes after Athena SWAN accreditation. However, female faculty at the non-professorial level are not more likely to being promoted to professor after accreditation, or to move to an Athena SWAN accredited university. Taken together these results suggest that the higher wage growth experienced by female non-professorial faculty after Athena SWAN accreditation is likely to come from pay rises within a particular rank.
J44|Catching up Is Hard to Do: Undergraduate Prestige, Elite Graduate Programs, and the Earnings Premium|"A commonly held perception is that an elite graduate degree can ""scrub"" a less prestigious but less costly undergraduate degree. Using data from the National Survey of College Graduates from 2003 through 2017, this paper examines the relationship between the status of undergraduate degrees and earnings among those with elite post-baccalaureate degrees. Few graduates of nonselective institutions earn post-baccalaureate degrees from elite institutions, and even when they do, undergraduate institutional prestige continues to be positively related to earnings overall as well as among those with specific post-baccalaureate degrees including business, law, medicine, and doctoral. Among those who earn a graduate degree from an elite institution, the present value of the earnings advantage to having both an undergraduate and a graduate degree from an elite institution generally greatly exceeds any likely cost advantage from attending a less prestigious undergraduate institution."

J44|Le donne nella Magistratura italiana: 1960 - 1990|In un contesto caratterizzato da una limitata presenza di donne nell’attività retribuita in Italia, che ci pone ai livelli più bassi riscontrati in Europa rispetto ai tassi di occupazione femminile, questo paper si interroga sui fattori determinanti la bassa partecipazione delle donne al mercato del lavoro e fra questi individua anche i limiti nell’accesso alle professioni. Il presente lavoro analizza una particolare professione che, sino al 1963, era preclusa alle donne in Italia: la Magistratura. Esso ricostruisce il contesto storico che ha portato all’approvazione della Legge n. 66 del 9 febbraio 1963 ed estende l’analisi sino agli anni novanta, rilevando che la persistenza di evidenti criticità di tipo retributivo e preclusivo alle carriere direttive riscontrate dalle donne in Italia affonda nel passato le sue radici. Ricostruite le linee generali degli aspetti storici e giuridici ed evidenziate le principali difficoltà che le donne hanno dovuto affrontare, il presente lavoro ha l’obiettivo di far emergere il lungo e tortuoso percorso che ha consentito l’entrata delle donne in Magistratura, ponendo in evidenza i limiti che tuttora impediscono una piena ed effettiva integrazione delle donne in Italia a tutti i livelli di questo settore.
J44|Does Workplace Competition Increase Labor Supply? Evidence from a Field Experiment|This paper develops a novel field experiment to test the implicit prediction of tournament theory that competition increases work time and can therefore contribute to the long work hours required in elite occupations. A majority of workers in the treatment without explicit financial incentives worked past the minimum time, but awarding a tournament prize increased work time and effort by over 80% and lowered costs of effort or output by over a third. Effort was similar with alternative (piece rate, low-prize tournament) bonuses. Men worked longer than women in the high-prize tournament, but for the same duration in other treatments.
J44|Toward an Understanding of Corporate Social Responsibility: Theory and Field Experimental Evidence|We develop theory and a tightly-linked field experiment to explore the supply side implications of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Our natural field experiment, in which we created our own firm and hired actual workers, generates a rich data set on worker behavior and responses to both pecuniary and CSR incentives. Making use of a novel identification framework, we use these data to estimate a structural principal-agent model. This approach permits us to compare and contrast treatment and selection effects of both CSR and financial incentives. Using data from more than 110 job seekers, we find strong evidence that when a firm advertises work as socially-oriented, it attracts employees who are more productive, produce higher quality work, and have more highly valued leisure time. In terms of enhancing the labor pool, for example, CSR increases the number of applicants by 25 percent, an impact comparable to the effect of a 36 percent increase in wages. We also find an economically important complementarity between CSR and wage offers, highlighting the import of using both to hire and motivate workers. Beyond lending insights into the supply side of CSR, our research design serves as a framework for causal inference on other forms of non-pecuniary incentives and amenities in the workplace, or any other domain more generally.
J44|Are Foreign Stem PhDs More Entrepreneurial? Entrepreneurial Characteristics, Preferences and Employment Outcomes of Native and Foreign Science & Engineering PhD Students|Prior research has shown that immigrants make important contributions to US innovation and are more likely than natives to become entrepreneurs. However, there is little evidence on how foreign and native high-skilled workers differ prior to entering the workforce. Moreover, little attention has been paid to distinguishing between founders and employees who join startups. We draw on a longitudinal survey of over 5,600 foreign and native STEM PhD students at U.S. research universities to examine entrepreneurial characteristics and career preferences prior to graduation, as well as founding and employment outcomes after graduation. First, we find that foreign PhD students differ from native PhD students with respect to individual characteristics typically associated with entrepreneurship such as risk tolerance, a preference for autonomy, and interest in commercialization. Second, foreign PhD students are more likely to express intentions to become a founder or a startup employee prior to graduation. Third, despite their entrepreneurial career interests, foreign PhDs are less likely to become founders or startup employees in their first industry job after graduation. These patterns call for future research on factors that enable or constrain foreign STEM workers from realizing their entrepreneurial career aspirations.
J44|Family-Oriented Job Benefits and the Returns to Graduate Education|We investigate how the choice of flexible working schedules and family-friendly benefits interacts with the education investment decisions and career trajectories of young professionals. We show that workers in white-collar professional occupations are less likely to choose family-friendly jobs when they have invested more in graduate business education. Our results indicate further that family-friendly employment is costly for all men in the sample, while for women the wage penalty is pronounced among MBA graduates. We also show evidence that self-employment is one channel through which workers attain balance between career and family demands.
J44|A tale of two tracks| We provide a simple framework that helps explore the need for contingent (teaching) jobs in academia alongside the usual tenured-professorship positions. It also explains the coexistence of these two types of jobs in research universities as an equilibrium phenomenon. Imprecisions in the academic editorial process, combined with the increasing difficulty of producing academic research, is suggested as a possible explanation for the recent increasing trend in the share of non-tenure-track teaching jobs in academia as well as the widening wage gap between tenured-professors and teaching faculty. Alternative interpretations are explored.
J44|Voice at Work|In the first large-scale study on voice, audio data on lawyers at the top U.S. law firmsâ€“a male dominated work environmentâ€“show that female lawyers alternate between two voice frequency modes: a primary female mode at about 200 Hz as well as a secondary female mode at about 100 Hz that is coextensive with the primary (and only) male voice frequency mode. This tendency is stronger among female associates than among female partners, and does not replicate for male lawyers or female assistants. Evidence of differences driven by firm heterogeneity is comparatively insignificant, indicating market-wide trends in workplace behavior.

J44|European Club Football after “Five Treatments” with Financial Fair Play—Time for an Assessment|UEFA’s Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play Regulations (FFP) have impacted European club football. After five distinct applications of the break-even requirement, which represents the cornerstone of these regulations, it is time for an assessment. How has the situation in European top-division football changed since the FFP regulation? The most recent financial data show that European club football is characterized by significant financial recovery and further polarization. How has the FFP regulation presumably affected this development? This article discusses plausible reasons why FFP has contributed to financial recovery but has not aggravated polarization. Understanding the drivers of polarization is essential before taking further regulatory steps.
J44| The role of boards' misperceptions in the relation between managerial turnover and performance: Evidence from European football|" In this paper, we account for boards’ misperceptions when replacing a top manager by differentiating between managerial turnovers following actual poor performance and managerial turnovers following seemingly poor performance due to bad luck in order to investigate their subsequent effects on performance. We focus on managerial changes within football organizations and analyze dismissals from the top European leagues. To account for the mean reversion of performance, we create a control group of non-dismissals using the nearest neighbor approach. To account for boards’ misperceptions, we differentiate between dismissals and non-dismissals that occur either due to poor playing performance on the pitch or due to a sequence of bad luck, which is measured using ""expected goals"". We find that dismissals after poor playing performance on the pitch increase subsequent performance, while dis-missals after a series of bad luck do not. Our results have important implications regarding the design of future turnover studies and the costs of boards’ ineffective turnover decisions."
J44|Doctors' Way of Working: Long Hours, Training, Secondary Jobs, and Desire to Work|"This paper utilizes a large, nationally representative micro data-set, the ""Employment Status Survey (2007, 2012),"" which is administered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications every five years, to investigate whether doctors' way of working is different from that of other kinds of occupations to give an insight for on-going debate on regulating labor standard of doctors. In particular, we compare doctors employed under regular status working more than 200 days per year with specialized and technical professions or nurses under the same employment conditions. Based on cross tabulations, we find that compared with the specialized and technical professions, the doctors have longer working hours, receive employer-provided training, and have secondary jobs at a very high rate. Moreover, based on logit model analysis, we find that despite working long hours the doctors' desire to terminate or change their position does not increase, contrary to the specialized and technical professions or nurses. However, similar to other professions, doctors also have a distinct desire to reduce their working hours, even when receiving employee-provided training and career development."
J44|Measuring Physiciansâ€™ Response to Incentives: Evidence on Hours Worked and Multitasking|We measure the response of physicians to monetary incentives using matched administrative and time-use data on specialists from QuÃ©bec (Canada). These physicians were paid fee-for-service contracts and supplied a number of different services. Our sample covers a period during which the QuÃ©bec government changed the prices paid for clinical services. We apply these data to a multitasking model of physician labour supply, measuring two distinct responses. The first is the labour-supply response of physicians to broad-based fee increases. The second is the response to changes in the relative prices of individual services. Our results confirm that physicians respond to incentives in predictable ways. The own-price substitution effects of a relative price change are both economically and statistically significant. Income effects are present, but are overridden when prices are increased for individual services. They are more prominent in the presence of broad-based fee increases. In such cases, the income effect empirically dominates the substitution effet, which leads physicians to reduce their supply of clinical services.

J44|Robust Design in Monotonic Matching Markets : A Case for Firm-Proposing Deferred-Acceptance|We study two-sided matching markets among workers and firms. Workers seek one position at a firm but firms may employ several workers. In many applications those markets are monotonic: leaving positions unfilled is costly as for instance, for hospitals this means not being able to provide full service to its patients. A huge literature has advocated the use of stable mechanisms for clearinghouses. The interests among workers and firms are polarized among stable mechanisms, most famously the firm-proposing DA and the worker-proposing DA. We show that for the firm-proposing DA ex-ante incentive compatibility and ex-post incentive compatibility are equivalent whereas this is not necessarily true for the worker-proposing DA. The firm-proposing DA turns out to be more robust than the worker-proposing DA under incomplete information when incentives of both sides of the market are important.

J44|Why are professors “Poorly paid”?|Using Current Population Survey data, I demonstrate a 15-percentage point wage disadvantage among academics compared to all other doctorate-holders with the same demographics. Time-diary data show that academics’ work hours are distributed more evenly over the week and day, although their total workweeks are equally long. This smoother distribution of work time accounts for as much as one-third of the wage disadvantage. Survey data (of economists only) indicate that flexible scheduling is an attraction, but only fourth among the characteristics of academic life.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J44|Immigrant Entrepreneurship in America: Evidence from the Survey of Business Owners 2007 & 2012|We study immigrant entrepreneurship and firm ownership in 2007 and 2012 using the Survey of Business Owners (SBO). The survival and growth of immigrant-owned businesses over time relative to native-founded companies is evaluated by linking the 2007 SBO to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). We quantify the dependency of the United States as a whole, as well as individual states, on the contributions of immigrant entrepreneurs in terms of firm formation and job creation. We describe differences in the types of businesses started by immigrants and the quality of jobs created by their firms. First-generation immigrants create about 25% of new firms in the United States, but this share exceeds 40% in some states. In addition, Asian and Hispanic second-generation immigrants start about 6% of new firms. Immigrant-owned firms, on average, create fewer jobs than native-owned firms, but much of this is explained by the industry and geographic location of the firms. Immigrant-owned firms pay comparable wages, conditional on firm traits, to native-owned firms, but are less likely to offer benefits.
J44|Termination Risk and Agency Problems: Evidence from the NBA|When agents with a significant risk of termination in the short term have discretion over project selection, they may have incentives to underinvest in projects whose results would be realized only in the long term, and owners may take this agency problem into account when deciding whether to grant those agents discretion in decision-making. Because NBA rookies who participate in games gain NBA experience that likely improves their long-term performance, decisions of NBA teams about whether to let rookies play provide a useful context for investigating this potential agency problem. We develop a model that identifies when owners will choose to leave coaches with discretion over rookie participation decisions and shows that, in the presence of such discretion, coaches facing a higher termination risk can be expected to use rookies less often. Testing our model using NBA data, we find evidence that is consistent with the predictions of our model.
J44|Publishing and Promotion in Economics: The Tyranny of the Top Five|This paper examines the relationship between placement of publications in Top Five (T5) journals and receipt of tenure in academic economics departments. Analyzing the job histories of tenure-track economists hired by the top 35 U.S. economics departments, we find that T5 publications have a powerful influence on tenure decisions and rates of transition to tenure. A survey of the perceptions of young economists supports the formal statistical analysis. Pursuit of T5 publications has become the obsession of the next generation of economists. However, the T5 screen is far from reliable. A substantial share of influential publications appear in non-T5 outlets. Reliance on the T5 to screen talent incentivizes careerism over creativity.

J44|The Superstar Code - Deciphering Key Characteristics And Their Value|The purpose of the presented research is to advance the superstar literature on the aspect of superstar’s characteristics and value. Typically, superstar research is faced with one problem: They apply the same criteria to determine who their superstars are as to describe them later because they lack “an objective measure of star quality” (Krueger, 2005, p.18). To avoid this complication, the author chose to study Major League Soccer’s (MLS) designated players as this setting present a unique, as discrete, assignment of star status. MLS has formally introduced stars in 2007 under the designated player (DP) rule which delivers over 100 star-observations in the last ten years to investigate MLS strategy of star employment. The insights from this data set demonstrate which characteristics are relevant, whether MLS stars can be categorized as Rosen or Adler stars, and what the MLS pays for and in this sense values most. A cluster analysis discovers a sub group of ten stars that stand out from the others, in this sense superstars. A two-stage regression model confirms the value stemming from popularity, leadership qualities, previous playing level, age and national team experience but refutes other typical performance indicators like games played and goals scored or position. Overall, evidence for Rosen and Adler’s theory is found, and an over the time change from hiring old and popular stars to younger but still leadership-prone stars.
J44|A Structural Approach to Assessing Retention Policies in Public Schools|One out of five entering public school teachers leave the field within the first 4 years. Despite that the presence of a newborn child is the single most important determinant of exits of female teachers, retention policy recommendations rely on models that take children as predetermined. This article formulates and estimates a structural dynamic model that explicitly addresses the interdependence between fertility and labor force participation choices. The model with unobserved heterogeneity in preferences for children fits the data and produces reasonable forecasts of labor force attachment to the teaching sector. Structural estimates of the model are used to predict the effects that wage increases and reductions in the cost of childcare would have on female teachers’ employment and fertility choices. The estimates unpack important features of the interdependence of fertility and labor supply and contradict previous studies that did not consider the endogeneity between these two choices.
J44|Impact Of Technological Changes On Hrm Competency Frameworks|The IT industry is witnessing rapid change due to technological advancements that are being made and adapted in organisations every day. This research aims to study how these changes have affected the HR department at a multinational IT professional services firm in India, in terms of the changes in their HR roles and role-specific competencies.Two global HRM Competency Models ? SHRM Competency Model 2012 and the HRCS Model 2016 by Michigan-Ross ? have been studied in detail and combined to form an exhaustive list of 18 core competencies for HR professionals. On analysing the HR roles at the organisation under study, it was found that there are 11 unique roles which leverage these 18 competencies. Interviews have been taken of senior and junior resources in the HR roles identified, to take their inputs on the impact of technological changes (in the organisation and industry) on their roles and how they see the core competency requirements for their role changing in the future.It was found that across all roles, there is a need to understand business better and move away from just performing activities to adding thoughtful value in every contribution made. Competencies required for such a shift are different than those for today?s nature of work, which is already seeing great transformation.
J44|Earning to Give: Occupational Choice for Effective Altruists|Effective altruists wish to do good while optimizing the social performance they deliver. We apply this principle to the labor market. We determine the optimal occupational choice of a socially motivated worker who has two mutually exclusive options: a job with a for-profit firm and a lower-paid job with a nonprofit. We construct a model in which a worker motivated only by pure altruism will work at a relatively high wage for the for-profit firm and then make charitable contributions to the nonprofit; this represents the “earning to give” option. By contrast, the occupational choice of a worker sensitive to warm glow (“impure altruism”) depends on her income level. While the presence of “warm glow” feelings would seem to clearly benefit charitable organizations, we show that impure altruism can create distortions in labor market choices. In some cases, warm glow feelings may push the worker to take a job with the nonprofit,even when it is not optimal for the nonprofit.
J44|Nepotism vs specific skills: the effect of professional liberalization on returns to parental back ground of Italian lawyers|We study the mechanisms of intergenerational inequality among Italian lawyers over the period 1994- 2014 using a longitudinal dataset that combines administrative and survey data. We first estimate a 17.5% earnings premium for a law family background within the group of lawyers, so conditional on entering the profession. We then exploit the 2003-2006 liberalization process, which asymmetrically affected the two main transmission mechanisms: skill transfer and nepotism. We find that liberalization squeezed the law background return by at least 3/5, thus revealing a high incidence of nepotism. The bulk of the reduction occurred for the youngest lawyers and the top earners
J44|On the Economics of Audit Partner Tenure and Rotation: Evidence from PCAOB Data|This paper provides the first partner tenure and rotation analysis for a large cross-section of U.S. publicly listed firms over an extended period. We analyze the effects on audit quality as well as economic tradeoffs related to partner tenure and rotation with respect to audit hours and fees. On average, we find no evidence for audit quality declines over the tenure cycle and little support for fresh-look benefits after rotations. Nevertheless, partner rotations have significant economic consequences. We find increases in audit fees and decreases in audit hours over the tenure cycle, which differ by partner experience, client size, and competitiveness of the local audit market. More generally, our findings are consistent with efforts by the audit firms to minimize disruptions and audit failures around mandatory rotations. We also analyze special circumstances, such as audit firm switches and early partner rotations, and show that they are more disruptive than mandatory rotations, and also more likely to exhibit audit quality effects.
J44|Fachkräftemangel in der Pflege: Kritische Situationsbewertung und Skizzierung einer Handlungsalternative|Das Bundeskabinett hat am 01.08.2018 das Pflegepersonal-Stärkungsgesetz beschlossen. Unter anderem ist darin die Einstellung von 13.000 zusätzlichen Pflegefachkräften vorgesehen. Angesichts der derzeitigen Mangelsituation in diesem Berufsfeld bestehen starke Zweifel, ob diese Stellen adäquat besetzt werden können. Zukunftsprojektionen für das Jahr 2030 zeigen, dass sich die Pflegekraftlücke noch deutlich vergrößern wird. Auch der Zugriff auf bislang unerschlossene Arbeitskräftepotenziale wird zur Schließung nicht ausreichend sein. Die soziale Dramatik dieses Problems verbietet eine abwartende Haltung. Bisher beschlossene Maßnahmen sind zu kleinteilig und zu reaktiv angelegt. Es sind kurzfristig Handlungen erforderlich, die einen aktiven Lösungsbeitrag in einer substanziellen Größenordnung leisten. Vorgeschlagen wird in einem stark fokussierten Handlungsansatz die Errichtung einer groß dimensionierten Pflegefachschule (10.000 Plätze) in einem Drittland. Es wird ein begründeter Kriterienkatalog für die Auswahl geeigneter Länder vorgestellt. Als potenziell geeignetes Land wird Vietnam diskutiert.
J44|Does regulation trade-off quality against inequality? The case of German architects and construction engineers|We exploit an exogenous price increase by about 10% for architectural services to answer the question how price regulation affects income inequality and service quality. Using individual-level data from the German microcensus for the years 2006 to 2012, we find a significant reform effect of 8% on personal net income for self-employed architects and construction engineers. This group moved from the second lowest to the highest quintile of the net income distribution. This increase in inequality is associated with a deterioration of service quality. The reform reduced average scores of a peer ranking for architects by 18%.

J44|Ökonomische Effekte der Deregulierung der Handwerksordnung im Jahr 2004|Die deutsche Handwerksordnung regelt die Unternehmensgründung in handwerklichen Berufen durch die Vorgabe verpflichtender Qualifikationsstandards. Im Jahr 2004 wurde der Marktzugang im Handwerk durch eine Novellierung der Handwerksordnung dereguliert, sodass für mehr als die Hälfte aller Handwerksberufe seitdem keine Meisterpflicht mehr gilt. Seit der Reform wird eine politische und wissenschaftliche Diskussion zu den einzel- und gesamtwirtschaftlichen Effekten dieser Deregulierung geführt. Fast fünfzehn Jahre nach der Deregulierung können aus den bisherigen Studien grundlegende Effekte abgeleitet werden und Forschungslücken definiert werden, um die weitere wirtschaftspolitische Diskussion wissenschaftlich zu fundieren. Der vorliegende Artikel fasst dafür die theoretischen Grundpositionen und die empirischen Studien zur Entwicklung des deutschen Handwerkssektors nach der Deregulierung zusammen und formuliert anschließend zu schließende Forschungslücken zur umfassenden wirtschaftspolitischen Bewertung der Handwerksreform.

In Folge ihrer Novellierung im Jahr 2004 entfiel für die Hälfte der von der HwO regulierten Berufe die Meisterpflicht als Vorbedingung zur Unternehmensgründung. Während die wettbewerbsökonomischen Folgen dieser Deregulierung vielfach analysiert wurden, fehlen Erkenntnisse zur informationsökonomischen Dimension des Wegfalls der Qualifikationspflichten. Hierbei ist zu klären, ob Informationsasymmetrien auf dem Handwerksmarkt Marktversagen im Sinne eines „Market-for-Lemon-Problems“ begünstigen, oder ob diese durch marktendogene Instrumente kompensiert werden – eine ökonomische Frage, die im Zentrum der wirtschaftspolitischen Diskussion um die Meisterpflicht steht. Diese Studie nutzt qualitative Methoden zur Analyse von 268 Interviews mit Betrieben und Privatkunden auf Handwerksmessen, um Informationsasymmetrien und marktendogene Instrumente zu ihrer Kompensation auf dem Handwerksmarkt zu untersuchen. Wir finden Hinweise auf starke Informationsasymmetrien und deren Kompensation durch regionale Reputationsbildung. Ferner zeigt sich, dass keine marktendogenen, formalen Informationsmechanismen über handwerkliche Dienstleistungsqualität entstanden sind. Auf Basis dieser Ergebnisse werden Forschungsansätze zur weiteren Untersuchung der informationsökonomischen Struktur des Handwerksmarktes formuliert.
J44|Fachkräfteengpass in der Krankenpflege: Wo liegt weiterer Reformbedarf?|Die Zahl der Pflegekräfte in den Krankenhäusern ist durch einen Anstieg der Teilzeitkräfte gestiegen. Parallel dazu ist die Verweildauer der Patienten gesunken und die Zahl der Patienten, die von einer Pflegekraft versorgt werden, ist ebenfalls gesunken. Dennoch bestehen in den Pflegeberufen bereits seit Jahren erhebliche Engpässe, so dass offene Stellen in Krankenhäusern nicht besetzt werden können. Der Gesetzesentwurf zum Pflegepersonal-Stärkungsgesetz (PpSG) sieht finanzielle Sofortmaßnahmen vor, damit Krankenhäuser die Möglichkeit erhalten, mehr Personal einzustellen. Da dieses Personal aufgrund von Engpässen aber schwer zu finden sein dürfte, sind weitere Maßnahmen notwendig. Deshalb ist der Blick auch auf eine Re-Organisation von Pflegeprozessen in den Häusern und auf eine vermehrte Digitalisierung zu richten. Mittel-fristig ist es hingegen sinnvoll, die Strukturen in der stationären - aber auch in der ambulanten - Versorgung zu überdenken und das Thema der Über- und Fehlversorgung konsequent anzugehen. Denn dann können auch bisher dort gebundene Pflegekräfte für Bereiche zur Verfügung stehen, in denen Personalknappheit besteht.

J44|Knocking on parents’ doors: regulation and intergenerational mobility|We exploited two major reforms in the regulation of professional services implemented in Italy since the 2000s in order to examine the impact on the intergenerational transmission of occupations. We built an OECD-style indicator of strictness of regulation for 14 occupations and three different cohorts (i.e. before and after each reform). Then, using a difference-in-differences strategy, we exploited the differential effect of regulation on the occupations considered compared with employees in similar occupations, before and after each reform. We found that the progressive liberalization of professional services affected the allocation of individuals across occupations, leading to a substantial decrease in the propensity to follow the same career as one’s parents. The impact of regulation on the likelihood of being employed in the same occupation as one’s parents is greater in soft sciences and in areas where the demand for professional services is higher; at individual level, it is greater for less able individuals.
J44|Migrant STEM Entrepreneurs|STEM workers are considered to be key drivers for economic growth in the developed world. Migrant workers play an increasing role in the supply of this occupational category. We study the universe of STEM workers in the Swedish economy over the period 2003-2015 and find that migrants are less likely to form their own business, but those who are entrepreneurs earn income at least as large as that of their native-born counterparts. While the income differential for economic migrants may be partially explained by self-selection, the estimated effect is not significantly different between natives and refugee migrants.
J44|Threats to scientific progress, past and present|A US boycott of Chinese researchers, as threatened by the Trump administration, could stifle scientific progress and technological innovation. That is the concern of Alessandro Iaria, Carlo Schwarz and Fabian Waldinger, whose research looks at the period between 1914 and 1926, when Allied scientists were cut off from their peers in Central countries - with damaging consequences for world science. Their study reveals how the interruption of international knowledge flows, as a result of the First World War and its aftermath, led to stark declines in the production of research deemed worthy of a Nobel prize nomination. Barriers to international scientific co-operation slow down the production of basic science and its application in new technologies. In contrast, policies that widen access to frontier research could benefit society beyond the confines of science itself.
J44|Politicians' Payments in a Proportional Party System|Is politics a lucrative business? The question is approached in this paper, as one of few to quantify the monetary returns to holding political office in a typical developed democracy where parties are the main political actors. By applying a difference-in-difference setting with a carefully chosen control group to rich data on candidates to the Swedish national parliament, both short and long-run effects of being elected on different types of income are estimated. Results show that, yes, mostly thanks to relatively high remuneration while still in office, politics can be a lucrative business. In the long-run however, the effect is instead compositional in the sense that ex-politicians receive more pension income and work less.
J44|Is It Worth It? On the Returns to Holding Political Office|This paper estimate causal effects of being elected in a local election on monetary returns. The claim for causality can be made thanks to a research design where the income of some candidate who just barely won a seat is compared to that of some other candidate who was close to winning a seat for the same party, but ultimately did not. The design is made possible thanks to comprehensive data covering all political candidates in the period 1991{2006. I establish that monetary returns are absent both in the short and long run. Instead, politicians seem to be motivated by non-monetary returns, and I show that being elected locally once can be an effective starting point for enjoying such payoffs.
J44|Measuring Physicians’ Response to Incentives: Evidence on Hours Worked and Multitasking|We measure the response of physicians to monetary incentives using matched administrative and time-use data on specialists from Québec (Canada). These physicians were paid fee-for-service contracts and supplied a number of different services. Our sample covers a period during which the Québec government changed the prices paid for clinical services. We apply these data to a multitasking model of physician labour supply, measuring two distinct responses. The first is the labour-supply response of physicians to broad-based fee increases. The second is the response to changes in the relative prices of individual services. Our results confirm that physicians respond to incentives in predictable ways. The own-price substitution effects of a relative price change are both economically and statistically significant. Income effects are present, but are overridden when prices are increased for individual services. They are more prominent in the presence of broad-based fee increases. In such cases, the income effect empirically dominates the substitution effet, which leads physicians to reduce their supply of clinical services.
J44|Occupational Licensing in the European Union: Coverage and Wage Effects|We present the first EU-wide study on the prevalence and labour market impact of occupational regulation in the EU. Drawing on a new EU Survey of Regulated Occupations, we find that licensing affects about 22 percent of workers in the EU, although there is significant variability across member states and occupations. On average, licensing is associated with a 4 percent higher hourly wages. Using decomposition techniques we show that rent capture accounts for one third of this effect and the remaining is attributed to signalling. We find considerable heterogeneity in the wage gains by occupation and level of educational attainment. Finally, occupational licensing increases wage inequality. After accounting for composition effects, licensing increases the standard deviation of wages by about 0.02 log points.
J44|Talent Development and Labour Market Integration: The Case of EU Football|We analyse how the Bosman ruling changed the incentives for football clubs in the European Union (EU) to develop talents. We show that the stiffer bidding competition over star players after the Bosman ruling has spurred talent development primarily in EU countries without established top clubs. This, in turn, has had a positive impact on their junior and senior national teams’ performance. However, the stiffer bidding competition has also led to a lower competitive balance in the Champions League, as non-established clubs prefer to sell their star players instead of challenging the top clubs. We provide empirical evidence consistent with these findings.
J44|Do Dutch dentists extract monopoly rents?|We exploit lottery-determined admission to dental school to estimate the payoffs to the study of dentistry in the Netherlands. Using data from up to 22 years after the lottery, we find that in most years after graduation dentists earn around 50,000 Euros more than they would earn in their next-best profession. The payoff is larger for men than for women but does not vary with high school GPA. The large payoffs cannot be attributed to longer working hours, larger investments while studying (opportunity costs and direct costs), or unpleasant aspects of working as a dentist. A plausible explanation is that dentists earn a monopoly rent. Results from regressions of dentists’ earnings on dentists density are consistent with this, as are the facts that the supply of dentists in the Netherlands is low and that the payoff does not vary with high school GPA.
J44|Occupational Licensing, Labor Mobility, and the Unfairness of Entry Standards|The combination of occupational licensing at the local market level often coexists with labor mobility across local markets. We empirically study a labor market in which a district-specific entry (licensing) examination is coupled with labor mobility across districts. Our analysis exploits a change in the grading procedure of the exam, from grading in the local district to grading in a randomly assigned different district. We document that licensing regulation leads to extreme heterogeneity across markets in admission outcomes (up to 50 percent differences in licensing exam pass rates), unfair (discriminatory) admission procedures (up to 49 percent unfair exam results), and inefficient mobility of workers. These findings, together with the estimated impact of the reform on exam outcomes and grading standards, provide the first evidence of regulatory competition based on strategic interaction among licensing boards.
J44|Occupational Recognition and Immigrant Labor Market Outcomes|In this paper, we analyze how the formal recognition of immigrants' foreign occupational qualifications affects their subsequent labor market outcomes. The empirical analysis is based on a novel German data set that links respondents' survey information to their administrative records, allowing us to observe immigrants at monthly intervals before, during and after their application for occupational recognition. Our findings show substantial employment and wage gains from occupational recognition. After three years, the full recognition of immigrants' foreign qualifications increases their employment rates by 24.5 percentage points and raises their hourly wages by 19.8 percent relative to immigrants without recognition. We show that the increase in employment is largely driven by a higher propensity to work in regulated occupations. Relating our findings to the economic assimilation of immigrants in Germany, we further document that occupational recognition leads to substantially faster convergence of immigrants' earnings to those of their native counterparts.

J44|Nepotism vs specific skills : the effect of professional liberalization on returns to parental back grounds of italian lawyers|We study the mechanisms of intergenerational inequality among Italian lawyers over the period 1994- 2014 using a longitudinal dataset that combines administrative and survey data. We first estimate a 17.5% earnings premium for a law family background within the group of lawyers, so conditional on entering the profession. We then exploit the 2003-2006 liberalization process, which asymmetrically affected the two main transmission mechanisms: skill transfer and nepotism. We find that liberalization squeezed the law background return by at least 3/5, thus revealing a high incidence of nepotism. The bulk of the reduction occurred for the youngest lawyers and the top earners. KEY
J44|Two-Sided Matching with (Almost) One-Sided Preferences|In a two-sided matching context we show how we can predict stable matchings by considering only one side's preferences and the mutually acceptable pairs of agents. Our methodology consists of identifying impossible matches, i.e., pairs of agents that can never be matched together in a stable matching of any problem consistent with the partial data. We analyze data from the French academic job market for mathematicians and show that the match of about 45 percent of positions (and about 60 percent of candidates) does not depend on the preferences of the hired candidates, unobserved and submitted at the final stage of the market.

J44|Is It Worth It? On the Returns to Holding Political Office|Despite the key role played by political payoffs in theory, very little is known empirically about the types of payoffs that motivate politicians. The purpose of this paper is to bring light into this. I estimate causal effects of being elected in a local election on monetary returns. The claim for causality, I argue, can be made thanks to a research design where the income of some candidate who just barely won a seat is compared to that of some other candidate who was close to winning a seat for the same party, but ultimately did not. This research design is made possible thanks to a comprehensive, detailed data set covering all Swedish politicians who have run for office in the period 1991–2006. I establish that monetary returns are absent both in the short and long run. Instead, politicians seem to be motivated by non-monetary returns, and I show that being elected locally once (for exogenous reasons) can be an effective starting point for enjoying such payoffs.
J44|Publishing and Promotion in Economics: The Tyranny of the Top Five|This paper examines the relationship between placement of publications in Top Five (T5) journals and receipt of tenure in academic economics departments. Analyzing the job histories of tenure-track economists hired by the top 35 U.S. economics departments, we find that T5 publications have a powerful influence on tenure decisions and rates of transition to tenure. A survey of the perceptions of young economists supports the formal statistical analysis. Pursuit of T5 publications has become the obsession of the next generation of economists. However, the T5 screen is far from reliable. A substantial share of influential publications appear in non-T5 outlets. Reliance on the T5 to screen talent incentivizes careerism over creativity.
J44|Are Apprenticeships Business Cycle Proof?|Although there is evidence that apprenticeship training can ease the transition of youth into the labour market and thereby reduce youth unemployment, many policy makers fear that firms will cut their apprenticeship expenditures during economic crises, thus exacerbating the problem of youth unemployment. Using recent panel data of Swiss cantons and dynamic regression models, we examine the relationship between new apprenticeships and the business cycle. The empirical results suggest that economic shocks induce a rather small, pro-cyclical immediate response in the apprenticeship market. However, within a year after the shock, firms compensate for their immediate reaction, with the result that no permanent effect is observable.

J44|A Tale of Two Academic Tracks|Given asymmetric information, this paper explores the need for non-tenure-track jobs in academia alongside the usual tenure-track positions. It also explains the coexistence of these two types of jobs in research universities as an equilibrium phenomenon. The increased effort needed to produce research, accompanied by imprecisions in the academic editorial process, explains the recent increasing trend in the share of non-tenure-track jobs in academia as well as the widening wage gap between tenure-track and non-tenure-track academics.
J44|Player Dismissal and Full Time Results in the UEFA Champions League and Europa League|This study is the first to estimate the effects of the sending-off of a player on the full time results in international club soccer. To this end, we analyse data of more than 2,000 recent games in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. We find that when home teams receive a red card, it harms their goal scoring and victory probabilities. By contrast, a red card for away teams can have a positive, negative, or neutral effect for them, depending on the timing of the player dismissal.
J44|Career Lotto: Labor Supply in Winner-Take-All Markets|Are people prone to selecting occupations with highly skewed income distributions despite minuscule chances of success? Assembling a comprehensive pool of potential teenage entrants into professional tennis (a typical winner-take-all market), we construct objective measures of relative ability and earnings projections. We find that prospective tennis professionals are attracted to right-skewed earnings distributions, independent of mean and variance. If skewness in prize money fell to zero, males would be 23% and females 5% less likely to continue pursuing a professional career, on average. Thus, winner-take-all labor markets appear to systematically encourage those with modest talents to pursue long-shot careers.
J44|Gender Differences in Accepting and Receiving Requests for Tasks with Low Promotability|Gender differences in task allocations may sustain vertical gender segregation in labor markets. We examine the allocation of a task that everyone prefers be completed by someone else (writing a report, serving on a committee, etc.) and find evidence that women, more than men, volunteer, are asked to volunteer, and accept requests to volunteer for such tasks. Beliefs that women, more than men, say yes to tasks with low promotability appear as an important driver of these differences. If women hold tasks that are less promotable than those held by men, then women will progress more slowly in organizations.
J44|Saving Soviet Science: The Impact of Grants When Government R&D Funding Disappears|I estimate the impact of a historic grant program, funded by George Soros, that provided grants to over 28,000 Soviet scientists shortly after the end of the USSR. Exploiting a discontinuity in the grant eligibility formula, I show that the grants more than doubled publications on the margin, significantly induced scientists to remain in the science sector, and had long-lasting impacts. While existing evidence shows negligible impacts of scientific grants, I show that funding for science can have high marginal returns when funding levels are low relative to the stock of human capital.
J44|The Effect of Ideological Positions on Job Market Interaction|Reporters and editors may not have the same ideology. When an editor wants to employ a new reporter with a different ideology, they have to negotiate the price of moving from their own to the other's ideology. We focus on the job market for reporters, where the agents negotiate over the ideological position to be reported and wage. We adopt a spatial model in which each agent suffers a utility loss as the agreed-upon position moves away from his/her favored one. Equilibrium determines a threshold ideological gap for a match to be formed. Our analysis generates a natural separation between extreme, mildly extreme and moderate ideologies. Furthermore, we find that agents that hold extreme ideologies compromise less than moderates. This formulation may be applied to other situations in which agents involve monetary and non-monetary considerations, especially a preference for similarity.
J44|Global Talent Flows|Highly skilled workers play a central and starring role in today's knowledge economy. Talented individuals make exceptional direct contributions--including breakthrough innovations and scientific discoveries--and coordinate and guide the actions of many others, propelling the knowledge frontier and spurring economic growth. In this process, the mobility of skilled workers becomes critical to enhancing productivity. Substantial attention has been paid to understanding the worldwide distribution of talent and how global migration flows further tilt the deck. Using newly available data, we first review the landscape of global talent mobility. We next consider the determinants of global talent flows at the individual and firm levels and sketch some important implications. Third, we review the national gatekeepers for skilled migration and broad differences in approaches used to select migrants for admission. Looking forward, the capacity of people, firms, and countries to successfully navigate this tangled web of global talent will be critical to their success.
J44|High-Skilled Migration and Agglomeration|This article reviews recent research regarding high-skilled migration. We adopt a data-driven perspective, bringing together and describing several ongoing research streams that range from the construction of global migration databases, to the legal codification of national policies regarding high-skilled migration, to the analysis of patent data regarding cross-border inventor movements. A common theme throughout this research is the importance of agglomeration economies for explaining high-skilled migration. We highlight some key recent findings and outline major gaps in the literature that we hope will be tackled in the near future.
J44|Frontier Knowledge and Scientific Production: Evidence from the Collapse of International Science|We show that World War I and the subsequent boycott against Central scientists severely interrupted international scientific cooperation. After 1914, citations to recent research from abroad decreased and paper titles became less similar (evaluated by latent semantic analysis), suggesting a reduction in international knowledge flows. Reduced international scientific cooperation led to a decline in the production of basic science and its application in new technology. Specifically, we compare productivity changes for scientists who relied on frontier research from abroad, to changes for scientists who relied on frontier research from home. After 1914, scientists who relied on frontier research from abroad published fewer papers in top scientific journals, produced less Nobel Prize–nominated research, introduced fewer novel scientific words, and introduced fewer novel words that appeared in the text of subsequent patent grants. The productivity of scientists who relied on top 1% research declined twice as much as the productivity of scientists who relied on top 3% research. Furthermore, highly prolific scientists experienced the starkest absolute productivity declines. This suggests that access to the very best research is key for scientific and technological progress.
J44|So Similar and Yet So Different: A Comparative Analysis of a Firm's Cost and Benefits of Apprenticeship Training in Austria and Switzerland|The authors compare a firm's costs and benefits of providing apprenticeship training in Austria and Switzerland, using two original micro data sets. While both countries share a number of similarities, including an extensive vocational education and training (VET) system, and a common border, there are some important institutional differences. On average, a Swiss firm generates a net profit of 3400 Euro per apprentice and per year of training, while an Austrian firm incurs net costs of 4200 Euro. Applying matching models, we find that this difference is largely driven by a higher relative apprentice pay in Austria, which in turn is associated with collective bargaining agreements and competition with alternative school-based VET pathways. However, Austrian firms can still generate a return on their training investment, partly due to wage subsidies, but mostly by retaining a high share of apprentices as skilled workers, and thereby save on future hiring costs.

J44|Are Mutual Fund Managers Paid for Investment Skill?|Compensation of mutual fund managers is paramount to understanding agency frictions in asset delegation. We collect a unique registry-based dataset on the compensation of Swedish mutual fund managers. We find a concave relationship between pay and revenue, in contrast to how investors compensate the fund company (firm). We also find a surprisingly weak sensitivity of pay to performance, even after accounting for the indirect effects of performance on revenue. Firm-level fixed effects, revenues, and profits add substantial explanatory power for compensation. Received April 25, 2017; editorial decision August 21, 2017 by Editor Matthew Spiegel.

J44|Prevalence of Diseases and Health Care Utilization ofthe Self-Employed Artists and TheirEmpirical Determinants: Evidence From a Slovenian Survey|Empirical studies on precarious work are still at their beginnings, even more so when the health of precarious workers is under concern. Commonly, precarious workers are assumed to have the inferior health to the employees and even to the population in general, although some recent studiesfound counter evidence to this claim. In particular, studies on the labor market of artists have so far almost completely neglected the question of the health of the artists,and this study tries to fill in this large and important void. In the study, we employ a survey of Slovenian self-employed artists, undertaken in 2015, to study the determinants of the prevalence of diseases and health utilization of self-employed artists in Slovenia using econometric modelling and network analysis. We study and find the determinants, influencing the prevalence of each type of the most common disease among the self-employed artists, determine the most common groupings/multiple diseases among this population, and, finally, study the determinants of health care utilization of self-employed artists and model the heterogeneity in the observed sample. Aninteresting result lies in determining two differentgroups according to their health care utilization and providingtheir interpretation which fits into the existing literature on artist labor markets.
J44|Taking My Talents to South Beach (and Back)|We study the local economic spillovers generated by LeBron James' presence on a team in the National Basketball Association. Mr. James, the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft, spent the first seven seasons of his career at the Cleveland Cavaliers, and then moved to the Miami Heat in 2010, only to return to Cleveland in 2014. Long considered one of the NBA's superstars, he has received the league's MVP award four times, won three NBA championships, and been a part of two victorious US teams at the Olympics. We trace the impact a star of Mr. James' caliber can have on economic activity by analyzing the impact his departures and arrivals had on business activity close to the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat stadiums. We find that Mr. James has a statistically and economically significant positive effect on both the number of restaurants and other eating and drinking establishments near the stadium where he is based, and on aggregate employment at those establishments. Specifically, his presence increases the number of such establishments within one mile of the stadium by about 13%, and employment by about 23.5%. These effects are very local, in that they decay rapidly as one moves farther from the stadium.

J44|Is Occupational Licensing a Barrier to Interstate Migration?|Occupational licensure, one of the most significant labor market regulations in the United States, may restrict the interstate movement of workers. We analyze the interstate migration of 22 licensed occupations. Using an empirical strategy that controls for unobservable characteristics that drive long-distance moves, we find that the between-state migration rate for individuals in occupations with state-specific licensing exam requirements is 36 percent lower relative to members of other occupations. Members of licensed occupations with national licensing exams show no evidence of limited interstate migration. The size of this effect varies across occupations and appears to be tied to the state specificity of licensing requirements. We also provide evidence that the adoption of reciprocity agreements, which lower re-licensure costs, increases the interstate migration rate of lawyers. Based on our results, we estimate that the rise in occupational licensing can explain part of the documented decline in interstate migration and job transitions in the United States.
J44|Organized interests and foreign-educated professionals: The case of the associations for physicians and nurses in Sweden|The role and importance of employee organizations (i.e., unions) on policies concerning international migration have been studied extensively for decades. However, we know very little about the strategies of the organized interests of health care professionals. This paper will contribute to previous research, both internationally and in the Swedish context, on issues concerning the (re-)action of professional organizations towards migration reforms that might endanger the profession's control over their segment of the labor market. Through a study of the associations representing the two largest licensed health care professions in Sweden – physicians and nurses – the study investigates if, and how, they try to limit the competition in the labor market against reforms that are promoting increased mobility and international migration. The conclusions are mixed, suggesting that the long-term goals of professional associations are more important than strategies that might reduce the competition of foreign-educated practitioners in the short run.
J44|Economic assimilation of immigrants arriving from highly developed countries: The case of German immigrants in Sweden and the US|Migration across well-developed countries has been overlooked in the immigration literature. The present study is designed to evaluate the interplay between the effects of host countries' characteristics and self-selection patterns of immigrants from a highly developed country on their economic assimilation in other developed countries. We focus on immigrants originated from Germany during 1990–2000 who migrated to Sweden and the US. We use the 5 percent 2000 Public Use Microdata files (PUMS) of the US census and a pooled file of the 2005–2007 American Community Survey, and the 2000 and 2006 Swedish Registers. We analyze eight groups of German immigrants – by country of desti¬nation (the US/ Sweden), gender, and skill level (with/without an acade¬mic degree). The results show that almost all German immigrants reached full earnings assimilation with natives of similar observed attributes, and that the assimilation of highly skilled Germans was better than that of the low skilled. We also found that the skilled immigrants were compensated for their human capital acquired in Germany prior to their migration. Finally, we find that despite higher educational levels of the Germans that headed to Sweden, the better assimilation of German immigrants, especially the highly educated, took place in the US. The better assimilation of Germans in the US was probably the result of an interaction between the Germans’ pattern of self-selection (mainly on un¬observed attributes) and the US context of reception – mainly higher returns on their observed human capital in the US.
J44|Job matching in connected regional and occupational labour markets|Job mobility equilibrates disparities in local labour markets and influences the job-matching efficiency. We specify a matching function with regional, occupational and combined regional–occupational spillovers of unemployed and vacancies. To construct these spillovers, we use information on regional proximities and occupational similarities. Based on novel German data on new hires, the unemployed and vacancies, we find significant positive effects of all spillover terms, with the exception of the negative and significant spillovers of the unemployed in other occupations. The reverse spillover effects could be used for designing macro-oriented policies aiming to improve job matching.
J44|The Careers of Teachers in Australia: A Descriptive Study|This study uses longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey to provide a descriptive analysis of teacher careers in Australia, looking at transitions in and out of teaching, the length of spells spent teaching, remuneration and job satisfaction in both government and non-government school sectors. Each year, approximately 14 per cent of teachers leave teaching (becoming a principal is not counted as leaving teaching). Most who leave return to teaching at some stage, commonly after a gap of just one or two years. This absence from teaching is typically associated with starting a family. Overall, teachers are just as satisfied with their jobs as other professionals, and express aboveaverage levels of job satisfaction in relation to job security, but below average satisfaction in relation to job flexibility (i.e. work/life balance). Those who left teaching recorded substantially lower job satisfaction on all aspects of their job while teaching, which su gests they were no longer well suited to teaching. The starting wages of full-time teachers are similar to those of other full-time professions, but their wages grow much more slowly with experience than other professions, for both males and females.
J44|So similar and yet so different: A comparative analysis of a firm's net costs and post-apprenticeship training benefits in Austria and Switzerland|The authors compare a firm's net cost and post-apprenticeship benefits of providing apprenticeship training in Austria and Switzerland: two countries with many similarities but some critical institutional differences. On average, a Swiss firm generates an annual net benefit of Euro 3,400 from training an apprentice, whereas a firm in Austria incurs net costs of Euro 4,200. The impetus for this difference is largely a higher relative apprentice pay in Austria. However, compared with Swiss firms, Austrian firms generate a higher post-training return by retaining a higher share of apprentices and savings on future hiring costs.
J44|Dual Practice by Health Workers: Theory and Evidence from Indonesia|Using a simple theoretical model we conjecture that dual practice may increase the number of patients seen but reduce hours spent at public facilities, if public physicians lack motivation and/or if their opportunity costs are very large. Using data from Indonesia, we then test these theoretical conjectures. Our identification strategy relies on a 1997 legislation necessitating health professionals to apply for license for private practice only after three years of graduation. Results using a difference-in-difference regression discontinuity design provides support to our conjectures, identifying the role of weak work discipline, lack of motivation and opportunity costs of public service provision.
J44|So Similar and yet so Different: A Comparative Analysis of a Firm's Cost and Benefits of Apprenticeship Training in Austria and Switzerland|The authors compare a firm’s costs and benefits of providing apprenticeship training in Austria and Switzerland, using two original micro data sets. While both countries share a number of similarities, including an extensive vocational education and training (VET) system, and a common border, there are some important institutional differences. On average, a Swiss firm generates a net profit of 3400 Euro per apprentice and per year of training, while an Austrian firm incurs net costs of 4200 Euro. Applying matching models, we find that this difference is largely driven by a higher relative apprentice pay in Austria, which in turn is associated with collective bargaining agreements and competition with alternative school-based VET pathways. However, Austrian firms can still generate a return on their training investment, partly due to wage subsidies, but mostly by retaining a high share of apprentices as skilled workers, and thereby save on future hiring costs.
J44|The Effect of Ideological Positions on Job Market Interaction|Reporters and editors may not have the same ideology. When an editor wants to employ a new reporter with a different ideology, they have to negotiate the price of moving from their own to the other's ideology. We focus on the job market for reporters, where the agents negotiate over the ideological position to be reported and wage. We adopt a spatial model in which each agent suffers a utility loss as the agreed-upon position moves away from his/her favored one. Equilibrium determines a threshold ideological gap for a match to be formed. Our analysis generates a natural separation between extreme, mildly extreme and moderate ideologies. Furthermore, we find that agents that hold extreme ideologies compromise less than moderates. This formulation may be applied to other situations in which agents involve monetary and non-monetary considerations, especially a preference for similarity.
J44|Digital Labor Markets and Global Talent Flows|Digital labor markets are rapidly expanding and connecting companies and contractors on a global basis. We review the environment in which these markets take root, the micro- and macro-level studies of their operations, their ongoing evolution and recent trends, and perspectives for undertaking research with micro-data from these labor platforms. We undertake new empirical analyses of Upwork data regarding 1) the alignment of micro- and macro-level approaches to disproportionate ethnic-connected exchanges on digital platforms, 2) gravity model analyses of global outsourcing contract flows and their determinants for digital labor markets, and 3) quantification of own- and cross-country elasticities for contract work by wage rate. Digital labor markets are an exciting frontier for global talent flows and growing rapidly in importance.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J44|Learning and Earning: An Approximation to College Value Added in Two Dimensions|This paper explores the implications of measuring college productivity in two different dimensions: earning and learning. We compute system-wide measures using administrative data from the country of Colombia that link social security records to students’ performance on a national college graduation exam. In each case we can control for individuals’ college entrance exam scores in an approach akin to teacher value added models. We present three main findings: 1) colleges’ earning and learning productivities are far from perfectly correlated, with private institutions receiving relatively higher rankings under earning measures than under learning measures; 2) earning measures are significantly more correlated with student socioeconomic status than learning measures; and 3) in terms of rankings, earning measures tend to favor colleges with engineering and business majors, while colleges offering programs in the arts and sciences fare better under learning measures.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J44|Measuring Instructor Effectiveness in Higher Education|Instructors are a chief input into the higher education production process, yet we know very little about their role in promoting student success. This is in contrast to elementary and secondary schooling, for which ample evidence suggests teacher quality is an important determinant of student achievement. Whether colleges could improve student and institutional performance by reallocating instructors or altering personnel policies hinges on the role of instructors in student success. In this paper we measure variation in postsecondary instructor effectiveness and estimate its relationship to overall and course-specific teaching experience. We explore this issue in the context of the University of Phoenix, a large for-profit university that offers both online and in-person courses in a wide array of fields and degree programs. We focus on instructors in the college algebra course that is required for all BA degree program students. We find substantial variation in student performance across instructors both in the current class and subsequent classes. Variation is larger for in-person classes, but is still substantial for online courses. Effectiveness grows modestly with course-specific teaching experience, but is unrelated to pay. Our results suggest that personnel policies for recruiting, developing, motivating, and retaining effective postsecondary instructors may be a key, yet underdeveloped, tool for improving institutional productivity.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J44|Are Recessions Good for Staffing in Nursing Homes?|The quality and cost of care in nursing homes depend critically on the number and types of nurses. Recent research suggests that the nursing supply adjusts to macroeconomic conditions. However, prior work has failed to consider the effect of macroeconomic conditions on demand for nurses through the effect on revenues. We test how county-level unemployment rates affect direct-care staffing rates in nursing homes using California data. We exploit the wide variation in the unemployment rates across counties and over time in 2005â€“12. We also test whether there are heterogeneous effects of unemployment rates by facility size, staffing level, and profit status. We find that as unemployment rates increase, staffing by registered nurses (RNs) decreases but staffing by licensed practical nurses (LPNs) increases. The increase in LPNs is larger in large nursing homes, nursing homes with higher staffing levels, and in for-profit nursing homes. We also find that as unemployment rates increase, nursing home revenue decreases. While the effect of macroeconomic conditions on nursing supply may be important for cost and quality of care, the mechanism is not simple, direct, or homogeneous for all types of nurses and nursing homes.
J44|Allocating Effort and Talent in Professional Labor Markets|In many professional service firms, new associates work long hours while competing in up-or-out promotion contests. Our model explains why. We argue that the productivity of skilled partners in professional service firms (e.g., law, consulting, investment banking, and public accounting) is quite large relative to the productivity of their peers who are competent and experienced but not well suited to the partner role. Therefore, these firms adopt personnel policies that facilitate the identification of new partners. In our model, both heavy workloads and up-or-out rules serve this purpose.
J44|On the Economics of Audit Partner Tenure and Rotation: Evidence from PCAOB Data|This paper provides the first partner tenure and rotation analysis for a large cross-section of U.S. publicly listed firms over an extended period. We analyze the effects on audit quality as well as economic tradeoffs related to partner tenure and rotation with respect to audit hours and fees. On average, we find no evidence for audit quality declines over the tenure cycle and little support for fresh-look benefits after rotations. Nevertheless, partner rotations have significant economic consequences. We find increases in audit fees and decreases in audit hours over the tenure cycle, which differ by partner experience, client size, and competitiveness of the local audit market. More generally, our findings are consistent with efforts by the audit firms to minimize disruptions and audit failures around mandatory rotations. We also analyze special circumstances, such as audit firm switches and early partner rotations, and show that they are more disruptive than mandatory rotations, and also more likely to exhibit audit quality effects.
J44|Is Occupational Licensing a Barrier to Interstate Migration?|Occupational licensure, one of the most significant labor market regulations in the United States, may restrict the interstate movement of workers. We analyze the interstate migration of 22 licensed occupations. Using an empirical strategy that controls for unobservable characteristics that drive long-distance moves, we find that the between-state migration rate for individuals in occupations with state-specific licensing exam requirements is 36 percent lower relative to members of other occupations. Members of licensed occupations with national licensing exams show no evidence of limited interstate migration. The size of this effect varies across occupations and appears to be tied to the state specificity of licensing requirements. We also provide evidence that the adoption of reciprocity agreements, which lower re-licensure costs, increases the interstate migration rate of lawyers. Based on our results, we estimate that the rise in occupational licensing can explain part of the documented decline in interstate migration and job transitions in the United States.
J44|Adjudicator Compensation Systems and Investor-State Dispute Settlement|Compensation for adjudicators is generally considered as a core issue for judicial independence and for attracting good judges in the institutional design for courts. This paper examines compensation systems for adjudicators and dispute settlement administrators in investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). The paper uses in part a comparative perspective based on approaches in domestic courts in advanced economies, an approach rarely taken in analysing investor-state arbitration.The first section of the paper provides historical context and examines the reform of remuneration of judges to replace private litigant fees with salaries in colonial America and the United States, France and England in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Subsequent sections address debates over the impact of compensation systems on adjudicators; contemporary approaches to the compensation of judges in advanced economies; the co-existence in advanced economies of national courts with salaried judges since the early 19th century with generally strong support for commercial arbitration based on ad hoc fee-based remuneration; and similarities and differences between commercial arbitration and investment arbitration, focusing how the largely similar compensation systems may have different effects and be differently perceived by the public.Annexes to the paper report on discussions about adjudicator compensation at the 2016 OECD Investment Treaty Conference and gather some preliminary facts about adjudicator and dispute administrator compensation in investor-state arbitration as well as the investment court system included in the recent EU-Canada CETA trade and investment agreement.

Se emplearon sensores electroquímicos de bajo costo, portátiles, inalámbricos y geolocalizables para la captura de los niveles de contaminación que permiten obtener en tiempo real valores confiables que podrían emplearse no sólo para cuantificar la exposición de contaminación atmosférica sino también para prevención y control, e incluso para fines legislativos. Para la previsión de los niveles de CO2 y de SO2 se aplicaron algoritmos de inteligencia computacional, específicamente redes neuronales.
J44|Productivity, Wages, and Marriage: A Case Study in Professional Athletics|The effect of marriage on productivity and wages has been long debated. A difﬁculty in estimating the effect of marriage on productivity is the lack of data that contain measures of both marital status and exogenous productivity. We fill this gap by using a sample of professional athletes from 1975 - 2007. Our results show that there is little correlation between individual measures of productivity and marriage, yet, wages are up to 15 percent higher for some married players. We find that married players exhibit more stable performance and teams with higher fractions of married players are more successful.

J44|Alma Mat(t)er(s): Determinants of Early Career Success in Economics|We study 6000 author-publication observations to investigate predictors of early career success in six fields of Economics. To minimise the effects of ability heterogeneity on publication success chance, we concentrate on top researchers and focus on the start of their careers to minimise distortions from reputation feedback. The rank of an author’s Alma Mater turns out to be significant in 4 out of 6 subfields of Economics; first placement is significant only in one subfield. Numerically, our insights suggest that a counterfactual descent in the Alma Mater of a star author who graduated from a top 10 university by as little as 10 to 20 ranks, significantly reduces by 13 percentage points his probability of getting a top 5 publication. Lowering the ranking of his Alma Mater by another 80 ranks reduces his chances of getting a top publication by a factor of three.
J44|Varsity Sports Participation, College Selectivity, and First Job in Investment Banking or Management Consulting in the US|I present evidence on the relationship between varsity sports participation, college selectivity, and the likelihood of a first job after graduation in investment banking or management consulting in general and at the most prestigious investment banking and management consulting firms in particular. The research is motivated by Rivera’s findings that elite firms in investment banking, management consulting, and law in the US hire from the most selective colleges and universities, usually the top five, and weigh participation in intercollegiate sports associated with high socioeconomic status over academic achievement. I use LinkedIn data to look at the first job after graduation for Ivy League varsity athletes in selected sports, 2000-2014, with strong academics as evidenced by an All Academic Ivy League designation. I do the same for Harvard University athletes in selected sports, 2007-2014. I also record the US News ranking of the undergraduate colleges and the varsity sports participation of investment bank analysts on LinkedIn at the top investment banks in the United States in 2017. I find a small proportion of investment banking analysts at top firms have been college athletes and the majority of these analysts come from undergraduate colleges outside the top 15 ranked undergraduate colleges and universities in the US. There is evidence that investment bank analysts that were college athletes were more likely to be participants in Rivera’s high status sports than in sports she classifies as more open to participants across the socioeconomic spectrum.
J44|Gender Gaps in Performance: Evidence from Young Lawyers|This paper documents the gender gap in performance among high-skilled professionals in the United States. On the basis of widely used performance measures in law firms, we find that male lawyers bill 10 percent more hours and bring in more than twice as much new client revenue as female lawyers. The differential impact across genders in the presence of young children and differences in aspirations to become a law firm partner account for a large share of the difference in performance. We show that accounting for performance has important consequences for gender gaps in lawyers’ earnings and subsequent promotion.
J44|Order of play advantage in sequential tournaments: Evidence from randomized settings in professional golf|In this paper we exploit naturally occurring randomized settings within a very large dataset of golf shots to test whether order of play matters in professional golf tournaments. We isolate two settings where professional golf competitors find themselves with virtually identical shots, implying the order of play is effectively random. These settings allow us to identify unbiased, causal estimates of the relevance of moving first or second in competition. We find robust evidence that the second-mover has a statistically (and economically) significant advantage, which we argue is consistent with a learning effect in competition.
J44|Heterogeneous Technology Diffusion and Ricardian Trade Patterns|Migration and trade are often linked through ethnic networks boosting bilateral trade. This study uses migration to quantify the importance of Ricardian technology differences for international trade. The framework provides the first panel estimates connecting country-industry productivity and exports, and the study exploits heterogeneous technology diffusion from immigrant communities in the United States for identification. The latter instruments are developed by combining panel variation on the development of new technologies across US cities with historical settlement patterns for migrants from countries. The instrumented elasticity of export growth on the intensive margin with respect to the exporter’s productivity growth is between 1.6 and 2.4, depending upon weighting. This provides an important contribution to the trade literature of Ricardian advantages, and it establishes a connection of migration to home country exports beyond bilateral networks.
J44|Do individual salaries depend on the performance of the peers? Prototype heuristic and wage bargaining in the NBA| This paper analyzes the link between relative market value of representative subsets of athletes in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and individual wages. NBA athletes are categorized with respect to multiple performance characteristics utilizing the k-means algorithm to cluster observations and a group's market value is calculated by averaging real annual salaries. Employing GMM estimation techniques to a dynamic wage equation, we find a statistically significant and positive effect of one-period lagged relative market value of an athlete's representative cluster on individual wages after controlling for past individual performance. This finding is consistent with the theory of prototype heuristic, introduced by Kahneman and Frederick (2002), that NBA teams' judgment about an athlete's future performance is based on a comparison of the player to a prototype group consisting of other but comparable athletes.

J44|The Impact of Television Programmes on Teenage Career Aspirations: The 'MasterChef Effect'|In recent years, in Italy, a larger number of students have chosen to attend vocational hospitality and catering schools. This paper investigates the extent to which this increase may have been triggered by the growing popularity of the cooking reality show MasterChef, in which the chef profession is portrayed as exciting and glamorous. Using panel data methods and controlling for several potential confounding variables, the analysis attempts to separate the effect of MasterChef from that of other determinants of the decision to attend vocational hospitality and catering schools. The results show that an increase of one percentage point in the audience of MasterChef is associated with an increase in the proportion of final year lower secondary school students willing to enrol at vocational hospitality and catering schools of between 0.25 and 0.35 percentage points. This finding suggests that popular television programmes like MasterChef may play an important role in complementing and supplementing government measures aimed at promoting vocational training among youths.
J44|What You Don’t Know... Can’t Hurt You? A Field Experiment on Relative Performance Feedback in Higher Education| This paper studies the effect of providing feedback to college students on their position in the grade distribution by using a randomized control experiment. This information was updated every six months during a three-year period. In the absence of treatment, students' underestimate their position in the grade distribution. The treatment significantly improves the students' self-assessment. We find that treated students experience a significant decrease in their educational performance, as measured by their accumulated GPA and number of exams passed, and a significant improvement in their self-reported satisfaction, as measured by survey responses obtained after information is provided but before students take their exams. Those effects, however, are short lived, as students catch up in subsequent periods. Moreover, the negative effect on performance is driven by those students who underestimate their position in the absence of feedback. Those students who overestimate initially their position, if anything, respond positively.
J44|Do Financial Incentives Influence GPs’ Decisions to Do After-Hours Work? A Discrete Choice Labour Supply Model|This paper analyses doctors’ supply of after-hours care, and how it is affected by personal and family circumstances as well as the earnings structure. We use detailed survey data from a large sample of Australian General Practitioners to estimate a structural, discrete-choice model of labour supply and after-hours care. This allows us to jointly model how many daytime-weekday hours a doctor works, and his or her probability of providing after-hours care. The underlying utility function varies across individual and family characteristics. We simulate labour supply responses to an increase in doctors’ hourly earnings, both in a daytime-weekday setting and for after-hours care. Among doctors overall, men and women increase their daytime-weekday working hours if their hourly earnings in this setting increases, but only to a very small extent. Men’s labour supply elasticities do not change if their family circumstances change, but for women the small behavioural response disappears completely if they have preschool-aged children. Doctors are somewhat more likely to provide after-hours care if their hourly earnings in that setting increases, but again the effect is very small and is only evident in some sub-groups. Moreover, higher earnings in weekday-daytime practice reduces the probability of providing after-hours care, particularly for men. Increasing doctors’ earnings appears to be at best relatively ineffective in encouraging increased provision of after-hours care, and may even prove harmful if incentives are not well-targeted.
J44|No Better Moment to Score a Goal than Just Before Half Time? A Soccer Myth Statistically Tested|We test the soccer myth suggesting that a particularly good moment to score a goal is just before half time. To this end, rich data on 1,179 games played in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League are analysed. In contrast to the myth, we find that, conditional on the goal difference and other game characteristics at half time, the final goal difference at the advantage of the home team is 0.520 goals lower in case of a goal just before half time by this team. We show that this finding relates to this team's lower probability of scoring a goal during the second half.
J44|Motivational factors influencing teaching (FIT) as a career: An empirical study of the expatriate teachers in the Emirates|This study aimed to investigate the motivational factors that lead to choice of teaching career in expatriate teachers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A UAE version of the Factors Influencing Teaching (FIT)-Choice scale (Watt & Richardson, 2007) was developed following the pre-testing strategies used by Dillman (2000), Heinz (2013) and Sharif (2014) and applied to identify the factors that most influenced the expatriates choose teaching as a career in the UAE. In a proposed and successfully tested model in this study, altruistic &/or intrinsic and extrinsic factors were found to be the mediator in the relationship between prior teaching & learning experience and social influence, and choice of a teaching career. Some gender differences were observed in case of four factors, ie, fall back career, work with children and adolescents, salary and prior teaching and learning experiences, and implications were discussed. For recruitment campaigns, strategies based on this study findings and understanding of the expatriate teachers’ motivations to adopt teaching as a career in the UAE were discussed. Due to the fact that the most recent study by LinkedIn among 380 million global members highlighted the UAE to be the most popular destination for expatriates surpassing Australia, Canada and Singapore (Maceda, 2015), the findings of this study can be considered to be of value to: (a) altruistically/intrinsically motivated professionals who are international-minded and seeking greener pastures in the UAE, and (b) the UAE policymakers who are working hard to fill the demand-supply gap drawing the attention of expatriates with the right skills and expertise. Finally, the research attempts in this study are seemingly unique in the sense that no previous study on teaching motivation had a combined focus on ‘in-service’, ‘expatriate teachers’ and UAE using FIT-Choice scale.
J44|Effectiveness of In-Season Manager Changes in English Premier League Football|Abstract We analyze the performance effects of in-season manager changes in English Premier League football during the seasons 2000/2001–2014/2015. We find that some managerial changes are successful, while others are counterproductive. On average, performance does not improve following a managerial replacement. The successfulness of managerial turnover depends on specific highly unpredictable circumstances, as we illustrate through case-studies.
J44|Measurement of the intensity of the reforms in professions and economic activities in Greece via a composite regulation index|Abstract The institutional framework regulating professions/ economic activities of the service sector in Greece has been recently liberalised extensively, to promote competition, conform to European Community regulations and fulfil commitments under the Memoranda of Economic and Financial Policies. This paper aims to capture quantitatively this major structural reform, by measuring for the first time the degree of regulation in 90 professions/ activities affected by the relevant reform laws. The degree of regulation is measured both for the regime before and for that after the laws, and the methodology employed is that of composite regulation indices. The index values obtained are used for evaluating the extent of the reforms and estimating correlations and regressions. The results of the analysis point to the existence of significant barriers to competition before the reforms and extensive liberalisation of the regulatory framework after the adoption of the relevant laws. Moreover, the results suggest that professions/activities characterised by more stringent restrictions before the reforms tend to be characterised by a comparatively higher intensity of regulations after the reforms.
J44|A quality-based global assessment of financial research|Abstract We conduct rankings on finance programs based on a rich database of citations for all articles from a set of 23 quality finance journals during 1990–2010. Our work represents a new perspective on the evaluation of faculty research as compared to the traditional counting of total number of publications in the literature. Our findings show that the top-five institutions are the University of Chicago, Harvard University, New York University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Duke University. In general, the top programs are able to produce a large number of high impact articles and a majority of their citations are drawn from premier finance journals. In addition, European and Asia–Pacific institutions are doing very well during the recent years. Our author assessment suggests that for an author with at least five normalized citations per year from articles that appeared in the 23 finance journals, she will be in the top 1.7 % of all authors.
J44|Using Google Scholar citations to rank accounting programs: a global perspective|Abstract We conduct an assessment on accounting program research performance based on Google Scholar citations for all articles from a set of 23 quality accounting journals during 1991–2010. Our work is a new approach in accounting by directly measuring the impact of the faculty research in accounting programs. We find that the top-5 accounting programs are the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Chicago, Stanford University, the University of Michigan, and Harvard University. These top programs produce a large number of high impact articles. In addition, using the mean citations from all articles in a journal, we find that the Review of Accounting Studies (RAST) is a top-5 journal, replacing Contemporary Accounting Research (CAR).
J44|Splash with A teammate: Peer Effects in High-Stakes Tournaments|This paper studies peer effects on individual performance among elite athletes in high-stakes tournaments. I ask whether the presence of a teammate affects athletes' performance using data from the latest seven World Swimming Championships.To identify causal effects I apply a regression discontinuity design by comparing athletes' performance in the finals when their teammate barely qualified and barely not qualified for the same final. Female athletes accompanied by a teammate swam 0.41%-0.56% of the average time faster, or ranked by 0.75-1.16 higher in the final. Male athletes' performance is unaffected. Potential channels and gender differences are discussed.
J44|Skills Gap – A Strategy for Increasing Knowledge Worker Supply & Demand|The U.S. Economy has been and continues to be burdened with a “Skills Gap” where the skills of the available workforce are mismatched with the skilled talent needs of employer. The skills gap is especially evident among knowledge workers. Millions of people in the US are looking for jobs while millions of skilled jobs remain open. The unemployed and the underemployed in general do not posess the professional skills necessary for the jobs that are available. The conundrum is this recognized shortage of skilled knowledge workers has not led to the expected increase in salaries traditional economic analysis would suggest. This paper explains the true economic analysis of the skills gap in terms of an economic “wedge” that supresses knowledge worker saleries in the face of worker shortages. The paper recognizes a systemic disharmony between the momentum of traditional higher education and the rapidly changing needs and demands for professional skill sets in the marketplace. Traditional academic institutions are not predisposed to creating job-ready professionals that meet market needs, and private sector businesses are not positioned to fill the professional education, training and development gaps that exist. Significant opportunities exist to reposition the players to cerate opportunities for both academic intuitions and private sector companies to address the skills gap problem efficiently and effectively.
J44|Immigrant Entrepreneurship|We examine immigrant entrepreneurship and the survival and growth of immigrant-founded businesses over time relative to native-founded companies. Our work quantities immigrant contributions to new firm creation in a wide variety of fields and using multiple definitions. While significant research effort has gone into understanding the economic impact of immigration into the United States, comprehensive data for quantifying immigrant entrepreneurship are difficult to assemble. We combine several restricted-access U.S. Census Bureau data sets to create a unique longitudinal data platform that covers 1992-2008 and many states. We describe differences in the types of businesses initially formed by immigrants and their medium-term growth patterns. We also consider the relationship of these outcomes to the immigrants’ age at arrival to the United States.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J44|Disruptive Change in the Taxi Business: The Case of Uber|In most cities, the taxi industry is highly regulated and has restricted entry. Ride sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, which use mobile internet technology to connect passengers and drivers, have begun to compete with traditional taxis. This paper examines the efficiency of ride sharing services vis-a-vis taxis. In most cities with data available, UberX drivers spend a significantly higher fraction of their time, and drive a substantially higher share of miles, with a passenger in their car than do taxi drivers. Reasons for this efficiency advantage are explored.
J44|Labor Supply Effects of Occupational Regulation: Evidence from the Nurse Licensure Compact|There is concern that state licensure requirements impede efficient mobility of licensed professionals to areas of high demand. Nursing has not been immune to this criticism, especially in the context of perceived nurse shortages and large expected future demand. The Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC) was introduced to solve this problem by permitting registered nurses to practice across state lines without obtaining additional licensure and making licensure easier to obtain for nurses moving between member states. We exploit the staggered adoption of the NLC across states and over time to examine whether a reduction in licensure-induced barriers alters the nurse labor market. Using data on over 1.5 million nurses and other health care workers from the 1990 and 2000 Census and the 2006-2012 American Community Surveys as well as data from the 1992-2012 Current Population Survey, we estimate the effects of NLC adoption on labor supply and commuting outcomes. We find no evidence that the labor supply or mobility of nurses increases following the adoption of the NLC, even among the residents of counties bordering other NLC states who are potentially most affected by the NLC. This suggests that nationalizing occupational licensing will not substantially reduce the labor market frictions caused by occupational regulation.
J44|Wage Flexibility and Employment Fluctuations: Evidence from the Housing Sector|Many economists suspect that downward nominal wage rigidities in ongoing labor contracts are an important source of employment fluctuations over the business cycle but there is little direct empirical evidence on this conjecture. This paper compares three occupations in the housing sector with very different wage setting institutions, real estate agents, architects, and construction workers. I study the wage and employment responses of these occupations to the housing cycle, a proxy for labor demand shocks to the industry. The employment of real estate agents, whose pay is far more flexible than the other occupations, indeed reacts less to the cycle than employment in the other occupations. However, unless labor demand elasticities are large, the estimates do not suggest that the level of wage flexibility enjoyed by real estate agents would buffer employment fluctuations in response to demand shocks by more than 10 to 20 percent compared to completely rigid wages.
J44|A Doctor Will See You Now: Physician-Patient Relationships and Clinical Decisions|We estimate the effect of physician-patient relationships on clinical decisions in a setting where the treating physician is as good as randomly assigned. OBs are 25% (4 percentage points) more likely to perform a C-section when delivering patients with whom they have a pre-existing clinical relationship (their “own patients”) than when delivering patients with whom they had no prior relationship. OBs’ decisions are consistent with receiving greater disutility from their own patients’ difficult labors. After a string of difficult labors, OBs are more likely to perform C-sections on their own patients, and this can explain the entire own patient effect.
J44|Competitive effects of scope of practice restrictions: Public health or public harm?|The demand for healthcare professionals is predicted to grow significantly over the next decade. Securing an adequate workforce is of primary importance to ensure the health and wellbeing of the population in an efficient manner. Occupational licensing laws and related restrictions on scope of practice (SOP) are features of the market for healthcare professionals and are also controversial. At issue is a balance between protecting the public health and removing anticompetitive barriers to entry and practice. In this paper, we examine the case of SOP restrictions for certified nurse midwives (CNMs) and evaluate the effects of changes in states’ SOP laws on markets for CNMs and on maternal and infant outcomes. We find that SOP laws are neither helpful nor harmful in regards to health outcomes but states that have no SOP-based barriers have lower rates of induced labor and Cesarean section births. We discuss the implications for state policy.
J44|Analyzing the Influence of Occupational Licensing Duration and Grandfathering on Labor Market Outcomes|The length of time from the implementation of an occupational licensing statute (i.e., licensing duration) may matter in influencing labor market outcomes. Adding to or raising the entry barriers are likely easier once an occupation is established and has gained influence in a political jurisdiction. States often enact grandfather clauses and ratchet up requirements that protect existing workers and increase entry costs to new entrants. We analyze the labor market influence of the duration of occupational licensing statutes for 13 major universally licensed occupations over a 75-year period. These occupations comprise the vast majority of workers in these regulated occupations in the United States. We provide among the first estimates of potential economic rents to grandfathering. We find that duration years of occupational licensure are positively associated with wages for continuing and grandfathered workers. The estimates show a positive relationship of duration with hours worked, but we find moderately negative results for participation in the labor market. The universally licensed occupations, however, exhibit heterogeneity in outcomes. Consequently, unlike some other labor market public policies, such as minimum wages or direct unemployment insurance benefits, occupational licensing would likely influence labor market outcomes when measured over a longer period of time.
J44|Strengthening competition in network sectors and the internal market in Canada|Canada’s productivity performance has lagged that of many other OECD countries, despite some improvement in recent years. One measure to enhance overall efficiency would be to strengthen competition on the domestic market to drive future multi-factor productivity improvements. The potential gains are large: about a half a percent per year over a fairly long horizon. This paper focuses on increasing competition in network sectors, including energy, telecommunication services and broadcasting, and transportation, which are key inputs to production in the broader economy. Improving regulatory conditions, efficiency and/or cost competitiveness could yield more productive outcomes in these sectors, as well as in downstream industries. Competition could also be increased by lowering barriers to interprovincial trade and the movement of labour, which act to fragment Canada’s already small domestic market. To this end, reforms of the Agreement on Internal Trade and measures to reduce sectoral barriers to trade are also discussed. This Working Paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of Canada (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-canada.htm) Concurrence dans les industries de réseau et renforcement du marché intérieur au Canada La productivité canadienne est inférieure à celle de nombreux pays de l’OCDE malgré quelques progrès ces dernières années.

J44|Which degrees do students prefer during recessions?|Abstract We examine how changes in the unemployment rate affect demand for tertiary education, demand for different fields of university study and degrees’ admission thresholds. We use panel data for applications submitted to every undergraduate program in Greece that span seven rounds of admission cohorts combined with a degree-specific job insecurity index, and time series on youth (ages 18–25) unemployment. We find that degree- and major-specific job insecurity turns applicants away from degrees and majors that are associated with poor employment prospects. Results indicate that the steep increase in the unemployment rate that started in 2009 is associated with an increase in the number of university applicants. The effect is heterogeneous across fields, with an increase in the demand for degrees in Psychology as well as for entrance to Naval, Police, and Military Academies, and a decrease in the demand for degrees in Business and Management. We also find that the business cycle changes degrees’ admission thresholds by affecting their popularity.
J44|What You Don’t Know... Can’t Hurt You? A Field Experiment on Relative Performance| This paper studies the effect of providing feedback to college students on their position in the grade distribution by using a randomized control experiment. This information was updated every six months during a three-year period. In the absence of treatment, students' underestimate their position in the grade distribution. The treatment significantly improves the students' self-assessment. We find that treated students experience a significant decrease in their educational performance, as measured by their accumulated GPA and number of exams passed, and a significant improvement in their self-reported satisfaction, as measured by survey responses obtained after information is provided but before students take their exams. Those effects, however, are short lived, as students catch up in subsequent periods. Moreover, the negative effect on performance is driven by those students who underestimate their position in the absence of feedback. Those students who overestimate initially their position, if anything, respond positively.

J44|The role of non-cognitive and cognitive skills in accounting for the intergenerational transmission of 'top job' status|Enabling fair access to professional careers is an important strand of UK social mobility policy, however many high status employers demand a wide range of 'soft skills' in addition to strong cognitive skills to identify the best talent which can disadvantage individuals from less privileged backgrounds. This paper uses BCS data to estimate and decompose the intergenerational persistence in top job status to assess the contribution of four potential transmission mechanisms for this advantage: non-cognitive skills, cognitive skills, job aspirations and educational attainment. The results reveal that individuals with parents employed in a top job are 22.8 percentage points more likely to access a top job in adulthood than individuals with parents who are employed in a non top job. Childhood cognitive skills and later educational attainment are found to be particularly important contributors to this transmission of advantage, with childhood non cognitive skills also making a substantial contribution.
J44|High-Stakes Accountability and Teacher Turnover: how do different school inspection judgements affect teachers' decisions to leave their school?|High teacher turnover damages pupil attainment (Borg et al., 2012; Ronfeldt et al., 2012). But while the effects of pupil and teacher characteristics on turnover are well documented, relatively little attention has been paid to the impact of the accountability system. This paper is the first to evaluate the effect on turnover of schools receiving different judgements from the English national schools inspectorate, Ofsted. Theoretically, the effects of inspection judgements are ambiguous. An 'Inadequate' rating may harm teachers' self-efficacy, increasing the chance of them leaving their current school. On the other hand, an 'Inadequate' rating provides a negative signal about the quality of teachers working in that school, decreasing the chance of them finding employment elsewhere. I use a difference in difference approach to estimate this empirically and find that an 'Inadequate' rating leads to an increase in turnover of 3.4 percentage points. By contrast, schools receiving an 'Outstanding' rating see no change in turnover. The results are robust to a number of specifications, sample restrictions and a placebo test.
J44|Traditionelle und neue intermediaere Akteure in den Arbeitswelten hochqualifizierter Solo-Selbststaendiger (Traditional and new intermediary actors in the labor markets of the highly-skilled solo self-employed)|Auf dem Arbeitsmarkt laesst sich eine wachsende Anzahl hochqualifizierter Solo-Selbststaendiger beobachten, fuer die angenommen wird, dass sie ihre Arbeitsbedingungen individuell aushandeln. In jedem Fall zeichnet sich deren Verguetung durch eine vergleichsweise hohe Heterogenitaet aus. Gleichzeitig laesst sich eine Verschiebung im Gefuege kollektiver Interessenvertretungsorgane beobachten, die sich darin zeigt, dass neben Gewerkschaften neue intermediaere Akteure (z.B. Agenturen, Genossenschaften) relevant werden. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist das Ziel des vorliegenden Beitrags, die Rolle traditioneller und neuer intermediaerer Akteure in den Aushandlungen der Arbeitsbedingungen, wie der Verguetung, von hochqualifizierten Solo-Selbststaendigen zu eruieren. Die empirische Basis des Beitrags bildet eine qualitative Studie mit Solo-Selbststaendigen sowie Vertretern/innen von Gewerkschaften, Berufsverbaenden, Agenturen und Genossenschaften in den Branchen Filmwirtschaft, IT-Dienstleistungen und Medizin. In der Analyse der Interviews wird deutlich, dass die hochqualifizierten Solo-Selbststaendigen ihre Verguetung nicht per se individuell aushandeln. Vielmehr wird die Aushandlung von Arbeitsbedingungen durch traditionelle und neue intermediaere Akteure gepraegt, die Beratungsangebote fuer Solo-Selbststaendige bereithalten und die Entwicklung und Verbreitung von Standards foerdern. (Solo self-employed people in Germany represent a growing part of the flexible workforce in knowledge-intensive services with highly heterogeneous income situations. This article challenges the common assumption that their working conditions are negotiated individually by exploring the role of traditional intermediary actors (unions, professional associations) and new intermediary actors (staffing agencies, cooperatives) in pay determination. The empirical basis is a qualitative interview study of solo-self-employed and representatives of unions, professional associations, staffing agencies and cooperatives in film, IT and medicine. The analysis illuminates the contribution of traditional and new intermediary actors to individual negotiations, but also to the development and diffusion of collective standards.)
J44|Arbeit, Arbeitsbewusstsein und Interessenorientierung von Hochqualifizierten Angestellten (Work, work-identity and interest representation of highly-qualified staff)|Die in der Privatwirtschaft angestellten Akademiker sind ein irritierender Gegenstand fuer die Soziologie, da sie sich nicht den klassentheoretischen Strukturkategorien fuegen. Formal betrachtet sind sie Lohnabhaengige wie die gewoehnlichen Arbeiter, orientieren sich aber aufgrund ihres Bildungsweges, ihrer komplexen Taetigkeiten und –in zahlreihen Faellen- ihrer Managementfunktionen an den oberen Schichten, entwickeln eine Arbeitsidentitaet der Beitragsorientierung, und verhalten sich distanziert gegenueber Gewerkschaft und Betriebsrat. Dieses Muster geriet in den 1990er Jahren aufgrund der oekonomischen Krise ins Wanken. Bei der Suche nach Antworten auf die Frage, welche Veraenderungen danach eingetreten sind, begleitet und kommentiert der Artikel die Hochqualifiziertenforschung in der juengeren deutschen Industriesoziologie. Er kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass die Kernelemente des traditionellen High-trust-Modells re-stabilisiert wurden. Eine gesonderte Betrachtung ist der Situation der Hochqualifizierten in der IT-Industrie und der Frage der Gleichstellung hochqualifizierter Frauen gewidmet. (The subject of academic staff in the private sector causes irritation in sociology because it does not fit the structural categories of class theory. In a formal view professionals and middle managers are wage earners like normal workers. However due to their educational background, their complex jobs, and – in many cases – their managerial functions, they are oriented to the upper classes, have a high-commitment work-identity and tend to keep their distance from unions and works councils. In the economic crisis of the 1990s this model of work seemed to erode. In search of answers to the question of what changes have taken place thereafter this article discusses research on highly-qualified staff in the younger German sociology of work literature. It comes to the conclusion that the key elements of the traditional high-trust-model have become restabilised. A separate issue is the situation of highly-qualified specialists in the IT-industry and the question of equal career prospects for highly-qualified women.)
J44|Offshoring R&D|This paper explores offshoring of firms’ research and development functions. Our analysis employs a previously untapped and unique Eurostat International Sourcing Survey. The results are easy to summarize. First, the magnitude of R&D offshoring is small. Second, a large majority of R&D is offshored within the en-terprise group, in contrast to offshoring outside of the enterprise group. Third, most of R&D offshoring from Europe is directed to high-income European countries, not so to low-cost countries in Europe, China, or India. Fourth, R&D jobs do have been lost from offshoring; however, the negative employment impact has been moderate. But the Eurostat International Sourcing Survey does not allow entangling the full net employment effect of R&D offshoring, which could be either negative or positive.
J44|Wage Effects of Unionization and Occupational Licensing Coverage in the United States|Recent estimates in standard models of wage determination for both unionization and occupational licensing have shown wage effects that are similar across the two institutions. These cross-sectional estimates use specialized data sets, with small sample sizes, for the period 2006 to 2008. The authorsâ€™ analysis examines the impact of unions and licensing coverage on wage determination using new data collected on licensing statutes that are then linked to longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) from 1979 to 2010. They develop several approaches, using both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, to measure the impact of these two labor market institutions on wage determination. The estimates of the economic returns to union coverage are greater than those for licensing statutes.
J44|Why do Women Leave Science and Engineering?|The author uses the 2003 and 2010 National Survey of College Graduates to examine the higher exit rate of women compared to men from science and engineering relative to other fields. The author finds that the higher relative exit rate is driven by engineering rather than science, and that half the gap can be explained by the relatively greater exit rate from engineering of women dissatisfied with pay and promotion opportunities. Family-related constraints and dissatisfaction with working conditions are found to be only secondary factors. The relative exit rate by gender from engineering does not differ from that of other fields once womenâ€™s relatively high exit rates from male fields generally are taken into account.
J44|Causal Latent Markov Model for the Comparison of Multiple Treatments in Observational Longitudinal Studies|We extend to the longitudinal setting a latent class approach that was recently introduced by Lanza, Coffman, and Xu to estimate the causal effect of a treatment. The proposed approach enables an evaluation of multiple treatment effects on subpopulations of individuals from a dynamic perspective, as it relies on a latent Markov (LM) model that is estimated taking into account propensity score weights based on individual pretreatment covariates. These weights are involved in the expression of the likelihood function of the LM model and allow us to balance the groups receiving different treatments. This likelihood function is maximized through a modified version of the traditional expectationâ€“maximization algorithm, while standard errors for the parameter estimates are obtained by a nonparametric bootstrap method. We study in detail the asymptotic properties of the causal effect estimator based on the maximization of this likelihood function, and we illustrate its finite sample properties through a series of simulations showing that the estimator has the expected behavior. As an illustration, we consider an application aimed at assessing the relative effectiveness of certain degree programs on the basis of three ordinal response variables in which the work path of a graduate is considered as the manifestation of his or her human capital-level across time.
J44|Revisiting German labour market reform effects—a panel data analysis for occupational labour markets|Abstract The role of the 2000’s German labour market reforms in boosting the German economy has been widely discussed. Considering that one of the main objectives of these reforms was to improve the matching process on the labour market, I use high-frequency administrative data to present new details regarding the development of job-matching performance from 2000 to 2011. Matching productivity increased during all reform stages. Increases in matching productivity have become smaller from 2009. The analysis shows also differences and commonalities in the matching productivity changes on occupational labour markets.
J44|Researchers’ career transitions over the life cycle|Abstract Based on a unique time-use survey of academic researchers in Japan, this study finds that research time decreases over the life cycle. The decrease in total hours worked and the increase in time spent on administrative tasks explain the decrease in research time. We also show that the decrease of research time partly explains why the research output of older researchers’ decreases. The results suggest that proper incentives and job designs for senior researchers may increase their research output.
J44|Exploration for Human Capital: Evidence from the MBA Labor Market|We empirically investigate the effect of uncertainty on corporate hiring. Using novel data from the labor market for MBA graduates, we show that uncertainty regarding how well job candidates fit with a firm's industry hinders hiring and that firms value probationary work arrangements that provide the option to learn more about potential full-time employees. The detrimental effect of uncertainty on hiring is more pronounced when firms face greater firing and replacement costs and when they face less direct competition from other similar firms. These results suggest that firms faced with uncertainty use similar considerations when making hiring decisions as when making decisions regarding investment in physical capital.
J44|The Labor Market Consequences of Regulating Similar Occupations: The Licensing of Occupational and Physical Therapists|This study shows the influence of occupational licensing on two occupations that provide similar services: occupational therapists and physical therapists. Most of the tasks for these two occupations differ, but several jobs overlap, and individuals in both occupations could have legal jurisdiction over these tasks. We empirically examine how these two occupations interact with one another in the labor market on wage determination and employment. Unlike previous studies, our study examines two occupations that are female dominated both within the professions and among its leadership. Our results show that occupational licensing can raise the wages of members of both occupations, but the duration of state occupational licensing statutes is the dominant influence on wage determination. Occupational licensing is also associated with a reduction in annual hours worked and in the relative numbers of members in each of the professions. Moreover, the ability of physical therapists to have direct access to patients is associated with a reduction in hourly earnings for occupational therapists, suggesting some substitution for certain service tasks across the two occupations. The ability of these two occupations to be both complements to and substitutes for one another provides new evidence on how the growing number of regulated occupations that are similar interact and influence one another.
J44|Work-Related Identity of Clinical Research Sector Employees in Poland Against Professional Transformation of the Industry|Purpose: Established professions and knowledge workers identify more with their professional groups than with their organisations. The purpose of the study was to find what kind of work-related identities are shown by clinical research sector employees in Poland, what is the intensity of those identities and which one is dominant.
J44|Physician ethics: undermined or enhanced by modes of payment?|Background: In the medical literature ((Begley (1987), Gervais et al. (1999), American Academy of Dermatology (2000)), the view prevails that any change away from fee-for-service (FFS) jeopardizes medical ethics, defined as motivational preference in this article. The objective of this contribution is to test this hypothesis by first developing two theoretical models of behavior, building on the pioneering works of Ellis and McGuire (1986) and Pauly and Redisch (1973). Medical ethics is reflected by a parameter α which indicates how much importance the physician attributes to patient well-being relative to his or her own income. Accordingly, a weakening of ethical orientation amounts to a fall in the value of α. While economic theory traditionally takes preferences as predetermined, such a change is possible in the light of Evolutionary Economics (Bolle, 2000). Methods: The model based on Ellis and McGuire (1986) depicts the behavior of a physician in private practice, while the one based on Pauly and Redisch (1973) applies to providers who share resources such as in hospital or group practice. Two changes in the mode of payment are analyzed, one from FFS to prospective payment (PP), the other, to pay-for-performance (P4P). One set of predictions relates physician effort to a change in the mode of payment; another, physician effort to a change in α, the parameter reflecting ethics. Using these two relationships, a change in ethics can observationally be related to a change in the mode of payment. The predictions derived from the models are pitted against several case studies from diverse countries. Results: A shift from FFS to PP is predicted to give rise to a negative observed relationship between medical ethics of physicians in private practice under a wide variety of circumstances, more so than a shift to P4P, which can even be seen as enhancing medical ethics provided physician effort has a sufficiently high marginal effectiveness in terms of patient well-being. This prediction is confirmed to a considerable degree by circumstantial evidence coming from the case studies. As to physicians working in hospital or group practice, the prediction is again that an observer will infer that a transition in hospital payment from FFS to PP weakens their ethical orientation. However, this prediction is not fully borne out; a likely reason is that hospitals also differ strongly in terms of their organizational culture, a factor that is not held constant in the case studies. A transition to P4P may lead observers to conclude that it actually enhances medical ethics of healthcare providers working in hospital or group practice. This prediction receives a degree of empirical support from the case studies. Conclusion: The claim that moving away from FFS undermines medical ethics is far too sweeping. It can only in part be justified by observed relationships, which even may suggest that a transition to P4P strengthens medical ethics.
J44|Competitive balance and assortative matching in the German Bundesliga|In this paper we consider trends in the distribution of player talent across association football clubs over time. Player talent is the most important prerequisite for team success in professional sports leagues and changes in players' assortativeness in regard to the clubs they play for may arguably be an important factor for changes in competitive balance. We offer a new approach for measuring player talent and its distribution - the partial correlation of each player with the goal margin. We use this measure to analyze the degree of competitive balance over time. This approach enables us to examine how player mobility drives competitive balance over time. Empirical results are based on 19 seasons of the first two divisions of the German Bundesliga as well as domestic cup games. Our results show a decrease in competitive balance over time; better teams tend to attract increasingly better players. We show that this is driven by an increasingly unequal inter-divisional distribution of teams, coaches and players, as well as increasing assortativeness in the 1st Bundesliga. We further demonstrate that player transfers between Bundesliga teams results in assortative matching between players and teams. These domestic transfers do not, however, explain the reduction in competitive balance over time. Furthermore, we show that UEFA Champions League payments may have contributed to the reduction in competitive balance over the last two decades.

J44|The Value of Postsecondary Credentials in the Labor Market: An Experimental Study|We study employers' perceptions of the value of postsecondary degrees using a field experiment. We randomly assign the sector and selectivity of institutions to fictitious resumes and apply to real vacancy postings for business and health jobs on a large online job board. We find that a business bachelor's degree from a for-profit online institution is 22 percent less likely to receive a callback than one from a nonselective public institution. In applications to health jobs, we find that for-profit credentials receive fewer callbacks unless the job requires an external quality indicator such as an occupational license. (JEL I23, I26, J24, J44, J63, M51)
J44|Battling over Jobs: Occupational Licensing in Health Care|The goal of this paper is to outline the major tensions between the monopoly face of licensing versus potential consumer protection goals of occupational regulation in the health care industry. Historically, health care occupations limited supply as a method of raising earnings, but with the growth in the number of newly regulated occupations, many professions have come in conflict over who gets to do the work. Rather than having consumers decide, state legislatures and licensing boards determine the allocation of tasks. The paper outlines policies that may allow consumers rather than service providers determine the direct allocation of these jobs.
J44|Should the US Eliminate Entry Barriers to the Practice of Law? Perspectives Shaped by Industry Deregulation|States' requirements that lawyers obtain a license to practice law, as well as American Bar Association (ABA) regulations of legal practice, constitute barriers to entry to the legal profession. In this paper, we argue that eliminating entry barriers in legal services would generate benefits that are similar to those resulting from deregulating U.S. network industries (i.e., transportation, communications, and energy.) Specifically, prices would fall as competition from incumbent firms and new entrants intensifies; in the long run, competitive forces and operating freedom would incentivize firms to produce innovations that significantly benefit consumers and the broader economy.
J44|STEM Training and Early Career Outcomes of Female and Male Graduate Students: Evidence from UMETRICS Data Linked to the 2010 Census|Women are underrepresented in science and engineering, with the underrepresentation increasing in career stage. We analyze gender differences at critical junctures in the STEM pathway--graduate training and the early career--using UMETRICS administrative data matched to the 2010 Census and W-2s. We find strong gender separation in teams, although the effects of this are ambiguous. While no clear disadvantages exist in training environments, women earn 10% less than men once we include a wide range of controls, most notably field of study. This gap disappears once we control for women's marital status and presence of children.
J44|The Returns to Medical School: Evidence from Admission Lotteries|We exploit admission lotteries to estimate the returns to medical school in the Netherlands. Using data from up to 22 years after the lottery, we find that in every single year after graduation doctors earn at least 20 percent more than people who end up in their next-best occupation. Twenty-two years after the lottery the earnings difference is almost 50 percent. Only a small fraction of this difference can be attributed to differences in working hours and human capital investments. The returns do not vary with gender or ability, and shift the entire earnings distribution. (JEL D44, I11, I26, J24, J31, J44)
J44|Physicians Treating Physicians: Information and Incentives in Childbirth|This paper provides new evidence on the interaction between patient information and physician financial incentives. Using rich microdata on childbirth, we compare the treatment of physicians when they are patients with that of comparable nonphysicians. We also exploit the presence of HMO-owned hospitals to determine how the treatment gap varies with providers' financial incentives. Consistent with induced demand, physicians are approximately 10 percent less likely to receive a C-section, with only a quarter of this effect attributable to differential sorting. While financial incentives affect the treatment of nonphysicians, physician-patients are largely unaffected. Physicians also have better health outcomes. (JEL D83, I11, J16, J44)
J44|How Do Providers Respond to Changes in Public Health Insurance Coverage? Evidence from Adult Medicaid Dental Benefits|This study evaluates how large changes in public health insurance coverage affect provider behavior and patient wait times by analyzing a common type of primary care: dental services. When states expand coverage of dental services to adult Medicaid beneficiaries, dentists' participation in Medicaid increases and dentists see more publicly insured patients. Dentists supply more visits but only modestly increase the amount of time spent working. They achieve this in part by making greater use of dental hygienists. Wait times increase modestly, with the largest increases in wait times observed in states with restrictive scope of practice laws governing dental hygienists.
J44|Affirmative Action and the Quality-Fit Trade-Off|"This paper reviews the literature on affirmative action in undergraduate education and law schools, focusing especially on the trade-off between institutional quality and the fit between a school and a student. We discuss the conditions under which affirmative action for underrepresented minorities (URM) could help or harm their educational outcomes. We provide descriptive evidence on the extent of affirmative action in law schools, as well as a critical review of the contentious literature on how affirmative action affects URM law-school student performance. Our review then discusses affirmative action in undergraduate admissions, focusing on the effects such admissions preferences have on college quality, graduation rates, college major, and earnings. We conclude by examining the evidence on ""percent plans"" as a replacement for affirmative action. ( JEL I23, I26, I28, J15, J31, J44, K10)"
J44|Market and political power interactions in Greece: an empirical investigation|Abstract In this paper, using a dynamic panel of 21 OECD countries, we find that, unlike the other OECD countries in the sample, wage setting institutions, competition conditions, public finances, and external imbalances can account for the behavior of the public sector wage premium (WPR) and the self-employed taxation gap (TSL) in Greece and to a lesser extent in Spain and Portugal, in a manner that is consistent with an “insider–outsider society” (IOS). That is, a politicoeconomic system characterized by groups of selfish elites that enjoy market power but at the same time cooperate in influencing government in protecting and promoting their collective self-interests. Then, we find that for Greece as well as Spain and Portugal, WPR and TSL have an adverse effect on both TFP and output growth. Finally, the effect of WPR and TSL on the business cycle (shock propagation mechanism) is investigated via a panel VAR analysis. Again, impulse response function analysis suggests that the shock propagation mechanisms of WPR and TSL for Greece and to a lesser extent for Spain and Portugal are quite different from the rest of the OECD countries. For example, in Greece, unlike the other OECD countries in the sample, a positive temporary shock in WPR causes TFP and output to fall and the public and current account deficits to increase. We take the TFP/output growth and the shock propagation mechanism results to provide strong evidence that Greece and to a lesser extent Spain and Portugal behave like IOS. For that matter, these results are important in order to understand the Greek crisis.
J44|Are returns to research quality lower in agricultural economics than in economics?| We compare effects of research quality and quantity on the salary of academics in agricultural economics and economics departments of the same universities. Agricultural economists get a significantly lower payoff to research quality, whether measured in terms of citations or in terms of quality-weighted journal output (based on nine different weighting schemes). Instead, salary in these agricultural economics departments appears to depend on the quantity of journal articles. In contrast, article counts have no independent effect on economist salaries. One-third of academics in the agricultural economics departments studied here have doctoral training in economics; these very different reward structures for research may cause frustration for these faculty due to the muted returns to research quality that agricultural economics departments seem to offer.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J44|Factors affecting student load debt accrued by graduates of US veterinary medical colleges| Graduates of colleges of veterinary medicine have experienced a marked increase in acquired student loan debt. The mean inflation-adjusted student loan debt for graduating veterinarians has increased at an average annual rate of 5.11% over the period of 2002-2014 while starting salaries have decreased at a rate of 0.9% annually. This research aims to identify the factors associated with the increase in student loan debt accumulation by veterinarians in the face of relatively unchanged wages. We utilize data collected from the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) fourth-year veterinary student surveys for 2001 through 2014. The variable of interest is the inflation-adjusted total student loan debt attributed to the study of veterinary medicine. Due to the nature of debt totals, there are a large number of observations of zero in the data (14%). We employ a two-part hurdle model to identify the factors affecting both the decision to borrow and the amount which was borrowed. We find that the majority of the annual increase in debt can be explained by increases in tuition costs and an increase in the share of students paying out-of-state tuition, with some of the change attributable to the increasing share of veterinary students that are women.
J44|Los determinantes y la persistencia de la sobreeducación en el Perú|El presente estudio analiza los determinantes de la sobreeducación y su permanencia en el tiempo. Por un lado, con respecto al primer punto, se encuentra que el hecho de haber estudiado en una universidad de buena calidad reduce la probabilidad de experimentar el fenómeno de la sobreeducación en casi seis puntos porcentuales. Asimismo, haber estudiado en una universidad pública disminuye dicha posibilidad en más de ocho puntos porcentuales. Por otro lado, con respecto a la persistencia del problema, se encontró́ que en promedio 77% de trabajadores sobreeducados continúan en la misma situación de un año a otro. En general, la persistencia es alta pues más del 50% continúa sobreeducado incluso luego de siete años de permanencia en el mercado laboral.
J44|Revisiting Gladwell'S Hockey Players: Influence Of Relative Age Effects Upon Earning The Phd|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12114-abs-0001""> We examine the influence of relative age effects (RAE) upon specific factors related to earning a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD): age at degree, time to degree, and salary upon completion. Drawing on the 2010 Survey of Earned Doctorates, we find no significant influence of RAE. Specifically, when controlling for discipline-specific variation, we find no influence of RAE on the age of people earning the PhD and no influence on post-graduate salary. However, we estimate a relative salary loss due to redshirting of over $138,000 in lifetime earnings for individuals who earn the PhD. To the extent that earning the PhD is considered an outstanding achievement, our findings support the view that redshirting is unnecessary and costly. (JEL D01, D12, I20, I28, J24, J44)"

Contrary to the common assumption that couples who do not live together break up, we find that living apart is a viable solution to location problems in the first year after graduate school. Surprisingly, PhDs facing moderate location problems are more likely than those facing severe location problems to make career sacrifices on behalf of their relationship; PhDs facing severe location problems are more likely to live apart.

J44|In-Season Head-Coach Dismissals And The Performance Of Professional Football Teams|" type=""main"" xml:id=""ecin12280-abs-0001""> This paper studies the causes and consequences of in-season changes of the head-coach of association football teams. We exploit data from the highest level of Dutch professional football during 14 successive seasons. An in-season change of the head-coach depends on recent match results and the difference between actual results and expectations as measured using bookmaker data. We find that, after the head-coach has been replaced, teams perform better than before. However, the performance is also better than before for a control group of coach replacements that did not occur. From this we conclude that replacement of head-coaches does not improve team performance. (JEL J44, L83)"
J44|The Impact Of Managerial Change On Performance: The Role Of Team Heterogeneity|When a key responsibility of a manager is to allocate more or less attractive tasks to subordinates, these subordinates have an incentive to work hard and demonstrate their talents. As a new manager is less well acquainted with these talents this incentive mechanism is reinvigorated after a management change – but only when the team is sufficiently homogenous. Otherwise, a new manager quickly makes similar choices as the old one did. We investigate this hypothesis using a large data set on coach dismissals in the German football league where the selection of players is indeed a key task of the coach. Indeed, we find substantial evidence that coach replacements enhance team performance (only) in homogenous teams. Moreover, from a methodological point of view, we argue that there is typically a negative selection bias when evaluating succession effects, which might reconcile previous findings of no (or even negative) effects with the vast number of dismissals observed in reality.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J44|Analysing the extent and effects of occupational regulation in New Zealand| This study is the first to our knowledge to document the extent and correlates of occupational regulation in New Zealand. Using data from the Census and the Survey of Working Life, we estimate that 28% of workers’ primary jobs are affected by occupational regulation. This is lower than the 35% reported for the US but identical to UK estimates of 28%. Furthermore, we find that holding observable factors constant, occupational regulation is associated with a wage premium of 5%. This is lower than the 18% licensing premium found for the US but within the range of estimates for the UK.
J44|Wage Flexibility and Employment Fluctuations: Evidence from the Housing Sector|Many economists suspect that downward nominal wage rigidities in ongoing labor contracts are an important source of employment fluctuations over the business cycle but there is little direct empirical evidence on this conjecture. This paper compares three occupations in the housing sector with very different wage setting institutions, real estate agents, architects, and construction workers. I study the wage and employment responses of these occupations to the housing cycle, a proxy for labor demand shocks to the industry. The employment of real estate agents, whose pay is far more flexible than the other occupations, indeed reacts less to the cycle than employment in the other occupations. However, unless labor demand elasticities are large, the estimates do not suggest that the level of wage flexibility enjoyed by real estate agents would buffer employment fluctuations in response to demand shocks by more than 10 to 20 percent compared to completely rigid wages.
J44|Taking care of the budget? Practice-level outcomesduring commissioning reforms in England|I investigate whether vesting budgets with doctors impacts treatment decisions and patients outcomes by exploiting the transitional phase of major recent health care reforms in England that passed budgets to consortia of General Practitioners (GPs). Applying difference-indifference techniques to balanced treatment and control groups, I find that practices becoming actively responsible for consortia budgets engaged in cost-saving prescribing and referral behaviour but that patients in these practices experienced a relative deterioration in the quality of their care. I discuss a number of explanations for these results, including that the reforms incentivised doctors to reduce quality in order to save cash or that they simply distracted those doctors most closely involved.

J44|Characterization of job stress for the employed population that lives in Cali: an empirical study using multiple correspondence analysis and a model generalized multinomial ordered|The economic contexts where the people (employees) participante as part of labor market affect directly the development of their skills and abilities. In economic theory this situation is motivated by the compensation that the employees obtain for their efforts in despite of their leisure time. However, there are situations in the organizational context that could affect individual's performance like professional stress.This research aims to analize, by means of qualitative and quantitative methods, social, economic and demographic factors associated with professional stress in the working population living in Cali. For this purpose, two econometric techniques are proposed: The first one refers to multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) that is used to construct a professional sress Index (PSI) taking into consideration a collection of variables that have been preliminarily selected. The second one technique is used for estimating an ordinal multinomial model that could be useful to characterize the employees who has a high profile professional stress. The database used for the statistical and econometric analysis came from the Employment and Quality of Life Survey applied in the city of Cali by the Ministry of Labour and the Municipality of Santiago de Cali in the period November 2012 - January 2013.
J44|Jura-Prädikat hat eine stark positive Signalwirkung auf das Einkommen|Higher education is usually associated with a higher income. While this effect can be verified by examining the extent and duration of an individual’s education and training, the question of whether better academic performance is also linked with higher income is more difficult to answer. This weekly report examines whether law students achieve honors in their first state examination affects their future income. The analysis shows a clear, statistically detectable positive effect relatively early in the lawyers’ career profiles. Interestingly, the effect remains significant even when control variables such as school grades and parental occupations are taken into account. Six years after the first state examination, the income growth connected solely to the achievement of honors amounted to 13 to 14 percent. The special signal effect of graduating with honors is apparent in the field of law: the fact that good academic performance does not have a demonstrable effect on income in other professions is evidence of this. Essentially, a connection between graduating with honors and a higher income is to be expected; what is surprising is the magnitude of this relationship. Höhere Bildung wird gemeinhin mit einem höheren Einkommen assoziiert. Während sich dieser Effekt für zusätzliche Schul- und Ausbildungsjahre leicht nachweisen lässt, ist die Frage, ob auch bessere Studienleistungen mit einem höheren Verdienst verbunden sind, nicht so einfach zu beantworten. Dieser Wochenbericht untersucht den Effekt des Prädikats im ersten Staatsexamen, das Studierende der Rechtswissenschaften erlangen können, auf das Einkommen. Die Analyse zeigt einen deutlichen, statistisch nachweisbaren positiven Effekt schon relativ früh in der Erwerbsbiografie der Juristinnen und Juristen. Interessanterweise bleibt der Effekt auch dann bedeutsam, wenn in die statistische Analyse Kontrollvariablen wie die Abiturnote und die elterlichen Berufe einfließen. Sechs Jahre nach dem ersten Staatsexamen beträgt der Einkommenszuwachs allein durch das Prädikat 13 bis 14 Prozent. Hier zeigt sich die besondere Signalwirkung des Prädikatsexamens. Dies wird insbesondere dadurch deutlich, dass sich bei anderen Berufsgruppen für gute Studienleistungen keine besonderen Einkommenseffekte nachweisen lassen. Grundsätzlich ist ein Zusammenhang zwischen einem Prädikat und einem höheren Einkommen zu erwarten. Überraschend ist aber die Größenordnung des Effekts.
J44|"Berufsgruppe ""Erzieherin"": zufrieden mit der Arbeit, aber nicht mit der Entlohnung"|The expansion of day care in Germany over the past few years has led to a corresponding growth in the number of childcare workers. How satisfied are these employees with their work? Do they feel overburdened? And how do their feelings differ from those working in comparable professions? The present study attempts to answer these questions using data from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). The data show that childcare workers are quite satisfied with their work, reporting satisfaction levels as high as those of primary school teachers. When it comes to pay, however, they are more dissatisfied than those in the comparison groups. Although they do not feel burdened by many aspects of their work, the balance between effort and reward is poorer than it is among most of the other professional groups. More investment in early education could be worthwhile, because if childcare workers are more satisfied with their pay and find their jobs less stressful, the quality of education will increase overall. This will ultimately be an investment in current and future human potential. Erzieherinnen und Erzieher haben mit dem Ausbau der Kindertagesbetreuung in Deutschland in den vergangenen Jahren massiv an Bedeutung gewonnen. Wie zufrieden ist diese Berufsgruppe mit ihrer Arbeit? Wie stark fühlt sie sich belastet? Und wie unterscheidet sie sich diesbezüglich von vergleichbaren Berufsgruppen? Diesen Fragen geht die vorliegendeStudie auf Basis von Daten des Sozio-oekonomischen Panels (SOEP) nach. Es zeigt sich, dass Erzieherinnen mit ihrer Arbeit durchaus zufrieden sind – sie erreichen ähnlich hohe Zufriedenheitswerte wie Grundschullehrerinnen. Mit ihrem Einkommen sind sie allerdings unzufriedener als die meisten Vergleichsgruppen. Obwohl sie sich in ihrem Beruf in vielen Bereichen nicht überdurchschnittlich belastet fühlen, ist ihre Balance zwischen beruflicher Belohnung und Verausgabung schlechter als in den meisten anderen Berufsgruppen. MehrInvestitionen in den Bereich der frühen Bildung könnten sich lohnen, wenn dadurch Erzieherinnen beispielsweise ihre Entlohnung als angemessener und die Arbeitsintensität als weniger belastend empfinden und so die Qualität der frühen Bildung steigt. Letztlich würde es sich dabei um Investitionen in das heutige und künftige Humanpotential handeln.
J44|Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and analyst forecast properties|We examine whether Directors and Officers (D&O) Insurance purchases around equity issues is priced information. Our results support the managerial opportunism hypothesis that the purchase of insurance is a signal of increased litigation risk and agency costs. At the time of equity issues, financial analysts are less optimistic about the future earnings of firms that purchase the insurance in comparison to firms that do not purchase it. We also find that financial analysts’ optimism is less pronounced for insured firms that increase their coverage. These results are robust to different measures of financial analysts’ forecasts and other checks.
J44|Costly interviews|In this paper, we show how the interaction between costly screening and competition in decentralized markets may prevent efficient matching. We examine this phenomenon in a simple dynamic model of a professional labor market, where firms can pay a cost to interview applicants who have private information about their own ability. Inefficiencies arise when a firm decides not to interview potentially able candidates since it infers that sufficiently good candidates will be hired by more productive firms. This effect is robust to changes in the information structure of the market, but it can be mitigated by subsidizing screening costs.
J44|Measuring the relative pay of school teachers in Latin America 1997–2007|How much are teachers paid in comparison to those in other professions in Latin America? How have these differences evolved in recent years? Is teachers’ underpayment more pronounced in certain segments of the labor markets? This paper documents answers for those questions using data for thirteen Latin-American countries circa 1997 and circa 2007. After controlling the earnings differentials by observable characteristics we find that teachers are underpaid vis-à-vis other professionals and technicians in Latin America both, circa 1997 and circa 2007; and both, at their main and secondary jobs. We document a decrease in the earnings gap during the decade of analysis, mostly attributed to a general trend in gap reduction rather than as a result of teachers’ improvements on their observable characteristics. The earnings gap shows important heterogeneities, across countries and along the earnings distributions. Additionally, using information from the main and secondary jobs we find that individual penalties for teachers go beyond their observable characteristics.
J44|Dynasties in professions and the role of rents and regulation: Evidence from Italian pharmacies|This paper provides causal evidence concerning the role of rents in explaining dynasties in professions. It focuses on the Italian pharmacist labor market, and exploits discontinuities (established by law) in the relationship between the number of pharmacies that should serve a city and the population. Using a regression discontinuity design, it shows that a reduction in rent, proxied by the pharmacy-to-population ratio, has a significant and negative impact on the propensity of pharmacists' children to follow their parents' career. In contrast, pharmacy rents do not affect the career choices of non-pharmacists' children, who face higher entry barriers (i.e. they do not inherit the family business). Further evidence shows that rents and lower exposure to competition are associated with stronger family ties also among other professions and within firms.
J44|Relations between the professional backgrounds of independent directors in state-owned enterprises and corporate performance|The article analyzes how the professional backgrounds of independent directors (hereinafter IDs) in state-owned enterprises (hereinafter SOEs) influence corporate performance by collecting and analyzing publicly available data on listed companies. After differentiating between the “nominal professional backgrounds” and “real professional backgrounds” of IDs, we find that more than 85% of IDs have backgrounds in “the party-state system”. Based on IDs' “real professional backgrounds”, IDs' proportion of board seats is negatively correlated with corporate performance, indicating that IDs from “the party-state system” background did not play a positive and effective role in helping companies improve their corporate performance. Additional deep, broad analysis shows that the diversification of IDs' backgrounds in SOEs is positively correlated with corporate performance. Additionally, an SOE that has dissenting IDs or IDs with “different voices” achieves better corporate performance. Therefore, reducing the number of IDs from “the party-state system” and focusing more on IDs' professionalism and background diversity should be considered.
J44|Compensation and performance in Major League Baseball: Evidence from salary dispersion and team performance|This study examines the relation between compensation and performance in Major League Baseball (MLB), focusing on salary dispersion and team performance based on 1985–2013 MLB data. We examine whether the tournament theory or the team-cohesiveness hypothesis dominates the relationship. We also use the relative position of team payroll as one of the control variables and compare our findings with the results based on the absolute level of team payroll. This study applies a dynamic panel estimation approach. Our evidence overall supports the team-cohesiveness hypothesis over the tournament theory. We find that greater wage disparity is negatively related to team performance. Our findings also suggest that salary structure is not a robust incentive design for team performance in MLB. A different treatment of payroll variables alters the role of salary dispersion. When we take the payroll level as a control variable, salary dispersion shows a negatively significant effect on team performance, while it has an insignificant effect on team performance when the payroll's relative position is used as a control variable.
J44|Formación de profesionales para la empresa del siglo XXI|The successive industrial revolutions have brought with them substantial economic and social changes. The introduction of digital technology into industry is currently giving rise to what is known as Industry 4.0, creating new business models and therefore new ways of working. In this context, the knowledge and abilities required of workers are different from those required by firms in the first industrial revolution. The key to productivity no longer lies in physical skills but in knowing how to use the huge quantity of information produced so as to provide the best solutions. Today’s businesses require a new type of professional capable of blending cross-sectoral skills with specific expertise, adapting easily to different disciplines and linking knowledge from different areas («T-shaped professionals»). Universities therefore need to adapt their syllabuses if they are to meet this new challenge successfully.

J44|Offshoring R&D|Abstract This paper explores offshoring of firms’ research and development functions. Our analysis employs a previously untapped and unique Eurostat International Sourcing Survey. The results are easy to summarize. First, the magnitude of R&D offshoring is small. Second, a large majority of R&D is offshored within the enterprise group, in contrast to offshoring outside of the enterprise group. Third, most of R&D offshoring from Europe is directed to high-income European countries, not so to low-cost countries in Europe, China, or India. Fourth, R&D jobs do have been lost from offshoring; however, the negative employment impact has been moderate. But the Eurostat International Sourcing Survey does not allow entangling the full net employment effect of R&D offshoring, which could be either negative or positive.
J44|Essays on Delegated Search and Temporary Work Agencies|Paper [I] models a game, where two temporary work agencies (TWAs) compete to fill a vacancy at a client firm (CF). They simultaneously choose how much effort to expend, based on their expectation of how good their opponents best candidate will be. I then show that this will make the TWAs overconfident, as the rational way of judging your own probability of winning is not looking at the opponents expected best, but comparing how much effort your opponent will expend. Paper [II] examines the misaligned incentives in the temporary work agency sector, where we first look at pure recruiting contracts, that either require payment on delivery, or payment on some specified point in time. We then look at the incentives of recruit-and-rent contracts, where the worker is leased to the client firm. We assume that the better the worker, the higher the probability that the client firm is going to want to hire him/her. If that happens then the TWA will no onger get revenues from said worker, incentivizing the TWA to not always deliver the first match it finds, if it is too good. Lastly we look at how competition can dampen this perverse incentive. Paper [III] models the waiting behavior that can occur if a TWA is contracted to find a worker for a specific time far in the future; the TWA will postpone effort. This behavior is modeled for two types of TWAs; one that is rational and plans ahead, and another that does not plan ahead at all, but instead only looks at the immediate future. I find that the one that only looks at the immediate future starts exerting effort earlier than the planner. After looking at optimal contracts under perfect monitoring and hidden action I provide two extensions. I first show that for the principal to want to delegate search to a rational TWA, the agent has to be better than the CF, by some factor, as it has to make up in efficiency what the principal loses in moral hazard, when the agent waits longer than the principal would like it to. Lastly I prove that it is profit maximizing for the principal to contract one agent and give it a deadline earlier than when the principal would need the worker, and then replace that agent with a competitor if the first one has not succeeded by that earlier deadline. Paper [IV] estimates at the effect of family experience on relative transition probability into the temporary work agency sector. Using register data for all of Sweden we run a bias-reduced logistic regression, where we include various factors that affect the probability of young adults (aged 18-34) entering the sector. This paper ties in to the literature on occupational inheritance, as well as the literature on changing social norms. We find that having had a parent, sibling or partner in the TWA sector increases your probability of entering the sector yourself.
J44|Occupation-specific matching efficiency|"""Based on rich administrative data from Germany, we address the differences in occupation specific job-matching processes where an occupation consists of jobs that share extensive commonalities in their required skills and tasks. These differences can be explained by the degree of standardization (determined by the existence of certifications or legal regulations) in an occupation and the diversity of tasks in an occupation. We find that the matching efficiency improves with higher degrees of standardization and lower task diversity. We discuss the possible mechanisms of these empirical findings in a search theoretic model: as the standardization of an occupation increases or the diversity of tasks decreases, search costs decrease and the optimal search intensity increases. However, the model reveals that higher search intensities can have positive or negative effects on the matching efficiency. We discuss the conditions under which the empirical results can be predicted."" (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))"
J44|The migration of professionals within the EU: Any barriers left?|"""Despite the effort at EU level to harmonize the process of recognition of foreign educational qualifications, the European states differ in their propensity to accept high-school and academic certificates obtained in other EU member states. In turn, a country's higher degree of recognition of foreign qualifications might be an attractor of non-native skilled workers. We provide evidence on this issue using new data on the outcome of the recognition process in every EU country. Estimating different panel data gravity models, we find that the migration rate to a given destination country is positively affected by its propensity to recognize foreign educational qualifications.""

J44|Do Financial Incentives Influence GPs' Decisions to Do After-Hours Work? A Discrete Choice Labour Supply Model|This paper analyses doctors' supply of after-hours care, and how it is affected by personal and family circumstances as well as the earnings structure. We use detailed survey data from a large sample of Australian General Practitioners to estimate a structural, discrete-choice model of labour supply and after-hours care. This allows us to jointly model how many daytime-weekday hours a doctor works, and his or her probability of providing after-hours care. The underlying utility function varies across individual and family characteristics. We simulate labour supply responses to an increase in doctors' hourly earnings, both in a daytime-weekday setting and for after-hours care. Among doctors overall, men and women increase their daytime-weekday working hours if their hourly earnings in this setting increases, but only to a very small extent. Men's labour supply elasticities do not change if their family circumstances change, but for women the small behavioural response disappears completely if they have preschool-aged children. Doctors are somewhat more likely to provide after-hours care if their hourly earnings in that setting increases, but again the effect is very small and is only evident in some sub-groups. Moreover, higher earnings in weekday-daytime practice reduces the probability of providing after-hours care, particularly for men. Increasing doctors' earnings appears to be at best relatively ineffective in encouraging increased provision of after-hours care, and may even prove harmful if incentives are not well-targeted.
J44|Barriers to skill acquisition: Evidence from English training in India|Skill development is viewed as an escape from the low education – high unemployment trap in developing countries. Despite investments in skill development programs, participation and completion rates in many programs remain low. We investigate factors that prevent individuals from acquiring spoken English, a skill with potentially high returns in the labour market. Using data from a field experiment in India, we find that offering subsidies increases the probability of participating in a spoken English training program. Simultaneously, distance to the training center, pre-existing knowledge of spoken English, and past enrolment in a similar course act as significant barriers to take-up. These findings suggest that multidimensional policy solutions are required to overcome barriers to skill development in developing countries.
J44|A Guide and Advice for Economists on the U.S. Junior Academic Job Market: 2016–2017 Edition|This guide, updated for the 2016-17 job market season, describes the U.S. academic market for new Ph.D. economists and offers advice on conducting an academic job search. It provides data, reports findings from published papers, describes practical details, and includes links to online resources. Topics addressed include: preparing to go on the market; applying for academic jobs; the JOE Network, which is the AEA's electronic clearinghouse for the job market; signaling; interviewing at the ASSA meetings; campus visits; the secondary market scramble; offers and negotiating; getting off to a good start as an assistant professor; diversity; and dual job searches.
J44|Stereotype Threat, Role Models, and Demographic Mismatch in an Elite Professional School Setting|Ten years of administrative data from a diverse, private, top-100 law school are used to examine the ways in which female and nonwhite students benefit from exposure to demographically similar faculty in first-year required law courses. Arguably causal impacts of exposure to same-sex and same-race instructors on course-specific outcomes such as course grades are identified using a two-way (student and classroom) fixed effects strategy. Impacts of faculty representation on long-run, student-specific outcomes such as graduation are identified using an instrumental variables (IV) strategy that exploits transitory variation in the demographic makeup of the faculty. Having an other-sex instructor reduces the likelihood of receiving a good grade (A or A-) by one percentage point (3%) and having an other-race instructor reduces the likelihood of receiving a good grade by three percentage points (10%). The effects of student-instructor demographic mismatch are particularly salient for nonwhite female students. The IV estimates suggest that the share of first-year courses taught by nonwhite instructors increases the probabilities that nonwhite students persist into the second year and graduate on time. These results provide novel evidence of the pervasiveness of role-model effects in elite settings and of the graduate-school education production function.
J44|Bankruptcy Rates among NFL Players with Short-Lived Income Spikes|We test for consumption smoothing using bankruptcy data on players in the National Football League (NFL), who typically earn several million dollars during an income spike that lasts a few years. The life-cycle hypothesis predicts that players should save substantially while playing and then have little risk of bankruptcy post-NFL. However, players in our sample begin to file for bankruptcy soon after they stop playing and continue filing at a high rate through at least the first 12 years of retirement. Players' total earnings and career lengths have surprisingly little effect on the risk of bankruptcy.
J44|An Empirical Model of the Medical Match|This paper develops a framework for estimating preferences in a many-to-one matching market using only observed matches. I use pairwise stability and a vertical preference restriction on one side to identify preferences on both sides of the market. Counterfactual simulations are used to analyze the antitrust allegation that the centralized medical residency match is responsible for salary depression. Due to residents' willingness to pay for desirable programs and capacity constraints, salaries in any competitive equilibrium would remain, on average, at least $23,000 below the marginal product of labor. Therefore, the match is not the likely cause of low salaries. (JEL C78, I11, J31, J44, K21, L44)
J44|Back to Fundamentals: Equilibrium in Abstract Economies|"We propose a new abstract definition of equilibrium in the spirit of competitive equilibrium: a profile of alternatives and a public ordering (expressing prestige, price, or a social norm) such that each agent prefers his assigned alternative to all lower-ranked ones. The equilibrium operates in an abstract setting built upon a concept of convexity borrowed from convex geometry. We apply the concept to a variety of convex economies and relate it to Pareto optimality. The ""magic"" of linear equilibrium prices is put into perspective by establishing an analogy between linear functions in the standard convexity and ""primitive orderings"" in the abstract convexity.

J44|The Role of Connections in Academic Promotions|This paper analyzes how evaluators' private information and subjective biases affect evaluations in academia. We use evidence from centralized selection exams in Spain, where evaluators are randomly assigned to promotion committees. Candidates are significantly more likely to be promoted when they are evaluated by an acquainted evaluator, but the source of the premium depends on the nature of this relationship. Our findings suggest that, when candidates are evaluated by their PhD adviser, a colleague or a coauthor, evaluation biases dominate the potential impact of informational gains. Weaker links, on the other hand, may improve the efficiency of the selection process. (JEL D82, I23, J44, M51)
J44|The Long-Term Direct and External Effects of Jewish Expulsions in Nazi Germany|This paper examines the long-term direct and spillover effects of large-scale human capital loss caused by the persecution of Jewish professionals in Nazi Germany. Using region-by-cohort variation in the percentage of the Jewish population as a quasi-experiment, we find that German children who were at school-age during the persecutions have fewer years of schooling on average in adulthood. Moreover, these children are less likely to finish high school and go to college. These results are robust after controlling for regional unemployment and income per capita, wartime destruction, Nazi and Communist Party support, compulsory schooling reform, migration, urbanization, and mortality.

J44|Research on Teaching Economics to Undergraduates|This survey summarizes the main research findings about teaching economics to undergraduates. After briefly reviewing the history of research on undergraduate economic education, it discusses the status of the economics major numbers and trends, goals, coursework, outcomes, and the principles courses. Some economic theory is used to explain the likely effects of pedagogical decisions of faculty and the learning choices that students make. Major results from empirical research are reviewed from the professor perspective on such topics as teaching methods, online technology, class size, and textbooks. Studies of student learning are discussed in relation to study time, grades, attendance, math aptitude, and cheating. The last section discusses changes in the composition of faculty who teach undergraduate economics and effects from changes in instructional technology and then presents findings from the research about measuring teaching effectiveness and the value of teacher training.

J44|The Superiority of Economists|In this essay, we analyze the dominant position of economics within the network of the social sciences in the United States. We begin by documenting the relative insularity of economics, using bibliometric data. Next we analyze the tight management of the field from the top down, which gives economics its characteristic hierarchical structure. Economists also distinguish themselves from other social scientists through their much better material situation (many teach in business schools, have external consulting activities), their more individualist worldviews, and their confidence in their discipline’s ability to fix the world’s problems. Taken together, these traits constitute what we call the superiority of economists, where economists’ objective supremacy is intimately linked with their subjective sense of authority and entitlement. While this superiority has certainly fueled economists’ practical involvement and their considerable influence over the economy, it has also exposed them more to conflicts of interests, political critique, even derision.

J44|How Economics Faculty Can Survive (and Perhaps Thrive) in a Brave New Online World|"The academy in which we toil is moving rapidly towards a greater role for online delivery of higher education, and both fans and skeptics offer strong reasons to believe this technological shock will have substantial disruptive effects on faculty. How can we as economic educators continue to provide sufficient value-added to justify our role in a world where much of what we now do is effectively being automated and commoditized? In this brave new online world, many successful and resilient faculty will add value (and differentiate their product) not by producing costly and elaborate multimedia lectures in which they become a superstar professor-celebrity, but rather through careful, clever, and innovative choices regarding both the adoption of the online content of other providers and the forms of online interactions they integrate into their course designs. Possible forms of faculty-to-student and student-to-student interactions run the digital gamut from discussion boards and electronic testing to peer assessments, games and simulations, and virtual office hours. This article explores basic descriptive and prescriptive questions economic educators and their administrators are likely to face as the online education tide rises. For example, how much does it cost to develop online content and how much time does it take? What are the key ""ingredients"" for a pedagogically sound online course? Throughout, I will draw on both the extant literature as well as my own experience at the University of California, Irvine, where the online evolution is advancing rapidly.

J44|Escolha ocupacional pela carreira de professor da Educação Básica: uma resenha com ênfase na situação atual no Brasil|This paper contains a survey of the literature on attracting and repelling factors associated with the teacher profession, with an emphasis on the current situation in Brazil. It is composed of three main sections, devoted to: a synthesis of the most important theoretical developments, an appraisal of selected international empirical evidence, and a detailed analysis of the available literature (essentially empirical) concerning the relative attractiveness of the teacher profession in Brazil. The main conclusion is that the perception of compensation (initial wage and career perspectives) is the key variable to attract and maintain teachers in the profession elsewhere and in Brazil. Other variables also play important roles, such as: the relative odds of becoming unemployed as a teacher as compared to alternative occupations, intangible preferences (“vocation”) in specific contexts, the extent to which it is possible to reconcile labor market and family concerns (esp. childbearing) and a series of other, non-pecuniary, pros and cons of the teacher profession vis-à-vis alternative occupations. Gender differences in terms of the relative importance of each factor have been registered in the literature. Teachers are not well paid in Brazil and their social status is definitely low, which might explain why the profession does not attract a large proportion of individuals with high scores in usual proficiency tests. (This paper is part of a broader research which will include a field work to be conducted in April-May 2015 consisting of interviews to a nationally representative sample of Brazilian would-be teachers.)
J44|Litigation in Spain 2001-2010: Exploring the market for legar services|There is empirical evidence of a cross-country positive association between the number of lawyers per capita and the extent of litigation. For instance, Spain has more litigation and more lawyers per capita than most OECD countries. How should this association be interpreted? In this paper we analyse the variation in both variables across Spanish provinces during the period 2001-2010, by means of an instrumental variable approach, to shed some light on the sources of the statistical association between them. Finally, implications of the results are discussed.
J44|Gender gaps in performance: Evidence from young lawyers|This paper documents and studies the gender gap in performance among associate lawyers in the United States. Unlike other high-skilled professions, the legal profession assesses performance using transparent measures that are widely used and comparable across firms: the number of hours billed to clients and the amount of new client revenue generated. We find clear evidence of a gender gap in annual performance with respect to both measures. Male lawyers bill ten percent more hours and bring in more than twice the new client revenue than do female lawyers. We demonstrate that the differential impact across genders in the presence of young children and differences in aspirations to become a law firm partner account for a large share of the difference in performance. We also show that accounting for performance has important consequences for gender gaps in lawyers’ earnings and subsequent promotion. Whereas individual and firm characteristics explain up to 50 percent of the earnings gap, the inclusion of performance measures explains a substantial share of the remainder. Performance measures also explain a sizeable share of the gender gap in promotion.
