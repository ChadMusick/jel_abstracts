B13|Note sur quelques limites de la méthodologie de Pareto et ses interprétations|: L'article évalue les limites de la méthodologie que Pareto applique à l'économie et à la sociologie. La première partie revisite les fondements sur lesquels repose la méthode logico-expérimentale et des approximations successives que Pareto propose pour les deux disciplines. La deuxième partie explicite les étapes qui définissent l'expérimentalisme de Pareto en sociologie. La troisième montre que les résultats que Pareto met en évidence impliquent qu'il n'applique pas la même méthodologie à l'économie et à la sociologie. La quatrième partie explique pourquoi les formes méthodologiques auxquelles Pareto recourt ne permettent pas la synthèse des résultats qu'il prêtant réaliser.
B13|La conception de l'homme dans la théorie de l'Echange Composite de François Perroux : entre homo economicus et homo religiosus|Cet article réexamine les fondements, analytiques, conceptuels et philosophiques sur lesquels repose la conception de l'homme que Perroux promeut pour définir l'Echange Composite par rapport à l'homo œconomicus propre à l'Echange Pur. Une première partie montre que l'Echange Composite constitue -i- une critique du rationalisme des modèles d'Echange pur marginalistes et d'équilibre général -ii- que cette critique repose sur une série de concepts qui ont contribués à définir le système que Perroux a toujours défendu (effets de domination, luttes-concours, conflits-coopérations, coûts de l'homme, dons et transferts contraints). Une seconde partie met en évidence que ces concepts trouvent leur origine dans une philosophie spécifique à la fois spiritualiste et communautariste qui s'inscrit dans l'oecuménisme chrétien de Perroux et qui fonde sa conception de l'homme.
B13|Theories of value and ultimate standards in Sraffa's notes of summer 1927|The group of manuscripts titled 'Notes/London, Summer 1927/Physical real costs, etc.' (D3/12/3) is recognized as extremely important for the reconstruction of the evolution of Sraffa's thought after the articles published in 1925 and 1926. The present paper is aimed at analysing some relevant passages and ideas expressed by Sraffa in those manuscripts. We shall focus, in particular, on Sraffa's arguments about the existence of two different theories of value, with different aims: one aimed at determining the value of large aggregates of commodities, such as the national product, the necessary consumption and the social surplus, and the other aimed at determining the price of a single commodity, separately from the others. In Sraffa's view, if the values of many commodities are to be determined simultaneously, then the theory cannot dispense with an ultimate standard of value. That idea led Sraffa toward the conception (or the rediscovery) of the physical real cost.
B13|Sraffa on Marshall's Theory of Value in the Cambridge Lectures: Achievements in an Unfinished Criticism|In his Cambridge lectures, Sraffa argues that classical political economy and marginalist economics present two alternative theoretical structures. This was a major achievement reached during the preparation of the lectures. The understanding of these two theoretical structures was however still unfinished: as known, he had already identified the need for simultaneous determination of prices and distribution - a result comprehensibly not made explicit in the lectures; but the critical implications of this result for the interpretation of Marshall's position were probably not yet evident to Sraffa. He in fact still accepted the Marshallian thesis that classical political economy and marginalist economics identified two single alternative “ultimate standards of value”. Sraffa’s failure to also overcome this limitation of the debate on the ultimate standard bears witness to his, albeit critical, initial adherence to the Marshallian theoretical framework. The road towards Production of Commodities was open but still unfinished.
B13|Wechselwirkungen zwischen orthodoxer Wirtschaftswissenschaft und Neoliberalismus|Die fehlende Einbettung der Wirtschaftswissenschaft in die Gesellschaft und ihr soziales Umfeld haben schwerwiegende Folgen. Ein tieferliegendes Verständnis ökonomischer Zusammenhänge ist verloren gegangen, was zu einer mangelnden Analysefähigkeit der Zunft geführt hat. Ein Kandidat für die Charakterisierung der aktuellen politischen und gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse ist der Neoliberalismus. Welche wechselseitigen Beziehungen zwischen orthodoxer Wirtschaftswissenschaft und Neoliberalismus vorherrschen, darauf will diese Arbeit versuchen Antworten zu geben. Insbesondere wird ersichtlich, dass der Neoliberalismus seine Legitimation auf den wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen der orthodoxen Wirtschaftswissenschaft aufbaut. Aufgrund dessen wird die orthodoxe Wirtschaftswissenschaft auf ihre ontologischen, epistemologischen und methodologischen Grundlagen hin untersucht. Es wird gezeigt, wie über Kriterien der Ermöglichung und der Demarkation ein Wissenschaftsbild transportiert wird, welches dem Neoliberalismus seine Legitimation verleiht. In Hinsicht darauf, dass Wechselwirkungen auch eine reaktive Wirkrichtung implizieren, wird versucht darzulegen wie der Neoliberalismus die orthodoxe Wirtschaftswissenschaft prägt. Hierbei wird vor allem das Journalsystem und die Drittmittelförderung betrachtet.
B13|"Die Wirkmacht der ""Liebe zum Markt"": Zum anhaltenden Einfluss ordoliberaler ÖkonomInnen-Netzwerke in Politik und Gesellschaft"|Der Artikel behandelt die aktuell breit diskutierte Frage der Rolle und des Einflusses ordoliberalen Denkens in (wirtschafts-) politischen Debatten in Deutschland.

B13|Das vermeintliche Wissen der ökonomischen Lehrbuchwissenschaft: Ein Essay|Der Beitrag verfolgt die beiden miteinander verwandten Fragen, wie Ökonom*innen zu wissen vorgeben und warum sie überhaupt wissen wollen. Es wird argumentiert, dass sowohl die ökonomische Wissensform als auch die Motivation der Wissenden im Verlauf des 20. Jahrhunderts einen grundlegenden Wandel erfahren haben. Das Wissen wichtiger ökonomischer Lehrbücher der Gegenwart hat mit einem objektiven, dezidiert wissenschaftlich motivierten Wissen nur noch wenig gemein. Ihren Inhalten und Formen liegt vielmehr eine produktive Absicht zugrunde, die auf die Subjektivität ihrer Leser*innen zielt.
B13|'Wage', 'Salary' & 'Remuneration': A Genealogical Exploration of Juridical Terms & Their Significance for the Employer's Power to Make Deductions from Wages|The Supreme Court in Hartley v King Edwards VI College (2017) has confirmed that an employee who refuses to work in accordance with his contract forfeits his right to be paid for the duration of the breach. The decision extends to professional employees paid a periodic salary the principle established in Miles v Wakefield MDC (1987). The present article sheds new light on these decisions by situating them within a broader debate concerning the function of the wage and the proper relationship between work and payment. Drawing on insights from economic theory, and engaging in a genealogical analysis of legal concepts, the article shows how this debate has, over time, conditioned the use of concepts such as the 'wage', 'the salary' and 'remuneration' in legislation and case law concerning deductions. It shows that the legal concept of the 'wage' is closely related to the economic idea of the wage as the price of a commodity, while the legal concepts of 'salary' and 'remuneration' are more closely analogous to the economic idea of the wage as the cost of subsistence. The courts' tendency to confuse these concepts, and to analyse the employer's power to deduct as a right to withhold wages for non-performance of the contract, tells us much about the implicit assumptions underpinning cases such as Miles and Hartley, and how they have shaped the path of the law.
B13|François Perroux : Echange pur contre échange composite - Controverses et enjeux de justice|Cet article examine les enjeux du concept d’Echange Composite que François Perroux propose pour critiquer celui d’Echange pur. La première partie étudie les critiques que Perroux adresse aux modèles marginalistes, néo-marginalistes, d’équilibre général et d’optimalité parétienne pour définir l’Echange Composite. La seconde partie apprécie les concepts qui caractérisent l’Echange Composite (effet de domination, luttes-concours, conflits-coopérations, coûts de l’homme, dons et transferts contraints). Nous étudions les enjeux de ces concepts par rapport aux formes de justice distributive que Perroux envisage pour définir l’Echange Composite par rapport aux théories de la justice de Walras et de Rawls.
B13|Does the Federal Constitutional Court Ruling Mean the German Financial Market is Efficient?|Following the landmark ruling by the German Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe on 7th February 2014 in which they endorsed the efficient market hypothesis, we present evidence on the efficiency of the German financial market. Introducing a new variance bound test based on the Component-GARCH model of volatility to analyse the long- and short-runs effects on the efficiency of the German financial market, we test the price volatility of four markets: DAX stock index, German sovereign debt index as provided by Barclays and Bloomberg, Euro gold index by the World Gold Council and Euro currency index by the Bank of England. Our use of the Component-GARCH-T model highlight two key contributions, the first being the analysis of the efficiency of the market in the long and short runs. However, a more important contribution is the result of our variance bound test highlight the relatively strong acceptance of the efficient market hypothesis in both the short and long runs in all the observed financial markets. It must be stated our research is of importance to researches in both applied finance and portfolio management. The influencing question of what moves specific markets is crucial to market participants seeking market alpha for their investments strategies and portfolio optimisations.
B13|Menger contre Walras|MENGER VERSUS WALRAS It is common to see in the rejection by Carl Menger of the use of mathematics only an anecdotal specificity which differentiates the author, on the form exclusively, from the marginalist analysis of Léon Walras. We show that, ultimately, Menger's rejection of mathematics (of a certain type) is a coherent decision perfectly justified by the vision of economic reality which the author seeks to analyse and by the methods he judges most appropriated. Some tools available today, the tools of complexity, seem well adapted to the thinking of this author and allow his renewal. We propose the broad outlines of a Neo-Mengerian program rooted in complexity economics
B13|From Karl Menger to Charles Menger? How Austrian economics (hardly) spread in France|The father of the “Austrian” Marginalist revolution and founder of the so-called “Austrian School of economics”, Carl Menger, had a mixed reception during different periods of development of French economics. Somewhat welcomed in the early days, he was rather forgotten later on. Even his major works were not published in translation until recently. What is the reason for such a situation? Criticisms of classical political economy have to be understood in their French context. In comparison to other countries, this paper details the case of France, besides showing how later Austrians, such as Friedrich Hayek, found a limited audience. This comparative study of economic ideas in France must start with the reception of the views of the founder and the role and impact of adopting/adapting or rejecting his views by French scholars. What place did they find in French academia? From Carl Menger to a “Frenchified” Charles Menger, how was Austrian economic thought disseminated in France? This essay starts by recalling the Belle-Époque and an astonishing letter by Charles Rist for the Jubiläum of Menger, in which he deplored the lack of translation of the latter’s works. The Austrian School in France is then discussed as pure economics replaces political economy in the Interwar period, with the 1938 Paris Congress of “liberal thinkers,” as the Vienna Circle became known, also comparing issues in philosophy. The paper considers how Austrian theories of “pure science” were received in Paris from the Vienna of the 1900s, at a time of ”Crossroads,” to the present day, through the Postwar and Cold War, until a revival since the 1990s and a rethinking of economic ideas after 2008.
B13|L'opus di Mauro Fasiani|Scopo di questo lavoro non è quello di discutere il pensiero scientifico di Fasiani, ma solo di attirare l'attenzione degli studiosi facendo conoscere il contenuto dei suoi apporti scientifici, perché Mauro Fasiani non sembra occupare ancora il posto che merita nell'ambito scientifico. In questo lavoro viene quindi presentato un profilo biografico di Mauro Fasiani, seguito da una breve analisi dei suoi scritti scientifici disposta secondo i principali filoni delle sue ricerche. Segue una bibliografia delle sue opere e la bibliografia degli scritti riguardanti il suo apporto scientifico. Il lavoro si conclude con la presentazione di trentotto schede, ciascuna corrispondente ad un suo saggio; rispetto agli scritti elencati nella bibliografia, mancano le schede corrispondenti a otto scritti, considerati del tutto trascurabili.
B13|The Rise and Fall of Unproductive Activities in the US Economy 1964-2015: Facts, Theory and Empirical Evidence|The general idea about unproductive labour and the associated with it activities is that they tend to expand and by expanding reduce the investible product and the growth potential of the economy, however little is known about the determinants of their movement. In this study, we take a closer look at the US unproductive labour and activities in general during the long enough 1964-2015 period. As possible determinants of the movement of unproductive activities we consider the economy-wide average rate of profit, the real interest rate and the degree of capacity utilization. The Toda Yamamoto causality tests, as well as the ARDL econometric model, lend support to the view that the unproductive expenditures and activities are determined rather than determine the above variables. Furthermore, the error correction term indicates that a long-run equilibrium relationship exists and it is attainable after the passage of not too long time.
B13|Paretian Fiscal Sociology|This work is a draft chapter for the forthcoming book “James Buchanan: A Theorist of Political Economy and Social Philosophy”, which is being edited by Ricard E Wagner for Palgrave Macmillan. It considers Pareto’s treatment of fiscal issues, first as a middle age economist and subsequently as a mature age sociologist. It establishes that Pareto never regarded fiscal studies as a purely theoretical exercise. Even as an economist, he relegated ‘fiscal effects’ to the aspect of applied economics that he called the ‘concrete economic phenomenon’. Pareto’s fiscal sociology takes his observations from applied economics and subjects them to further analysis using his division between logical and non-logical action, with fiscal effects falling within the category of non-logical action. This chapter reviews those enhancements and subjects Paretian fiscal sociology to critical assessment. While the Paretian episode in fiscal sociology has now long passed, the study concludes by noting a number of its attributes that have continuing relevance.
B13|Thinking Outside the Box: Edgeworth, Pareto and the Early History of the Box Diagram|This study enhances McLure (2017) by considering the significance Edgeworth’s reciprocal demand curves to the early history of the Edgeworth box. In short, it clarifies Edgeworth’s and Pareto’s respective contributions to the development the Edgeworth box diagram by establishing the relationship between the ‘trade’ representations of Edgeworth’s Figures 1 and 5 and the associated ‘allocation’ representations of those two diagrams. A reconstruction of Edgeworth’s Figure 1 is also provided to make the implicit aspects of his treatment of production explicit. A new early history of the Edgeworth box diagram is also presented.
B13|Ökonomische Expertise und politökonomische Machtstrukturen|Aufbauend auf neueren und älteren Forschungsergebnissen zum Einfluss von ÖkonomInnen auf politische Entscheidungsprozesse und mediale wirtschaftspolitische Debatten wird in diesem Beitrag ein eklatantes politökonomisches Machtungleichgewicht unter einflussreichen ökonomischen ExpertInnen aufgezeigt: Es kann vor allem in Deutschland eine starke Dominanz von neo- bzw. ordoliberalen Interessenskoalitionen bzw. -netzwerken gegenüber alternativen, keynesianischen oder gewerkschaftsnahen Netzwerken konstatiert werden, wohingegen in Österreich durch eine noch stärkere Bedeutung korporatistischer Strukturen dieses Ungleichgewicht zumindest schwächer ausgeprägt ist. Auf Basis dieses Beitrags kann argumentiert werden, dass das politökonomische Machtungleichgewicht in der Ökonomik als einer der Grundpfeiler der Persistenz neoliberaler Wirtschaftspolitiken zugunsten ökonomisch Mächtiger zu verstehen ist.

Unsere These ist, dass in jenem Denkkollektiv der Kollektivgedanke ""des Marktes"" enthalten ist, wir zeigen dies anhand grundlegender Werke von Ludwig von Mises, dem Begründer des Marktfundamentalismus, sowie führender Denker des Ordoliberalismus. In diesem Beitrag wollen wir (1) auf konzeptioneller Ebene zeigen, auf welche Weise das Konzept ""des Marktes"" als eine ""Tiefenstruktur"" im Denken unterschiedlicher ökonomischer TheoretikerInnen verstanden werden kann, und (2) andeuten, welchen Einfluss diese konzeptionelle Grundlage des ökonomischen Denkens auf konkrete Vorstellungen zur Organisation von politischen und gesellschaftlichen Prozessen hat."

Das ist mit einem Konzept des Nicht-Wissens für den Menschen verbunden, der angesichts des ""Überwissens des Marktes"" die Fähigkeit verliert, über das Wirtschaftssystem angemessen reflektieren zu können. Damit ist eine Aufwertung des Wissen von UnternehmerInnen und eine Abwertung des Wissens von WirtschaftswissenschaftlerInnen verbunden - mit Konsequenzen für das Konzept der Politik und auf die Art, wie z.B. über Klimaprobleme diskutiert werden. Im Paper werden diese Konzepte in Bezug auf die Absicht von Hayek diskutiert, langffristig die gesamte Gesellschaft zu verändern."

B13|50 años de economía de la cultura. Explorando sus raíces en la historia del pensamiento económico|El artículo tiene por objetivo rastrear elementos clave desde el pensamiento económico que en principio limitaron y posteriormente permitieron el acercamiento de la economía al análisis de los bienes y servicios culturales. La contribución del artículo es doble. Por un lado, se sintetiza cómo se incorporó la modelización del consumo de bienes culturales al análisis económico, a partir de una selectiva revisión de la literatura de prestigiosos economistas en la historia del pensamiento económico. Por otro lado, se describen los elementos que configuran la economía de la cultura como un área dinámica de especialización, perfectamente situada y con prestigio intelectual en la economía. ***** The objective of this paper is to rediscover key elements of economic thought, which first limited and then paved the way for an economic analysis of cultural goods and services. This paper contributes in two ways. Firstly, we show how modelling the consumption of cultural goods was undertaken by economic analysis. In order to do so, we have selectively used the relevant literature written by prestigious economists on the economic thought history. Secondly, we describe the elements that form the basis of cultural economics. These can be understood as a dynamic area of specialization, they are perfectly situated and are intellectually prestige within the economy.
B13|Les droits et libertés fondamentaux à l'épreuve de l'efficacité économique : une application à la politique de la concurrence|La place croissante que revêt l'analyse économique dans le contentieux juridique, y compris dans le contentieux constitutionnel, pose la question de son impact sur les droits et libertés fondamentaux. Ces derniers peuvent être mis en balance avec la logique de l'efficacité. Dans le droit de la concurrence de l’Union Européenne, la mise en oeuvre d'une approche plus économique (ou approche par les effets) et la montée en puissance des procédures négociées (souvent justifiée par des gains d'efficience en termes procéduraux) constituent un exemple d'évolution de la pratique décisionnelle pouvant mettre en jeu non seulement les droits de propriété et la liberté contractuelle des firmes mais aussi le contrôle juridictionnel lui-même. Cet exemple nous conduit à nous interroger sur l'analyse économique de ces deux droits fondamentaux. Nous insistons sur la diversité des approches économiques en la matière en confrontant les approches de l'analyse économique du droit à celles du vieil institutionnalisme et de l'approche autrichienne.
B13|Central Bank Digital Currency and the Future of Monetary Policy|We consider how a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could transform all aspects of the monetary system and facilitate the systematic and transparent conduct of monetary policy. In particular, we find that CBDC can serve as a practically costless medium of exchange, secure store of value, and stable unit of account. To achieve these criteria, CBDC would be account-based and interest-bearing, and the monetary policy framework would foster true price stability.
B13|The Neoclassicals' Conundrum: If Adam Smith Is the Father of Economics, It Is a Bastard Child|Neoclassical economists of the current era frequently pay lip service to Adam Smith's theories to certify the validity of natural-laws-based, laissez-faire policies. However, neoclassical theories are fundamentally disconnected from Adam Smith's notion of value, his understanding of the economic individual and their interactions in society, his methodology, and the field of study he afforded to political economy. Instead, early neoclassical economists parted ways with the theories of Adam Smith in an effort to construct economic laws that would validate the existing capitalist order as universal, natural, and harmonious.
B13|Central Bank Digital Currency And The Future Of Monetary Policy|We consider how a central bank digital currency (CBDC) can transform all aspects of the monetary system and facilitate the systematic and transparent conduct of monetary policy. Drawing on a very long strand of literature in monetary economics, we find a compelling rationale for establishing a CBDC that serves as a stable unit of account, a practically costless medium of exchange, and a secure store of value. In particular, the CBDC should be universally accessible and interest-bearing, and the central bank should adjust its interest rate to foster true price stability.
B13|Neoclassical theories of stationary relative prices and the supply of capital|In the traditional versions of the neoclassical theory of value and distribution, the stock of existing capital—understood as either an amount of value or an endowment of capital goods—was taken as given, together with the available quantities of labour and natural resources. This characteristic of the early neoclassical theories is analysed by the comparison with the modern neo-Walrasian models of stationary equilibrium, in which the stock of capital is not considered among the data. We show that the attempt to put capital on the same footing as labour and land—i.e. to present it as a factor of production—led the early neoclassical author to write the zero netaccumulation condition, which was required by the stationarity of relative prices, in the form of a market clearing condition between supply of and demand for capital. The rate of interest was then understood as the price to determine by this market. However, as is well known, the conception of capital as a factor of production—and of the rate of interest as the price for its use—did not work and involved several problems, some of which are discussed in this paper.
B13|The Interest Rate and the Length of Production: A Comment|Machaj (2015) does a great service in pointing out a key assumption, heretofore unaddressed, in Filleule (2007) and Hülsmann (2010). Machaj errs, however, in stating that who saves will have an ambiguous effect on the interest rate and that where savings are directed can have ambiguous effects on the length of production. In this brief comment I will first show that who saves will have no effect on the interest rate. I then turn my attention to what it means to “lengthen” the structure of production. Although extended production time or additional “stages” of production make convenient placeholders for increased roundaboutness, they fail to grasp the core concept as it pertains to capital theory – what is it about production processes that makes more or better consumer goods?
B13|The rise and fall of the subsistence fund as a resource constraint in Austrian business cycle theory|Abstract The “subsistence fund” was once an integral part of Austrian business cycle theory to indicate the resource constraint on the ability to complete investments. Early agrarian and industrial economies were constrained by resource availability in a manner consistent with that alluded to by the subsistence fund. This link became more tenuous as the growth of the financial economy in the twentieth century removed the apparent importance of pre-saved goods to complete investments. At this point the subsistence fund came to be used only as a metaphor and was jettisoned from Austrian business cycle theory. The present paper points to the merits of the subsistence fund in explaining the turning point of the business cycle as compared to alternative explanations. It also works out the deficiencies in historical expositions of the Austrian theory based on the subsistence fund, and traces the evolution of the resource constraint at the core of Austrian economists´ treatment of the business cycle.
B13|Други Канон И Маршалов План Као Модел Економске Политике<BR>[Other Canon and Marshall’s Plan as a Model of Economic Policy]|Serbian: Разматрају се основне карактеристике Маршаловог плана као типа економске политике. За разлику од политике саморегулишућег тржишта, која је заснована на (нео)либералној теорији и представљена Вашингтонским договором, политика маршаловског типа, активног уплива државе у привредне токове, заснована је на многовековној традицији и представљена Другим каноном. Обе врсте политика могу се историјски пратити до времена физиократа и меркантилиста, али у савременим условима потпуно адекватно могу да буду представљене плановима Моргентауа и Маршала, насталим за и примењеним у Немачкој после Другог светског рата. Моргентауов план одговара (нео)либералној политици и резултира деиндустриализацијом земље, док Маршалов план насупрот томе одговара политици Другог канона и резултира индустријализацијом земље. Из тих карактеристика следи да транзиционе земље за своје привреде треба да примене економску политику оваплоћену у Маршаловом плану. English: The paper considers the main characteristics of Marshall’s plan as an economic policy model. Unlike the self-regulating market policy, which is based on the neo-liberal policy and defined by the Washington Consensus, the Marshall-type policy, with its active state interference in economic processes, is based on the many centuries’ tradition and reflected in the Other Canon. Both policy types can be traced to the times of physiocrats and mercantilists, but in present circumstances they can be represented through Morgenthau Plan and Marshall Plan, originated after the World War Two and applied in Germany. Morgenthau’s Plan corresponds to the neoliberal policy and its consequence is the country deindustrialization, while Marshall’s Plan corresponds to the Other Canon policy and results in industrialization. Therefore, we deduce that transition countries need to apply the economic policy incorporated in Marshall Plan in order to develop their economies.
B13|Old and new formulations of the neoclassical theory of aggregate investment : a critical review|This paper surveys the neoclassical theory of aggregate investment and its criticisms. We distinguish four main formulations of this theory: the traditional Wicksellian investment function; the Fisherian array-of-opportunities approach (as Witte Jr. called it); the Jorgensonian model; the now prevailing adjustment-costs models. With respect to other papers criticizing the neoclassical theory of investment, we do not appeal to market imperfections. We instead argue that all four formulations present serious theoretical difficulties, even conceding free competition.
B13|"The ""dark ages"" of German macroeconomics and other alleged shortfalls in German economic thought"|"Ordoliberalism is often accused as being responsible for Germany's policy stance during the Eurozone crisis. Ordoliberalism originates from the so-called Freiburg School of Economics, founded by Walter Eucken during the 1930s at the University of Freiburg, which is in fact in Germany. It is however neither true that ordoliberal thought has continuously been predominant and a prevailing idea in German macroeconomic policy, nor that it is responsible for Germany's policy stance during the crisis in EMU. In this paper, we show why a proper analysis must arrive at this conclusion by referring to Eucken's thinking and the development of German ordoliberalism across time in relation to the ""Rules vs. Discretion"" debate and to Constitutional Economics. Although ordoliberalism may have had some influence on the design of EMU, pragmatism, the status-quo and national interests are dominant in German economic policy."
B13|Joseph A. Schumpeter: Ein Pionier der Makrofinanz|Since the outbreak of the Great Financial Crisis in 2007, „Macrofinance“ has evolved as an exciting field for economists. The idea of marrying macroeconomics and financial economics has a long tradition, however, which should not remain buried in almost forgotten books. A couple of seemingly new ideas can be traced back to the work of the eminent economist Joseph A. Schumpeter. His dynamic model of the business cycle is built upon a close interaction between entrepreneurs and banks. Fire-sales of assets, liquidity spirals and feedback loops can turn a mild recession into a devastating depression. Schumpeter’s analysis of the role of monetary policy bears a striking resemblance to contemporary discussions.
B13|Démographie, économie, culture|Relations between demography and economics are complex. Studied from the beginning by economists (Petty, Malthus), demography has not evolved as a branch of economics. During the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century demography has been deeply influenced by biology and culture. Nevertheless by the mid-20th century, demography returned to the social sciences thereby facilitating the analysis of its links with economics (Sauvy, Fourasti?, Becker). Today, demographic studies lean on cultural anthropology and economics as shown in this article through several cases. Finally these two disciplines appear to be complementary, the first one being focused on the long term and the other one on the short term, in particular as regards financial aspects.

B13|[Ensayo] Liberalismo e instituciones: Douglass North y la economía neoclásica|Este ensayo es un intento de comprender los aportes y debilidades de la economía institucional de Douglass North y la forma como esta se relaciona con los postulados básicos del liberalismo y la economía neoclásica. Se examina la teoría de la sociedad propuesta por el liberalismo y, de una parte, la forma como resuelve los problemas de coordinación y cohesión social en una economía de mercado donde se preservan las libertades individuales y, de otra, su relación con los postulados del paradigma neoclásico. Se concluye que, en la teoría de North, se encuentran los elementos para construir una teoría general de las instituciones pero que su análisis se encuentra limitado porque lo incorpora a un marco neoclásico. La razón es que North no desarrolla una teoría del valor alterna. No obstante, su propuesta teórica lleva a reconsiderar los postulados liberales, al tiempo que enriquece el debate económico pues permite tener una visión más amplia de los fenómenos sociales, políticos y económicos.
B13|Some notes on Gossen’s ‘submerged and forgotten’ approach to consumption and time|Hermann Heinrich Gossen (1810-1858) — a civil servant who, in 1854, published at his expense the book Entwickelung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs und der daraus fließenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln — has traditionally been considered a forerunner of the neoclassical theory of consumption based on the law of diminishing marginal utility. It is only with the long-awaited publication, in 1983, of the English translation of Gossen’s book, that his editor, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, started to see in The Laws of Human Relations and the Rules of Human Action Derived Therefrom the roots of a wholly different theory of consumption in which the flow of calendar time plays a crucial and non-trivial role. By going through the works of Jevons, Menger and Walras, the paper argues that the logical and theoretical connection between Gossen’s approach to consumption choices and the marginalist school is unwarranted. Theoretical connections, if any, can be found between Gossen and the classical economists on the one hand and the English ‘liberal’ tradition of John Stuart Mill and J.M. Keynes on the other.
B13|Survival Value And A Robust, Practical, Joyless Individualism: Thomas Nixon Carver, Social Justice, And Eugenics|The aim of this paper is to provide a compressive assessment of Thomas Nixon Carver’s thought - from his early formative years in the 1880s to his post WWII career as a journalist and pamphleteer. The main (albeit not exclusive) focus of this paper will be on the theoretical and philosophical coordinates of Carver’s “new liberalism” - his own definition - and how this broad vision was intrinsically connected with an explicit hierarchical and eugenic approach to human nature. Just as important, what follows is also an attempt to increase our general understanding of the extent in which eugenic considerations permeated the realm of political economy during the first decades of the last century and how, in some specific cases as that of Carver, this influence persisted after the end of the Progressive Era.
B13|Fifty years of Cultural Economics. Exploring the roots in the history of economic thought|The objective of this paper is to backtrack key elements from the economic thought which limited and then allowed the approach of the economy to the analysis of cultural goods and services. The contribution of this paper is double. On the one hand, we synthesize how the modeling of consume of cultural goods was embodied to economic analysis, with this aim we use a selective revision of the literature of prestigious economists on the economic thought history. On the other hand, we describe the elements which form the basis of cultural economics as a dynamic area of specialization, which be perfectly identified and with an intellectual prestige on the economy.
B13|A. C. Pigou and the ‘Real Purpose’ of the 1924-25 Committee on the Currency and Bank of England Note Issues|Brian Reddaway has argued that the title for the Committee on the Currency and Bank Notes served as a smokescreen to hide its real purpose of advising the government on Britain’s return to gold. When A. C. Pigou was invited by Sir Otto Niemeyer to serve on that Committee, there was no mention of gold. Only the title of the Committee was mentioned in the letter. The objective of this study is to establish whether Pigou appreciated the real purpose of the Committee or whether he was misled by the title of the Committee that he was invited to serve on.

B13|Les droits et libertés fondamentaux à l'épreuve de L'efficacité économique: une application à La politique de la concurrence|The increasing influence of economic analysis on case law, even in matters of constitutional litigation, raises the issue of its impacts on fundamental rights and liberties. Within the European Union competition law field, the implementation of the “more-economic approach” (named the effects-based approach) and the growing use of negotiated practices (often grounded on procedural efficiency concerns) provide us with a striking example of how the decisional practice may not only challenge property rights and economic freedoms but also impair the judicial control. This example leads us to interrogate the economic treatment of these two fundamental rights. We insist on the diversity of the theoretical approaches, confronting the economic analysis of law with old institutionalism and Austrian economics.
B13|What are production, work and consumption? Trans-historical re-conceptualisations|This paper argues for trans-historical reformulations of the basic economic concepts of production, work and consumption. The definition of the production boundary by System of National Accounts (SNA) is inconsistent from a scientific point of view. For example, while some non-market and illegal services are viewed as productive, others are not, and services and goods are treated differently. The definition proposed by feminist economics, the so-called third person criterion, is consistent, but in need for further development; furthermore, it is a definition of work and not of production. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether it is possible to formulate a non-eclectic set of logically consistent definitions that could be considered variations of a common underlying understanding across various theoretical traditions – mainly Classical, Neoclassical, Institutional, Marxist, Feminist and Keynesian Economics – of how humans consciously change external nature in order satisfy human needs. Important issues concern how to deal with violence, double counting of transaction costs, human capital formation, non-market activities and causation of final consumption. Production, work and consumption are defined as relations between events, the subject matter and the agent, and in the main definitions reduced to non-economic sentences. Even the utility concept is avoided. First-order logic is used, complemented with modal operators for some of the sentences. In this study, it is shown that production, work and consumption all share the common feature of intentional physical transformation of the intrinsic properties of the subject matter. The object transformed during the productive activity and work must at some point in time be external to the agent. For work, the purpose of transforming an external object must not lie in the transformation of the agent. A productive activity must potentially be able to cause the satisfaction of human needs, or final consumption, which is not a condition for work or required by the third-person criterion. Final consumption involves the transformation of the subject matter that is a final purpose for the consumer or serves as a purpose for transforming the consumer. Using a criterion applied by the institutional economist Cheung to identify transaction costs, this study defines social reproduction as an activity that would not occur in a Robinson Crusoe economy. Social reproduction occurs under an institutional setting. We can further differentiate between coercive and non-coercive social reproduction. In this study, eight different definitions of production are presented. The definition of agent external production is close to the third person criterion, but the possible causation of future final consumption is included as a condition for a productive activity. It is also related to the basic neoclassical model with its assumptions of no transaction costs. The definition of agent external non-coercive production entails that transformations of persons against their own will, whether legally or illegally performed, are unproductive activities. The definition of agent external non-social production entails that all socially reproductive activities are unproductive, and comes close to the distinction made by Classical and Marxist economists of productive and unproductive work. Humanity external production only includes the transformation of non-persons. The three definitions of time scale invariant production entails that human capital formation could be considered productive activities. Market production comes close to Keynesian theory and the present definition of SNA, with the difference that it excludes non-market goods production. The present study also opens for the possibility of unproductive work, for example failed production or professional murder, and productive final consumption that does not involve any work, for example hobby-hunting, play with children or research activity for own pleasure. Which definition of production is applied greatly affects the modelling and empirical application of growth theory and the analysis of the driving forces in economic history. For example, assume trade causes labour productivity outside of trade to increase four-fold due to specialisation, while the share of GDP in total working time increases from nil to half. With the same value added per productive hour and with total hours worked kept constant, the value added of agent external production then records a four-fold increase, while that of non-social production only a doubling. Similarly, during wars the SNA GDP often increases substantially, while the concept of agent external non-coercive production entails that all war expenses are treated as unproductive. Time frame invariant production grows faster than agent external production during expansions of the education system. Market production could serve important analytical purposes, for example to investigate the relation between money supply and inflation, but should be rid of inconsistencies such as the inclusion of non-market goods production.
B13|The Property Economics and the Benchmark Culture of Common Sense: On Markets for Ideas, Ideals, and Ideologies|The very word “culture”, as well as its twin, “civilization”, is one of the richest with respect to both significations and assorted definitions. Common in defining culture is to observe both its immaterial and material dimensions, meaning both the sharing and bonding values and ideas, on one hand, and the artefacts embodying them and resources involved in their making, on the other. There is a multiple relation between the world of ideas, which is disciplined by logical soundness, and the world of things, which is disciplined by property rights. And the interplay of ideas / ideals / ideologies and property rights is a critical one. The capacity of a culture to deliver peace and prosperity heavily depends on the measure in which public space is impregnated with the logic of private property, the mark of common sense. A condensed view of the Romanian realities will round up the principled argument.
B13|Antonio De Viti de Marco, political competition, and the principle of minimum means|De Viti de Marco is generally regarded as one of the most eminent scholars of the early Italian public finance tradition. This paper presents a new interpretation of his thought with respect to the prevailing literature. In particular, an original perspective is provided for three main themes. The first is the consistency of De Viti’s theory of the state, that is presented as a coherent but naïf structure founded on the principle of minimum means and on political competition. The second suggests that his reflections on concrete problems are clearly independent from his theoretical framework, which still presents some features that may have application in modern democratic states. Finally, it is argued that, even if De Viti’s role in spreading the marginal analysis in Italy remains unquestioned, he seldom employed marginal tools in his analysis, and that he was more closely related with classical economics, rather than with the real approach of marginal analysis.
B13|The transformations of utility theory: a behavioral perspective|Abstract The aim of this paper is threefold. First, it reappraises the major transformations which the utilitarian approach to human behavior has undergone in economics in search for a representation by utility functions and later by preference orders. Second, in the light of today’s behavioral and human sciences, an attempt is made to restore some elements of early utilitarianism that were abandoned in these transformations. Third, in line with the interest of the early utilitarians in both explaining behavior and elaborating on its moral assessment, the present paper also discusses some normative implications of the suggested restoration of utilitarian theory.
B13|A Literature Review of the Efficient Market Hypothesis|The efficient market hypothesis and behavioural finance theory have been the cornerstone of modern asset pricing for the past 50 odd years. Although both theories are fundamental in explaining modern asset pricing, they are opposing views. The efficient market hypothesis dictates that the price of any asset depends on the information, while the behavioural finance theory dictates that the price depends on the reaction of the market participants to the information. Therein lays the key to the argument influencing modern asset pricing, does price immediately reflect the information or market participants’ perception of the information. In this paper, we will critical evaluate the theory influencing the efficient market hypothesis. We will review the neoclassical economics underpinning the efficient market hypothesis and the recent empirical evidence. In concluding, we find that although the efficient market hypothesis has difficulties in testing and the empirical evidence is mixed. Yet it is useful as a benchmark for regulators and central bankers alike. However, market participants are homo sapiens and not homo economics; hence there is a requirement to understand their reaction. So in essence leading to a requirement to include the behavioural finance theory, if we are to understand asset pricing.
B13|Revisiting Free Market Utopia: A Hayek-Polanyi Reminder|As pundits discuss the causes and results of the 2008 financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession, economists of various strands—led mainly by Keynesians—are slowly beginning to question the supposed wisdom of unfettered markets. Since Keynesian-liberal disputes revolve around the symptoms of the crisis rather than the historical and structural features of market economies, we thought that a Hayek-Polanyi comparison would be a timely intervention in order to understand the real nature of the subject. This comparison may also pave the way for the creation of an alternative to the vagaries of unfettered markets.
B13|A Literature Review of Behavioural Finance|The efficient market hypothesis and behavioural finance theory have been the cornerstone of modern asset pricing for the past 50 odd years. Although both theories are fundamental in explaining modern asset pricing, they are opposing views. The efficient market hypothesis dictates that the price of any asset depends on the information, while the behavioural finance theory dictates that the price depends on the reaction of the market participants to the information. Therein lays the key to the argument influencing modern asset pricing, does price immediately reflect the information or market participants’ perception of the information. In this paper, we will critical evaluate the theories influencing the behavioural finance theory. We will review the overreaction/underreaction hypothesis and rational bubbles arguments influencing the behavioural finance theory. In concluding, we find that although the behavioural finance theory has difficulties in testing and the empirical evidence is mixed. Yet it does explain a number of anomalies in the financial world and is a more accurate view of the real world. It is also possible to explain market efficiency using the underreaction/overreaction hypothesis. However, a key advantage of using the efficient market hypothesis is that it is a useful benchmark for regulators and central bankers alike. The lack of a uniformed testable model means that the behavioural finance theory as it stands cannot be used as a benchmark. Conversely, the key to the behavioural finance theory is in its ability to explain the movement from the benchmark. So in essence, both models are required to explain asset pricing.
B13|Solving a Longstanding Conundrum: The Uneasy Coexistence of Alternative Equilibrium Conceptions in Walras’s Theoretical System|The evolution of Walras’s theoretical ideas over the last thirty years of the 19th century is highly tormented: from the early outline of Walras’s theoretical system, as sketched in his surviving Geneva lecture notes (1871-72), through the various editions of the Éléments (1st: 1874-77; 2nd: 1889; 3rd: 1896; 4th: 1900), Walras’s exposition of General Equilibrium Theory undergoes a process of ceaseless revisions, which often do not blend with each other, occasionally giving rise to self- contradictory statements. This paper purports to show that such a tortured development can ultimately be traced to the uneasy coexistence in Walras’s approach of two different conceptions of economic equilibrium: a more traditional one, where an equilibrium of the economy is viewed as the outcome of a balancing of forces, themselves unrelated or only barely connected with individual optimizing behavior; and a more innovative conception, resting on the then revolutionary idea that an equilibrium ought to be viewed as a consistent array of optimally chosen individual plans of action. Starting from the first conception, which pre-dates Walras’s discovery of the link between individual demand and utility maximization (fall 1872), Walras strives to progressively enhance the role played by the second, without ever fully succeeding in his attempt. This is the root cause of most of the inconsistencies marring Walras’s Éléments, as well as indirectly affecting the subsequent developments of General Equilibrium Theory.
B13|Mises and Montaigne: A Comment|Ludwig von Mises (1881-1973) baptized the idea that the gain of some is caused by the loss of others as the “Montaigne dogma.” Mises considered the fallacy to be very widespread and sufficiently noteworthy that he devoted chapter 24 of his magnum opus Human Action to refuting the idea. Casto Martín Montero Kuscevic and Marco Antonio del Río Rivera (2015) discuss Mises´ refutation of Montainge´s dogma and claim that he misinterpreted Montaigne on fundamental grounds. They make the further claim that Mises misattributed the dogma to Montaigne. In this short response, we assess their argument to demonstrate that a more complete reading of Mises’s arguments vindicate both his identification and criticisms of the Montaigne dogma.
B13|Neoclassical Economics: The Need for a Reconstruction|This paper examines the case being made by the Real World Economics Movement (RWEM) against the prevailing mainstream economics, including the lack of realism in the teaching of economics resulting from uncontrolled formulation and use of abstract mathematical models that lack empirical validity, the lack of pluralism of approach to economic inquiry, and the basic matter of upside-down application of mathematics in economics. It undertakes a critical examination of the key message and major proposals of RWEM, and goes on to show how they can be harnessed to enhance our understanding and explanation of economic realities. The paper draws attention to the fact that neoclassical economic theories has been inhibited by its ahistorical approach to economic inquiry and abstract formalistic methodology which has made it provide very limited understanding of the complex real world economic phenomena. It, therefore, calls for fundamental reform – in the content, structure and delivery – of economics curricula that universities currently offer and teach students.
B13|Může být přirozená úroková míra nulová? Neoklasický přístup<BR>[Can the Natural Rate of Interest Be Zero? A Neoclassical Approach]|Very low real rates of interest observed in modern economies might be caused by the fact that the natural rate of interest declined to a zero level. This article shows that a zero or a negative natural interest can be explained by the Böhm-Bawerkian and neoclassical theory. Firstly, two senses of time preference are introduced in a discounted utility model, and key determinants of the zero interest rate on the side of time preference are discussed in detail. Secondly, a simple general equilibrium model with fixed intertemporal endowment is presented. Within this model, a decreasing shape of the income stream is identified as a major source of zero interest along with a low intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption. Even in the world of zero or negative natural interest, it might be optimal to be a lender. The last section focuses on the role of marginal productivity of capital in the model, stressing the role of this phenomenon on one side and time preference on the other in lowering the natural rate of interest to a zero level.
B13|Walras on capital: interpretative insights from a review by Bortkiewicz|A review by Bortkiewicz, wholeheartedly approved by Walras, of the second edition of the Eléments supplies an important insight, until now neglected, on how Walras interpreted his own capitalization equations before the fourth edition. The insight helps to explain why Walras was for so long unable to perceive that his given vectorial endowment of capital goods was incompatible with the uniform rate of return on supply price that he was assuming. Walras seems to have confusedly considered the capital endowments relevant for the determi-nation of equilibrium rentals to be the ones resulting from the production of new capital goods, and therefore as having already undergone an adjustment of their composition toward the one required for URRSP. Realization of the erroneousness of this view can explain the unobtrusive but crucial changes in the discussion of capitalization in the fourth edition, and most likely also the introduction of the ‘bons’.
B13|Marx, the Production Function and the Old Neoclassical Equilibrium: Workable under the Same Assumptions? With an Appendix on the Likelihood of Reswitching and of Wicksell Effects|A stochastic approach has been introduced to explain the empirically observed fact that wage curves calculated from input-output systems tend to be nearly linear and that the paradoxes of capital appear to be rare. The stochastic approach allows to justify the simplifying treatment of normal prices common to 19th and early 20th century authors as diverse as Marx (transformation problem), Wicksell (old neoclassical equilibrium), J.B. Clark (neoclassical production function). It is shown that the likelihood of reverse capital deepening is much lower than that of Wicksell effects. With this, the likely characteristics of the wage frontier obtained from a multiplicity of input-output tables are derived. The conclusion summarises what we know and do not know about the validity of the Cambridge critique of capital.
B13|Sraffa on the Degeneration of the Notion of Cost|The paper reconstructs the history of what Sraffa called the ‘degeneration of cost’ as emerges from his manuscripts of the late 1920s. In particular, Sraffa regards the Physiocrats as having the correct idea of cost as being the commodities that allow workers to subsist. The classical economists measured this bundle of commodi-ties in terms of labour, which they also ambiguously viewed as ‘toil and trouble’. Then, the idea of labour as ‘toil and trouble’ was indicated by neoclassical authors as an anticipation of their conception of cost as a sacrifice. Conferring also upon abstinence from consumption the nature of sacrifice, the neoclassical-marginalist theory understood wages and interest as compensation for the disutility of working and saving. Then, cost was ultimately seen as what induces workers and capitalists to produce. This completed the degeneration of cost from the objective-physical conception of the Physiocrats to the subjective-psychological view of the neoclassical school.

B13|Which Economics? Which Economies?|Abstract It is argued that the problems affecting our societies at present are not so much the result of a mysterious disappearance of inventiveness and imagination, as Phelps deplores. It is rather the dramatic change of the socio-economic order propelled by the neoliberal ideology that captured the minds of many people and politicians. This led to a de-regulation of financial markets and a policy of austerity, which triggered the “Great Recession” and stifled innovation. There is also the problem of a mismatch between our measurement devices and what is to be measured in a world of bits and bytes. With the firm establishment and growth of R&D&I in all Western economies the talk about a declining innovativeness ought to be received with suspicion. New materials and rare earths, biotechnology, further advances in ICT and what is called the fourth industrial revolution based on cyber-physical systems can be expected to have an important impact on economic performance.
B13|Price flexibility and full employment: barking up the wrong (neoclassical) tree|This paper (a revised version of Strathclyde Paper 2004-07) questions the thesis (again in fashion) that price flexibility ensures full employment. (See most standard macro textbooks.) We make the point that explanation of unemployment in terms of price/wage stickiness typified much pre-Keynesian analysis, but not Keynesâ€™s theory of involuntary unemployment. Under uncertainty - an essential aspect of the Keynes conception - no set of prices consistent with full employment may actually exist: if so, price inflexibility is not the critical obstacle to the attainment of full employment. Finally, with respect to current use of the AD/AS model, we note that once-rejected ideas have returned to the mainstream and that the strong arguments against attribution of necessarily beneficent effects to price and wage flexibility, which ought to be well-known, seem now to be forgotten.
B13|Chicago Economics in the Making, 1926-1940. A Further Look at US Interwar Pluralism|The aim of this paper is to unfold a rich body of archival material that can shed new light on the nature and evolution of interwar Chicago economics. Specifically, this paper is based on a scrutiny of the PhD qualifying exams on Economic Theory at Chicago from 1926 to 1940. The qualifying tests (supplemented by the courses’ programs) show the existence of two important turning points in the shaping of Chicago economic training. The first one is in 1927, when John M. Clark, the undisputed leader of the Chicago Department of Economics during the heyday of institutionalism, moved to Columbia, leaving open ground to the restructuring of the courses according to a different and more analytical approach already represented in the Department by Viner and, in a narrower field, by Paul Douglas. The arrival at Chicago of figures such as Knight, Schultz and Simons definitely shifted the balance toward neoclassical theory. A second turning point occurred in 1933 when the qualifying test in Economic Theory was divided into two major fields: price and distribution theory on the one side; money and business cycle on the other. This innovation reveals the importance acquired by monetary theory in economic training at a time that is commonly associated with the nurturing of what was later named as the “Chicago monetary tradition.”
B13|Social nudging with condorcet juries and its strategic implications for a paternalistic implementation of LED bulbs|"In the light of irrational behaviour and decision biases leading people to commit systematic blunders, Thaler and Sunstein (2003) presented in their approach of libertarian paternalism the concept of choice architecture, to face the problem of wrong decisionmaking and resulting welfare losses by ""Nudging"" irrational agents. The debate about this approach focuses on its compatibility with libertarian principles, on its welfare-enhancing character and on the knowledge problem about peoples' true preferences. The goal of this paper is to show in part I that with recourse to contract theory, applied constitutional economics provides a justification of both the libertarian character and the profitability of libertarian paternalism. The use of libertarian paternalistic policies for environmental in particular to promote the acceptance and purchase of climate-friendly and sustainable LED bulbs can be justified as a selfbinding commitment induced by hierarchical preferences for sustainability. Referring to the Condorcet Jury Theorem, stating that 1) an expert jury is always more competent than a single expert and that 2) for large juries, group competence tends to infallibility with an increase in group size, libertarian paternalism for ecological goals can be defended against the knowledge problem. In part II an extension of the Condorcet Jury Theorem relaxing its restrictive assumptions of binary choice, homogeneous and independent voters, investigates its applicability and reliability for paternalistic interventions and allows a new perspective in the debate of choice framing paternalism, namely the concept of ""social nudging"" to promote social long-term goals. This paper provides an approach of effective choice framing by applying the CJT and implementing expert juries with the subsidiary principle. It investigates with regard to the support of sustainable ""lightconsumption"" how far institutions should go in shaping choice situations of consumers to promote their welfare."
B13|Vom Tätig-Sein und Güter-Haben|Geldökonomien vermitteln nicht einfach Wirtschaftssubjekte; sie führen zu einer charakteristischen Trennung zwischen Arbeitenden und Konsumenten. Während die klassische Ökonomie die Arbeit in den Mittelpunkt rückte, sollen nach neoklassischer Lehre die Konsumenten durch ihre Präferenzen die gesamte Ökonomie über die Preise steuern. Diese Denkfigur wird nachfolgend in ihrer ideologischen Funktion dechiffriert. Die Reduktion der meisten Menschen auf die Rolle passiver Konsumenten, die andererseits beim Gelderwerb dem Diktat des Eigentums als Arbeitskraft subsumiert sind, prägt sowohl die Struktur der modernen kapitalistischen Gesellschaften wie die Psyche der Menschen. Die Dualität von Tätig-Sein und Güter-Haben entpuppt sich als spezifische Herrschaftsform.
B13|"""Gefangene der Bilder in unseren Köpfen"": Die Macht abstrakten ökonomischen Denkens"|Wie selbstverständlich geht die heutige ökonomische Standardlehre davon aus, dass sie Studierenden eine feste und unveränderliche Sicht auf die Welt vermitteln kann. Doch woher kommt diese Annahme? Walter Lippmann, einer der Begründer des Neoliberalismus, gibt hierauf einen ersten Hinweis: Wirtschaftswissenschaft soll in der Lage sein, Bilder in Köpfen von Menschen zu verankern, die allem Denken und Handeln unbewusst zugrunde liegen, selbst aber nicht schöpferisch veränderbar sind. Anhand dreier Stationen - ausgesuchten Textpassagen von Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill und Léon Walras - zeigt der Beitrag, wie die Wirtschaftswissenschaft hierfür das Denken umformen musste: hin zu einem rein erfahrungsunabhängigen Denken, das seine Inspiration nicht aus der Begegnung mit der Wirklichkeit, sondern allein aus der reinen Mathematik und Mechanik übernimmt. Zugleich zeigt die philosophische Auseinandersetzung mit der Geschichte dieser Wissenschaft, dass diese Umformung selbst weder zwangsläufig noch alternativlos ist. Auch in der Ökonomie lässt sich die schöpferische Kraft des Denkens zurückgewinnen.
B13|Imaginative Grundlagen bei Adam Smith: Aspekte von Bildlichkeit und ihrem Verlust in der Geschichte der Ökonomie|"Adam Smith, der Begründer der Nationalökonomie, hat in der ""Theory of Moral Sentiments"" - basierend auf Ideen von David Hume - das Bild einer moralischen Person entworfen. Diese gewinnt ihre Moralität dadurch, dass sie andauernd Imaginationen über andere und über sich selbst unternimmt. Dieses Menschenbild weist viele Implikationen für die Wirtschaftstheorie auf. Es geriet in der Folgezeit in der Ökonomie rasch in Vergessenheit. Von Smith ausgehend kann die Geschichte der ökonomischen Theorien als Verlust von Bildlichkeit und der Bedeutung von Imaginationen für wirtschaftliches Handeln verstanden werden. Dies wird in einem knappen Überblick über einige Aspekte der Theoriegeschichte geschildert."
B13|ESP – Modern theories in management|Contemporary theories of management tend to account for and help interpret the rapidly changing nature of today’s organizational environment. This paper deals with several important modern theories in management. Among them we can mention: the Scientific Management School, the Classical Organizational Theory School, the Behavioural School, the Management Science School, as well as recent developments in management theory comprising works such as: Systems approach, Situational or Contingency theory, Chaos theory, and Team building approach. This discussion will provide a general description of some of the scholars in each of these management theories and the successes that they achieved in this field of activity.
B13|O wartosciowaniu dobr ekonomicznych/On the Valuation of Economic Goods|The presented study includes an analysis of the category of ‘good’ on the basis of philosophy and economics. Particular attention was paid here to the factors determining the monetary value (price) of an economic good. While achieving the assumed objective of the research, answers to the following questions were sought: What is the difference, therefore, in the interpretation of good as an axiomatic category and good which the economy deals with? What is the basis for the valuation of goods which are the subject of economic analysis? While seeking answers to these questions, an attempt was made to justify the thesis according to which contemporary understanding of the way of valuating goods by the market is limited to accepting the price understood as a variable representing a kind of relationship set in a given time period.
B13|La peur du déclin économique face à l’épuisement des ressources naturelles, de W. Stanley Jevons à Herbert S. Jevons (1865-1915)|From the 1860s, the unprecedent prosperity state of Great Britain faced a new threat : the exhaustion of coal resources. W. Stanley Jevons is the first to clearly emphasize the risks of coal depletion for the economic future of his country. Fifty years after him (in 1915), his son, Herbert S. Jevons, extended his father’s analysis in multiple ways. If these two authors share the same idea that resource depletion is a matter of production costs more than physical shortage, both do not indicate the same channels to avoid industrial decline, a fear that remains a strong feature of the late-19th century British economic thought.

Analyses économiques en France au tournant du xx e siècle|At the end of the 19th century, in the context of a general concern about the alleged « decay of white races », the Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895) opens the perspective of an industrial revolution in China. The paper studies how economic concepts and theories are used to evaluate the possibility of a « Chinese Peril » for Europe, but also how the debate, while progressing both from conceptual and a methodological viewpoints, relies on racialist representations to estimate the relative value of key economic indicators (wage, productivity, initiative, speeds of capital accumulation and technological transfers, institutional efficiency).

B13|Ordoliberalism, pragmatism and the eurozone crisis: How the German tradition shaped economic policy in Europe|German policy during the Eurozone crisis supposedly follows an ordoliberal tradition. In this paper, we discuss to what extent this contention holds and to what extent Germany pragmatically responded to different crisis phenomena. A proper analysis of ordoliberal thinking reveals that the European Monetary Union can be justified on ordoliberal grounds as an economic constitution for Europe in which several pillars supposedly aim at ensuring sound money in the Eurozone. The policies the German government pushed during the Eurozone crisis have been informed by the ordoliberal tradition. In particular, this tradition may explain why the German government has been hesitant to support the call for Eurobonds and has only reluctantly established the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). However, the decisions on the ESM and the acceptance of unconventional monetary policy in Europe show that German economic policy largely responded pragmatically to the challenges offered by the crisis.
B13|The issue of value in economic thought — Part 2: the evolution of views from 1871 until the second half of the 20th century|This paper is devoted to the evolution of views on value propounded in the period from 1871 until the second half of the 20th century. The creators of the scientific revolution in economics called the marginal revolution rejected the classical interpretation of value understood objectively, and developed a subjective theory of value. According to W.S. Jevons, economists should focus only on exchange value, which expresses the ratio of exchangeability of some goods for others. A. Marshall combined the issues of value and price with the theories of supply and demand. J.B. Clark made the value of goods dependent on their effective utility, which constitutes the significance that an individual attaches to satisfying a given need. For C. Menger value represents the importance that individuals attribute to particular goods, serving to satisfy those individuals’ needs. Expanding C. Menger’s views, E. von Böhm-Bawerk and F. von Wieser claimed that the value of goods is determined by their border use (marginal utility). L.M.E. Walras maintained that the exchange value of goods is determined by their rarity. In the 20th century, J.R. Hicks and K.E. Boulding, who based the theory of value on choice theory, and finally, P.A. Samuelson, according to whom the value of a commodity is determined by the point of market equilibrium, dealt with the modification of the neoclassical theory of value. Proposals by V. Pareto, G.K. Cassel and W.M. Zawadzki to remove the category of value from economics confront contemporary economists with the task of searching for, and possibly determining a new source and measure of value of goods and services.
B13|A few remarks on the introduction of the term “marketing” into economic literature|Representatives of most academic disciplines, both at home and abroad, collect theoretical concepts developed by previous generations, thus creating histories of the sciences cultivated by them. In this respect, Polish academics engaged in marketing are lagging behind. The purpose of this study is to establish the “paternity” of the term “marketing”. The authors of publications up to now have claimed that in 1912 this term, interpreted as market distribution, was introduced into the specialist literature by the American economist Arch Wilkinson Shaw. Meanwhile, after conducting studies of the literature, it has turned out that in 1890, and so 22 years earlier, the term “marketing” in the sense of introducing goods to the market was used by Alfred Marshall. So, it was this British economist who turned out to be the author of the above innovation in terminology in the field of economics.
B13|The Origin Of The Sylos Postulate: Modigliani’S And Sylos Labini’S Contributions To Oligopoly Theory|Paolo Sylos Labini's Oligopoly Theory and Technical Progress (1957) is considered one of the major contributions to entry-prevention models, especially after Franco Modigliani's famous formalization. Nonetheless, Modigliani neglected Labini's major aim when reviewing his work (JPE, 1958), particularly his demonstration of the dynamic relation between industrial concentration and economic development. Modigliani addressed only Sylos' microeconomic analysis and the determination of the long-run equilibrium price and output, concentrating on the role played by firms' anticipations. By doing so he shifted attention from Sylos' objective analysis to a subjective approach to oligopoly problem. This paper discusses Sylos' and Modigliani's differing approaches, derives the origin of the Sylos postulate and sets Modigliani's interpretation of Sylos' oligopoly theory in the context of his 1950s research into firms' behaviour under uncertainty.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B13|Methodology of institutional analysis and its implication for contemporary framework of Islamic banks|Purpose - – This paper aims to investigate the possibility of a methodological error made by the concerned scholars and academics of Islamic finance & economics to understand and study the modern framework of financial institutions, where they intend to practice Islamic law of contract. This error has led them to expect something which the institutional modern framework of banks, adopted by Islamic banks (for e.g.), wasn’t designed to accomplish, hence the disappointment. Design/methodology/approach - – This study reviews the literature on history of evolution of banking industry and the corresponding ideological and cultural changes in the European society which drove this evolution; this is followed by a conceptual analysis to identify the institutional components inconsistent with ethos of Islamic norms and ethos. Findings - – After review of history and evolution of modern banking framework, in the light of Hollingsworth frame of institutional analysis, it is inferred that the said framework was designed for a secular, liberal and capitalist society to efficiently and effectively enhance freedom and accumulate capital and wealth, without much regard for equitable distribution of wealth and economic justice. These goals are very much in contrast with the normative premise of Islamic Economics, which cannot be efficiently used to achieve the related objective. This indicates that framework of banking was narrowly understood by the concerned scholars and academics, without considering its history of evolution and intended objectives, before adopting for IBs. Practical implications - – The disconnect between the Western institutional framework and ethos of Islam implies that the concerned need to look deeper and holistically while adapting Western institutions, so that necessary alteration is done in advance, if such an adoption is inevitable. Originality/value - – This study introduces a new dimension for the concerned scholars, academics and practitioners to reanalyze the institutional framework adopted from the West, so that necessary adjustments can be worked out to make the said framework compatible with the ethos of Islamic economics.
B13|Notes in the margin to a recent collection of essays by Luigi Einaudi|In this note, attention is focused on two essays, namely Myths and paradoxes of justice in taxation and Abstract hypotheses and historical hypotheses and on value judgements in Economic science, which are included in Luigi Einaudi’s Selected Economic Essays, recently published in English. The two essays are the most significant among the epistemological opus of Einaudi; thus, this note is devoted to discuss Einaudi’s problem of knowledge in economics.
B13|Non-Euclidean geometry and political economy How Jacques Rueff explained unemployment in England (1919-1931)|This paper provides new perspectives on the French liberal economist Jacques Rueff (1896-1978), especially as regards his early writings on unemployment. We aim to show that Rueff distinguishes the root causes of permanent unemployment in England (1919-1931) based upon an interesting reading of non-Euclidean geometry. Controversially, this enables him to locate the cause of unemployment in the stickiness of the wage/price ratio. Hence, arguing that reality remains inaccessible in itself, Rueff focuses on a succession of variables (price, wage, unemployment), supplemented by his concepts of rational ego and the reasoning machine, in order to approach this reality.
B13|L'apport de Pellegrino Rossi à la théorie de l'offre et de la demande : une tentative d'interprétation|Cet article réexamine l'apport de Pellegrino Rossi à la loi de l'offre et de la demande par rapport aux contributions de Say, Ricardo ou Smith. Il montre que Rossi développe une théorie de la valeur originale qui emprunte à la fois à la pensée classique anglaise et à la pensée continentale française et fonde sa conception de l'offre et de la demande. L'article met en évidence les mécanismes novateurs que Rossi retient pour expliquer la loi de l'offre et de la demande pour diverses formes de concurrence par rapport à ceux que Say ou Ricardo envisagent pour la seule libre concurrence. On montre que Rossi peut être considéré comme un précurseur du concept de prix de réservation développé par Jules Dupuit et de plusieurs formes de raisonnements à la marge qui l'amènent à proposer une analyse de la loi de l'offre et de la demande originale.
B13|Théorie des élites parétienne et moment machiavélien comme principes explicatifs de la dynamique sociale : les limites de la méthode des approximations successives|Cet article explique comment la dynamique de l’équilibre social chez Pareto repose sur le principe de rupture du moment machiavélien. Il resitue ce principe en termes d’équilibre entre virtù et fortuna puis en apprécie la transposition à l’étude de la dynamique de l’équilibre social parétien. Après avoir réévalué la méthode des approximations successives et de synthèse à laquelle Pareto recourt, nous montrons que le principe de rupture du moment machiavélien implique que l’explication de la dynamique sociale repose sur des lois tendancielles qui supposent de remettre en cause la synthèse des résultats de Pareto.
B13|Alienation and rationality—The retreat of postwar socialism|Postwar socialist thought, such as the Frankfurt School, retreated from the Social Sciences due to its theoretical and empirical failures, as well as the discovery of Marx’ Paris Manuscripts. It shifted its emphasis away from exploitation. Instead, it dealt with human alienation in a prosperous world and other more philosophical concerns, such as the nature of rationality. We show that the Frankfurt School is not unique in dealing with these topics. The writings of F.A. Hayek, and, to a lesser extent, James Buchanan, focus on surprisingly similar observations but arrive at different conclusions. We also argue that the modern version of socialism is flawed.

B13|Szűkösség és felesleg a történelemben és a tudományban<BR>[Surplus and scarcity in history and science]|A tanulmány a neoklasszikus közgazdaságtan alaptézisét, a szűkösségnek a termelésben játszott meghatározó szerepét teszi kritika tárgyává. Ehhez felvázolja a szűkösség és a felesleg mibenlétét, egymással való kapcsolatukat és a társadalom fejlődésében játszott szerepüket. Bemutatja, hogy a kisajátítással a szűkösség új formája jön létre, amelyet a feleslegre irányuló termelés táplál. A feleslegtermelés általános módjára vonatkozóan bevezeti a kezdeti előny és a kumulatív előnyszerzés, valamint az osztályfelesleg fogalmát. Rávilágít, hogy a kapitalizmusban a feleslegtermelés módja megváltozott, mert az előnybirtokosok szubjektív igényei helyett a piac specifikus törvényeinek rendelődik alá. Ennek következtében ma már elegendő osztályfelesleg termelődik ahhoz, hogy a szűkösség egyáltalában felszámolható legyen. Ennek szükségességét mutatja, hogy a feleslegtermelés a vele együtt járó szűkösségtermeléssel minduntalan megakad, és ilyenkor különösen kiélezi a gazdasági-társadalmi problémákat.

B13|La Teoria dell'Equilibrio Economico Generale: Walras, Pareto e i Neo-Walrasiani|This paper shows that two different conceptions of economic equilibrium coexist in the theory of general economic equilibrium, as put forward by Walras over the last thirty years of the nineteenth century: a conception of equilibrium as a ‘balance of forces’, on the one hand, and a conception of equilibrium as ‘compatibility of plans’, on the other. Walras, who starts from the first conception in his early theoretical drafts (1871), in developing his theoretical system strives to progressively enhance the role played by the second conception, without ever fully succeeding in his attempt; so that significant traces of the original duplicity persist even in the fourth edition of the Éléments (1900), the last to be published during Walras’s life. Pareto faithfully enough adheres to Walras’s analytic standpoint in his Cours (1896-97), paying himself a price to the ambiguous conception of equilibrium marring Walras’s Éléments. Yet, a few innovative elements, which already peep out in the Cours, will fully blossom in Pareto’s more mature masterpiece, the Manuale di economia politica (1906), whose French edition, the Manuel (1909), crowns Pareto’s theoretical achievements in economics: therein Pareto embraces the conception of equilibrium as a configuration of optimally chosen and mutually consistent plans, eventually succeeding in almost completely erasing the older conception of equilibrium as a ‘balance of forces’. The so-called ‘neo-Walrasian research program’, started by Hicks’s Value and Capital (1939) and fully developed by Arrow, Debreu and other theorists in the 1950s and the following decades, consistently endorses the conception of equilibrium as ‘compatibility of plans’: from this point of view, as well as in a number of related features, the ‘neo-Walrasian research program’ owes more to Pareto’s mature approach than to Walras’s original one, so that it should more appropriately be labelled as the ‘neo-Paretian research program’.
B13|Lawson on Veblen on Social Ontology| This paper reviews three distinct strategies in recent economics for using the concept of social identity in the explanation of individual behavior: Akerlof and Krantonâ€™s neoclassical approach, Senâ€™s commitment approach, and Kirman et al.â€™s complexity approach. The primary focus is the multiple selves problem and the difficulties associated with failing to explain social identity and personal identity together. The argument of the paper is that too narrow a scope for reflexivity in individual decisionmaking renders the problem intractable, but that enlarging this scope makes it possible to explain personal and social identity together in connection with an individual behavior termed comparative value-objective evaluation. The paper concludes with recommendations for treating the individual objective function as a production function.

Their ideas depend largely on how each of them conceive the role and purpose of economic science.
B13|F. A. Hayek'in Bilgisizlik Teorisi Çerçevesinde Piyasa, Denge ve Planlama<BR>[Market, Equilibrium, and Planning within the Framework of F.A. Hayek's Theory of Ignorance]|In this article, the implications of the theory of ignorance developed by Hayek to economic theory and policy will be examined. The theory of ignorance appeared especially in the second period of Hayek’s career and has been applied to the field of economics, politics, and law. Accordingly, people do not have knowledge about the institutions they’ve got today, knowledge which other people have, their actions and the results of them. This kind of knowledge cannot exist as cumulative and the amount of it cannot be enhanced by technological developments. Hence, developing theories, making plans and practices as if we have complete knowledge will not conclude as we desire. This study will discuss and sum up Hayek’s criticizes on market perception, the assumption of perfectly competitive market, and equilibrium analysis of mainstream economics, his contributions to the possibility of economic calculation in socialism and central planning, and recent development in information theory of mainstream economics.
B13|Entrepreneurship: State of grace or human action? Schumpeter’s leadership vs Kirzner’s alertness|Joseph A. Schumpeter developed a very well-known theory of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship, centred on the concept of ‘new combinations’. According to him, innovation and entrepreneurship are destructive elements driving the system beyond an equilibrium position and setting in motion a competitive process, in order to reach a new equilibrium point. Though Austrian, Schumpeter was never a member of the Austrian School of Economics. However, his position as regards entrepreneurship is widely commented on by Austrian School members. In particular, Israel M. Kirzner devoted his research activity to develop an alternative concept of entrepreneurship rooted in Misesian human action and the concept of ‘alertness’. This paper aims to analyze and compare the two positions, in an attempt not so much to stress differences but to find possible common paths for further developments of the concept of entrepreneurship.
B13|At the Root of Economic Fluctuations: Expectations, Preferences and Innovation. Theoretical Framework and Empirical Evidences|The present paper aim to develop the Austrian Theory of Business Cycle in order to conclude that economic fluctuations are unavoidable. The conventional version of Austrian business cycle theory focuses on a temporary imbalance between natural and monetary rates of interest. When, because of the role of monetary authorities in defining the monetary rate, the two values are in a situation of imbalance, the resulting expansion stage is followed by a recession. On the other hand, if instead the expansive phase arises without any interference by monetary authorities but through re-adaptation of the productive structure to a modified structure of temporal preferences, a period of sustainable growth begins that will not be followed by a crisis. The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate, on the other hand, that because of profit-expectations and the combined action of Schumpeterian elements (imitations-speculations and the ‘creation of money’ by banks), even a so-called ‘sustainable’ boom will be affected by a liquidation and settling crisis. What distinguishes the latter situation from the conventional case of imbalance between monetary and natural rates is not the onset or otherwise of a crisis but, rather, its intensity and duration. We will define as natural an economic cycle characterised by a stage of expansion considered to be ‘sustainable’ in the Austrian theory but followed by an inevitable readjustment crisis. In conclusion we will try to link our theoretical conclusions with the crisis emerged in the Western world in 2007, to test the explanatory power of our theoretical framework.
B13|Ludwig M. Lachmann contro la Scuola di Cambridge<BR>[Ludwig M. Lachmann against the Cambridge School]|While in the early 1930s Keynes and Hayek were the major figures in a heated academic debate about money and capital, in which Keynes also and especially involved the Italian Piero Sraffa, it might seem at first sight that the Austrian economist set aside an organic demolition of the ideas expressed in 1936 by his rival in the General Theory. But the ‘Austrian knight’ of a new Vienna-Cambridge debate, in the subsequent decades, was the German economist Ludwig M. Lachmann (1906-1990), a student of Hayek at LSE during the 1930s and later a professor in Johannesburg and New York. Lachmann was one of the protagonists of the Austrian revival after 1974 and the founding leader of the ‘hermeneutic stream’, opposed by the Rothbardian stream. Lachmann, defending Keynes’s subjectivism and expectation theory, revived the Vienna-Cambridge controversy, criticising not Keynes but his followers, in particular the ‘new’ Cambridge School, developed by Joan Robinson and Piero Sraffa. Lachmann’s life sight was to build a new economics paradigm, centred on the idea of market process, expectations and kaleidic society (Shackle).
B13|Homo Economicus and Homo Stramineus|The model of Homo economicus has often been criticized as unrealistic. In particular, it has been found lacking for allegedly assuming that people are selfish, an assumption which is contradicted by both introspection and empirical evidence. The aim of this paper is to show that never in the history of the economic discipline has selfishness constituted the core of the Homo economicus model. In fact, the standard economic model of behaviour which has been used by economists for more than a hundred years is reticent about the motives of behaviour. Critics thus do not criticize Homo economicus but a straw man - Homo stramineus. Three possible reasons for confusing Homo economicus with Homo stramineus are identified: malicious intent, ignorance and an attempt to avoid the tautological model of behaviour.

Algunos economistas heterodoxos muestran la importancia del comportamiento del grupo y la influencia de las organizaciones en la actividad económica, pero el paradigma neoclásico es la corriente dominante. Este artículo presenta una “sociología de la economía” para explicar por qué la cultura imperante impide ver y estudiar el comportamiento de grupo. Recurriendo a la obra de Pierre Bourdieu, examina el habitus, el sistema de creencias y la violencia simbólica contra quienes los cuestionan. Y resalta el apoyo de los intereses comerciales y financieros a esta cultura dominante.

B13|Austrian Business Cycle Theory: An Evolution and Contemporary Condition<BR>[Теория Экономического Цикла Австрийской Школы: Эволюция И Современное Состояние]|The aim of the paper is to analyze the process of evolution of Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ATBC). The theory was very popular until 1940 however after that it was in the shadow for the long years. The theory explains business cycle with fiduciary credit and other governmental distortion which lower interest rates and lead to incorrect capital structure compare to sustainable growth which supported by voluntary savings. ATBC considers laissez-faire as the most effective anticyclical economic policy. The paper presents the contribution to the theory made both by former leaders of the school (Mises, Hayek) and by contemporary adepts of the school.
B13|Kartele w trzech perspektywach: neoklasycznej, behawioralnej oraz etycznej|Celem artykułu jest krytyka podejścia neoklasycznego w studiach nad kartelami oraz ukazanie, w jaki sposób perspektywy behawioralna i etyczna rozszerzają a także uzupełniają optykę neoklasyczną. Główny nurt badań ekonomicznych nad problematyką karteli przyjmuje perspektywę neoklasyczną. Z tej tradycji badawczej wyrasta teoria optymalnego zniechęcania, która stanowi podstawę dla obecnej polityki wobec karteli w rozwiniętych krajach świata. Teoria optymalnego zniechęcania stanowi tu punkt wyjścia dla rozważań teoretycznych. Skonfrontowana jest ona następnie z doniesieniami ekonomistów behawioralnych oraz sądami etycznymi na temat funkcjonowania karteli. Analiza behawioralna pozwala wskazać odstępstwa od zachowań przedsiębiorstw przewidywanych na podstawie teorii optymalnego zniechęcania (zakładającej pełną racjonalność, doskonały egoizm oraz całkowitą samokontrolę decydentów). Te behawioralne odstępstwa wynikają z przyczyn wewnętrznych (dyspozycji decydentów) lub czynników środowiskowych. Analiza etyczna rozszerza optykę neoklasyczną. Rozważania aksjologiczne pozwalają pokazać, że działania kartelowe mają nie tylko wymiar czysto ekonomiczny, ale łamią one normy społeczne i mogą zostać uznane na moralnie złe jako przykłady kradzieży oraz oszustwa.

B13|Dominant market position and ordoliberalism|The ordoliberal distinction between performance competition and impediment competition may improve the understanding of the European distinction between a “dominant position” and an “abuse” of that position. Using a simple game-theory framework, I illustrate the dominant firm as a firm with, among other things, a dominant strategy in performance competition. If, due to the impediment condition, the dominant firm abandons its dominant strategy in the performance competition, then this firm is conducting abusively. In other words, the dominant firm should behave as-if it did not have economic power. It is the formulation of the ordoliberal as-if standard. As I show, such an ordoliberal standard leads to a wider concept of dominance that not only includes the economic domain but also considers the impact of private economic power on the political sphere .

B13|The best horse in the Viennese stables: Gottfried Haberler and Joseph Schumpeter|Haberler knew Schumpeter as a mentor, colleague and fatherly friend for almost 25 years. His well-known obituary of Schumpeter, besides offering an overview of Schumpeter’s work, brings to light a wealth of biographical information, invaluable spadework for future biographers. The obituary draws attention to various facets of Schumpeter’s multi-layered personality and notes the ironical tone in his writings. Schumpeter draws on irony as a rhetorical strategy when he considers the prospects for capitalism in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy. The ironical mode as a common ploy for dealing with disaster is ingrained in the Austrian culture of Schumpeter’s youth. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015

B13|Old lady charm: explaining the persistent appeal of Chicago antitrust| The paper deals with the mysterious persistence of the Chicago approach as the main analytical engine driving antitrust enforcement in American courts. While the approach has been almost completely replaced in contemporary industrial economics by the so-called Post-Chicago view, Chicago arguments still permeate antitrust case law at all judicial levels. Chicago's rise to dominance was allegedly due to the superiority of its economic analysis. Why did the Post-Chicago approach, which is supposed to have a clear analytical edge, fail to do the same? The paper offers a series of explanations: though none is completely exhaustive, each may account for a bit of the story. More generally, the current situation of antitrust case law offers valuable methodological insight on themes such as how economists persuade (i.e., how economic arguments come to be accepted and applied by policy- or law-makers) or the impact of the different professional practices in the diffusion of economic ideas.

B13|Contending Conceptions of Competition and the Role of Regulating Capital|This article discusses two major conceptions of competition, the classical and the neoclassical. In the classical conception, competition is viewed as a dynamic rivalrous process of firms struggling with one another over the expansion of their market shares at the expense of their competitors. This dynamic view of competition characterizes mainly the works of Smith, Ricardo, J. S. Mill and Marx; a similar view can be also found in the writings of Austrian economists and the business literature. By contrast, the neoclassical conception of competition is derived from the requirements of a theory geared towards static equilibrium and not from any historical observation of the way in which firms actually organize and compete with one another.
B13|The Nationalökonomische Gesellschaft (Austrian Economic Association, NOeG) in the Interwar Period and Beyond|The Nationalökonomische Gesellschaft (Austrian Economic Association, NOeG) provides a prominent example of the Viennese economic circles that more than academic economics dominated scientific discourse in the interwar years. For the first time this paper gives a thorough account of its history, from its foundation 1918 until the demise of its long-time president, Hans Mayer, 1955, based on official documents and archival material. The topics treated include its predecessor and rival, the Gesellschaft österreichischer Volkswirte, the foundation 1918 soon to be followed by years of inactivity, the relaunch by Mayer and Mises, the survival under the NS-regime and the expulsion of its Jewish members, and the slow restoration after 1945. In particular, an attempt is made to provide a list of the papers presented to the NOeG, as complete as possible, for the period 1918-1938. (author's abstract)

B13|Ordoliberalism, Pragmatism and the Eurozone Crisis: How the German Tradition Shaped Economic Policy in Europe|German policy during the Eurozone crisis supposedly follows an ordoliberal tradition. In this paper, we discuss to what extent this contention holds and to what extent Germany pragmatically responded to different crisis phenomena. A proper analysis of ordoliberal thinking reveals that the European Monetary Union can be justified on ordoliberal grounds as an economic constitution for Europe in which several pillars supposedly aim at ensuring sound money in the Eurozone. The policies the German government pushed during the Eurozone crisis have been informed by the ordoliberal tradition. In particular, this tradition may explain why the German government has been hesitant to support the call for Eurobonds and has only reluctantly established the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). However, the decisions on the ESM and the acceptance of unconventional monetary policy in Europe show that German economic policy largely responded pragmatically to the challenges offered by the crisis.
B13|Ökonomie und Moral: Eine kurze Theoriegeschichte|Die ökonomische Theorie hat mit Moral wenig oder gar nichts zu tun. In den gängigen Lehrbüchern der Mikroökonomie findet sich in den Stichwortverzeichnissen kein Eintrag zu Moral oder Ethik. Die Studierenden lernen über die Wirtschaft nachzudenken, aber sie lernen dabei nicht, systematisch über ethische Fragen zu reflektieren. Nach der neoklassischen Lehre, wie sie in den Lehrbüchern präsentiert wird, weist wirtschaftliches Handeln nicht grundsätzlich moralische Aspekte auf. Ein solcher Tatbestand ist erstaunlich. Er widerspricht (phänomenologisch) unseren ökonomischen Alltagserfahrungen und (theoriegeschichtlich) einer jahrhundertelangen Tradition, die vor gut zwei Jahrhunderten schrittweise aufgegeben und im 20. Jahrhundert durch dezidiert morallose Standpunkte ersetzt worden ist.

B13|Agricultura Familiar, seu Interesse Acadêmico, sua Lógica Constitutiva e sua Resiliência no Brasil| The article aims to present particular views on family farm in economic and social thought, suggesting that this subject has been attracting growing interest in the research communities of these areas in Brazil, at different times. The trajectory seeks to highlight the way in which many authors emphasized, in their analysis, the nature, characteristics and fundaments of family farming. The research methodology is bibliographic and guided by economics and sociology comparative analysis, aiming a contextualized historical reconstruction, concerning theoretical and empirical approaches on family farming. This methodological procedure brought as a hypothesis that Chayanov’s theory was seminal for countless approaches, with repercussions into different schools of thought, interested in family farming research. In addition, the research method also permits to conjecture about family farm specificities, to constitute, organize and survive throughout history. The text aims to bring some contribution to the current debate on the role and the importance of family farming in the Brazilian countryside, particularly on its resilience in a scenario of productive concentration and rural depopulation. It also suggests that the quality of this discussion depends on: 1) advances in the conceptual area, 2) more empirical research and 3) new looks on sectorial and regional diversity in Brazil and its influence on family farming varieties and arrangements.
B13|Why did Wicksell change his mind about the machinery question?|The article investigates Wicksell's change of mind about the machinery question between 1890 and 1900/1901. Wicksell at first sided with the so-called “compensation theory” that workers are not harmed by the introduction of machinery. In his lecture notes of April 1900, made available here for the first time, Wicksell deployed marginal productivity theory to discuss the effects of labour-saving technical progress, with inconclusive results. Finally, in his published 1901 Lectures and in his 1900 article about marginal productivity, Wicksell claimed that the introduction of machinery increases output and reduces wages. His analysis was based on the demonstration that free competition maximizes output, but not total utility. It is argued that Wicksell's change of mind and his mature formulation of the machinery question result from his critical assessment of the then new concept of Pareto optimality, together with his reinterpretation and rejection of Ricardo's (1821) contention that the introduction of machinery may diminish output and employment.

B13|Jean-Baptiste Say et l'entrepreneur : la question de la filiation avec Cantillon et Turgot|Since Schumpeter, there has been a tradition in the history of the economic thought that has placed Say’s entrepreneur in a filiation Cantillon-Turgot. The aim of this article is to show that this filiation does not exist, even if certain themes such as risk, knowledge or organization of production appear in the works of these three authors. More precisely, it is possible to find a double break between Say and his predecessors. The first one lies in the analysis of the production and the division of labor, which shows that the entrepreneur in Say’s writings has not the same role as in Turgot’s ones. The second one concerns their conceptions of uncertainty and profit, which shows that the place of the entrepreneur in the distribution of income in the writings of Say is not the same that in Cantillon or Turgot’s ones. The implications of this double break are specified in the conclusion. JEL Codes : B12, B13, L26
B13|Aspects pratiques et théoriques de l'entrepreneur dans la vie et l'œuvre de Jean-Baptiste Say|In the history of economic thought, Jean-Baptiste Say distinguishes himself in being a theoretician and practitioner of the enterprise. Moreover, he also taught the entrepreneurial spirit in the last years of his life. We may therefore find in his writings a theory of production and exchanges and a modern theory of the enterprise. This places him at the forefront of the economists who focused on the entrepreneur. This paper presents two faces of Jean-Baptiste Say : Jean-Baptiste Say as an entrepreneur and Jean-Baptiste Say as a theoretician of the entrepreneur. JEL Codes : B12, B13, L26
B13|La influencia de la investigación operativa en la conformación de los precios comerciales y su impacto en las teorías del valor|A partir del estudio técnico, tecnológico e histórico de la evolución de la investigación operativa,como disciplina matemática aplicada al campo de la Economía Política previo desarrollo de la manufactura y la maquinaria, el autor estudia la influencia de dicha disciplina en la conformación de los costes de producción y su influencia en los precios de producción, así como el impacto que ello supone en los precios comerciales de las mercancías en tanto se trata de conectar esta influencia con la relación entre técnica y tecnología y teorías del valor. La forma en que tanto la teoría de la utilidad marginal como la teoría del valor trabajo enfocan esta influencia tecnológica será analizada desde la teoría del cierre categorial, teoría de la ciencia desarrollada por el filósofo español Gustavo Bueno.
B13|Character in Alfred Marshall’s work: not so commonplace?|Character is commonly recognised as a crucial notion in Alfred Marshall’s thought, and more broadly in Victorian thought. However, this concept is never intrinsically defined. This paper offers an intellectual reconstruction of the notion of character in Marshall’s thought. While not denying that Marshall’s ideas evolve between his early writings and his later writings, this reconstruction focuses on the unchanged elements of his thought. This reconstruction is also an opportunity to re-examine Marshall’s conception of social ideal, on the basis of archives documents: Marshall conceives character as a complex of psychological, moral and cognitive faculties that – in a somewhat circular way – both makes sense in the light of his social ideal and serves his social ideal.
B13|Augusto Graziani on the walrasian capital formation model|In the Sixties of the last century there was in Italy a re-kindling of interest for Walrasian theory. Several economists wrote on it, expounding opposing opinions. This partly reflected the hectic ideological climate of that decade, and Graziani could not but be influenced by it. Yet his book Equilibrio generale ed equilibrio macroeconomico testifies to his deep intellectual curiosity and searching attitude. The key problem was the consistency of the Walrasian capital formation model. The dominant opinion was that of over-determinacy. Graziani opted for under-determinacy. He provided two arguments, the first of which was based on a misinterpretation of Walras’ Law, the second, an ingenious one, would have led, if properly completed, to determinacy. His criticisms of over-determinacy are penetrating and constructive: he suggested a promising dynamic over-determinacy thesis which integrates the markets for newly produced and for second hand capital goods.
B13|The Luigi Einaudi vs. Mauro Fasiani epistemological debate (1938-1943): the end of the italian tradition in Public Finance|The epistemological debate between Luigi Einaudi and Mauro Fasiani is discussed herein by considering not only the essays published in journals, but also the private letters of the two discussants, notably Fasiani’s recently discovered unsent correspondence. Revisiting the entire discussion is of considerable interest for understanding the history of economic thought, not to mention the current relevance of the arguments raised, which relate to the different perspectives by which science may be considered and to the different answers to problems such as the cognitive capability of economic science and the relationship among science, value judg ments, and economic policies. The debate allows us to infer that in those years, Einaudi did not believe the theory of public finance to be independent of economic science, concluding that the Italian tradition was essentially over. On the contrary, Fasiani believed in the autonomy of the theory of public finance, and was the last scholar still working to build a unifying design covering the entire set of public interventions in the economy.
B13|Economic theory and social classes|The marginalist economic theory believes that the effectiveness of the collective action exerted by a social class as a whole conflicts with the hypothesis of competition (perfect competition). A question of method is at the root of this view: the marginalist theory only takes into consideration the individual maximizing behaviour of workers, capitalists and entrepreneurs. In this way it excludes from the analysis the study of social links, which, as a matter of fact, are the conditions for collective action. In the classical approach, economic relations are instead affected by the institutions and social conventions that characterize each particular historical moment. As a consequence, the classical notion of competition (free competition) does not exclude a role for the social links that can justify collective action and, at the same time, make it effective. This characteristic of the classical approach is particularly considerable as concerns the theory of income distribution. A re-proposal of the classical theory of wages which takes into consideration the development and complexity of the institutions that, these days, condition the conflict for the distribution of income, cannot actually disregard the role of collective action.
B13|An Aspect of Welfare Economics in the Fomative Age-Pigou and Eugenics-|"Eugenics, a scientific position advocating strengthening a nation through genetic improvements, emerged around the end of the 19th century and became the dominant influence of the day. Eugenics contended that policies supporting the weak and the disabled would lead to nothing but deterioration of the stock of the nation. Hence, eugenicists, in general, were strongly opposed to a welfare policy assisting the poor with inferior innate talents. This eugenic conclusion, however, was completely in contrast to the idea of Pigou's welfare economics that entails extending assistance to the ""lower"" class. Accordingly, Pigou took the lead in defending welfare economics from eugenicists' severe disapproval."
B13|Some Origins of Welfare Economics-Marshall, Ruskin and Tokuzo Fukuda-|This paper investigates the origins of welfare economics starting from its formative age. Pigou's Economics of Welfare started a history of 'old' and 'new' welfare economics based on economic welfarism. But at that time there were multiple economic ideas on welfare. While the main stream was the Cambridge school using a neo-classical approach, there was also the Oxford approach. 'Another economics of welfare', developed by people like Hobson, and emanating from Ruskin's 'no wealth but life', was quite influential. This paper, considering the origin of non-welfaristic economics of welfare, re-examines Marshall's welfare and his organic growth theory. The paper points out some commonality between Marshall's ideas and Ruskin's, and make clearer the existence of the non-welfaristic economic ideas by referring to Fukuda's welfare economic studies.
B13|The Healthy Currency – An Alternative To Stable Currency|In the current historical and economic context of the globalised world, sensitive to fluctuations and liable to economic crisis, we find it especially important to analyse the concept of monetary stability. The purpose of this paper is to critically analyse the concept of monetary stability, from the merchandise-currency point of view as well as regarding the fiduciary currency. Through the contributions of the Austrian economists, that underlined the mutations that occur after the inflationary processes in the allocation of resources, revenue distribution and in the evolution of entrepreneurial activities, we understand the necessity to use a healthy currency. The conclusions of the study reflect the undisputed virtues of the gold standard whose stabilizing mechanisms can only function on a free market, guaranteed by economic freedom and without the state’s intervention.
B13|Literaturbeitrag / Review Book. Über die Natur und das Wesen des Geldes – J. H. von Thünens unveröffentlichtes Manuskript zur Geldtheorie / The Nature and the Essence of Money – J. H. von Thuenen’s unpublished Manuscript on Monetary Economics|The economic works of Johann Heinrich von Thuenen include 1,000 unpublished pages of drafts and notes on the basis of which he prepared the second volume of his famous “Isolated State in Relation to Agriculture and Political Economy”. It’s bulk was not made accessible until today. The analysis of a 60 pages’ manuscript treating monetary questions and preparing his theory of capital and interest shows that the economic thoughts of Thuenen are much more far-reaching than presented in his published works. Diminishing returns of cash keeping in enterprises are the basic concept of his monetary analysis. Main results are an algebraic equation of exchange, the interaction between the monetary interest rate and the rate of return on real capital and finally a synthesis of an extended quantity theory and the production cost theory of money. “The Nature and Essence of Money” includes important elements of the development in monetary economics in the late nineteenth and the beginning twentieth century mainly influenced by contributions of Irving Fisher, Knut Wicksell and John Maynard Keynes.
B13|Schumpeter’s Idea of a Universal Social Science|This paper deals with methodological principles of Schumpeter’s academic writings. Those principles led Schumpeter to create diverse works and were reflected systematically in some of his writings, where Schumpeter emerged as a theorist of science. Besides working on specific topics, Schumpeter dealt systematically with methodological issues in different works. Schumpeter’s History of Economic Analysis, in particular, must be regarded as the one study among his diverse works which is considered not only his latest but also his most relevant analysis concerning social sciences and the role of economics in relation to sociology, history, and other academic branches. The substantial preface of the History of Economic Analysis can be regarded as a manual on how to refer to different academic branches and integrate them into a coherent universal social science, which is far removed from being an autistic, narrow economic science of some modern representation. Although Schumpeter’s History of Economic Analysis has been extensively printed in several editions, the idea is that the preface especially reveals somewhat neglected thoughts in Schumpeterian discourse. While Schumpeter is mostly regarded as a pioneer of evolutionary economics, this paper argues that Schumpeter could also, perhaps primarily, be interpreted as a well-reasoning institutionalist aiming at a universal social science. From today’s point of view, Schumpeter is a truly interdisciplinary theorist. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2014
B13|The place of Austrian economics in contemporary entrepreneurship research|We review the place of Austrian economics in contemporary entrepreneurship and management research, focusing on the contributions of Israel Kirzner. We show that Kirzner’s central concept of entrepreneurial discovery has been vastly influential in theoretical and applied work on entrepreneurship, even though Kirzner’s larger research program has not been well understood. We also describe and assess a number of methodological, ontological, and cognitive critiques of the opportunity-discovery approach and review the most important alternatives, including the judgment-based view associated with Knight ( 1921 ) and more recent contributors. We conclude that the entrepreneurship and management literatures provide a useful example of how Austrian economics—Kirznerian economics in particular—can play an important role in shaping mainstream discussions, debates, and research programs in the social sciences.

B13|The Natural Cycle: WHY Economic Fluctuations are Inevitable. A Schumpeterian Extension of the Austrian Business Cycle Theory|The conventional version of Austrian business cycle theory focuses on a temporary imbalance between natural and monetary rates of interest. When, because of the role of monetary authorities in defining the monetary rate, the two values are in a situation of imbalance, the resulting expansion stage is followed by a recession. On the other hand, if instead the expansive phase arises without any interference by monetary authorities but through re-adaptation of the productive structure to a modified structure of temporal preferences, a period of sustainable growth begins that will not be followed by a crisis. The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate, on the other hand, that because of profitexpectations and the combined action of Schumpeterian elements (imitations-speculations and the ‘creation of money’ by banks), even a so-called ‘sustainable’ boom will be affected by a liquidation and settling crisis. What distinguishes the latter situation from the conventional case of imbalance between monetary and natural rates is not the onset or otherwise of a crisis but, rather, its intensity and duration. We will define as natural an economic cycle characterised by a stage of expansion considered to be ‘sustainable’ in the Austrian theory but followed by an inevitable readjustment crisis.
B13|Integrating Economic Cycles Theory with Equilibrium Theory|(The Second Half of the 1920s and 1930s) and N. D. Kondratiev’s Project of Economic Dynamics The article considers the ways to overcome the methodological gap between the analysis of economic cycles and the pure economic theory as suggested by the Western economists in the 1920s and 1930s. In this context, N. D. Kondratiev’s project of economic dynamics is analyzed, which implied a radically different vision of the opportunities to solve this problem.
B13|A economia e o melhoramento social: a agenda de reformas de Alfred Marshall [Economic and social improvement: Marshall’s reform agenda]|This paper aims to investigate some aspects of Marshall’s social and economic philosophy. It is argued that he made great effort to extinguish poverty, for he considered it an evil that besides provoking intense distress to the poor, was responsible for their physical, moral and intellectual degradation. To rescue men, women and children from misery would be, for him, a pre-condition to human and social betterment. The paper analyses Marshall’s reform agenda that included the direct combat of poverty and indigence, but also educational, sanitary, and urban planning policies. Despite the appearance of miscellaneous measures, these reforms, when viewed as a whole, complemented each other and aimed basically at breaking the ‘vicious circle’ of poverty and, by these means, at ameliorating human characterand human life.
B13|Memory and Anticipation: New Empirical Support for an Old Theory of the Utility Function|The paper contrasts early theories of the utility function (starting with Bentham and elaborated by Jevons) with the modern theory (laid down by Fisher and Samuelson). The former include in the utility function not only the sensation of current events but also the memory of past events and the anticipation of future events. The alternative hypotheses are tested by introducing both past and expected future income into the estimated subjective well-being function, using an appropriate data set for China. The tests favour the early theories. Implications are drawn.
B13|Il giovane Einaudi e il socialismo: una questione aperta (1893-1902) (Luigi Einaudi and Socialsim (1893-1902): an unknown dilemma)|Although in recent decades the economic and political thought of Luigi Einaudi has undergone new studies and analyses, his association with socialism (and socialists) as a young scholar still remains a cause of queries. To what extent has the attraction for socialist economic theories affected the development of his protoliberalism? Why did Einaudi abstain to participate in the exciting debate over Marxism? Which were his reactions in front of the political crisis experienced by Italian democracy towards the end of the nineteenth century? And how deep were his connections with Turati and the Socialist Party? This essay aims to answer these questions through a careful survey of scientific papers as well as unpublished or little known archival sources, hoping to shed light over some of Einaudi’s ‘dark sides’.
B13|Luigi Einaudi e Mauro Fasiani: il dibattito epistemologico dal 1941 al 1943 (The debate between Luigi Einaudi and Mauro Fasiani (1941-1943))|The paper draws attention to the 1942-1943 debate between Luigi Einaudi and his pupil Mauro Fasiani, and is discussed by considering not only the essays published in journals, but also the private letters of the two discussants. It mainly relates to the different perspectives by which science may be considered and the relationship among science, value judgments, and economic policies. The debate began when Fasiani published his treatise Principii di Scienza delle Finanze in 1941. In a short time, Einaudi published a review article in his own «Rivista di storia economica» basically praising, but also raising the important criticisms that value judgments cannot be excluded from fiscal theory and that the science of finance is not a matter that can have a unifying doctrine logically deduced from a principle, meaning that scholars could not write treatises on such a subject: the Principii is not a treaty, but three separate monographies. To these criticisms, Fasiani responded by a letter accompanied by a typescript, to which Einaudi replied by a letter and a typescript. Fasiani resumed the exchange of ideas with a second letter and a second typescript. The discussion continued by other letters, and with four more Einaudi’s articles and two articles by Fasiani. All the correspondence between Einaudi and Fasiani, which occurred in 1942 and 1943, now preserved in the Einaudi Foundation of Turin, is published in the Appendix.
B13|Schumpeter y la Historia del Pensamiento Económico<BR>[Schumpeter and the History of Economic Thought]|The History Schumpeter´s of Economic Analysis, is a tour de forcé of scholarship. The display of erudition is 'truly unbelievable. How could one man have acquired and then digested so much knowledge? Not only does the History offer two thousand years of economics, from Aristotle to Paul Samuelson, but also it ranges most expertly over all the other social sciences, history and belles lettres as well. For more than 1,100 pages the prose flows on in a way that one has come to expect from Schumpeterthe fluent style, the vivid analogy, the striking metaphor, the arresting aside. Our goal is to present the central ideas of Schumpeter on the complex relationships between Economic History and Epistemology of Science. This design has three aspects that interest us: (a) its amplitude to conceive the economy as part of the overall development of scientific knowledge; (b) its relevance applied and the examples used by the author; (c) its currently facing tremendous methodological problems facing the economy with the other sciences.

B13|Tax Power and Economics|The article is divided into two parts. The first describes Hayek's critique of the progressive tax system since its conception of social order and fiscal rationality. Hayek thinks about a key principle in liberal democracies: majority rule. And stretching comments to the influence of morality in taxation decisions. The second is aimed at analyzing the reception of Hayek in constitutional economics Brennan and Buchanan. However, in the interpretation of tax policy has decisively if governments reflect a tyrant or benevolent Leviathan State. The Fiscal Constitution must be accompanied by a monetary constitution. Both constitutional forms are related and prevent leviathánico power of governments, especially when they are short stay. Although, for the authors, the Fiscal Constitution has important implications for monetary constitution.

B13|Ludwig M. Lachmann Against the Cambridge School. Macroeconomics, Microfoundations, Expectations, Rate of Profit, Equilibrium and Innovations|While in the early 1930s Keynes and Hayek were the major figures in a heated academic debate about money and capital, in which Keynes also and especially involved the Italian Piero Sraffa, it might seem at first sight that the Austrian economist set aside an organic demolition of the ideas expressed in 1936 by his rival in the General Theory. But the ‘Austrian knight’ of a new Vienna-Cambridge debate, in the subsequent decades, was the German economist Ludwig M. Lachmann (1906-1990), a student of Hayek at LSE during the 1930s and later a professor in Johannesburg and New York. Lachmann was one of the protagonists of the Austrian revival after 1974 and the founding leader of the ‘hermeneutic stream’, opposed by the Rothbardian stream. Lachmann, defending Keynes’s subjectivism and expectation theory, revived the Vienna-Cambridge controversy, criticising not Keynes but his followers, in particular the ‘new’ Cambridge School, developed by Joan Robinson and Piero Sraffa.

B13|Böhm-Bawerk und die Anfänge der monetären Zinstheorie|Böhm-Bawerk defines the rate of interest as the ratio of intertemporal goods prices, but cannot show the emergence of interest as a financial market price. The alleged efficiency ofroundabout production methods is ill-suited to derive a uniform rate of return of capital. Time preference may affect the allocation of income flows and the decision to build up individual wealth, but credit supply follows from a portfolio decision on the structure of the stock of assets. Here, liquidity preference and monetary policy operations have a decisive influence, whereas changes of productivity and time preference are poor predictors of even the sign of market interest changes. A 'natural' rate of interest, determined by 'deep' parameters of capital, production and time, does not exist; it turns out to be a mere estimated value of the bank rate, as a proxy for goods market equilibrium conditions.
B13|The Hicks-Malinvaud average period of production and 'marginal productivity': A critical assessment| Malinvaud took up the concept of the average period of production introduced by Hicks in Value and Capital and then Capital and Time , in an article of 2003 celebrating Wicksell's contribution to the theory of capital, where he observed that once techniques are ranked according to the average period for a given initial rate of interest, a rise in the rate of interest entails the use of a technique with a shorter average period. After a brief reconstruction of Malinvaud's argument, it is shown that the result is far less encouraging for neoclassical theory than it might seem. The most important problem is not the fact that change in the interest rate affects the average period of production associated with a technique, despite the concern this aroused in Hicks and Malinvaud, but rather that it affects the ranking of techniques. An example with two techniques is used to show that a rise in the rate of interest entails the use of a technique with a shorter average period even in the case of reswitching simply because the ranking of techniques is inverted at the two switch points.
B13|Carl Menger on the Theory of Economic History. Reflections from Bulgaria|Carl Menger founded the Austrian School of economics at the end of the 19th century. He rejected some of the main ideas of the German Historical School in his work Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics (1881). The submitted paper presents the main implications of the investigations on the theory of economic history with a special reference to the economic history and history of economic thought of the Balkans. The emphasis is on the methodological subjectivism, spontaneous order, rejection of the teleological understanding of the process of economic development, and the application of mathematical models. These principles could be used as a theoretical base of the historical research, though they are widely underestimated in modern economic history
B13|Der kühle Gleichmut des Ökonomen: Leidenschaftslosigkeit als Paradigma der Wirtschaftswissenschaft und die Fragefelder der Sozio-Ökonomie|In der ökonomischen Bildung wird die Wirtschaft aus quasi-naturwissenschaftlicher Perspektive gelehrt, ohne dass diese Perspektive selbst kaum je reflektiert würde. Aufgezeigt wird, wie aus dieser Perspektive heraus angehende Ökonomen angeleitet werden, sich von ihrer eigenen Erfahrungswelt wie auch von ihrer eigenen Kultur stillschweigend zu distanzieren. Sie sollen gleichsam zu Sozialingenieuren werden, welche die Wirtschaft wie eine Maschine von außen zu beherrschen glauben. Weitergehend wird diskutiert, wie die ökonomische Bildung sich selbst grundlegend ändern kann, um junge Menschen wieder Möglichkeiten zu bieten, sich über ihre eigenen Voraussetzungen des Denkens und Handelns zu verständigen. Wie kann ihnen geholfen werden, die herrschende Sprach- und Gefühllosigkeit im Wirtschaftsalltag zu überwinden?
B13|Orthodoxer Mainstream und Heterodoxe Alternativen: Eine Analyse der ökonomischen Wissenschaftslandschaft|Die moderne Volkswirtschaftslehre als wissenschaftliche Disziplin ist einerseits durch große Uneinheitlichkeit geprägt, die andererseits selbst in Zeiten der Krise der Theorie anscheinend nicht nachhaltig in ein öffentliches Bewusstsein vordringen konnte. Nach wie vor wird die Ökonomik unterstellt und auf diese Weise werden Unterschiede ökonomischer Denkweisen entweder nivelliert oder für irrelevant erachtet, wenn es um die Erklärung der großen Zusammenhänge geht. Doch neben dem orthodox-neoklassischen Mainstream, der seit langem den institutionalisierten akademischen Forschungs- und Lehrbetrieb dominiert, existieren vielfältige alternative Ansätze. Diese Tatsache an sich könnte der Ökonomik insgesamt den Schein eines monolithischen Theoriengebäudes eigentlich nehmen und stattdessen ihre Pluralität belegen. Als Phänomen ist Ökonomik zwar durchaus im Plural denkbar, aber die Existenzweise von Pluralität ist kümmerlich und bestenfalls durch hegemonialen Diskurs geprägt. Warum es nach wie vor schwierig ist, die Emanzipation vom Streamlining der Wirtschaftswissenschaften konsequent und erfolgreich zu betreiben, wird aus verschiedenen Perspektiven beleuchtet. Jenseits vertrauter Standarderklärungen unterstützen ideengeschichtliche, wissenschaftstheoretische und wissenschaftspolitische Argumente das Plädoyer für eine kritisch-pluralistische Ökonomik als Bestandteil eines funktionierenden modernen Wissenschaftsgebäudes.
B13|An unexpected discovery: Johann Heinrich von Thuenen and the tragedy of the commons|William Forster Lloyd's 1833 sketch about poor cattle on the commons and the well-fed animals on the adjacent enclosures published in his 'Two lectures on the checks to population' has hitherto been assessed as one starting point of the economics of renewable resources. In the 20th century the question of the use of common property resources has initially been treated by fisheries economists, at first in unknown publications of Jens Warming in 1911 and 1931, and after a disruption of more than 40 years starting again with the contributions of Gordon and Scott in the 1950s. Important results have been the derivation and presentation of the economic criteria for the open access equilibrium case on the one hand and the private property equilibrium case on the other hand. Garrett Hardin's well known 1968 Sciences article brought a new title and increased awareness to the 'tragedy of the commons' and Elenor Ostrom's 2009 nobel prize in economics finally underlined the importance as well as the diversity of institutional rules to achieve an efficient use of the natural resources - challenging the favored liberal concept of a privatization of scarce resources. Johann Heinrich von Thuenen's contributions on the commons - hidden in an 1831 article about urban agriculture in the journal 'Neue Annalen der Mecklenburgischen Landwirtschaftsgesellschaft' and in an unpublished manuscript - have been totally neglected until now, although he published his article about the core problem of the commons two years earlier than William Forster Lloyd and almost in the clarity of the fisheries economists 80 resp. 120 years later. He not only presented the correct allocation criteria for both property rights scenarios but additionally developed a framework a) how to gain the maximal rent of a resource through an auction system - drafting the first demand table b) how to redistribute the gains to the communal property owners - developing an adequate compensation mechanism c) and finally how to establish this institutional innovation democratically - thereby applying important elements of Elenor Ostrom's Common Property Rights Framework. Due to these contributions Johann Heinrich von Thuenen deserves the title of the founder of the economics of renewable resources. Moreover, in combination with his publications on forestry, land use, soil improvement and agricultural processing industries he should also be seen as the creator of a discipline which got its name but now, the creator of bioeconomics.
B13|La moral hobbesiana como equilibrio de mercado|Este escrito constituye una lectura económica de la obra de Thomas Hobbes, dirigida a entender conductas morales como resultado de equilibrios de mercado. Partiendo de una economía de intercambio donde el precio de los bienes obedece a su costo de oportunidad, se muestra usando Teoría de Juegos el surgimiento de conductas morales en un escenario anterior a la formación del Estado. Cuando el Estado ha sido consolidado dejan de ser posibles los comportamientos estratégicos y surge la posibilidad de competencia perfecta. La Teoría del Equilibrio General adquiere entonces valor para entender la presencia de conductas morales en el estado civil hobbesiano. El resultado es que independientemente de la presencia o ausencia del Estado, las conductas morales en Hobbes constituyen equilibrios de mercado motivados por el deseo individual de comerciar.

B13|Social Welfare: Insights From The Austrian School Of Economics|When looking back in the last decades, one can notice the assertion of the state as the main provider of the social welfare. The state proclaimed itself as the “welfare state” and assumed all the responsibilities for ensuring the welfare of its society. The economic and social situation (stressed and unstable in current times), combined with limited resource availability and aggressive state policies, have once again highlighted the importance of understanding the meaning of social welfare. This study aims at emphasizing some important aspects regarding social welfare in light of the Austrian School of Economics perspective. We dare to think outside the box and propose this theoretical foray as a cornerstone for rethinking the meaning of social welfare and the role of the state in ensuring the welfare for its members within the society.
B13|Valor, Capital e Instituições Sociais em Carl Menger: as contribuições de uma obra inacabada|The theoretical legacy of Carl Menger involves works on value, capital and the origin of social institutions. There is a huge literature on Menger, that has been growing since Schumpeter wrote his short article on the founding father of Austrian Economics in 1921. Reavaliations concerning the place of Menger in the history of economic thought have suggested the de-homogeneization of Menger, Walras and Jevons (Jaffé, 1976) and the desaggregation of Menger, Böhm-Bawerk e Weiser. It might be that now is a moment for a new line of investigation: the desequencing of Menger, Mises and Hayek.
B13|Alfred Marshall’s cardinal theory of value: the strong law of demand|Abstract We show that all the fundamental properties of competitive equilibrium in Marshall’s cardinal theory of value, as presented in Note XXI of the mathematical appendix to his Principles of Economics (1890), derive from the Strong Law of Demand. That is, existence, uniqueness, optimality, and global stability of equilibrium prices with respect to tatonnement price adjustment follow from the cyclical monotonicity of the market demand function in the Marshallian general equilibrium model. We propose a refutable model of Marshall’s cardinal theory of value: the Marshallian equilibrium inequalities. We show that the Marshallian equilibrium inequalities have a solution iff the finite market data set consisting of observations on market prices and social endowments is cyclically monotone.

B13|Una Revisión Moderna de las Teorías de Precios de Ricardo y Jevons|Este artículo revisa las teorías de precios de Ricardo y Jevons. El argumentoprincipal es que la diferencia entre estas teorías proviene de motivaciones y nalidades teóricas diferentes. Mientras Ricardo tenía interés en encontrarun estándar de valor que sirviera para homogeneizar la heterogeniedad debienes y servicios que compone el producto o excedente de una naciónen una medida común, y cómo ese producto homogeneizado se distribuyeentre terratenientes, trabajadores y capitalistas, Jevons pretendía explicarel consumo de la riqueza en una economía que proviene de la maximizacióndel placer o utilidad a través del intercambio que determina el valor de losbienes en el mercado, tomando como dada la producción de la economía.Argumento que esta diferencia de enfoque surgen debido a la diferencia enlo que cada uno de ne como el objeto de la Economía Política. Sin embargo,muestro que ambas teorías se pueden racionalizar dentro de un modelo deequilibrio competitivo walrasiano.
B13|Protection of competition in the contemporary global economy as a challenge for the competition theory|Although the phenomenon of competition is fundamental of the economic theory and policy, the scientists have not yet achieved the consensus concerning the kind of competition which should be protected. Contemporary researchers striving to find the answer to this question rely on their predecessors achievements and the recognition that all elements of the classical structure-conduct-performance paradigm are influencing each other. Thus, the current research on competition is conducted within the confines of the theory of economy and management and the protection of competition in the contemporary global economy constitutes a challenge for the competition theory in all three areas mentioned in the paradigm. Given the above, there are several issues of vital importance. Firstly, the development of MNs in the direction of diversified networks which are interconnected with different contractual and ownership multidimensional ties, secondly, the need to take into account the relations between the competitors on other geographical and product markets in the analysis of competition on the local market, and thirdly, the need to widen the traditional perception of the protection of competition to other areas, which have not been covered by antitrust policy so far.
B13|William Stanley Jevons and “social reform”: A theory of welfare without posterity|While Jevons is well known for his analysis on pure economics his contributions to a broader conception of welfare including a social aspect has attracted less attention. However, from a history of economic thought perspective, these contributions have a twofold benefit: on the one hand, they reflect the adhesion of Jevons to the utilitarian philosophy; on the other hand, they bear the marks of nascent welfare economics. Jevons has indeed a particular way of dealing with social welfare as he identifies two levels of utility, “economic” and what we call “global”, the latter being a broader concept and showing clearly that these two might contradict. In this paper, our objective is to reconstruct the overall architecture of Jevons’s position on “social reform”. For this purpose, we will first present the “narrow” approach that the economist should adopt according to Jevons and highlight the links that he establishes between economics and ethics through the utilitarian calculus of Bentham (§.1). Then, we will show that Jevons considers that such a point of view should be abandoned in the field of legislation in favour of a method similar to the cost/benefit analysis and which mobilises different sciences to anticipate the outcomes of reforms. After having defined this method (§.2), we will focus on the consequences of such an analysis, which lead Jevons, as an economist, to amend a number of assumptions that he made in the context of pure economics (§.3).
B13|General Equilibrium and Social Justice: Neoclassical Theory as a Political Philosophy?|We study the willingness of some authors, including H. Varian in the 70’s, to elaborate a theory of justice that would fit standard general equilibrium theory in its Pareto’s canonical version. We first show, through an analysis of market socialism in the 30’s, that the Paretian ethic is based on the value judgment of consumer sovereignty. Then we are able to discuss the specific contribution of Varian, who, by introducing the criterion of equity as envy-freeness, produces a – very specific – theory of justice that seems compatible with this value judgment and can stand at the heart of standard general equilibrium analysis.
B13|Is the Schumpeterian entrepreneur superhuman?|Most of Schumpeter’s commentators admit Nietzsche’s influence on the Schumpeterian conception of the entrepreneur. Nevertheless, from our point of view, this influence is often treated in the historical context and in a very limited definition of the entrepreneur. In this article, we argue that the latter could be interpreted from a philosophical standpoint. Although Schumpeter has not aimed to go that far, we suggest an interpretation based on Nietzschean will to power
B13|Giffen’s Good: A case of mistaken identification|Giffen reported that, in the late nineteenth century, English wheat consumption rose when its price increased – the first recorded “Giffen good”. Using Giffen’s data, I explain how he reached his conclusion. I then show that his analysis was faulty: price elasticity of demand appears positive when the demand curve is incorrectly identified, but is significantly negative – like any normal good – when it is correctly identified. Since the pathological Giffen good case was actually just mistaken identification, it is no surprise that Giffen goods are impossible to find elsewhere. Popularization of the Giffen good stemmed from Marshall’s and Samuelson’s influential textbooks.
B13|Lecciones olvidadas de tres economistas difuntos|En este trabajo el autor se lamenta de la importancia cada vez menor que se otorga a la historia del pensamiento económico en la comunidad académica mundial, defiende que esta recesión está dando lugar a visiones unidimensionales de la obra de los principales autores en economía y afirma que, si lo analizamos de cerca, podemos sorprendernos de la simplicidad de las concepciones más corrientes. Como triple ilustración, básicamente citando algunas partes omitidas de sus trabajos, el autor hace hincapié en los casos de Adam Smith, Francis Ysidro Edgeworth y John Maynard Keynes, que imparten lecciones cruciales ignoradas por la mayoría de la generación actual de economistas.
B13|Still more on why we should bury the Marginal Productivity Theory of the Price of Capital: A Supplementary Note|The purpose of this note is to supplement the authorâ€™s earlier remarks on the unsatisfactory nature of the neoclassical account of how the return on capital is determined. (See Strathclyde Discussion Paper 12-03: â€œThe Marginal Productivity Theory of the Price of Capital: An Historical Perspective on the Origins of the Codswallopâ€ ). The point is made via a simple illustration that certain matters which are problematical in neoclassical terms are perfectly straightforward when viewed from a classical perspective. Basically, the marginalist model of the nature of an economic system is not fit for purpose in that it fails to comprehend the essential features of a surplus-producing economic system as distinct from one merely of exchange.
B13|Public Debt and J.S. Mill’s Conjecture: A Note|Classical economists - mainly Smith, Ricardo and J.S. Mill - abhorred public debts because of their interference with capital accumulation. J.S. Mill in particular envisaged that a rising public debt leads to higher interest rates and falling real wages, a combination which may be consistent with a mildly increasing trend in the profit rate.
B13|Equilibrium versus Process: A Confrontation between Mainstream and Austrian Ontology|We confront mainstream and Austrian economics from a history of economic analysis point of view in order to identify the main reasons of their divergent interests on the concepts of, respectively, equilibrium and processes. The result of this confrontation attributes a decisive role to ontological considerations: mainstream central focus on equilibrium is the consequence of the adoption of specific mathematical tools. But the claim for a mathematical approach to economics is a doctrine that is independent from any study on the nature of the underlying economic system and real phenomena that are non-tractable are either reinterpreted in an amenable to reason form or are simply ignored. The choice of the tools determine the orthodox vision of the economic world as a closed system of interacting autonomous atoms. Austrians proceed exactly the other way round: ontological investigations are the starting point and as a consequence, they choose the relevant tools so to be coherent with their ontology where social reality is apprehended along an open processual view.
B13|Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1): Chapter One, Background and Historical Setting|"This paper puts John Maynard Keynes’ ""The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money"" into its historical context, both in terms of economic history and in terms of the history of economics. It discusses the post-World War I period as background to the General Theory, looks at the influence of other economists of the period on the evolution of Keynes’ thought and considers the parallels between the post-World War period and the post-Napoleonic War period, when Ricardo and Malthus were debating issues very similar to the ones with which Keynes was wrestling."
B13|Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (2): Chapter 2, “The Postulates of the Classical Economics”|Chapter 2 is one of the most important chapters in the General Theory. Not only does it set out Keynes’ disagreements with key elements of the classical model, it lays out his own model of the working of the labour market, which underlies the analysis in the remainder of the General Theory. The issue of how labour’s response to a change in its real wage differs depending on whether the change is driven by a change in the nominal wage or in the price of consumer goods plays a key part in the way Keynes’ theoretical model is developed here. This chapter introduces Keynes’ concept of involuntary unemployment and sets out his argument about the causal relation between the real wage and the level of unemployment, and about the consequent cyclicality of the real wage. Chapter 2 also includes Keynes’ discussion of Say’s Law.
B13|Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (3): Chapter 3, “The Principle of Effective Demand”|In Chapter 3 of the General Theory, Keynes sketches out what he calls the essence of the General Theory of Employment. He introduces the Keynesian expenditure-based model, his aggregate demand function and also his aggregate supply function, a concept which spawned much debate among Post-Keynesian economists but which was, for a long time, virtually ignored in mainstream macroeconomics. He sets out the Savings = Investment version of Say’s Law and outlines how an economy can settle into an equilibrium at less than full employment.
B13|"Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (4): Chapter 4, ""The Choice of Units""; Chapter 5, ""Expectations as Determining Output and Employment"""|In Chapter 4 of the General Theory, Keynes discusses the units of measurement he will be using in the remainder of the book, in particular his reason for measuring in nominal rather than real terms, objection to aggregate measures of real output and physical capital stock, and his concept of wage units, which is a source of difficulty in following bits of the later exposition. Chapter 5 introduces expectations and discusses the role of short run expectations in determining the behavior of firms and of economic aggregates.
B13|Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (5): Chapter 6, The Definition of Income, Saving and Investment; Appendix to Chapter 6, Appendix on User Cost; Chapter 7, The Meaning of Saving and Investment Further Considered|Chapter Six and its Appendix deal in some detail with the way Keynes is defining income, savings and investment in the General Theory while the appendix to Chapter 6 goes into detail on user cost. His concept of user cost at one point sparked a certain amount of controversy among Keynesians but has since virtually been forgotten. It is of interest to us because user cost is the place where Keynes sees firms taking account of the future consequences of their current production decisions. The General Theory is a theory of the short run, but firms’ cost curves, which are key to many short run decisions, contain a forward looking element. Chapter 7 returns to the concepts of saving and investment, relates Keynes’ definitions to those used by others (including his own from the Treatise) and relates aggregate investment, which refers to additions to physical capital stock, to the way the term is often used at the micro level, in the sense of investment in financial assets.
B13|Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (6): Chapters 8, 9 and 10: Keynes’ Theory of Consumer Behaviour|Chapters 8, 9 and 10 set out Keynes’ theory of consumer behavior. Chapter 8 is entitled The Propensity to Consume: I. The Objective Factors, Chapter 9 is The Propensity to Consume: II. The Subjective Factors, and Chapter 10 is The Marginal Propensity to Consume and the Multiplier. Contrary to the widely held belief, Keynes saw the consumer as an intertemporally optimizing agent, in a manner which is quite consistent with Frank Ramsey’s model of intertemporal saving behavior and with modern theories of the behavior of the optimizing consumer. While he did conclude that in the short run income would be the dominant factor underlying consumer behavior, this was an empirical judgement, not simply an assumption about fundamental psychological propensities. Chapter 10 formally introduces the marginal propensity to consume and the multiplier.
B13|Origins and developments of Irving Fisher’s compensated dollar plan|"In 1911, Fisher published The Purchasing Power of Money. In chapter 13 of the first edition and in an appendix in the second section of 1913, he introduced a rule to maintain the stability of the level of prices, known as the ""compensated dollar."" According to this rule, the legal definition of money is changed. In other words, the weight in gold of the dollar is modified once a month in order to impede the frequency of price changes on a basket of goods. According to Fisher, this plan would offer stability for the purchasing power of money. He sought to find an alternative system to the fixed price of gold under the Gold Standard. He wanted to introduce a dollar fixed in terms of its purchasing power, but variable in terms of its metallic weight. In this paper, we will focus on Fisher's analysis of the stability of money value and his position in the debate on the compensated dollar from 1909 to 1922. We will study the anticipations of Fisher's compensated dollar, the critical reception of Fisher's project and the evolutions it gave rise to, the gold exchange standard and the algebraic evidence. We also examine the debate's connections to the question of whether or not the compensated dollar plan is compatible with the quantity theory of money. We end with the analysis of the gold price elasticity of the net supply of gold, with an explanation of the relationship between the Yellowbacks and the varying price of the gold reserve."
B13|The Austrian School Of Economics And Market Instability|Market equilibrium is an illusion. The economic reality shows us that the main characteristic of the markets is the state of instability. The complexity of the phenomenon and the strong implications engendered by the economic fluctuations in the macro system, justify the rich scientific research activity of the main schools of economic thought to explain it. The Austrian school of economic thought has one of the most realistic analyses of the factors who generate the market instability.

B13|Hayek’s 1945 Finlay Memorial Lecture: Tracing the origins and evolution of his ‘true’ individualism|Hayek’s original 1945 University College Dublin lecture outlined the origins and evolution of two different interpretations of ‘individualism’, comparing and contrasting what Hayek terms ‘true’ and ‘false’ individualism notwithstanding the misleading contemporary interpretations and distorted perceptions of the assumptions underlining ‘true’ individualism. Hayek developed and extended the Scottish Enlightenment theory of spontaneous order originally formulated by Adam Ferguson’s maxim that social order was the result of unintended human action rather than the result of deliberate human design in order to explain the origin of complex social structures, which originated in a Cromwellian maxim. The origination and inspiration for the title of Hayek’s lecture is also considered, as is the influence of other thinkers; Mandeville, Tocqueville, Mill, Acton and Schatz that Hayek cites in his Dublin lecture.

B13|Abstraction as a Mother of Order? (Historical-Methodological Reflections on the Relation of Economic Science and Economic Policy)|The article deals with the relation between assumptions of economic theories and their political implications. Two canons of economic science are being analyzed according to the degree of abstraction. A hypothesis is that the more abstract formal canon is connected with a liberal kind of economic policy whereas the more concrete canon presupposes an active state intervention in economic affairs. Several attempts at integrating both canons are studied separately (Marshall, Schumpeter, Eucken). Historic evidence is more or less consistent with the hypothesis stated above, but there happens to be one important exclusion: the general equilibrium theory is so abstract that it can imply opposite policies.
B13|A Short Insight into the Schools of Economic Thinking Evolution on the Notions of Market and Competition (I) [Scurtă incursiune în evoluţia teoriilor economice privind noţiunile de piaţă şi concurenţă (I)]|The concepts of market, economic concentration, concurrent with competition mechanisms are key elements to market economy systems, that decisively shape the architecture of national economies. While to economic science, similarly to the group of social sciences, the experiment is not allowed, the study of economic theories demonstrates a process of evolution of these concepts.
B13|Ethics and Capitalism. An Interdisciplinary Interpretation [Etică şi capitalism. O interpretare interdisciplinară]|The paper starts from the argument that, at present, there are two opposite perspective on the relationship between ethics and capitalism, namely: on the one hand, it is the interpretation offered by the neoclassical school of economic thought (mainstream economics) and, on the other hand, it is the interpretation offered by the Austrian School of economic praxeology (libertarian economics).
B13|Orthodoxy and the Extensive Social Division of Labour [Ortodoxia şi diviziunea socială extinsă a muncii]|The present paper tackles two broad theses. According to the first, in the Eastern Orthodox view wealth, riches, material prosperity and whatever these things presuppose (the extended division of labour, trade, money, profit oriented entrepreneurship etc.) are not evil or condemnable in themselves. According to the second, one cannot find a positive sanction of honest wealth and riches.
B13|A Short Insight into the Schools of Economic Thinking Evolution on the Notions of Market and Competition (II) [Scurtă incursiune în evoluţia teoriilor economice privind noţiunile de piaţă şi concurenţă (II)]|This continuation of the previous part of our proposed monograph, which by no means is intended as an exhaustive one, is corroborated by the citation of innovative criticism and ideas put forward by the various economists, the purpose of which is to highlight exactly the relativism and nuances of the concepts, all stemming from the keen observation of economic realities and trends.
B13|"""New"" And ""Old"" In Economic Neoliberalism"|"In the evolution of economic history, the economic neoliberalism can be considered one of the most important. On the one hand, neoliberalism is a promoter of freedom in decision making process and competition. On the other hand, the market and its capability to supply information for the individuals and firms represents one of the central pillars for economic growth, development and profitability. Finally, we cannot ignore the diversity of neoliberal ideas, the number of promoters, and the global extension of neoliberalism. For these reasons, we consider that a short incursion in the history of neoliberalism is also actual and necessary. In the recent evolution of the neoliberal doctrine we can mention several important stages in the 20th century. During the first stage - between the first and second decade - Mises revived the School of Vienna, in his attempts to combat the concepts strongly promoted in the economic theory by the socialist doctrine. The second stage, comprised between the third decade and the end of the fourth decade, was an unfavourable period, during which the concepts of liberal orientation were strongly criticized. The third stage of the neoliberalism evolution, as a doctrine, can be placed between the last part of the fourth decade and the end of the fifth decade, having as object of debate the criticizing of the concepts launched in the economic literature by John Maynard Keynes. The fourth stage meant the entry of neoliberalism in a shadow cone, which lasted from the beginning of the 1950's until towards the middle of the 1970's, due to the popularity ""enjoyed"" by keynesism. The failure to apply the keynesist theories, declared in the second half of the 1970's, meant the entry of neoliberalism in an extended stage of development, which lasted until towards the end of the first decade of the 21st century. After year 2008, there are voices stating that the neoliberal principles are unable to find the answer to the world economic crisis and that, in fact, their promotion to such a wide scale contributed to this negative evolution of the economy."
B13|A theory of capital as value in progress|This is a paper on the theory of capital. It deals with the role of capital in a cost-of-production theory of value in which both labour and capital are directly productive. The guidelines of an analytical method are proposed. Marx’s ‘monetary expression of abstract labour-value’ (MEV) is used as price-index. It is preferred to the ‘monetary expression of labour time’ (MELT), exclusively focused on living labour, suggested by some neo-Marxist scholars during the ’New Value Controversy’. The author, a critical Marxist, develops the trace provided by Marx in his Grundrisse ’Fragment on Machines’, where he pointed out the need to abandon the labour theory of value and to rely on a broader labour-and-capital monetary theoretical construction. Due attention is paid in this essay to the time and money dimensions of capital and to the roles of both real and financial capital.
B13|Towards a revision of the theory of capital|This is a proposal to restate the theory of capital along critical Marxian lines aimed at providing a better integration of the theory of capital with the theory of money and finance. The time value of money must be properly accounted for. An analytical method is proposed to accomplish this task. The fundamental Marxian problem of the origin of profit is treated with reference to a specific price index, the monetary expression of labour value (MEV), which accounts for both explicit and implicit cost components, including the financial cost of capital. MEV should not be confused with MELT, the ‘New Interpretation’ money expression of living labour time, which does not consider the opportunity-cost of capital and, following the erroneous net value equality, focuses on the money value of the living labour time commanded by commodities at a given wage rate, rather than on the money value of total abstract labour time embodied in commodities, inclusive of both living and past labour.
B13|On the theory of capital in post-industrial societies|This is an analysis of the present unsatisfactory state of the theory of capital and a proposal to reformulate this theory in line with some neglected late-Marxian views on the subject and in the light of the passage of capitalism from the industrial to a post-industrial era characterized by the dominance of speculative finance. The author’s aim is to provide a better integration of the theory of capital with those of money and finance. Attention is focused on a Marxian price index, the monetary expression of labour value, MEV, which accounts for both explicit and implicit cost components and, differently from MELT, does not consider only the money value of living labour time.
B13|The ongoing history of economic conservation laws|Building on Mirowski’s historical analysis in the 1980s, the role of conservation laws in economic equilibrium theories is reexamined. Both static Walrasian systems and dynamic systems of intertemporal optimization are considered. While the formal derivation of conservation laws is discussed in detail, the paper also reviews the growing literature tradition in economics that is aware of the existence of conservation laws in economic equilibrium theories and tries to incorporate them into their models.
B13|Na institucích záleží! Ale proč?<BR>[Institutions Matter! But Why?]|The commentary defends the central idea of current institutional social research - that institutions are significant variables influencing the human action regarding the resource allocation. This idea was strongly opposed by the scientific board of the Czech economic faculty (institutionally oriented economic research was labeled as needless). The goal is to open the debate about this issue and ask the opponents to formulate concrete objections. Theoretical arguments and empirical examples are raised in favor of the institutional economics.
B13|John Bates Clark’s Conception of Capital|This paper revisits the economic theory of John Bates Clark, with specific reference to his concept of capital, which seems very little remembered. For Clark, capital is to be distinguished from capital goods and is a resource that is at once immaterial and, in routine circumstances, permanent. Drawing on the original definition of holism in the writings of General the Right Honorable Jan Christiaan Smuts, it is argued that Clark’s conception is holist rather than (as in the case of other concepts of capital and most other economic theory) reductionist. That is, for Clark capital is an emergent property of a market equilibrium in or near equilibrium. This poses questions as to whether the concept can be extended to other economic forms, such as central planning, or indeed can be applicable to a capitalist economy constantly in the process of self-transformative flux.
B13|Continuity or rupture ? An analysis of some aspects of social philosophy in the works of J.S.Mill, Alfred Marshall and J.M.Keynes|It is argued in this paper that it’s possible to speak of a ‘tradition’ in the field of social and economic philosophy uniting the works of J.S.Mill, Alfred Marshall and John Maynard Keynes. This ‘tradition’ can be characterized by the following concepts: (a) by the rejection of the acquisitive values of capitalism; (b) by the idea that capitalism would be incapable of spontaneously solving the problems of distribution of wealth and poverty; (c) by the idea that, for the sake of the preservation of liberty, diversity and economic efficiency, individual initiative should be free to act wherever it engenders good results, but that the State should intervene whenever the free initiative fails, acting in the good of collectivity; (d) by the belief that it would be possible to make capitalism significantly better by the way of small and gradual changes.
B13|Retrospectives: Irving Fisher's Appreciation and Interest (1896) and the Fisher Relation|"Irving Fisher's monograph Appreciation and Interest (1896) proposed his famous equation showing expected inflation as the difference between nominal interest and real interest rates. In addition, he drew attention to insightful remarks and numerical examples scattered through the earlier literature, and he derived results ranging from the uncovered interest arbitrage parity condition between currencies to the expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates. As J. Bradford DeLong wrote in this journal (Winter 2000), ""The story of 20th century macroeconomics begins with Irving Fisher"" and specifically with Appreciation and Interest because ""the transformation of the quantity theory of money into a tool for making quantitative analyses and predictions of the price level, inflation, and interest rates was the creation of Irving Fisher."" I discuss the message of Appreciation and Interest, and assess how original he was."
B13|On the cyclical variability of economic growth in Italy, 1881–1913: a critical note|Since the 1950s, beginning with Gerschenkron’s classic article, a great number of studies have examined Italy’s economic growth in the post-Unification period; and the quantitative evidence has been much improved, particularly by Fenoaltea. However, the cyclical variability of the Italian economy in the sub-period 1893–1913 is low, and apparently underestimated, in Fenoaltea’s reconstruction, whereas it was emphasized in the neglected qualitative–quantitative analyses conducted by Luigi Einaudi and his colleagues of the Turin school in the early twentieth century. This paper uses various advanced spectral methods to reconsider Italian economic growth and cycles in the post-Unification period, detecting in Italian GDP a significant structure which closely matches the Einaudians’ account of Italian development in the period 1881–1913.
B13|Institutional strengthening of the free market in the new economic history|The article highlights the current theories in the New Economic History, explaining the market social order rules imposed in the Western World in the post Renaissance period. The social order structure, based on impersonal exchange and rational prudence, differing from any other order in the history of human societies, is derived from a specific set of political and military conditions and world view. The institutional decisions taken as a result thereof enable the contemporary levels of production, trade and economic growth. The applied explanatory approach integrates on the ground of their common features the alternative concepts of this process elaborated by À. Greif, À. Acemoglu and J. Robinson, D. North, J.

In the Odyssey he specifically wrote about the minimum cost choice. This kind of problem, as is well known, is at the heart of the neoclassical economics. We can therefore consider Homer a forerunner of this school of thought. This hypothesis contrasts with those of Trever (1916), Schumpeter (1954) and Schefold (1997).
B13|Equilibrio parcial y general: dos problemas inquietantes|A pesar de los múltiples avances y modificaciones que ha sufrido la teoría microeconómicaneoclásica, sus dos modelos canónicos continúan siendo el de equilibrio parcial y el de equilibriogeneral. Contrario a lo que habitualmente se expone, existe abundante literatura que tornainsatisfactorios a ambos instrumentos analíticos. El presente ensayo intenta exponer algunosproblemas de la teoría microeconómica dominante recuperando los trabajos que nos parecencontienen los componentes más esenciales de las críticas desarrolladas hacia ambos paradigmas:los elementos aportados por Piero Sraffa; los Teoremas de Sonnenchein-Mantel-Debreu; yla imposibilidad de la teoría del equilibrio general tanto de poder ofrecer una explicación de laformación de precios como de modelar economías monetarias. Finalmente, la parte final del ensayoaborda brevemente si la teoría de juegos puede ser considerada como una salida satisfactoria a losdefectos de la teoría microeconómica convencional.
B13|The businessmen as knights of the social ideal: Alfred Marshall and the moralization of capitalism|This article studies the role of the businessmen in Marshall’s views on the progress towards the social ideal. The analysis is grounded on a perfectionist reappraisal of the Marshallian principle of justice supported by an historical perspective and some of Marshall’s unpublished papers. It updates and questions the broadening process of the economic chivalry of businessmen in the social space. More particularly, it pays attention to the evolutionist conception of morality which underlies this process.
B13|Negishi On Edgeworth On Jevons' Law Of Indifference, Walras’S Equilibrium, And The Role Of Large Numbers: A Critical Assessment|In developing their pure-exchange equilibrium models, Jevons [1871], Walras [1874–77], and Edgeworth [1881] make use of some version of a law, called law of indifference (or principle of uniformity) by Jevons and Edgeworth and often referred to as the law of one price in connection with Walrasian economics. Edgeworth, in particular, shares with Jevons the idea that the law of indifference must be regarded as an equilibrium property; unlike his predecessor, however, he denies the validity of the law in all economies with a finite number of traders: for him, price uniformity can only emerge and a Jevonsian or Walrasian or competitive equilibrium can only be established when the traders’ number grows unboundedly large. About one century later, Negishi [1982] resumes the time-honoured discussion about the law, striving to prove that, contrary to Edgeworth’s original conjecture, a competitive equilibrium can be attained even in small economies, provided that the true driving force underlying Jevons’s law of indifference, namely, its implicit arbitrage mechanism, be allowed to operate and carry its effects through. In this paper, after reconstructing Jevons’s, Walras’s, and Edgeworth’s respective positions, we critically discuss Negishi’s critique of Edgeworth’s stance on Jevons’s law of indifference, Walras’s equilibrium, and the role of large numbers, showing that his central claim is unsubstantiated.
B13|Competition: The Ways To Perfection|In the economic literature of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, perfect competition rests on essentially two different types of foundations, the distinction of which has not always been emphasized enough. According to the first type, perfect competition prevails when the agents, small relative to the market, completely lack the power to influence their environments, be it in a cooperative or a non-cooperative context. According to the second, perfect competition results from the agents’ normal conduct, independently of their size: either peaceful price taking or, on the contrary, aggressive undercutting. The paper reviews and compares briefly these different categories of foundations.
B13|Price-Takers Vs. Great Numbers: A Critique Of The Edgeworth - Walras Convergence À La Debreu - Scarf|We discuss the traditional interpretation of Edgeworth’s conception of competition neo-Walrasian authors developed following the Debreu-Scarf ’s theorem legacy. This interpretation presents Edgeworth as the forerunner of the cooperative-games approach based on the notion of the core as a solution concept. We appraise those notions using Edgeworth’s texts. This allows us to plead in favour of Edgeworth’s originality and of the need to rescue his theory of perfect competition from a misleading way. Textual evidence allows us to assert that the language of the cooperative game theory, and the subsequent modern theory of the core, do not correspond to Edgeworth’s theory. The modern notion of coalition seems to be an interpretation of Edgeworth’s concept of “combination” and of “cooperative associations.” Both notions deeply differ from the traditional concept of coalition when one examines them more carefully. Edgeworth clearly establishes a difference between a group of agents entering in a series of bilateral contract relations and a “combination.” The logic of the former is purely individual in the sense of an individual improvement accepting bilateral contracts within a new group rather than the bilateral contracts she have formerly agreed within another group. In fact, within the new improving-group all contracts continue to be bilaterally established and, more important, these kind of association does not necessary imply giving up all previous exchanges outside this group. From this alternative interpretation about Edgeworth’s notion of “combination” we extract a completely different conclusion than that implied by the coalitional formation presented in the cooperative game theoretical framework. In this framework, the core of an economy is simply reduced by the presence of an increasing number of agents forming this kind of coalitions. From the Egeworthian point of view, the number of agents does not per se guaranteed the increasing of competition when this kind of cooperative arrangement is the rule.
B13|Economics and reality|This paper is a non-technical and somewhat philosophical essay, that seeks to investigate the relationship between economics and reality. More precisely, it asks how reality in the form of empirical evidence does or does not influence economic thinking and theory. In particular, which role do calibration, statistical inference, and structural change play? What is the current state of affairs, what are the successes and failures, what are the challenges? I shall tackle these questions moving from general to specific. For the general perspective, I examine the following four points of view. First, economics is a science. Second, economics is an art. Third, economics is a competition. Forth, economics is politics. I then examine four specific cases for illustration and debate. First, is there a Phillips curve? Second, are prices sticky? Third, does contractionary monetary policy lead to a contraction in output? Forth, what causes business cycles? The general points as well as the specific cases each have their own implication for the central question at hand. Armed with this list of implications, I shall then attempt to draw a summary conclusion and provide an overall answer.
B13|Revisiting Adam Smith's theory of the falling rate of profit|Purpose - This paper aims to present the salient features of Smith's argument of the falling rate of profit. This theory has usually been interpreted as a result of the intensification of competition in the markets of goods and services of the factors of production. This aspect of Adam Smith had been initially posed by Ricardo and subsequently was widely adopted by the major economists of the past as well as from the majority of the modern historians of economic thought. Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews the major interpretation of the argument from Ricardo and Marx as well as from major historians of economic thought, and then attempts to reconstruct Smith's argument, which is scattered throughout the Findings - In the author's view, Smith's analysis of the falling tendency in the rate of profit is by far more complex than usually presented and that the intensification of competition is the result of the falling rate of profit rather than its cause which is the capitalization of the production process. Originality/value - This paper presents a review of existing literature and an interpretation of Adam Smith's original model of the falling rate of profit.
B13|War and the Austrian School|The Austrian school of economics increasingly has become identified with antiwar groups. This is not due to religious or political views. Rather, the antiwar viewpoints of the Austrians come from the fundamental tenets of economics as expressed by the school’s founders and refined for 140 years. This article applies post-WWII Austrian thought to the subject of war.
B13|Dostoyevski'nin İktisadi Yaklaşımı ve İktisadi Aklın Eleştirisi|İlgi alanının sınırlarının dışıyla ilgisini kesmiş neoklasik iktisadın iktisadi düşünce üzerindeki belirleyiciliğini göz önüne aldığımızda iktisadi düşünceye dair yeni düşünceler geliştirme yolunda komşu sosyal bilim disiplinlerinin kaynaşmasının ne denli önemli olduğu görülür. Bize göre edebiyatın da bu amaç yolunda yararı yadsınamaz. Bu bakımdan homo economicus ve ortodoks iktisat her ne kadar farklı birçok alternatif iktisat yaklaşımınca eleştiriliyorsa da Dostoyevski’nin Yeraltından Notlar’ı eleştirel politik ekonominin bu konulara yaklaşımına önemli katkı sunar. Yazıda anaakım iktisatta, sosyal ve siyasal düşüncede homo economicus’un yeri ana hatlarıyla belirtildikten sonra Dostoyevski’nin Yeraltı İnsanı üzerinden geliştirdiği homo economicus eleştirisinin ışığında iktisadi düşünce için gerçekçi bir insan tipinin görünümleri ve karakteri incelenmektedir.
B13|Marshall on Progress and People's Welfare|The paper focuses on Marshall’s ideas of the economic and socio-ethical progress, of the development of man’s higher faculties, and of people’s welfare and improvement of their quality of life. The studies on economic and social progress with prospects for the elimination of human poverty and the higher development of human faculties, were ‘the high theme’ and the crucial ideas of his whole economics writings of Marshall. For him ‘the solution of economic problems was not an application of the hedonistic calculus, but a prior condition of the exercise of man’s higher faculties’. The paper stresses a nonutilitarian perspective. The first section examines the man’s economic conditions and human character, work and life, economic and ethical progress. Then the second section discusses about the ideas moralizing capitalism and citizenship, which is followed by the section on education and strength of the people; and supported by the discussions on the cumulative effects of people’s wages in the final section.
B13|Technological Effects on Wages and Labour: Classical and Neoclassical Ideas|The introduction of new technology may have significant effects on the level of employment and the real wage rate; effects that have received considerable attention even from the economic thinkers of the classical period. This paper aims to analyze and evaluate the various views and arguments of early classical and neoclassical economists concerning the technological effects on wages and employment. On the one hand, the economists of the early decades of the 19th century (mainly between 1800 and 1840) had recognized and analyzed many of the effects of technology on labourers’ welfare. On the other hand, early neoclassical theorists of the period between 1890 and 1935 tried to expand on the classical views and to develop their own theoretical arguments, based on new perceptions like the marginal productivity theory. The main conclusion drawn is that most of early classical and neoclassical economists recognized and specified the temporary adverse effects of new technology on labour (e.g. short-run unemployment), but, at the same time, they argued for the beneficial long-run consequences of technological progress on labourers’ welfare.
B13|Adolphe Landry and Otto Effertz: Lessons from a Debate|"In his work Arbeit und Boden (Labor and Land) (1889) Otto Effertz outlined the foundations of a ""Ponophysiocracy"". This book which in its final, strongly modified version Les Antagonismes économiques was published in 1906, had a stronger impact on Adolphe Landry, who praises as well as criticizes the work of the German author who spent a greater part of his life in Paris. Both economists were strongly interested in the conflict between the private and the social interest. They belong to the small group of socialists who early on took notice of the development of marginalism in their economic theories but, in contrast to Walras and Pareto, did not enter into a mathematical analysis."
B13|Competition and Justice in the Works of Adolphe Landry and Léon Walras|This article revisits the reasons why Leon Walras did not give enough consideration to the economic and social analysis of Adolphe Landry. Both were fervent defenders of socialism and their recommendations for social economics are based on thorough economic analysis. We show that Walras did not evaluate Landry’s work fairly because of various methodological inconsistencies and different assessments of the forms of competition and resulting rules related to distributive justice.
B13|Adolphe Landry and Irving Fisher on Circulation and Interest|In the two decades before World War I, Irving Fisher and his French contemporary Adolphe Landry presented and extended Boehm-Bawerk’s theory capital and interest, although both of them criticized Boehm-Bawerk’s concept of an average period of production. They analyzed each other’s work on interest theory in books reviews and books. They both attempted to construct an operationally meaninful version of the quantity theory of money, with Fisher building explicitly on early studies by Landry and Pierre des Essars in France and by Edwin Kemmerer and David Kinley in the US.
B13|Adolphe Landry’s Theory of Profits|The paper provides a critical assessment of Adolphe Landry’s contributions to the theory of capital and interest. His analysis represents one among several variants of marginal productivity theory. The distinguishing feature of his variant is that he considers entrepreneurship a scarce factor of production alongside with the usual factors labour, land and capital. He thus tries to put entrepreneurship - the innovative agens, as Schumpeter saw it - into the Procrustean bed of marginalist theory. It is not clear whether Landry’s combination of various ideas to be found in the contemporary literature generates a coherent whole, because his argument is often suggestive and vague and lacks analytical rigour.
