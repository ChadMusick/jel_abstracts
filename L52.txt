L52|Do enterprise zones promote local business development? Evidence from Vietnam|We examined the effects of Vietnamese enterprise zones on local businesses based on different patterns of place-based policies as well as the ownership structure of the zone infrastructure developers (ZIDs). We constructed a panel of communes during 2000-2007 using a census survey of firms having more than nine employees and a census of zones and zone-based firms. We found that place-based policies led to growth in the number of jobs and firms in the communes where enterprise zones were located, even after excluding zone-based firms. Our findings also suggest that privately owned ZIDs worked best under corporate-tax incentives, while zones with a designated central government agency as the ZID had adverse spillover effects on business development in neighboring communes of the same district.
L52|Designing an Industrial Policy for Developing Countries: a New Approach|"In this study, the prevalent methodology for design of the industrial policy in developing countries was critically assessed, and it was shown that the mechanism and content of classical method is fundamentally contradictory to the goals and components of the endogenous growth theories. This study, by proposing a new approach, along settling Schumpeter's economic growth theory as a policy framework, designed the process of entering, analyzing and processing data as the mechanism of the industrial policy in order to provide ""theoretical consistency"" and ""technical and Statistical requirements"" for targeting the growth stimulant factor effectively."
L52|Industrial Policy for Innovative Companies: A Theoretical Approach (in Korean)|In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the government's role in supporting innovative companies that will lead the Fourth Industrial Revolution is growing. This paper introduces the results of recent studies into the government¡¯s industrial policies. It examines the mechanisms that enable the supply of sufficient funds for the development of innovative technologies through a theoretical model, and then draws policy implications. Extending loans to innovative industries is likely to result in insufficient lending to emerging innovators. This is due to poaching externality that focuses on entrepreneurs with good repayment histories of existing loans. There may be an equilibrium where funding to the innovative industries cannot be achieved at all. This implies that if private financial institutions only play a role of supplying funds to innovative companies, a smooth supply of funds to innovative companies may not be attained. Therefore, the government needs to implement industrial policies to facilitate investment in innovative industries.
L52|Challenges for EU Merger Control|The proposal to relax EU merger control to allow for anti-competitive ô€‡²European Championsô€‡³ may lead policy makers to update current merger control. While we see little merit in this specific proposal, we recommend a revision that goes into a different direction and, in particular, addresses mergers of potential competitors and the burden of proof. Thus, our proposal aims at the EC addressing problems of under-enforcement and making better-informed decisions. However, we would find it sensible to introduce in the Merger Regulation a clause whereby in exceptional and well-defined cases a merger, which would otherwise pass muster on competition grounds, may be prohibited due to defence, strategic and security of supply considerations.
L52|Tales of the City: What Do Agglomeration Cases Tell Us About Agglomeration in General?|This paper considers the heterogeneous microfoundations of agglomeration economies. It studies the co-location of industries to look for evidence of labor pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers. The novel contribution of the paper is that it estimates single-industry models using a common empirical framework that exploits the cross-sectional variation in how one industry co-locates with the other industries in the economy. This unified approach yields evidence on the relative importance of the Marshallian microfoundations at the single-industry level, allowing for like-for-like cross-industry comparisons on the determinants of agglomeration. Using UK data, we estimate such microfoundations models for 97 manufacturing sectors, including the classic agglomeration cases of automobiles, computers, cutlery, and textiles. These four cases – as with all of the individual industry models we estimate – clearly show the importance of the Marshallian forces. However, they also highlight how the importance of these forces varies across industries – implying that extrapolation from cases should be viewed with caution. The paper concludes with an investigation of the pattern of heterogeneity. The degree of an industry’s clustering (localization), dynamism, incumbent firm size, and worker education are shown to contribute to the pattern of heterogeneous microfoundations.

L52|Some Causal Effects of an Industrial Policy|We exploit changes in the area-specific eligibility criteria for a program to support jobs through investment subsidies. European rules determine whether an area is eligible for subsidies, and we construct instrumental variables for area eligibility based on parameters of these rule changes. Areas eligible for higher subsidies significantly increased jobs and reduced unemployment. A ten-percentage point increase in the maximum investment subsidy stimulates a 10% increase in manufacturing employment. This effect exists solely for small firms: large companies accept subsidies without increasing activity. There are positive effects on investment and employment for incumbent firms but not Total Factor Productivity.
L52|Demographic Aging, Industrial Policy, and Chinese Economic Growth|We examine the role of demographics and changing industrial policies in accounting for the rapid rise in household savings and in per capita output growth in China since the mid-1970s. The demographic changes come from reductions in the fertility rate and increases in life expectancy, while the industrial policies take many forms. These policies cause important structural changes; first benefiting private labor-intensive firms by incentivizing them to increase their share of employment, and later on benefiting capital-intensive firms resulting in an increasing share of capital devoted to heavy industries. We conduct our analysis in a general equilibrium economy that also features endogenous human capital investment. We calibrate the model to match key economic variables of the Chinese economy and show that demographic changes and industrial policies both contributed to increases in savings and output growth but with differing intensities and at different horizons. We further demonstrate the importance of endogenous human capital investment in accounting for the economic growth in China.
L52|Small and Mid-Sized Business as a Factor of Economic Growth in Russia|The present edition includes two papers by the leading experts of the Gaidar Institute for Economic Policy. The papers in question are based on the outputs of research carried out by the Gaidar Institute in 2018. Both the papers deal with operation of the sector of small and mid-sized business (SMB). In the first paper – “The Statistics of the Sector of Small and Mid-Sized Business in Russia and the World” – the authors note that there are serious differences in the methods of calculating statistical indices related to the SMB sector and definition criteria. Without understanding those differences, there is no point in inter-country statistical comparison. Utilization of international experience in facilitating and promoting the SMB sector suggests that there is clear awareness of the differences in this sector’s definition criteria and, consequently, statistical data published in international organizations’ reports. In the other paper – “Comparative Analysis of the Government’s Support to Exports by Small and Mid-Sized Businesses in the Regional Aspect” – the authors elaborate on the existing patterns of support to exports in Russia and point to serious disadvantages which largely prevent small and mid-sized businesses from engaging in export activities. The methods of analyzing the assessment of the impact of export support measures at the regional level on the volumes both of the overall regional exports and exports by small and mid-sized businesses are based on econometric models.
L52|Russian industrial sector in 2018: slowdown of exiting from stagnation of 2012–2016 (on business surveys’ findings)|Prolonged period of industrial business surveys conducted by the Gaidar Institute and representative range of indicators permit to resolve the first task – analyze the situation in the sector in 2018 – determine the place for the year 2018 in all the 27 years since the IET launched and carried out business surveys between 1992–2018. For this purpose, we will use aggregate indicators. The latter are usually calculated on a monthly basis on the findings obtained from monthly surveys. They became widely popular owing to promptness of the findings and shortage of data released on the Russian industrial sector. However, this approach to present surveys’ findings complicates assessment of each year as a whole. That is why we analyze all consolidated indicators in a year-on-year basis
L52|Government support of small and medium sized entrepreneurship in Russia|Support of the small and medium sized entrepreneurship (SME) sector is recognized to be one of Russia’s economic policy priorities2,3. It is customary to speak of that sector’s low level of development compared with other countries. However, when comparable estimates are applied, the gap does not appear to be catastrophic. The relative share of SMEs in the value added produced by Russia’s business sector amounts to about 44 percent, in the developed countries – OECD member states it amounts on average to 55 percent, in the USA – to 48 percent, and in Canada – to 30 percent. The problems faced by Russian SMEs, in qualitative terms, are as follows: the percentage of exporters and technological startups is low, and a greater part of that sector is unregulated; in 2018, the relative share of medium sized firms and the number of technological startups shrank even further. The conditions for and specific features of the SME sector’s development vary across Russia’s regions, and this fact is completely overlooked by prevailing legislation. According to our estimations, entrepreneurial activity in the regions does not depend on government support, instead responding to macroeconomic and institutional changes. In 2018, in a majority of Russian regions, the number of SME subjects and their turnover declined in response to shrinking personal income, especially in the regions with a high relative share taken up by the shadow sector, while the same indices increased in those regions that hosted the FIFA World Cup events.
L52|Intended and unintended effects of public incentives for innovation. Quasi-experimental evidence from Italy|This paper provides an extensive empirical evaluation of a policy introduced in Italy at the end of 2012 to incentivize young innovative start-up firms. Using a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) we estimate the causal effects of the policy on the firms’ share of intangible assets, turnover, number of employees, and number of partners. Our results indicate that two years after its implementation the policy was effective only in increasing the number of partners, thus attracting private investments, but failed, at least in the short run, in boosting innovation or increasing employment. It follows that the new investors generated by the policy might have been attracted only by the tax benefit and had little interest in innovation.

L52|Externalities, entry bias and optimal subsidy policy in oligopoly|This article analyses alternative subsidy schemes and long-run entry bias in a new industry that creates positive environmental externalities. It demonstrates that per unit subsidy scheme, despite attracting fewer firms, results in higher industry output and economic surplus in the equilibrium compared to the expenditure equivalent lump-sum subsidy scheme. However, the later leads to higher total surplus, unless spill-over externalities is sufficiently small. Further, free entry equilibrium number of firms may be excessive or insufficient. The first best equilibrium outcome can be implemented through a unique combination of per unit subsidy and lump sum subsidy/tax, which involves positive government expenditure.
L52|Realising regional potentials through better market integration in China|China’s regions have been experiencing impressive growth over the past decades, but their potentials could be better exploited by creating a single product and labour market. Local protectionism increases transaction costs and hinders competition, thereby taking a toll on productivity. Administrative monopolies have long thrived and are hard to dismantle. Restrictions on the hukou and the fragmented pension system limit labour mobility. Local regulations aim at, among other things, securing the collection of local taxes, without which cities could not afford to offer the same public services to migrants as to urbanites. Hence, dismantling local regulations and creating a single product and labour market needs to go hand-in-hand with the reform of inter-governmental finances. Recent measures on both the product and labour market front appear to aim at making up for the slow progress over the past decade or so. There are signs that these efforts are helping China’s regions at various levels to converge toward each other. Disparities are shrinking faster across provinces, compared to within provinces. Integration of product and labour markets will boost productivity over the medium-to long term by reducing transaction costs, but could potentially widen regional disparities, which are already relatively high. This will necessitate enhanced transfers and re-centralisation of the financing of spending in some key categories such as education and health. Policies to help catching up of laggard regions by better connectivity through infrastructure investment are bearing fruit, but such investments should be subject to rigorous cost-benefit criteria to enhance capital allocation efficiency and should take into account externalities. Notwithstanding significant disparities along multiple dimensions across provinces, inequalities, be it in terms of income, wealth or education, are actually most striking along the rural-urban dimension. The rural revitalisation strategy, a novel element of the 19th Party Congress outcomes, is expected to address this issue. The other recent strategy of nurturing the formation of city groups will also likely benefit rural areas in-between those cities.This Working Paper relates to the 2019 OECD Economic Survey of China (http://www.oecd.org/economy/china-economic-snapshot/).
L52|Analysing IoT cyber risk for estimating IoT cyber insurance|This paper is focused on mapping the current evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) and its associated cyber risks for the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) sector. We report the results of a qualitative empirical study that correlates academic literature with 14 - I4.0 frameworks and initiatives. We apply the grounded theory approach to synthesise the findings from our literature review, to compare the cyber security frameworks and cyber security quantitative impact assessment models, with the world leading I4.0 technological trends. From the findings, we build a new impact assessment model of IoT cyber risk in Industry 4.0. We therefore advance the efforts of integrating standards and governance into Industry 4.0 and offer a better understanding of economics impact assessment models for I4.0.

L52|Cambodian place in the International trade of Textile and Clothing: Threat and Opportunity|This paper analyzes the threat and opportunity of textiles and clothing industry in Cambodia by employing SWOT analysis, quantitative method of revealed comparative and competitive advantage. The findings reveal that Cambodia has both comparative and competitive advantage of garment industry comparing to another Asian garment exporting countries-namely India, Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam, except Bangladesh. Whereas the Cambodian textile industry experiences both comparative and competitive disadvantage as it obtains the lowest score among counties in this study. Our analysis shows that the Cambodian T&S sector faces the risk of EBA, negative impact on the US-China trade war. Vietnam’s readiness, along with good trade policy between India and Bangladesh, is also has a negative impact on Cambodia. Cambodia must consider long-term and medium-term strategies to expand competitiveness for T&S exports. Nevertheless, the term of trade could obtain positive growth since the price of garment and textile products experiences an increasing trend.
L52|Culture and authenticity: regulating shadow economy to foster market growth|Competition in the cultural and creative industries is much dependent upon product and service differentiation. Differentiation is about the unique features that are embedded in the cultural products themselves. These unique features relate to and determine, the value that consumers ascribe to cultural products. Authenticity is commonly used to underlie the uniqueness of a cultural product and is thus a sign of a thing worthy of admiration. Within this context the current study undertakes a comparison of practices related to the way in which authenticity in the paintings’ market is handled. The aim is to sketch policy interventions for effectively regulating the shadow economy in this market. It is argued that good regulations are necessary and if enforced, positive outcomes in terms of the paintings’ market turnover and employment levels might be generated. In particular, we discuss interventions that would transform the threat of an illegal fake market into an opportunity for market growth through the development of a ‘parallel authentic copy market’. Under certain conditions such a policy intervention could have direct and indirect positive effects via: a) the incorporation of an important part of the activities of the shadow economy in the official market, b) the use of a parallel market to protect consumers and their welfare and c) the use of the parallel market to strategically foster growth in the cultural industry at large. Given the economic significance of the cultural industries at both the national and the EU level and the commitment of the later to support the industry’s growth insights, as to how we might best regulate the market in line with such directions, are critical.
L52|The Reformed EU ETS - Intertemporal Emission Trading with Restricted Banking|With the increase of the linear reduction factor (LRF), the implementation of the market stability reserve (MSR) and the introduction of the cancellation mechanism (CM), the EU ETS changed fundamentally. We develop a discrete time model of the intertemporal allowance market that accurately depicts these reforms assuming that prices develop with the Hotelling rule as long as the TNAC is non-empty. A sensitivity analysis ensures the robustness of the model results regarding its input parameters. The accurate modelling of the EU ETS allows for a decomposition of the eﬀects of the individual amendments and the evaluation of the dynamic eﬃciency. The MSR shifts emissions to the future but is allowance preserving. The CM reduces the overall emission cap, increasing allowance prices in the long run, but does not signiﬁcantly impact the emission and price path in the short run. The increased LRF leads with 9 billion cancelled allowances to a stronger reduction than the CM and is therefore the main price driver of the reform.
L52|Optimal certification policy, entry, and investment in the presence of public signals|We explore the optimal disclosure policy of a certification intermediary in an environment where (i) the seller's decision on entry and investment in product quality are endogenous and (ii) the buyers observe an additional public signal on quality. The intermediary mutes the seller's entry incentives but enhances investment incentives following entry, and the optimal policy maximizes rent extraction from the seller in the face of this trade-off. We identify conditions under which full, partial or no disclosure can be optimal. The intermediary's report becomes noisier as the public signal gets more precise, but if the public signal becomes too precise, the intermediary resorts to full disclosure. In the presence of an intermediary, a more precise public signal may also lead to lower social welfare.
L52|Environmental performances in Europe: An empirical analysis of the convergence among manufacturing sectors|?This study focuses on the environmental performances of the European manu?facturing industry. Our aim is to test the existence of both absolute and conditional ? ? ?-convergence as well as ? ? ?-convergence in the environmental productivity (i.e., for each sector, the ratio between value added and carbon dioxide emissions) of fourteen sectors for the period 1995-2009 using data from the WIOD database. The results support the hypothesis of ? ? ?-convergence and highlight other factors such as trade openness. In addition, the results indicate that the sectorial share of value added can affect sectorial environmental performances, as shown by a higher speed of convergence. No statistical evidence of ? ? ?-convergence is found.?
L52|Capabilities and firm growth: the role of formal collaboration agreements|The paper presents an empirical analysis of the effect of formal network agreements on growth of firm in Italy in the years 2011-2013. The theoretical background is given by evolutionary theories that assign a key role in determining the ability of firms to capture business opportunities to internal capabilities and to external knowledge and capabilities. We suggest that firms establishing formal relationships with other firms can extend the â€œset of things that they are able to doâ€ â€“the set of capabilitiesâ€“ so that they are able to capture opportunities and grow. The study is based on a novel database of Italian firms that matches networked firms in year 2012 with firms that did not sign a formal network agreement but possess similar structural characteristics. In order to deal with possible self-selection phenomenon, we use difference-in-differences regression models to assess the effect on growth of belonging to a formal network agreement. Moreover, to study the effect of characteristics of network we employ two stage Hackman regression models. Results show that networked firms have a higher growth rate and that the size of the network plays a role. Results are in line with the evolutionary interpretation and suggest that formal network agreement can function as long-range antennas for firms that are more constrained from the geographical point of view. These agreements allow to acquire capabilities and knowledge of the market that allow firms to expand their economic activity.
L52|Proprietà e controllo delle grandi imprese: un’interpretazione del resistibile declino italiano|Il capitalismo italiano si presenta nel dopoguerra con un ampio settore di grandi imprese pubbliche che garantiscono una separazione estrema fra proprietà e controllo e altrimenti con imprese, anche di grande dimensione, solo a conduzione familiare. Diversamente da altri paesi capitalistici, è assente nel settore privato del capitalismo italiano una modalità organizzativa che consenta di gestire le imprese a persone capaci ma prive della ricchezza necessaria per controllarle. Le privatizzazioni, fatte senza una adeguata riforma del governo societario delle grandi imprese private, hanno paradossalmente confermato l’importanza delle imprese pubbliche per il contesto italiano. Il capitalismo privato italiano non solo non riesce a generare un numero soddisfacente di grandi imprese , ma finisce con il gestire peggio dello Stato le imprese pubbliche che vengono privatizzate. Al contrario, le imprese trasformate in società per azioni, di cui lo Stato ha mantenuto direttamente o indirettamente il controllo, sono ora meno gravate da obiettivi politici impropri e riescono a tornare al loro iniziale obiettivo di separare proprietà e controllo, favorendo così l’affermarsi di organizzazioni di grande dimensione. Il declino italiano è dovuto a una struttura di imprese troppo piccole, a regole che non incentivano il passaggio a grandi imprese manageriali, alla convinzione che la piccola dimensione fosse il futuro della cosiddetta economia della conoscenza e alla incapacità di comprendere che le privatizzazioni avrebbero aggravato questi problemi dimensionali. In assenza di lavori qualificati offerti da grandi imprese, molti giovani italiani sono stati costretti a emigrare. Il resistibile declino italiano può solo essere fermato con politiche che tengano conto delle lezioni che ci ha fornito la nostra storia più recente.
L52|Greece as a bridge to the most vibrant region of the next decades|In the years following the financial crisis, Greece experienced a severe loss in real per capita income and accumulated a public debt much higher than GDP and that of any other EU country. The article briefly analyses the causes of this development, including the policy failures of Greece and the EU. It develops a game-changing strategy, which could return the country to a growth path. This starts with the vision that Greece can make use of its unique location between Europe, Asia and Africa to build a bridge connecting these regions with fascinating and productive complementarities. Given this new strategy, including regional leadership in decarbonisation, youth reform boards, and the Greek diaspora as a manager of reforming and financing new activities, Europe should cut a substantial part of the debt. This would be in the interest of Greece, the EU and Europe´s neighbours.
L52|Public Policy Targets in EU Broadband Markets: The Role of Technological Neutrality|The European Commission has recently sought to substantially revise how it regulates the telecommunication industry, with a key goal being to incentivise investment in high-speed broadband networks. Ambitious goals have been set regarding the availability and quality of broadband across the European Union, initially in the 'Digital Agenda for Europe' and more recently in its 'Gigabit strategy'. These goals reflect the view of many that there are widespread and significant socio-economic benefits associated with broadband. Our analysis explores the consequence of target setting at a European level, in terms of encouraging investment and picking which technology should be adopted within the context of technological neutrality. We demonstrate that while public policy targets favour specific technologies, especially when the target is defined with regards to fast broadband speeds, the technological choices that occur within a Member State are shaped by the complex and dynamic interaction between a series of path dependencies that may vary significantly across as well as within Member States. Furthermore, taking into account the ecosystem's tremendous evolution, the technological choices that are made within markets reflect both demand and supply uncertainties. To assist with understanding the interaction between those forces that shape, to lesser or greater extent, the choice of one technology over another, we propose a four-phase framework. This framework is not a definitive statement of the relationships that we have identified, but rather serves as a mechanism that illustrates the challenges associated with adopting and then sticking with technological neutrality in policy making.
L52|Working Paper 303 - Industrial Policy and Late Industrialisation in Ethiopia|Ethiopia has emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa in the early twenty-first century. Despite this rapid growth, however, structural transformation of the economy remains the country’s central challenge. This paper reviews the origins of Ethiopia’s industrialization and industrial policymaking process in the 20th century. The Ethiopian government has pursued developmentalism and practiced an active industrial policy since the early 2000s. However, a review of industrial policies in various priority sectors shows that the outcome has been uneven across sectors, indicating the importance of the strong interaction between industrial structure, linkage dynamics, and politics/political economy for the evolution and effectiveness of an industrial policy. After examining the fundamental weakness in Ethiopia’s economic structure, this paper will illustrate why and how industrial policy must focus on manufacturing and exports to generate structural transformation and accelerate catch-up. The Ethiopian experience shows that an activist industrial policy goes hand in hand with an activist state.JEL classification: L16, L50, L52, 014, 025Keywords: Ethiopia, structural transformation, industrialization, industrial policy, policy learning, activist state, linkage effects, industrial parks.
L52|You are judged by the company you keep: Reputation leverage in vertically related markets|This paper analyzes a mechanism through which a supplier of unknown quality can overcome its asymmetric information problem by selling via a reputable downstream firm. The supplier’s adverse-selection problem can be solved if the downstream firm has established a reputation for delivering high quality with the supplier. The supplier may enter the market by initially renting the downstream firm’s reputation. The downstream firm may optimally source its input externally, even though sourcing internally would be better in terms of productive efficiency. Since an entrant in the downstream market may lack reputation, it may suffer from a reputational barrier to entry arising from higher input costs—this constitutes a novel theory of downstream barriers to entry.
L52|Economic dispatch in the electricity sector in China: potential benefits and challenges ahead|Unlike the economic dispatch used in most power systems, electricity system dispatch currently used in China is an equal share approach. This form of dispatch has been criticized for its negative influence on system operations, worsening energy security, environmental sustainability and affordability problems. To contribute to on-going electricity market reform discussions, our study employs an optimization model to quantify the economic dispatch savings in the coal-fired power sector. We offer three major findings. First, the heat rates of coal generators in China in 2014 ranged from 273.91 gce/kWh to 348.38 gce/kWh units and as a result of these large differences among generators in different regions, implementing economic (merit order) dispatch will bring economic and environmental benefits. Second, we identify three major political and economic challenges, which hinder the transition from the current dispatch model, namely (i) current running hours are insufficient for cost recovery, (ii) limited cross-border trading due to electricity over-supply and local protectionism, and (iii) political economy problems from generators of different ownership types. Finally, 5.67% of coal used in power generation could be saved if economic dispatch was employed at the provincial level, the value of which equals 0.05% of Chinese GDP in 2014.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L52|A Human Is Not a Resource|"The language of ""human resource management"" treats people as a means to an end. Three core tenets of human resource literature are that it is desirable to have (1) labour ""flexibility"" and ""mobility"" in a peripheral workforce, (2) individual (not social) responsibility for employment searching, and (3) a manager’s right to manage, without collective accountability. This article explores the cutting edge evidence, which show human resource theory harms productivity and human development. It explores the effects of ""HR"" in the UK, EU and international regulation on atypical work, full employment, and union voice. Where human resource beliefs have pervaded the most, the outcomes are the worst: lower productivity, higher unemployment, more inequality, less growth. To advance prosperity, economic risks must be distributed to the organisations best placed to bear them, people must have security to plan for the future, and people must have real votes at work through collective bargaining and corporate governance. Many people who themselves work in ""HR"" strongly disagree with the essential elements of their discipline. They support equality, security and democracy at work. Just as international law once affirmed that ""labour is not a commodity"", for social justice in the 21st century there must be a conviction that a human is not a resource. ""HR"" must change in name and substance, to advance human development and human rights."
L52|An Economic Analysis of Blockchains|The blockchain is a technology that goes beyond timestamping, bitcoin and secure financial transactions. The development of an ecosystem around smart connected objects will probably not happen without the blockchain (in one form or another). The blockchain opens the door to the liquification of the physical world, to the economy of real-time micro-transactions and to smart data sharing. However, it is necessary to distinguish between the different types of blockchains, especially between public and private blockchains, because their economic properties are contrasted. Moreover, governance issues in public blockchains seem to indicate that the technology alone cannot guarantee trust.
L52|Does state aid for broadband deployment in rural areas close the digital and economic divide?|We evaluate the impact of a major European state aid programme for speed upgrades in broadband internet availability applied to rural areas in the German state of Bavaria throughout 2010 and 2011. We use a matched difference-in-differences estimation strategy that compares treated and untreated municipalities that are balanced with respect to funding criteria. We find that aided municipalities have a significantly higher broadband coverage at higher speed than non-aided municipalities. This increase in broadband coverage does not, on average, benefit the local population in terms of increase in local jobs per resident or wages. However, these effects are heterogeneous across skill groups. Furthermore, we find positive effects on the employment rate among residents. Taking these results together suggests that an increase in broadband coverage through state aid protects rural areas from depopulation (while residents work at other locations), but does not contribute to a further closing of the economic divide in the form of creating new jobs.
L52|Transfer Pricing and the Arm's Length Principle under Imperfect Competition|This paper analyzes incentives of a multinational enterprise to manipulate an internal transfer price to take advantage of corporate-tax differences across countries under both monopoly and oligopoly. We examine “cost plus” and “comparable uncontrollable price” as two alternative implementations of the so-called arm's length principle (ALP) to mitigate this problem. Tax-induced foreign direct investment (FDI) may entail inefficient internal production. We show how the mechanisms behind such inefficient FDI differ between alternative implementation schemes of the ALP and explore implications of the ALP for welfare and dual sourcing incentives. We also develop a novel theory of vertical foreclosure as an equilibrium outcome of strategic transfer pricing.

L52|Towards economically dynamic Special Economic Zones in emerging countries|Despite a massive recent proliferation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs), there is virtually no quantitative research on what drives their dynamism. The aim of this paper is to address this gap and analyse the factors influencing SEZ performance ? proxied by economic growth ? in emerging countries. The paper relies on two novel datasets, using night-lights data to proxy for SEZ performance and containing a wide range of SEZ policy variables and characteristics across a large number of countries. The main results of the analysis indicate that a) zone growth is difficult to sustain over time; that b) trying to upgrade the technological component or value-added of the economy through SEZ policies is often challenging; and that c) zone size matters: larger zones have an advantage in terms of growth potential. Furthermore, country context significantly determines SEZ performance. Firms look for low cost locations, but in close proximity to large cities. Proximity to large markets as well as pre-existing industrialization also increase SEZ performance. In contrast, incentives and other program specific variables are highly context-specific and not structurally correlated with SEZ performance.
L52|The real exchange rate, innovation and productivity : regional heterogeneity, asymmetries and hysteresis|We evaluate manufacturing firms' responses to changes in the real exchange rate (RER) using detailed firm-level data for a large set of countries for the period 2001-2010. We uncover the following stylized facts: In export-oriented emerging Asia, real depreciations are associated with faster growth of firm-level TFP, higher sales and cash-flow, and higher probabilities to engage in R&D and to export. We find negative effects for firms in other emerging economies, which are relatively more import dependent, and no significant effects for firms in industrialized economies. Motivated by these facts, we build a dynamic model in which real depreciations raise the cost of importing intermediates, affect demand, borrowing-constraints and the profitability of engaging in innovation (R&D). We decompose the effects of RER changes on productivity growth across regions into these channels. We estimate the model and quantitatively evaluate the different mechanisms by providing counterfactual simulations of temporary RER movements and conduct several robustness analyses. Effects on physical TFP growth, while different across regions, are non-linear and asymmetric.
L52|Towards economically dynamic Special Economic Zones in emerging countries|Despite a massive recent proliferation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs), there is virtually no quantitative research on what drives their dynamism. The aim of this paper is to address this gap and analyse the factors influencing SEZ performance â€“ proxied by economic growth â€“ in emerging countries. The paper relies on two novel datasets, using night-lights data to proxy for SEZ performance and containing a wide range of SEZ policy variables and characteristics across a large number of countries. The main results of the analysis indicate that a) zone growth is difficult to sustain over time; that b) trying to upgrade the technological component or value-added of the economy through SEZ policies is often challenging; and that c) zone size matters: larger zones have an advantage in terms of growth potential. Furthermore, country context significantly determines SEZ performance. Firms look for low cost locations, but in close proximity to large cities. Proximity to large markets as well as pre-existing industrialization also increase SEZ performance. In contrast, incentives and other program specific variables are highly context-specific and not structurally correlated with SEZ performance.
L52|Economic dispatch in the electricity sector in China: potential benefits and challenges ahead|Unlike the economic dispatch used in most power systems, electricity system dispatch currently used in China is an equal share approach. This form of dispatch has been criticized for its negative influence on system operations, worsening energy security, environmental sustainability and affordability problems. To contribute to on-going electricity market reform discussions, our study employs an optimization model to quantify the economic dispatch savings in the coal-fired power sector. We offer three major findings. First, the heat rates of coal generators in China in 2014 ranged from 273.91 gce/kWh to 348.38 gce/kWh units and as a result of these large differences among generators in different regions, implementing economic (merit order) dispatch will bring economic and environmental benefits. Second, we identify three major political and economic challenges, which hinder the transition from the current dispatch model, namely (i) current running hours are insufficient for cost recovery, (ii) limited cross-border trading due to electricity over-supply and local protectionism, and (iii) political economy problems from generators of different ownership types. Finally, 5.67% of coal used in power generation could be saved if economic dispatch was employed at the provincial level, the value of which equals 0.05% of Chinese GDP in 2014.
L52|Russian industrial enterprises in 2017 (on business surveys’ findings)|This Chapter has been prepared on the results of business surveys of industrial enterprises which have been conducted by the Gaidar Institute using a European harmonized method in monthly cycles since September 1992, covering the entire territory of the Russian Federation. The panel size is around 1,000 enterprises employing over 13 percent of industrial employees. The panel is shifted towards large enterprises for each of the segregated sub-industries. The ratio of returned questionnaires is in the range of 70-75 percent
L52|Small and medium-sized enterprises in 2016–2017|Over the period 2016–2017, a number of specialized normative legal acts were introduced with the aim of developing the small and medium-sized business sector (SMB), including the SMB Development Strategy until 2030;[1] the SMB Corporation was set up;[2] and the creation of a basic support infrastructure was completed in many regions. The Single Register of SMB Subjects was introduced in order to follow the monthly movement of their basic indices. In 2017, 77.9 percent of all organizations and individual entrepreneurs (IEs) belonged to the category of SMB subjects, while at year-end 2016, the share of SMB subjects in the national average employment rate (calculated on the basis of their average staffing number index) amounted to 37.9 percent, and in the total turnover of enterprises and organizations – to 37.1 percent. The input of SMBs, IEs including, in GDP over the period from 2011 through 2016 jumped by 0.5 percentage points, and now amounts to approximately 20 percent.
L52|Divergence between the core and the periphery and secular stagnation in the Eurozone|In this paper, we provide empirical evidence about the widening divergence between the macroeconomic performances of core eurozone countries and peripheral economies. We note that, while core economies operate close to full employment, there are evident signs of secular stagnation, i.e. widespread long-term unemployment and reduced growth potential, in the periphery. In such a context, we stress that the unconventional monetary policy implemented by the European Central Bank since 2015 has proved largely ineffective to stimulate investment demand and economic recovery in the periphery. More than this, it may even deepen the existing gap between core and peripheral countries. We suggest that a reform of EU industrial policy, which put emphasis on the productive development of underdeveloped regions in the euro area, stands out as the best strategy against the eurozone core-periphery divide and for improving the functioning and effectiveness of EU macro policies.
L52|The unilateral accidenct model under a constrained Cournot-Nash duopoly|Summary: This paper extends the basic unilateral accident model to allow for Cournot competition. Two firms compete with production input and prevention as strategic variables under asymmetric capacity constraints. We find that liability regimes exert a crucial influence on the equilibrium price and outputs. Strict liability leads to higher output and higher risk compared to negligence. We also study the conditions under which both regimes converge. Key Words: Tort Law, Strict
L52|Cluster policy and firm performance: a case study of the French optic/photonic industry| This study analyzes the effects of a cluster policy on firms’ productivity, employment and total fixed assets in the French optic/photonic industry. Exploiting firm-level data between 1996 and 2008, it analyzes the selection process of the cluster policy through a logit model, before combining a propensity score matching (PSM) procedure and a difference-in-differences estimation to capture its impact on firms’ performance. It is shown that larger firms are more likely to be selected by the public policy. Second, the firms that received the competitiveness cluster certification became more productive and increased both their employment and their total fixed assets levels.
L52|Antidumping and Feed-In Tariffs as Good Buddies? Modeling the EU-China Solar Panel Dispute|The paper analyzes the interactions between trade and renewable energy policies based on the EU-China solar panel dispute which is the most significant antidumping (AD) complaint in Europe. We build a price competition duopoly model with differentiated products and intra-industry trade in photovoltaic (PV) equipment. We show that an optimal antidumping duty always increases with the feed-in tariff (FIT) program set in the home country. An appropriate antidumping duty - nullifying the dumping margin - decreases with the FIT program. We show that optimal FIT increases with the AD duty. Therefore, trade and renewable energy optimal policies may complement one another. Lastly, we introduce R&D activities in the PV sector, and international spillovers. We show that R&D makes the optimal FIT lower and increases the dumping margin. These effects are reinforced by technological spillovers.
L52|Impact sur l’emploi de la participation aux projets de R&D des pôles de compétitivité. Méthode et résultats|?Since their creation in 2005, competitiveness clusters have been defined as a structuring instrument of French industrial policy. From the implementation of an evaluation model that is well-identified in the literature, this work proposes a quantified estimation of the clusters? effects on employment for the companies taking part in R&D projects labeled by the clusters. This observation was carried out on the basis of the construction of an original database and the mobilization of a double difference evaluation method. This article highlights the positive and significant effect of French competitiveness clusters on employment.?
L52|Promoting Academic Engagement: University context and individual characteristics|This paper aims to explore the impact of organizational context on individuals’ industry activities in Chinese universities. Academic engagement, which includes collaborative research, contract research, consulting and other informal outreach activities, is posited as being jointly determined by organizational and individual level factors. Based on 564 Chinese scientists’ survey responses, our results show that scientists perceiving their university as having a strong entrepreneurial mission or supportive policy context are more active in academic engagement. This relationship is, however, moderated by individual-level factors. Specifically, entrepreneurially oriented university mission and supportive policy are more strongly associated with intra-individual differences in academic engagement for junior scientists, and for scientists with established personal networks to industry. Our analysis also shows that several individual-level predictors of academic engagement identified in studies set in Europe and the US carry over to the Chinese context.
L52|Transfer Pricing and the Arm's Length Principle under Imperfect Competition|This paper analyzes incentives of a multinational enterprise to manipulate an internal transfer price to take advantage of corporate-tax differences across countries under both monopoly and oligopoly. We examine “cost plus” and “comparable uncontrollable price” as two alternative implementations of the so-called arm’s length principle (ALP) to mitigate this problem. Tax-induced foreign direct investment (FDI) may entail inefficient internal production. We show how the mechanisms behind such inefficient FDI differ between alternative implementation schemes of the ALP and explore implications of the ALP for welfare and dual sourcing incentives. We also develop a novel theory of vertical foreclosure as an equilibrium outcome of strategic transfer pricing.
L52|Brilliant Technologies and Brave Entrepreneurs: A New Narrative for African Manufacturing|In this paper I argue that the manufacturing sector still has an important role to play in Africa's development. Despite failing to industrialize in the past, there may be a new window of opportunity. This is due to the convergence of what has been called 'brilliant' new technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and a resurgence of start-up entrepreneurship. In this light I (i) show why manufacturing is vital for African economies, (ii) critically analyse the nature and impact, both in terms of opportunities and risks, of the new technologies associated with the 4IR for Africa; (iii) describe the resurgence of technological start-up entrepreneurship in Africa and (iv) call for policy support in the form of complimentary investments and regulations to allow entrepreneurs to utilize opportunities and to minimize threats. In short, a new narrative for African manufacturing is possible.
L52|Marshallian vs Jacobs Effects: Which One Is Stronger? Evidence for Russia Unemployment Dynamics|This paper is devoted to the study of diversification and specialization influence on one of the main indicators of Russian labour market, the unemployment growth. The purpose of the work is to find out which effects dominate in the Russian regions, Marshallian or Jacobs, and whether this predominance is stable for different time intervals. The following hypotheses were empirically tested: 1) the dependence of the unemployment rate on the degree of concentration or diversification is non-monotonic due to possible overlapping effects of urbanization and localization; 2) the influence of the degree of concentration or diversification on the level of unemployment depends on the time period. To test these hypotheses nonparametric additive models with spatial effects were used. Both hypotheses found empirical confirmation. It was shown that in Russia, depending on the period, various effects dominated: in 2008-2010, and 2013-2016 Marshallian effects predominated, while in 2010-2013, Jacobs effects dominated.
L52|Public Funding and Corporate Innovation|We review and condense the body of literature on the economic returns of public R&D on private R&D and find that: (i) private returns to R&D appear to be large and larger than the returns to alternative investments; (ii) private R&D and R&D subsidies are positively correlated and there is no evidence for crowding out; (iii) R&D cooperation increases private R&D; (iv) there appear to exist complementarities between alternative sources of funding; (v) the mobility of R&D workers, particularly of university scientists, is positively related to innovation; (vi) there are many university spin-offs but these are no more successful than non-university spin-offs; (vii) universities constitute important collaboration partners and (viii) clusters enhance collaboration, patents and productivity. Key problems for economic policy advice are that the identification of causal effects is problematic in most studies and that little is known about the optimal design of policy measures.
L52|Integration of Small Technology-Based Firms in Aeronautics|This paper examines the role of small technology-based firms (TBF) in aeronautics industrialization processes. In particular, given the susceptibility of these firms to the changing nature of industrial production, it focuses on the integration and growth of small TBFs in aeronautics supply chains. We use the case study of Embraer, the Brazilian firm that leads the regional aircraft segment, to uncover processes through which small TBFs can integrate its supply chain, creating value and enhancing regional technological capabilities. This case is of particular relevance since Embraer pioneered the introduction of risk-sharing partnership for product development in aeronautics, followed by other aircraft manufacturers, which led to significant changes in the supply chains structures. Based on 100 semi-structured interviews with leading experts in Brazil and Portugal, our research shows that aeronautics inherent specificities impose several challenges to the integration and growth of small TBFs into the aeronautics supply chain. We identify 11 main challenges for the integration and growth of small TBF suppliers in aeronautics, and 5 major reasons why despite these challenges, some of these firms make the strategic decision of entering this sector. In addition, we argue that small TBFs should be promoted through regulatory frameworks that take into account the aircraft development process.
L52|Федеральное Агенство Развития. Оно Необходимо Для Разработки И Реализации Успешных Стратегий<BR>[Federal development agency. It is necessary to design and implement successful strategies]|It is shown that in the success of catching-up development, an important role was played by special structures - general development agencies- that coordinated the activities of ministries and offices. The functions of such agencies are considered, the main tasks that the similar Russian Federal Development Agency (FDR) should solve, are described. The creation in late 2016 of the Department of Project Activities of the Government Office of the Russian Federation can be considered as the first stage of the creation of FDR. A number of further steps are proposed for its formation.
L52|The impact of market deregulation on milk price: A dynamic panel data approach|The scope of this paper is to investigate the impact of market deregulation on the competitiveness of raw milk producers in Greece along the suggested lines of OECD (OECD, 2014). The study uses a dynamic panel data approach, to assess changes in the relative competitiveness of milk producers as a result of certain deregulation policies imposed by the Greek government in two phases (May 2014 and September 2015). In order to account for the presence of cross-sectional dependence and non-stationarity, the empirical analysis implements novel panel econometric methodology namely Common Correlated Effects (CCE) and Augmented Mean Group estimators (AMG). Our sample uses micro level data drawn from the 45 Greek regions spanning the period from January 2010 to October 2017. By comparing the wholesale prices of milk affected by regulation before and after the policy changes, we infer that abolishing regulation led to an increase in the prices of the wholesalers and thus in their profitability levels. Moreover, we argue that the openness of the relevant milk market segment had significant implications to the level of competition in the sector. Lastly, our empirical findings which confirm the OECD competition guidelines in the milk sector remain rather robust under different empirical methodologies and sample splitting, providing a focal point to policy makers and government officials for the ex-post evaluation of the deregulation strategies.
L52|Proposed Methodology for Strategic Trade Policy to Achieve High Value Added Exports: A Case of Pakistan’s Textile Sector|This paper proposes a new methodology through which a list of specific intermediate inputs can be generated for a strategic reduction in tariff rates to climb up the export value chain. This methodology can be extended across all the manufacturing sectors in countries where the technology is constrained and the economy relies on great chunk of imported goods. We argue that by reducing the tariffs on selective range of inputs; low priced, high quality intermediate inputs can be made available to the local manufacturer that will lead to better quality exports of the final product. We take a conservative approach to propose a sequence of tariff reduction on intermediate inputs based upon its importance ranging from a scale of being extremely important to less important, ultimately to promote high value added exports. We do so, by comparing the average quality of each respective intermediate input available to the local manufacturer with the quality of the same intermediate input imported from abroad to strategically propose the final list of intermediate inputs that should be considered for tariff reduction (at HS-6 Digit Code). Next, a cross country comparison of tariff rates between Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka is done to show where the potential of tariff reductions exist for Pakistan. Finally, this list at HS-6 digit code is extended at HS-8 digit code to further precisely identify the inputs. We present the case of Pakistan’s textile sector, and apply this methodology as an illustration to identify a list of intermediate inputs for strategic reductions in tariffs.
L52|Back in Business: Industrial Policy for Emerging Economies in the New Globalization|We explore the potential roles of industrial policy in the transition from middle-income to high-income status, and the actual experience of industrial policy in emerging economies. Guided by the conceptual framework of the neo-Schumpeterian approach, we look at industrial policy in the context of structural transformation, i.e., in transforming economic structures as well as the institutions supporting these structures. Today’s emerging economies face a dual structural transformation challenge: (i) to move closer to the current world technology frontier (traditional catch-up), and (ii) to adjust to technological change in advanced economies and increasingly binding environmental and social constraints. The feasible set of industrial policy is constrained by state capacity. The paradox of industrial policy is that it is most straightforward when state capacity is the most constrained. We suggest that emerging economies still should explore what we denote as sector-based horizontal policies addressing market and state failures in individual industries.
L52|Regional Industry Cluster Analysis for the Potomac Highlands in West Virginia|This part of the project identifies existing industrial clusters for the Potomac Highlands region in West Virginia and seeks potential industries or clusters for economic development. We also evaluate strengths and gaps of existing industry clusters. Our cluster analysis comprises three parts, including (1) location quotient (LQ) analysis, (2) shift-share analysis, and (3) input-output (I-O) analysis. Results of both location quotient and shift-share analyses are used for industry targeting, whereas input-output analysis measures existing cluster strengths and bottlenecks for potential cluster diversification strategies based on Jackson’s(2015) cluster and diversification strategy (CADS).
L52|Implicit Regional Economic Goals and Objectives: A Study of U.S. Development Programs|At the present time, U.S. regional economic development policies tend to be focused on sectors, infrastructure, human capital, innovation capability, or to be problem oriented, and only a few programs can be described as being place-based. In this paper, we are looking at major federal regional development programs to deduce their combined implicit place-based goals and objectives. Because the U.S. seems to be relatively unique among OECD countries in its scant use of place-based policies, we compare the United States to, in particular, Canada to gain further insights into the reasons for and potential effects of such policy differences.
L52|The Unilateral Accident Model under a Constrained Cournot-Nash Duopoly|This paper extends the basic unilateral accident model to allow for Cournot competition. Two firms compete with production input and prevention as strategic variables under asymmetric capacity constraints. We find that liability regimes exert a crucial influence on the equilibrium price and outputs. Strict liability leads to higher output and higher risk compared to negligence. We also study the conditions under which both regimes converge.
L52|The Differentiated Effect of Advertising on Readership: Evidence from a Two-Sided Market Approach|In this paper, we empirically analyze the French print media market by modeling the existence of a reciprocal effect between the size of the readership and the amount of advertising. For this two-sided platform, we measure the cross-effects of advertising on the readership and periodical popularity on advertising. By estimating a structural model of simultaneous demand equations, we quantify some crucial elements in designing pricing and product-differentiating strategies. We measure the impact of advertising on reader demand and find in the data that it has opposite effects depending on whether the publication presents informational or entertaining content. By taking into account the market interactions, we compute price and advertising elasticities. Our results show that advertisers targeting a specific category of the audience would choose its corresponding periodicals and would trade off the size of the readership for these periodicals and the advertising insert price changes. Also, advertising campaigns aimed at reaching a broader spectrum of the population should focus on popular titles and on titles for which demand is inelastic to ensure a more consistent impact of the campaign. Finally, for magazines with low price demand elasticity on the readers’ side, editors’ revenues could be improved by increasing prices. These combined effects should allow a publisher to generate positive margins from both sides of the market, for certain content categories.
L52|Planificación: pasado, presente y prospectiva. A 50 años de la creación de la Oficina de Planeamiento y Presupuesto|This working paper carries out a historical review of the role that the Office for Planning and Budget (OPP) has played in planning. The aim of the study is to examine to what degree the OPP has fulfilled one of its main tasks: to advise the executive branch in issues on development policies. For this purpose, annual reports and different documents that have been prepared by the Office in matters of Development are examined. Six periods are identified with very different characteristics in terms of the degree of fulfillment of the planning task and regarding the ideas and development strategies promoted. A long term-overview shows a loss of gravitation of the OPP in planning matters during the five decades. Regarding the dominant ideas on development, it can be argued that the transition from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean´s ideas to the market-centered views of the 1990s was not radical but gradual, and began early in the founding stage of the OPP. Since 2005, its reversal has also been gradual.

L52|La realizzazione del Piano di Investimenti per l'Europa|The Investment Plan for Europe - which is known as the Juncker Plan and is aimed at European economic recovery â€“ is estimated to provide a relatively large amount of financial resources for SMEs and different areas of public infrastructure. This estimate was based on a high value of the multiplier that was forecasted and applied to the guarantees of the approved projects. At the end of the first period (2015-2017), it was considered appropriate to review some of the international scientific literature on this Plan, in order to analyse if the results achieved up until that point coincide with its initial objectives. The main outcome of this analysis - in contrast to the success attributed to the Plan by the European Commission - is that verification is substantially unattainable, since even the quantitative results thus far disseminated for the Juncker Plan have been obtained by estimates, which have never been illustrated in a comprehensive manner.
L52|Modern industrial policy and public-private councils at the sub-national level: Mexico's experience in an international perspective|In recent years, the need for modern industrial policies has been increasingly acknowledged in the literature and by the praxis of developed and developing countries, including much of Latin America. Whether a country should have an industrial policy is no longer in question; rather, the issue is how to do it right. Nevertheless, research is still incipient on the experience with the specific institutional arrangements and governance structure required for effective modern industrial policy, and this is especially true in large countries with developed subnational governance structures. One institutional mechanism considered vital to effective modern industrial policy is the modality of public-private dialogue and problem solving that supports a search for obstacles and solutions to agreed development objectives. This paper addresses the institutional foundations of industrial policy at the subnational level, with new empirical evidence from a large federal state-Mexico. It presents a detailed analysis of the governance of 32 newly created public-private State Productivity Commissions. All evidence analysed point to the fact that most of these commissions were in a rudimentary state of development after more than three years since the federal law promulgated them. Problems of governance in many ways mirrored issues that often emerge in national councils, but were graver in their depth and covered even the most rudimentary elements. Moreover, the peculiarity of the CEPs emerging out of a federal labour law appears to have generated overly narrow agendas. Central government's entities have a major challenge to provide and mobilise technical, administrative, and possibly financial support for the sub-national commissions.

Despite failing to industrialize in the past, there may be a new window of opportunity. This is due to the convergence of new technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and a resurgence of start-up entrepreneurship.

The paper show that a new narrative for African structural transformation is possible.
L52|Structural Change, Trade and Global Production Networks|An ‘Appropriate Industrial Policy’ for Peripheral and Catching-up Economies The global economy has been undergoing rapid structural change the impressive development processes in a range of emerging economies have induced strong shifts in global trade shares; international production networks (IPNs) are characterising regional and global trading relationships and we observe also persistent changes in the positions of countries in global value chains due to rather rapid technological and human capital upgrading. The aim of this paper is to assess these developments, but also discuss the importance of – what we call – ‘appropriate industrial policy’ (AIP) for countries at different developmental stages to support their position in the current global context. We emphasise in particular the role of AIP for European low- and medium-income economies (LMIEs) as the recent financial and economic crisis has shown that they are particularly vulnerable with respect to ‘structural external imbalances’ and thus policies to support their tradable sectors are of great importance.
L52|Non-ferrous Metals Manufacturing: Vision for 2050 and Actions Needed|The European non-ferrous metals manufacturing industry is a strategic sector directly employing 500,000 people and supplying products for numerous crucial downstream industrial sectors. As a capital intensive industry, its investment horizon spans over decades and is thus particularly in need of adopting a long-term strategic perspective. This foresight study applied a highly participatory, qualitative methodology that gathered representatives of the non-ferrous metals industry, research institutions, policymakers, trade unions and stakeholders from upstream and downstream sectors. This methodology allowed: (1) to define a long-term (2050) vision for the non-ferrous metals manufacturing industry and (2) to propose concrete actions for the industry itself, policymakers, and other stakeholders, to address the challenges faced by the sector (trade and competition, innovation, resources, business integrity and skills) on its path towards the vision.

L52|Evaluating mobile number portability policy in the Thai mobile telecommunications market|Abstract Mobile number portability (MNP), which allows consumers to retain their mobile numbers when switching service providers, is expected to promote competition by lowering switching costs. This paper estimates switching costs and switching costs reduction from the MNP policy in Thailand using the mixed logit model with preference heterogeneity on a nationwide survey of mobile telecommunications service usages. The estimation result shows that the MNP policy reduces switching costs by 37% on average and that this benefit is heterogeneous across consumers. The considerable and persistent switching costs call for additional measures to facilitate switching.

Ennek az újfajta, a világűr gazdasági kiaknázását előmozdító modellnek az elemzésekor bemutatjuk a COTS programban szereplő vállalatok hátterét, stratégiájukat és finanszírozásukat majd Heckit-féle panelregresszió segítségével megvizsgáljuk az egyes vállalatok programba kerülését és rendelésállományát - tekintettel arra, hogy a NASA eredetileg innovatív startup vállalatok által megvalósított, olcsón üzemeltethető platformok létrehozását tűzte ki célul. A program eredményeit elemezve megállapítható, hogy az eredeti célcsoportból csak egy innovatív vállalatot sikerült felnevelni, a többi résztvevő ugyanis a repülési-védelmi szektor hagyományos szereplői közül került ki. Emellett a kapott NASA-megrendelések összege a múltbeli repülések számától és nem a fajlagos költségek szintjétől függött. Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) Kód: G24, H54, L52, L91, O43.
L52|Structural Transformation, Deep Downturns, and Government Policy|Most recessions are a result of some shock to the economic system, typically amplified by financial accelerators, and leading to large balance sheet effects of households and firms, which result in the effects persisting. But, over time, the balance sheets get restored. Even banks recover. But episodically, the “shock” is deeper. It is structural. Among advanced countries, the movement from agricultural to manufacturing in the last century, and the more recent movement from manufacturing to the service sector reflect such a large economic transformation. The associated downturns are longer lasting. The usual responses, in particular, monetary policy, are only of limited efficacy. Policies have to be designed to facilitate such transformations: markets on their own typically do not do well. This paper explains why such transformations are associated with persistently high unemployment, and describes the effects of particular government policies. It looks at the lessons of the Great Depression both for the advanced countries and the developing countries as they go through their structural transformations.
L52|Real exchange rate policies for economic development|This paper analyzes the role of real exchange rate (RER) policies in promoting economic development. Markets provide a suboptimal amount of investment in sectors characterized by learning spillovers. We show that a stable and competitive RER policy may correct for this externality and other related market failures. The resulting development of these sectors leads to overall faster economic growth. A system of effectively multiple exchange rates is required when spillovers across different tradable sectors differ. The impact of RER policies is increased when they are complemented by traditional industrial policies that increase the elasticity of the aggregate supply to the RER. Among the instruments required to implement a stable and competitive RER are interventions in the foreign exchange market and regulation of capital flows. We also discuss the trade-offs associated with alternative stable and competitive RER policies and the relationship between the use of exchange rate policies for macro-stability and for development.
L52|Boosting firm dynamism and performance in China|With persisting slower growth worldwide and in China, over-capacity in some heavy industry sectors, declining profitability, and intensifying competition from other, lower-cost emerging economies, corporate behaviour in China needs to change and focus more on efficiency and sustainability. This need is further intensified by mounting environmental pressures and China’s ambition for greener and more sustainable growth. A larger proportion of firms, including state-owned enterprises, should step up innovation efforts and improve corporate governance practices. To this end, supportive policies are needed, fostering an environment that is more conducive to innovation and entrepreneurship, and facilitating resource reallocation through the exit of unviable firms. At the same time, fraudulent corporate practices must be halted and State assets need to be better managed. Reforms are under way or envisaged that will help improve corporate performance and, more broadly, deliver more resilient and environmentally sustainable growth and continuing progress in living standards. This Working Paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of China (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-china.htm).
L52|Where to get the best bang for the buck in the United Kingdom?: Industrial strategy, investment and lagging regions|The United Kingdom is preparing a modern industrial strategy to boost labour productivity across the whole country and to narrow regional gaps in living standards. This raises the question of the optimal allocation of scarce resources in meeting these targets. This study identifies industrial strengths of each region and scope to boost regional productivity through the channel of higher capital intensity. Overall regional investment ratios appear weakly linked to regional productivity, but the sectoral composition of regions and their type of investment are more important determinants. Each region has productivity leaders, but the concentration of such firms is the highest in the south of England. Differences in the representation of the most productive firms in regions are strongly related to differences in regional productivity. The empirical methodology quantifies the productivity effects of raising the capital intensity in each sector-region, focusing on viable firms falling behind the national productivity frontier in all but the finance and insurance sectors over 1995-2014. To enhance labour productivity of lagging regions, the industrial strategy should promote the catch up of firms with the national best performers in services sectors, in particular knowledge intensive services such as ICT and business services, but also wholesale and retail trade. This finding is consistent with the UK’s leading global position in high value-added services sectors. The type of investment matters: boosting research and development in the manufacturing sector in some lagging regions would also be effective in stimulating productivity. Manufacturing investment cannot be a substitute to investment in services given the small size of the manufacturing sector and its high exposure to competition from rapidly emerging global hubs. However, this study does not quantify the effects of skills, the benefits of greater industrial diversification and the positive impact that larger cities would have on agglomeration effects.
L52|Sales Range and Innovation Activity in the Industry System of Poland|In the literature, there is a discussion on the importance of the spatial distans to the user in the context innovation activity. Although, most of this kind of studies concentrate on exporting enterprises and compare them to domestic ones. Exporting activity is very important for catching-up countries, because of technology transfer in its background. The aim of this paper is to determine whether the innovative activity in Poland’s industrial system is a consequence of close interactions (local and regional), or perhaps conditioned by the imperative of functioning on the national and international market? Main hypothesis was to claim that on the current development level of Poland, the relationship between the range of sales and innovation activities are different from those in the more developed countries. Empirical studies was created in 2006-2012 as a result of the systematic collection of questionnaires filled by industry enterprises in Poland from all regions (5209 correct fulfilled questionnaires). Methodical analysis was based on the theory of probability - probit modeling, because dependent variables were binary (0 or 1). Local and regional environment is not conducive to stimulating innovation activity, but national spatial is a sufficient space, but high intensity observed only when the company has been working on the international market. It means, that the industry maturity level in Poland is good enough for creating a domestic innovation environment. This kind of an aggregation level should be stimulating by the government innovation policy.
L52|Regional development in the context of economic reform: The case of Limassol|Regional development occurs in the larger context of national economies. Thus, the elaboration of regional economic development strategies cannot be separated from higher-level economic policy which frames and conditions opportunities and risks for regional development. As a Southern European country undergoing a process of profound structural economic reform, Cyprus provides a case for a policy context aiming towards the emergence of a new model of economic growth. Within this context, the Limassol region as one of the country’s major economic centers with a number of comparatively strong industries can serve as an example of how to promote regional development in the framework of national reform priorities such as moving the national economy closer towards a knowledge- and innovation-driven model. The present study analyses current reform priorities on the national and supra-national level, takes stock of the regional economic structure of Limassol district, and presents some preliminary ideas that could be further explored if and when a comprehensive regional economic development strategy for Limassol were to be elaborated.
L52|Effects of Licensing Reform on Firm Innovation: Evidence from India|The regulatory environment in a country is an important factor affecting firm performance. This study investigates the impact of a particular regulation, namely license requirements for certain firm activities, on the innovation performance of Indian firms. Using a firm level panel data set, it shows that removal of license requirements led to roughly eight percentage points faster innovation rates within two years following the reform where innovation is measured as introduction of new product varieties that had not existed in the market. When the residual increase in sales revenues even after controlling for product innovation is called as process innovation, substantial improvements in process innovation are also observed. The results are robust to inclusion of controls for the other policy reforms that occurred during the period of licensing reform, and persist in different subcategories of firms.
L52|Planeación Óptima de la Red de Transmisión Eléctrica de Baja California Sur<BR>[Optimal Planning of the Electricity Transmission Grid of Southern Baja California (Mexico)]|We analyze the effects on social welfare of two different processes of transmission network expansion planning. A first model (integrated model) considers decisions on electricity generation and transmission as interdependent activities. A second model (disintegrated model) assumes that these decisions are independent, so that network expansion follows an exogenous process. This duality of approaches has been subject of academic and policy discussions in diverse systems, as it is the case of the electricity system in Germany. These two models are simulated for the transmission network in Southern Baja California, Mexico. This is a self-contained system with relatively few nodes and links that allows the development of a realistic study on the characteristics of efficient expansion of the electricity grid. We demonstrate that the integrated approach to expanding transmission networks results in higher levels of social welfare for different network topologies in this system.
L52|Estimación de la Elasticidad-Precio de Corto Plazo de la Demanda de Electricidad en República Dominicana<BR>[An Estimation of the Short-Run Price Elasticity of Electricity Demand in the Dominican Republic]|This paper presents a theoretical model for the optimization of the decision-making process of power purchase of the electric utility companies of the Dominican Republic, taking into account the demand of end-users of the service, the short-term marginal cost of energy in the wholesale power market, and the budgetary constraints of the utility companies. This model was applied to estimate the short-term price elasticity of electricity demand for the three largest electric utility companies of the Dominican Republic, during the period 2007-2016; this evaluation was made using time series analysis techniques. The elasticities estimated were in the range of -0.012 to -0.018. It is also explored if these values undergo intraday variations. The paper closes outlining some welfare implications of the results obtained as well as policy recommendations.
L52|A Blockchain Application in Energy|Abstract This report documents a blockchain application developed for the energy sector that enables distributed market coordination for decentralized energy systems. As its core element, it utilizes Ethereum-based smart contracts to facilitate market matching between individual producers and consumers of electricity. The motive for this application was to understand the process of developing blockchain applications with industrial partners. Moreover, the purpose of this exercise was to examine whether Ethereum-based smart contracts could be effectively utilized for similar applications in industry and society at large. The application and the discussions during its development indicate that similar horizontal market structures may spring up in value chains in which the dynamicity of the market is growing and in which the roles of the market actors are shifting from fixed roles towards switch-role markets.
L52|Import substitution of investment goods in Russia|This paper investigates the sensitivity of the demand for imported capital goods to the influence of various factors of the investment dynamics with the aim to generate evidence-based recommendations for the import substitution policy in the Russian Federation. It provides a forecast of the dynamics of the demand for imported machinery, equipment, components and vehicles in various macroeconomic scenario conditions. The article estimates the influence of the EU and US sectoral sanctions on the volume of Russian imports of investment goods. We characterize different approaches to the import substitution policy in the Russian Federation and conditions for their implementation.
L52|The Impact of Telecommunication Regulatory Policy on Mobile Retail Price in Sub-Saharan African Countries|This paper examines the eect of regulatory policies on mobile retail prices. Using quarterly data for 8 African countries for the period 2010:Q4 to 2014:Q4 we estimate structural demand and supply equations. We nd that mobile termination rates (MTR) have significant positive impact on mobile retail prices. A decline in average MTR of 10% decreases average mobile retail prices by 2.5%. On the other hand, mobile number portability (MNP) has an insignicant eect on price and subscriptions in selected African countries. This may be due to inadequate implementation of MNP and consecutively low demand for porting numbers. The average market conduct in mobile telecommunications industry for selected African countries can be approximated by Cournot Nash equilibrium, while price elasticity of demand is on average -0.27.
L52|Public R&D subsidies: collaborative versus individual place-based programs for SMEs|Abstract This paper provides novel empirical evidence on the effectiveness of regional research and innovation policies for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It investigated two subsidy programs implemented at the regional level in central Italy. One program targeted SMEs’ investments in individual research projects, and the other focused on collaborative research projects between SMEs and universities. Using a matched difference-in-differences approach, the empirical analysis showed that the two programs had different effects. The first was successful in stimulating additional private research and development (R&D) investment and improving firms’ performance. The second had weaker effects, mostly restricted to R&D expenditure and employment. These effects were not always uniformly distributed among project participants.
L52|Removing geo-blocking: What are the effects on innovation for vertically differentiated goods?|At present, there is a wide debate on regulating geo-blocking, an online practice that prevents consumers from buying or having access to products and services from another country. This practice is not only used by retailers, but is also of great importance in the market for digital visual broadcasting. We develop a model to identify the cases, in which firms have an incentive to include geo-blocking clauses in their licensing agreements. In addition, we analyze the effects of restricting geo-blocking on the level of innovation of two vertically differentiated goods and on the overall product variety. Our results show that the market outcome primarily depends on the level of competition between the two goods. For instance, regulatory changes do not have any impact if competition is very low or very high. However, if competition is sufficiently high, the removal of geo-blocking decreases the level of innovation of the good that is traded. The product quality of the other firm, instead, increases - as long as R&D costs are sufficiently high. Putting both effects together, it becomes evident that the quality gains do not compensate for the quality losses. In addition, the removal of geo-blocking affects the product variety as well - a lower level of competition increases the product variety and vice versa.
L52|Innovation, Skills and Investment: A Digital Industrial Policy for Europe|This paper identifies the main factors for Europe’s delays in embracing the well proven growth enhancing effects of digital technologies. It argues that market failures, including externalities from knowledge spillovers, cybersecurity and first mover advantages justify public support. The whole value added chain of digital production is entailed, starting with infrastructure investment and R&D relevant for digital sectors, along with qualified skills of researchers and of workers, coming to skill sets provided by the education sector. Emphasis is put on the efficient leverage effects that can be achieved by combining public and private sector funds through financial instruments.
L52|The Chaning Patterns of Investment in the PRC Economy|The investment-intensive growth model of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is often viewed as state-driven and ultimately unsustainable. But largely unnoticed, a shift has taken place. This paper examines the changes in investment patterns since 2003 and the potential impact of industrial policies on these patterns. The point of view is macroeconomic, based on economy-wide data with various breakdown. Significant shifts in investment patterns across sectors and ownership forms have occurred over time, supporting a new growth model with a reduced role of the state, and these shifts appear driven more by market factors than by government policies.
L52|Heterogeneous Merger Impacts on Competitive Outcomes|Mergers realize heterogeneous competitive effects on profits, production, and prices. To date, it is unclear whether differential merger outcomes are caused mostly by firms’ technology or product market attributes. Furthermore, empirical merger studies conventionally assume that, conditional on regressors, the impact of mergers on outcomes is the same for every firm. We allow the merger responses to vary across firms, even after controlling for regressors, and apply a random-coefficient or heterogeneous treatment effect model (in the context of Angrist and Krueger (1999), Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006), and Cerulli (2012)). Based on a comprehensive dataset on the static random access memory industry, we find that firms’ postmerger output further increases (and postmerger price further declines) if merging firms are more efficient, operate in more elastic product markets, are more innovative, and acquire knowledge in technological areas that are relatively unexplored to themselves. A further interesting insight is that product market characteristics cause stronger postmerger outcome heterogeneities than do technology market characteristics. We also find that the postmerger effects accounting for heterogeneities differ greatly from those that consider homogeneous postmerger outcome effects. Our estimation results provide evidence that ignoring heterogeneous outcome effects can result in heterogeneity bias, just as ignoring premerger heterogeneities can lead to selectivity bias.

L52|Caracterización de los actores del clúster BPO - ITO - KPO en Cali (2014 - 2016)|Studies based on cluster mapping allow to understand the potential of certain industrial sectors and its relevance in the economy of a region, in such a way that businessmen, the academia and State, can have a reference for decision making that will promote the cluster’s dynamism and as a consequence, the socio-economic development of the region. This document is the result of the study of the socio-economic characterization of the actors, based on the technique of cluster mapping of the sectors BPO KPO and ITO and related to the city of Cali, Valle del Cauca, Colombia in 2014 and 2016. The motivation to carry it out was based on the support that the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali has been providing to the Major’s office of Cali, initially to the “Program of Cluster Promotion and Strengthening of the Secretary of Planning” (Programa de Fomento y Fortalecimiento de Clúster de la Secretaría de Planeación), as support to cluster-related initiatives; in this case, to PacificShore, businessmen that received a copy of this study in June 2016 to be analyzed. More recently (August 2017), the study for the recently constituted Secretary of Economic Development of Santiago de Cali has been updated, that has the purpose of encouraging the development of this type of industries in the city. The version here presented corresponds to the updated study.
L52|Nuclear Power in the Twenty-First Century: An Assessment (Part I)|Nuclear power was one of the most important discoveries of the twentieth century, and it continues to play an important role in twenty-first century discussions about the future energy mix, climate change, innovation, proliferation, geopolitics, and many other crucial policy topics. This paper addresses some key issues around the emergence of nuclear power in the twentieth century and perspectives going forward in the twenty-first, including questions of economics and competitiveness, the strategic choices of the nuclear superpowers and countries that plan to either phase out or start using nuclear power, to the diffusion of nuclear technologies and the emergence of regional nuclear conflicts in the “second nuclear age”. The starting point for our hypothesis is the observation that nuclear power was originally developed for military purposes as the “daughter of science and warfare” (Lévêque 2014, 212), whereas civilian uses such as medical applications and electricity generation emerged later as by-products. Based upon this observation, we interpret the nuclear industry in terms of “economies of scope”, where strategies, costs, and benefits must be assessed in the multiproduct context of military and civilian uses of nuclear power. We propose a classification of different economic perspectives on nuclear electricity generation, and confirm the consensus of the literature that on its own, nuclear power has never been an economic method of producing electricity: not a single reactor in existence today was constructed by a private investor in a competitive, market economic framework. The economics-of-scope perspective is a useful heuristic to interpret countries’ strategic choices regarding the use of nuclear power. The paper provides a survey of strategies used by the nuclear superpowers (United States, Russia, China), by countries phasing out nuclear power because they cannot benefit from economies of scope (e.g., Italy, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland), and by potential newcomers who may expect synergies between military and civilian uses (e.g., Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, perhaps one day also Japan). We conclude that the future of nuclear power in the twenty-first century must be assessed in terms of economies of scope, and that a purely “economic” analysis of nuclear electricity is insufficient to grasp the complexity of the issue; this also raises conceptual challenges for energy modelers. The paper leaves out some important questions to be addressed in a future Part II of the assessment, such as economic and technical issues of plant decommissioning, long-term storage of waste, and the potential role of nuclear energy in climate policies.
L52|Emerging green-tech specializations and clusters – A network analysis on technological innovation at the metropolitan level|Current models of production and energy use are promoting an effervescent green-technology (green-tech) market focused on innovation and improved environmental performance. Most green-tech firms are innovative start-ups or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) characterized by large intangible assets and technological uncertainty, which makes it difficult to identify their research and development (R&D) and innovation paths. In addition, green-tech companies tend to aggregate spatially and, throughout the world, clusters are increasingly seen as a strategy to foster innovative production and R&D activities and stimulate a sustainable energy transition. This paper investigates green-tech companies in San Francisco, New York and London to identify their specialization and underlying technological and/or market complementarities, and emerging aggregates and specific clusters. Based on information from CrunchBase and the web, we propose a network analysis using metadata on technological innovations produced by green-tech companies in these three metropolitan areas. Metadata are keywords and terms that help to describe an item, and in the database they identify the products, services and technologies driving innovation. The main metrics of the networks identified (at both node and network level) are discussed from an economic perspective. The approach helps in the design and implementation of targeted and information-based local policies and facilitates closer relationships between innovative companies, suppliers and clients, venture capitalists, large corporations and research laboratories involved in the green-tech industry.
L52|Diversely moving towards a green economy: Techno-organisational decarbonisation trajectories and environmental policy in EU sectors|This paper adopts an ex ante perspective to investigate the potential techno-organisational dynamics related to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the EU by 2030 and 2050. We provide a qualitative analysis based on interviews with representatives from the main manufacturing sectors in the EU. Path dependency and enhanced carbon pricing may support the ‘incremental path’. More radical changes are achievable through strong techno-organisational reorganisation and new policy support. It follows that technological innovation is sufficiently effective only if coupled with organisational innovation. Earmarking ‘environmental revenues’ to support sector R&D is a way to enhance the governance of the innovation-policy realm and create opportunities for radical innovation.
L52|Fiber deployment in Spain|Abstract Next generation access networks will be critical for future economic growth and access to these infrastructures will have major consequences for territorial and social cohesion. This paper examines the economic and competition determinants that serve as incentives for operators to invest in fiber-to-the-home technology. We draw on a dataset comprising 6603 Spanish municipalities with access to broadband services to examine the incumbent’s (Telefónica) deployment of fiber in the period 2010–2013. We show that local loop unbundling competition had a strong positive impact on Telefónica’s fiber deployment, while bitstream competition had a negative effect. Moreover, the incumbent was more likely to invest in municipalities with a large presence of cable operators. We also consider how the municipalities’ sociodemographic characteristics affected the operator’s deployment decision. While market size and population density had a positive effect on investment, the level of unemployment and the percentage of elderly population had a negative impact.
L52|Russian industrial enterprises in 2016 (on business surveys’ findings)|Business surveys of industrial enterprises have been conducted by the Gaidar Institute using a European harmonized method in monthly cycles since September 1992, covering the entire territory of the Russian Federation. The panel size is around 1,000 enterprises employing over 13% of industrial employees. The panel is shifted towards large enterprises for each of the segregated sub-industries. The ratio of returned questionnaires is in the range of 70-75%. Business survey questionnaire contains a limited number of questions (not more than 15–20). The questions are of a qualitative and not quantitative nature. Simple questions structure allows the respondents to fill out the questionnaire quickly and without using any documents. It is paramount that respondent at each enterprise is a manager of the highest level who has a full understanding of state of business and is directly linked to the business management.
L52|Antidumping and Feed-In Tariffs as Good Buddies? Modeling the EU-China Solar Panel Dispute|The paper analyzes the interactions between trade and renewable energy policies based on the EU--China Solar Panel dispute which is the most significant antidumping (AD) complaint in Europe. We build a price competition duopoly model with differentiated products and intra-industry trade in photovoltaic equipment. We provide two relevant types of AD duties. The optimal AD which maximizes social domestic welfare always increases with the feed-in tariff (FIT) program set in the home country. The appropriate AD -- equalizing the foreign firm's price on the domestic market with the foreign market price -- decreases with the FIT program. We show that the optimal FIT increases with the AD duty. Therefore, trade and renewable energy optimal policies may complement one another. When setting AD duties in clean energy sectors, it is important not to ignore the extent to which renewable energy is subsidized.
L52|Cluster dynamics: learning from Competitiveness Cluster policy. The case of ‘Secure Communicating Solutions’ in the French Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur Region|"The paper aims to identify the forms and dynamics of the organizational structures of high-tech clusters overtime. Since Markusen (1996), it is well acknowledged that diversity is an emergent property of clusters, but the interactions between local and non-local actors of the clusters are difficult to trace because of lack of relevant data. The cluster policies developed to fix the network failures between the heterogeneous actors – large and small firms, universities, research institutes – of the current processes of innovation provide new information opportunities. In France, Competitiveness Clusters work as a ""factories of project""; the information they produce on collective R&D projects applying for subsidies provides a proxy of local and non-local relations of the clusters. Social network analysis is used to infer the organizational structure of the collective learning networks and trace their dynamics. The case studies considered are Sophia-Antipolis and Rousset, two high tech clusters which belong to the same Competitiveness Cluster, ‘Secure Communicating Solutions' in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur Region. The paper highlights the decoupling of the two clusters overtime as a consequence of distinctive organizational structures. The diversity of the dynamics of the collective learning networks which emerges through the analysis of the collective R&D projects in the two high tech clusters shows that knowledge creation and innovation can follow different paths and questions the public policies implemented."
L52|The impact of state aid on the survival and financial viability of aided firms|We estimate the causal impact of restructuring aid granted by the European Commission between 2000 and 2012 on the survival and financial viability of aided firms. Using a comprehensive dataset we find that restructuring aid decreases the hazard rate of a market exit by 58–68% and increases firms’ average survival time by 8–15 years, depending on the definition of firm survival. We also find that aid receiving firms have a significantly higher probability to improve their financial viability than the counterfactual group in the longer run.

L52|Subsidy Entrepreneurs|In this paper, we study the selection process and incentives of ﬁrms that apply for and eventually receive one or multiple governmental grants intended to stimulate innovation and growth in supported ﬁrms. The analysis departs from a rent-seeking model of heterogeneous entrepreneurs who are free to allocate their effort between production and rent-seeking. In equilibrium, highly productive entrepreneurs choose not to enter the rent-seeking contest altogether, and moderately productive entrepreneurs allocate a share of their effort both to rent-seeking and production, whereas low-productivity entrepreneurs are incentivized to allocate most, if not all, of their effort to seeking grants and can thus be called subsidy entrepreneurs. These ﬁrms also have a higher probability of receiving grants. Using detailed data over all grants administered by the three largest grant distributing agencies in Sweden, the empirical analysis suggests that supported ﬁrms tend to have relatively low productivity, higher wages, and a larger share of workers with higher education than do non-supported ﬁrms. These characteristics become more pronounced as we move from single to multiple supported ﬁrms, thus supporting the notion of subsidy entrepreneurs.

This book is a resource for designing institutions to make public-private interaction a win-win strategy.
L52|The Effect of Industrial Cluster Policy on Firm Performance in Ethiopia: Evidence from the Leather Footware Cluster| This paper empirically analyzes the productivity, profitability, innovation and network effects of a public policy promoting micro and small scale industrial clusters in Ethiopia. To this end, firm-level survey data was collected from randomly selected clustered leather shoe manufacturers that have directly benefited from the policy and those that do not, both before and after the cluster policy intervention. The results from econometric analysis suggests that the industrial cluster policy adversely impacts the productivity, profitability, growth, and innovation performance of the small and micro leather shoe manufacturing enterprises that moved to the government created clusters . The analysis of the transmission mechanism further reveals that the relocated cluster policy hampers the treated firms’ collaborative business and knowledge network and aggravates their growth impediments which includes lack of trust, high customer and supplier search and reach cost, lack of market information, imperfect contract enforcement, delays in the supply of raw materials and the lack of skilled labor. The time lag between policy implementation and its impacts may conceal the long-term impact of the cluster policy. The overwhelming majority of the representatives of treatment group firms also continue to believe that their buisness performance will improve over time as a result of their participation in the MSE cluster development program. This study is a pioneer to quantitatively evaluate the productivity, profitability, innovation and network effect of industrial cluster policy in Ethiopia.
L52|Public subsidies for SME research and development: Empirical evaluation of collaborative versus individual place-based programs|This paper provides novel empirical evidence on the effectiveness of regional research and innovation policies for small and medium-sized firms (SMEs). Two subsidy programs implemented at the regional level in central Italy are investigated. One program targeted firms' individual research, while the other addressed collaborative research between firms and universities. Using a matched difference-in-differences approach our empirical analysis shows a differentiated impact of the two programs. The first was successful in stimulating additional private R&D investment and, at least partially, in improving firms. performance. The second program had weaker effects, mostly restricted to R&D expenditure and employment. Otherwise, subsidized firms show a reduction in their tangible and intangible investments, thus casting doubts on the benefits of subsidies forcing R&D collaborations.
L52|Industry Vietnam 2005-2014: Status, Issues and Development Orientation|Although with a low starting point, Vietnam’s industry has achieved positive results with the average growth rate of over 10% per year, a positive contribution to the economic- social development in Vietnam. However, from 2010 to now, the average growth rate of industrial output value has declined. In fact, growth of industry that bases on outsourcing (outputs of manufacturing based on mainly inputs from foreign markets) has lasted for many years. This has clearly revealed the inefficiency and lack of sustainability of the domestic industry. Vietnam's industry is currently characterized by the industries belong to first generation, including industrial products that using more labor, unskilled labor and the products of industry that base on outsourcing). The imbalance in industrial structure of Vietnam is one of the problems noted in the recent years. This is reflected in the lack of supporting industries to manufacture capital goods and industries have high scientific content. In addition, development of industries still has spread over country, lack of key industries to make tower cranes for the development of whole industry. Therefore, in order to become a developed industrial country with over 80 million inhabitants, Vietnam’s industry require to have an accelerated development strategy and reasonable implement policy.
L52|Clearing and Settlement Systems from Around the World: A Qualitative Analysis|As Canada continues to engage in a dialogue to develop the approach to modernizing its core payment systems, we analyze the core payment systems that exist in countries around the world. We study payment systems in 27 jurisdictions, encompassing a broad range of geographic regions, through three levels of analysis. First, we identify and discuss the different types of core systems, and the prevalence of each of them. At a high level, we find that most jurisdictions have added a new real-time retail system, all have a batch retail payment system, and the vast majority have made upgrades to their large-value payment systems. Second, we evaluate what core system upgrades have resulted in improved access, functionality, interoperability, timeliness and risk management. Finally, we analyze the overarching design found in multiple core payment systems across jurisdictions and identify four distinct core payment system configurations. These main core system configurations reflect the different approaches taken to modernize, depending on jurisdictional factors, including public policy objectives, drivers, needs, payment instruments and gaps resulting from legacy systems. We conclude that it is necessary to have a complete understanding of modernization objectives, based on each country’s unique jurisdictional factors. A comprehensive set of modernization objectives can then be used to develop a holistic multi-system plan, designed to modernize each core payment system in a complementary manner.
L52|Fiber to the People: The Development of the Ultra-Broadband Network in Italy|In this paper, we firstly revise the main technological solutions for ultra-fast broadband connections and summarize the main economic literature (both theoretical and empirical) on the role of regulation to support infrastructure investment in broadband networks in profitable areas. We then move to the core of our analysis, that is to assess the relative positioning of the Italian market today in terms of deployment and penetration of broadband access, and then analyse the main relevant policy issues involved in the current Italian plans for broadband deployment. Our goal is to propose a policy framework for fostering the deployment of the Italian ultra-fast broadband network and evaluate the Government master plan. The analysis will also give the opportunity to provide our contribution to the current debate and to suggest how industrial policies in a market-oriented perspective should be reconsidered.
L52|Impact of Trade Openness and Sector Trade on Embodied Greenhouse Gases Emissions and Air Pollutants|The production of goods and services generates greenhouse gases (GHGs) and air pollution both directly and through the activities of the supply chains on which they depend. The analysis of the latter—called embodied emissions—in the cause of internationally traded goods and services is the subject of this paper. We find that trade openness increases embodied emissions in international trade (EET). We also examine the impact of sector trade on EET. By applying a fixed-effect model using large balanced panel data from 187 countries between 1990 and 2011, we determine that each unit of increase in trade openness results in a 10% to 23% increase in GHG embodied emissions (EE). The sector trade effect is also significant for the EE of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), particulates (PM10 ) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Our findings also clearly indicate that the impact of the GDP on the EE of exports is positive, increasing emissions, but that it is negative on the EE of imports. We suggest that countries monitor trade sector emissions and trade openness to mitigate global embodied GHG emissions and air pollutants.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

Une analyse systémique de la gestion des matières organiques à Bruxelles|L’économie circulaire connait un engouement réel et apparaît comme une approche prometteuse pour rompre avec les flux linéaires qui commencent par l’extraction d’une ressource et finissent par la création d’un déchet. Mobilisant la théorie des systèmes socio-écologiques et différents indicateurs d’impact, cet article souligne l’existence de trajectoires alternatives vers la circularisation de l’économie – et que ces alternatives ne sont pas neutres quant à leurs conséquences économiques, sociales et environnementales. La mesure de ces conséquences pour le cas des flux des matières organiques dans la métropole bruxelloise permet de faire ressortir deux trajectoires potentielles :celle d’une « troisième révolution industrielle », avec une prolongation de la logique de croissance économique basée sur l’accumulation de capital et une expansion quantitative, et celle d’une « post-croissance » créatrice d’une nouvelle organisation polycentrique du travail et d’un développement qualitatif moins intensif en capital.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L52|The Impact of Horizontal Mergers on Market Structure: Evidence from the Semiconductor Industry|The U.S. and EU Merger Guidelines strongly emphasize the relevance of the “ease of entry” argument in merger evaluations. Up to now, very little is known empirically about how mergers affect entry and exit, and the resulting number of firms in the markets. We empirically test this aspect of mergers using a comprehensive database that contains detailed firm-level information on mergers, production, and innovation in the dynamic random access memory semiconductor market from 1985 to 2004. Our reduced-form regression results show that mergers dominated by efficiency effects have a negative impact on the number of firms in the product market. Mergers dominated by market power effects result in a higher number of firms than efficiency dominated mergers. Interestingly, we also find that mergers foreclose potential entry in other product markets and reduce the number of firms in related product markets. Finally, our results confirm that postmerger changes in the equilibrium number of firms directly impact market prices.
L52|¿Existe un mejor desarrollo local en los municipios con clúster?: el caso del estado de São Paulo en Brasil|Este artículo analiza la contribución de los clústeres para el desarrollo local. Se analiza el caso de los Arreglos Productivos Locales (APL) en los municipios no metropolitanos del estado de São Paulo (Brasil). Mediante la técnica de descomposición de efectos de Oaxaca Blinder se examina si existe una brecha de desarrollo local o “mejor calidad de vida” en los municipios con APL respecto de aquellos donde no hay. Los resultados obtenidos corroboran que los municipios con APL presentan mejores niveles de desarrollo que aquellos sin APL. Sin embargo, tal diferencia responde a las características demográficas y económicas de los municipios con APL, más que a factores inobservables.
L52|Evolución de las políticas públicas de fomento a las pymes en la Comunidad Andina de Naciones y la Unión Europea: un análisis comparativo|Este trabajo estudia las políticas de fomento a las pymes implementadas en la Comunidad Andina de Naciones (CAN) y en la Unión Europea (UE) en las últimas décadas. A partir de una metodología analítico-comparativa, se plantea que, frente a las hipótesis de adopción sincrónica o secuencial, las políticas públicas de apoyo a las pymes responden a un modelo de adopción independiente y son determinadas por su propio contexto histórico-político, según el diferente estadio en que se encuentra el proceso de integración económica de ambas regiones. También se destaca que en la CAN, a diferencia de la UE, resulta difícil encontrar líneas de acción perdurables en el diseño de estas políticas públicas.******This paper studies the policies designed to promote SMEs implemented in the Andean Community of Nations (ACN) and the European Union (EU) in the past few decades. Based on an analytical and comparative methodology, it is set out that, with regard to synchronous or sequential adoption hypotheses, public policies that support SMEs respond to an independent adoption model and are determined by their own historical and political context, according to the different arenas in which the economic integration process of both regions is found. The paper also highlights that in the ACN, in contrast to the EU, it is difficult to find abiding lines of action in the design of these public policies.
L52|Investigating the Feasibility of a National Minimum Wage for South Africa|Part I was completed by the DPRU and is a quantitative analysis of the feasibility of a national minimum wage for South Africa. The DPRU was commissioned by the Department of Labour to provide an analytical and empirical rubric, with which a more informed and nuanced decision could be taken around the promulgation of a NMW for South Africa. In summary, the report recommends that the South African Government consider introducing a NMW to address low wages. However, we argue that critical attention must be given to the design and implementation of the policy so that it achieves the goal of protecting workers, minimizes the potential negative consequences on employment, and ultimately succeeds in improving levels of compliance with legislated wages. Part II was completed by the CSDA and is a qualitative analysis that investigates how a national minimum wage might affect young people’s labour market outcomes in South Africa.
L52|Ophthalmic-Optical Foreign Sector And Policy Implications|The aim of this paper is to analyse how the ease of manufacturing a product may influence the evolution of exports of specific products in the Spanish economy. This research focuses on the analysis of the international trade of ophthalmic-optical products to ascertain how the so-called complexity index may determine the strength of international competition. More specifically, the foreign sector, in terms of products and countries, is studied for the period 1978 to 2014. Results demonstrate that specialization in products of low complexity is a determining factor for the lack of success of this type of product in international competition.
L52|Has EU Accession Caused Structural Change in New Entrants? Intersectoral Linkage Analyses on Bulgaria and Romania|The European Union (EU) countries, especially the founders and earlier entrants (EU-15) are among the most-developed, post-industrial and innovationdriven economies in the world. Countries with different structures are expected to have progressive structural changes after their accessions to the EU by means of the intra-EU policies on socio-economic integration and monetary (Euro) adoption. Starting from this convergence premise, this study aims to explore whether the latest member states, Bulgaria and Romania, that joined the EU in 2007, have experienced significant changes in their economic structures. To this end, with a general equilibrium approach and using input-output data of the countries, we conduct intersectoral linkage analyses covering all economic activities aggregated to 34 sectors for the years of 1995, 2002, 2007 and 2011. Backward and forward linkage coefficients calculated from inverse matrices based on the Leontief model and the Ghosh model reveal that there is no strong evidence found supporting the structural change experiences in the 5th year of the EU accession for both countries
L52|Effectiveness of Energy Efficiency Certificates as Drivers for Industrial Energy Efficiency Projects|The efficiency of policies in steering the implementation of energy efficiency (EE) projects has multiple implications including economic opportunity such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, security of supply, technological development opportunity for industry. One of the key new instruments foreseen to support EE improvements is the EE certificate (EEC). Focusing on the industrial business case, the purpose of this paper is two-fold. First the energy performance contact is analyzed and discussed, second this paper shows how EECs concur in supporting the viability of the investment. Specifically, results suggest including this instrument the payback time reduction would be around 20% below the baseline hypothesis

L52|Determinants of investment under incentive regulation: The case of the Norwegian electricity distribution networks|Investment in electricity networks, as regulated natural monopolies, is among the highest regulatory and energy policy priorities. The electricity sector regulators adopt different incentive mechanisms to ensure that the firms undertake sufficient investment to maintain and modernise the grid. Thus, an effective regulatory treatment of investment requires understanding the response of companies to the regulatory incentives. This study analyses the determinants of investment in electricity distribution networks using a panel dataset of 129 Norwegian companies observed from 2004 to 2010. A Bayesian Model Averaging approach is used to provide a robust statistical inference by taking into account the uncertainties around model selection and estimation. The results show that three factors drive nearly all network investments: investment rate in previous period, socio-economic costs of energy not supplied and finally useful life of assets. The results indicate that Norwegian companies have, to some degree, responded to the investment incentives provided by the regulatory framework. However, some of the incentives do not appear to be effective in driving the investments.
L52|Impact of network payment schemes on transmission expansion planning with variable renewable generation|A large number of studies have dealt with the Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) problem. However, few investigations have focused on analyzing the impacts of network payment schemes on network configuration and the benefits/losses distribution among the participants in electricity markets. In this paper, we propose a multi-annual transmission expansion planning model considering four different network payment schemes to finance the construction of new transmission lines, seeking to reduce the total system costs. Wind and solar power generation are included in the model taking into account their variability. The proposed models are reformulated as Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems. We use seven performance metrics related with congestion, nodal prices and generator benefits, among others, to evaluate the effect of each payment scheme. A realistic case study based on the main power system in Chile is analyzed to illustrate the proposed models. It is shown that integrating line cost-recovering equations into the TEP model may result into a more realistic and less congested power network. Also, total system cost is highly related with transmission tariff discrimination. In that way, tariffs with high location dependence perform better in the case studied, the Chilean power system.
L52|A difficult road ahead: Fleet fuel economy, footprint-based CAFE compliance, and manufacturer incentives|Using detailed vehicle specifications, this paper analyzes the impact identifiable vehicle characteristics and technological progress has on fleet fuel economy by vehicle type and class. The results suggest manufacturers will face a difficult task complying with the new footprint-based CAFE standards if compliance is met by only changing identifiable vehicle characteristics. I find evidence that the stringent footprint-based standards create a manufacturer incentive to increase vehicle size to lower the burden of compliance. This undermines the standards' potential to create expected fuel savings and lower emissions levels.
L52|Economic impacts of debottlenecking congestion in the Chinese coal supply chain|The fast pace of development in China's coal industry created bottlenecks in its transportation infrastructure. These bottlenecks likely affected not only China's domestic coal market, but also global coal markets. In this paper, we estimate the costs and consequences of these bottlenecks using a production and multimodal transportation model. We find that coal transportation inefficiencies increased the price of Chinese domestic coal at coastal locations and thereby influenced global seaborne coal prices. According to our model results, the resulting extra costs of coal supplied to the Chinese economy totaled 228 billion renminbi (RMB) in 2011 and 105 in 2013. The subsequent debottlenecking, on the other hand, has reduced the price of Chinese domestic coal delivered to coastal regions and contributed to the reduction in global seaborne coal prices since 2011. Our analysis also suggests that current tariffs for coal transport, with their embedded taxes to cover investments in rail capacity, result in economic efficiencies similar to charging marginal transportation costs and that planners have not introduced distortions that impose significant additional costs on the Chinese economy. Many projects that expanded transport capacity delivered strongly positive rates of return. However, some have poor or negative rates of return, which can reflect either overinvestment or preinvestment in future needs.
L52|The need for more efficient public funding of new communications infrastructure in EU member states|Ubiquitous coverage of new high-speed broadband networks, as foreseen by the European Commission, still appears to be a rather unrealistic objective in most European Union member states without government intervention in terms of funding network deployment in unprofitable areas. We contend, however, that the current contract practice of fixing ex ante targets for network expansion is inefficient given the uncertainty about future returns on high-speed broadband services and the public authorities’ incomplete information about the costs of the network provider. This paper suggests delegating the choice of the network expansion to the typically much better informed network operator. Furthermore, we show that such contracts can be implemented based on existing accounting data and that it is not necessary to undertake any additional ex post verification of cost or demand data as is currently the case under claw-back rules.
L52|Net neutrality and innovation at the core and at the edge|How would abandoning Internet net neutrality affect content providers that have different sizes? We model an Internet broadband provider that can offer a different quality of service (priority) to heterogeneous content providers. Internet users can potentially access all content, although they browse and click ads with different probabilities. Net neutrality regulation effectively protects innovation done at the edge by small content providers. Prioritization, instead, increases both infrastructure core investment and welfare only if it sufficiently stimulates innovation from the large content provider.
L52|Efficiency determinants of container terminals in Latin American and the Caribbean|Extensive use of containerized cargo has caused technological changes in the maritime industry and consequently port transformations. To face these new challenges, port reform processes were designed, coming to Latin America in the 90s. The main objectives were the modernization of ports and the promotion of competition and efficiency. However, there still seems to be potential for improving port efficiency. To assess the potential of this margin, this article analyses the evolution of the efficiency of the main container terminals in Latin America and the Caribbean, and determinants of inefficiency. One question this paper seeks to answer is whether increases in efficiency resulting from port modernization subsequent to reforms in Latin America and the Caribbean have been maintained over time. In addition, and in order to contribute to the definition of economic policies, the main objective of this paper is to analyse the factors that are currently influencing container ports inefficiency – specifically inter-port and intra-port competition. The estimation of a Stochastic Production Frontier shows an average level of technical efficiency of 83% in the 2000–2010 period, and a technological change of 5%. These results show that port efficiency has evolved positively, although affected by the economic crisis. Our findings also indicate that container terminals located in Mercosur countries, and ports with three or four container terminals, are the most efficient, and that transhipment ports are less efficient than other type of ports. According to our findings, LAC decision-makers should consider promoting inter-port competition and strengthening intra-port competition.

L52|Evaluation of subsidies programs to sell green cars: Impact on prices, quantities and efficiency|During the recent period of economic crisis, many countries have introduced scrappage schemes to boost the sale and production of vehicles, particularly of vehicles designed to pollute less. In this paper, the authors analyze the impact of a particular scheme in Spain (Plan2000E) on vehicle prices and sales figures as well as on the reduction of polluting emissions from vehicles on the road. They considered the introduction of this scheme an exogenous policy change and because they could distinguish a control group (both non-subsidized vehicles and the same vehicles in Slovenia) and a treatment group (subsidized vehicles), before and after the introduction of the Plan, the authors were able to carry out their analysis as a quasi-natural experiment. The study reveals that manufacturers increased vehicle prices by 600 € on average. In terms of sales, econometric estimations revealed that the Plan would not cause any increase in sales. With regard to environmental efficiency, comparing the costs (invested quantity of money) and the benefits of the program (reductions in polluting emissions and additional fiscal revenues) and it has been found that the Plan would only be beneficial if it boosted demand by at least 30%.
L52|Potential and partnerships in innovations in EU-funded research projects|We analyse the relationship between the composition of innovation partnerships and the potential of their innovations developed within EU-funded research projects under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7), the European Union's Research and Innovation funding programme for 2007-2013. Innovation potential is assessed using a formal framework capturing three different dimensions: innovation readiness, management and market potential. Both the analysed innovations and innovators were identified by external experts during periodic Framework Programme reviews. Thus, our population includes participants in the FP7 projects that are considered as key organisations in the project delivering innovations in FP7 projects. We show that the innovative potential of research output of homogenous partnerships, e.g. between two SMEs or two large companies, is likely to be higher, as compared to heterogeneous partnerships, e.g. an SME and a large company. The impact of universities on the potential of innovations is unclear. The total number of key organizations in delivering an innovation has a negative impact on its potential. Neither project funding nor duration affects the potential of innovation. Our results contribute to the discussion on the most appropriate design of R&D consortia of organizations in publically-funded projects.
L52|The Causal Effects of an Industrial Policy|"Business support policies designed to raise productivity and employment are common worldwide, but rigorous micro-econometric evaluation of their causal effects is rare. We exploit multiple changes in the area-specific eligibility criteria for a major program to support manufacturing jobs (""Regional Selective Assistance""). Area eligibility is governed by pan-European state aid rules which change every seven years and we use these rule changes to construct instrumental variables for program participation. We match two decades of UK panel data on the population of firms to all program participants. IV estimates find positive program treatment effect on employment, investment and net entry but not on TFP. OLS underestimates program effects because the policy targets underperforming plants and areas. The treatment effect is confined to smaller firms with no effect for larger firms (e.g. over 150 employees). We also find the policy raises area level manufacturing employment mainly through significantly reducing unemployment. The positive program effect is not due to substitution between plants in the same area or between eligible and ineligible areas nearby. We estimate that ""cost per job"" of the program was only $6,300 suggesting that in some respects investment subsidies can be cost effective."
L52|Rethinking deindustrialization|Summary Manufacturing in high-income countries is on the decline and Denmark is no exception. Manufacturing employment and the number of firms have been shrinking as a share of the total and in absolute levels. This paper uses a rich linked employer-employee dataset to examine this decline from 1994 to 2007. We propose a different approach to analyze deindustrialization and generate a series of novel stylized facts about the evolution. While most of the decline can be attributed to firm exit and reduced employment at surviving manufacturers, we document that a non-negligible portion is due to firms switching industries, from manufacturing to services. We focus on this last group of firms before, during, and after their sector switch. Overall this is a group of small, highly productive, import intensive firms that grow rapidly in terms of value-added and sales after they switch. By 2007, employment at these former manufacturers equals 8.7 percent of manufacturing employment, accounting for half the decline in manufacturing employment. We focus on the composition of the workforce as firms make their transition. In addition, we identify two types of switchers: one group resembles traditional wholesalers and another group that retains and expands their R&D and technical capabilities. Our findings emphasize that the focus on employment at manufacturing firms overstates the loss in manufacturing-related capabilities that are actually retained in many firms that switch industries.
L52|La ‘Smart Specialization Strategy’ delle regioni italiane e le relazioni fra ambiti tecnologici|La Smart Specialization Strategy richiede alle regioni di individuare le relazioni tra domini tecnologici all’interno della stessa regione (relatedness) e di indicare i potenziali collegamenti con domini di altre regioni (connectivity). Il presente lavoro, oltre a fornire un quadro degli ambiti di specializzazione individuati dalle regioni italiane, mostra che l’analisi della relatedness e della connectivity è stata in gran parte trascurata dalle regioni stesse. Tale sottovalutazione è, a nostro avviso, frutto della mancanza di una metodologia consolidata per rilevare la natura e l’intensità dei legami fra settori oltre che della carenza di dati e informazioni necessari all’analisi.
L52|Relative Income Traps|Despite economic growth in the post-World War II period, few developing countries have been able to catch up to the income levels in the United States or other advanced economies. Such countries remain trapped at a relative low- or middle-income level. In this article, the authors redefine the concept of income traps as situations in which income levels relative to the United States remain constantly low and with no clear sign of convergence. This approach allows them to study the issue of economic convergence (or lack of it) directly. The authors describe evidence pointing to the existence of both relative low- and middle-income traps and examine cross-country historical transitions between income groups at the global and regional levels. Finally, they point out challenges to the benchmark neoclassical growth theory, which predicts convergence to the developed world over time, and discuss existing theories with the potential to explain income traps.
L52|Industrial production dynamics in particular sectors of Russian industry| Russia’s real economy continued throughout 2015 to accommodate itself to new terms of trade and a new geopolitical context, both of which rendered the dynamics of domestic market’s key indicators less stable and less foreseeable. To make sure that sectoral dynamics are interpreted correctly, analysis of time series in the short term should be attended with seasonal and calendar adjustments. In order to be certain that the available dynamics of industrial production indicates that a period of downturn (or growth) is over, recovery (or slowdown) processes are afoot, monthly series should be decomposed into calendar, seasonal, irregular and trend components.[1] It is the changes of the trend component that should be analyzed in order to provide a substantial interpretation of sectoral trends.
L52|Russian industrial enterprises in 2015 (on the basis of business surveys)|This section is prepared using the data of monthly business surveys conducted by the Gaidar Institute for Economic Policy (IEP) among managers of industrial enterprises since September 1992. The surveys are conducted on the basis of the European harmonized methodology and encompass the entire territory of the Russian Federation. The size of the panel is around 1,000 enterprises, which employ over 13% of the total number of employed in industry. The panel is biased towards large enterprises in each of the selected branches. The rate of response to questionnaires ranges from 70% to 75%. The business survey questionnaire contains quite a small number of questions (not more than 15-20). They are of qualitative rather than quantitative nature. The simple formulation of questions and answers allows the respondents to fill in the forms quickly and without consulting any documentation. It is essential that the respondent at each enterprise is an executive of the highest level possible who is fully aware of the situation at the enterprise and is directly involved in its management

L52|Tort law under oligopolistic competition|This article extends the unilateral accident standard model to allow for Cournot competition. Assuming risk-neutrality for the regulator and injurers, it analyzes three liability regimes: strict liability, negligence rule, and strict liability with administrative authorization or permits systems. Under competition the equivalence between negligence rule and strict liability no longer holds, and negligence insures a better level of social care. However, enforcing both a permit system and strict liability restores equivalence between liability regimes. Furthermore, whatever the current regime, competition leads to lower the global safety level of industry. Indeed, the stronger firm may benefit from safety rents, which they may use to increase production rather than maintaining a high level of safety.
L52|Regulatory Holidays and Optimal Network Expansion|We model the optimal regulation of continuous, irreversible, capacity expansion, in a model in which the regulated network firm has private information about its capacity costs, investments need to be financed out of the firm’s cash flows from selling network access and demand is stochastic. If asymmetric information is large, the optimal mechanism consists of a regulatory holiday for low-cost firms, and a mark-up regime for higher-cost rms. With the regulatory holiday, a firm receives the full revenue of capacity sales, and expands capacity as if it were an unregulated monopolist. Under the mark-up regime, a firm receives only a fraction of the capacity revenues, and is obliged to expand capacity whenever the price for capacity reaches a threshold. The regulatory holiday is necessary to fund information rents to the most efficient firms, which invest relatively early, as direct investment subsidies are not feasible.

It is based on a survey realized by a team of French and Moroccan researchers. It discusses the conditions of the location of the French carmaker, at the crossroads of its internationalisation strategy and of the industrialization policy of the Moroccan government for the Northern country. It studies the impact of this location on the supplier industry and on local employment, underlining the limits in terms of industrial development. Presently, it is more an agglomeration of automotive activities rather than a true integrated industrial cluster.
L52|Effects of Privatization on Price and Labor Efficiency: The Swedish Electricity Distribution Sector|I examine the effects of privatization, in the form of acquisitions, in the Swedish electricity distribution sector. As the majority of the distribution networks remained publicly owned, I use a synthetic control method to identify the effects on price and labor efficiency. In comparison to their synthetic counterparts, I find that the acquired networks increased labor efficiency by on average 18 percent, while no effect is found on the price. Thus, the evidence suggests substantial efficiency gains but that these are not fed through to consumer prices. Since each acquisition involved several bordering networks that were separately operated by each municipality prior to the acquisitions, I examine to what extent the efficiency gains are likely to be driven by increased economies of scale. Results suggest that the entire effect can be explained by increased economies of scale, questioning the causal effect of privatization per se.
L52|Building Public Capabilities for Productive Development Policies: Costa Rican Case Studies|This paper explores the development of public sector capabilities for Productive Development Policies in Costa Rica through four case studies of successful experiences, with less successful cases presented as counterfactuals. To some extent the paper tests the Technical, Organizational and Political Capabilities (TOP) conceptual framework of Cornick (2013), suggesting adjustments and extensions of that framework. Strong commonalities are found among the cases, notably high technical and political capabilities. All cases likewise involve well-managed organizations, but identifying organizational capabilities proved difficult. While the TOP Capabilities framework may be useful for understanding institutional performance, it has three major weaknesses: i) organizational capabilities are not clearly defined; ii) it does not provide tools for identifying and measuring capabilities ties independently of institutional performance; and iii) it needs to be integrated into a more general framework that takes into account the interactions among the political economy, the Policy Making Process, the institutional setup and TOP capabilities.

L52|Economic reforms and industrial policy in a panel of Chinese cities|Abstract We study the effect of place-based industrial policy on economic development, focusing on the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in China. We use data from a panel of Chinese (prefecture-level) cities from 1988 to 2010. Our difference-in-difference estimation exploits the variation in the establishment of SEZ across time and space. We find that the establishment of a state-level SEZ is associated with an increase in the level of GDP of about 20 %. This finding is confirmed with alternative specifications and in a sub-sample of inland provinces, where the selection of cities to host the zones was based on administrative criteria. The main channel is a positive effect on physical capital accumulation, although SEZ also have a positive effect on total factor productivity and human capital investments. We also investigate whether there are spillover effects of SEZ on neighboring regions or cities further away. We find positive and often significant spillover effects.
L52|R&D Policy Involving Consumer-Friendly Strategy: Cooperative and Non-Cooperative R&D|Abstract In a highly globalized economy, foreign exporting firms have initiatives to be consumer friendly for many reasons. The aim of the present paper is to endogenize consumer-friendly actions by the exporting firms, and explore how government’s industrial policy and firm’s R&D investment are affected by the strategy of foreign exporting firms under cooperative and non-cooperative R&D commitments in an international rivalry market. It finds that consumer-friendly action is a dominant strategy equilibrium, and no matter whether under cooperative or non-cooperative R&D, a consumer-friendly firm tends to invest less than does the purely profit-maximizing firm on R&D under symmetrical decisions. In the case of firms cooperating in R&D and involving consumer-friendliness in action, their governments need not intervene. On the other hand, governments always subsidize non-cooperative R&D activities, or cooperative but unfriendly firms. Furthermore, the consumer-friendly action will result in more (less) R&D subsidies by the exporting government when both firms non-cooperate (cooperate) in R&D. Finally, it is robust to indicate that the government of an importing country prefers friendly foreign firms in any circumstances. Above all, the equilibrium outcomes explain the crucial role of consumer-friendly strategy for industrial policies and R&D activities.
L52|Warranty regulation and consumer demand: evidence from China’s automobile market|Abstract Although government regulations on product warranties are common, few studies have empirically examined their effects on product demand. Using a natural experiment, we examine the effect of a newly introduced government warranty regulation in China’s automobile market on product demand. Exploiting the exogenous variation in warranty coverage caused by the regulation, we apply a difference-in-differences analysis and find that the regulation increases the sales of the affected vehicles. Moreover, we find that (1) the demand effects of the regulation decrease as vehicle quality increases, and that (2) these effects are weaker for luxury brand vehicles and stronger for non-luxury vehicles.

L52|Effect of Information Technologies Investments to The Future Plans: A Research in Health Institutions|Information Technologies is a factor that take place at the center of the lives of companies and human lives and that have the greatest positive share in easing the lives. While reaching information is considered to be the most important skill both for companies and people, the tool used in reaching and storage of information is technology. The development of the technologic developments in the world without slowing down, affects the service industry as well as all the other industries. Health institutions that have a great share in service industries have to follow the innovations and technological developments closely in order to survive in competitive market conditions and therefore they should make their plans in in accordance with these developments. In accordance with these statements, the aim of the study is; to search whether the information technology investments of health institutions in order to ensure customer satisfaction and sustainability correspond to the future plans or not. For that purpose, health institutions located in cities Gümüþhane and Trabzon in Eastern Black Sea Region, constitute the universe of the research. The data of the universe is obtained by survey data acquisition technique. Reliability and validation analyses were applied with definitional statistical analyses to the data obtained and the optimal scale structure for the structural model is attained. Goal oriented structural model is analyzed with structural equation model and AMOS 20 and SPSS 20 package programs. In accordance with the factors obtained as a result of the research it is stated that; factors such as information structures of the health institutions, information technology usage levels of the health institutions, information technology perceptions of the health institutions, the usage level of health institutions during decision making processes and technology compliance of health institutions are effective on the future plans of the health institutions.

Finally, the article attempts to integrate these assumptions into an alternative definition of public recreation marketing that is termed “administered marketing.”
L52|Explaining Pakistan’s Premature Deindustrialization|Recognizing that Pakistan faces premature deindustrialization, this paper seeks to explain the phenomenon. The country experienced wild swings in industrialization during the 1950s and 1960s. The period 2001–10 was characterized by fairly strong growth, followed by contractions in other periods. Pakistan’s manufacturing sector is dominated by clothing and textiles exports. Periods of manufacturing growth were associated with pro-manufacturing and import substitution policies, while slumps were characterized by deregulation and a relatively high exchange rate. The evidence shows that the relative stagnation of manufacturing (regardless of the policies implemented) can be explained by the lack of a dynamic industrial policy targeting technological catch-up and leapfrogging. Moreover, where rents were distributed in the form of incentives, there was no emphasis on monitoring and appraisal.
L52|"Analytical Review Of Approaches To Define Of ""Cluster"" And The Assessment Of The Role Of Clusters In Territorial Development"|The article discusses the changing approaches to the definition of a cluster in the scientific literature over the past 25 years, as well as the changing views to the significance of clusters for territorial development.
L52|Exchange Rate, Inflation and Industrial Policy|"The dynamics of the exchange rate of the Russian ruble is considered in the context of the discussions on the optimal exchange rate regimes. It is shown that the dominant focus on the stability of the nominal exchange rate was erroneous. Since the prices in Russia grew faster than in the countries - its trading partners, this policy led to an overvaluation of the real exchange rate and caused the shock devaluations in 1998, 2008 and 2014-2015. It is argued that the best regime for Russia is the ""dirty float"" aimed at maintaining relatively low and stable real exchange rate. This implies the periodic devaluation of the nominal rate. This implies the periodic devaluation of the nominal exchange rate. The suggested policy entails accumulation of foreign exchange reserves that stimulates export oriented growth. These reserves can also become a source of investment in case of appropriate industrial policy."
L52|The Russian government approach to import substitution planning in industry|The article examines the conditions and results of the organization process of import substitution in the Russian industry. The approaches to forecasting, development of import substitution plans, realization of projects are described and proved. The key feature of the planning process is described: it is based not on traditional action plans and road maps but on the potential projects list. The product-project approach is proposed for forming long-term strategic planning documents.
L52|The Afghan Carpet Industry: Issues and Challenges|his paper describes the current issues and challenges that the carpet industry in Afghanistan is facing. The context of this paper is based on review of literature, policy papers and interviews carried out with public and private institutions, carpet producers/ weavers and sellers/traders. Millions of people are directly and indirectly employed and earn their income from this sector in major hand-made carpet producers and exporters of Asian countries including Afghanistan. The Afghan carpets export rose rapidly from USD 4 million in 2001/02 to USD 216 million in 2005/06. After six years the export trend considerably slumped to USD 44 million, which also abruptly affected domestic carpets production. The main issues and challenges found are: competition from other Asian carpet producers and exporters, lack of branding and market linkage, lack of access to finance, low quality raw materials, inadequate cut and wash facilities, lack of market research and limited training, endemic corruption etc. Considering the current unemployment and poverty condition, the cited issues and challenges of the industry should be tackled. To do so, there is a great need of huge and concrete attention plus strong cooperation by the Afghan government, private sector, donor agencies and NGOs.
L52|How Do Product Market Regulations Affect Workers?: Evidence from the Network Industries|Knowing who gains and loses from regulatory reform is important for understanding the political economy of reform. Using micro-level data from 26 countries, this paper studies how regulatory reform of network industries, a policy priority in many advanced economies, influences the labour market situation of workers in network industries. Estimates are identified from changes in a worker’s pay, industry-level employment flows and regulation over time. The main finding is that the regulation of network industries provides workers in this industry with a wage premium and higher employment stability relative to similar workers in other industries. Regulatory reform therefore tends to align labour income and employment stability in the reformed industry with those in other industries. Workers in the reformed industry lose out compared with others, because they no longer benefit from “excess” pay and employment stability. Réglementation des marchés de produits : Quelles conséquences pour le marché du travail dans les industries de réseau ? Pour comprendre l’économie politique d’une réforme réglementaire, il est important de savoir qui seront les gagnants et qui seront les perdants. À partir de microdonnées recueillies dans 26 pays, cet article étudie les incidences que la déréglementation des industries de réseau – une priorité de l’action publique dans de nombreux pays avancés – peut avoir sur la situation des travailleurs employés dans ce secteur. Les effets sont estimés sur la base des variations observées au niveau des salaires, des flux de main-d’oeuvre et de la réglementation. Les principaux résultats de l’analyse montrent que, dans les industries de réseau, la réglementation se traduit par une prime de salaire et une plus grande stabilité de l’emploi que dans les autres secteurs. La déréglementation tend donc à aligner vers le bas les revenus salariaux et le niveau de stabilité de l’emploi des travailleurs concernés, qui sont les perdants de la réforme puisqu’ils ne bénéficient plus du surcroît de salaire et de stabilité dont ils jouissaient auparavant dans leur emploi.
L52|Industrial Policy under Clientelist Political Settlements in Pakistan|Developed and developing countries are diverging rather than converging in their growth trajectories in contradiction to theory. Many explanations have been put forward to explain this fact but they fall short of providing an adequate account of the growth experiences of all countries. The key to explaining this divergence lies in the source of growth in developed countries on the one hand—industrial sector development, and the channel employed by developing countries attempting to emulate their experience on the other hand—industrial policy. The implementation of industrial policy in developing countries has been influenced by political economy factors such as political settlements. Against this backdrop, the interplay between political settlements and formulation and implementation of industrial policy will shed light on the experience of developing countries with industrialisation, and lessons for the future. The aim of this paper is to identify specific political economy factors that could explain the economic growth performance of Pakistan's industrial sector, by comparing two distinct periods of industrial development, and in so doing contribute to the policy debate on industrial policy in the country. his paper finds that Pakistan's political settlements have fractured over time and in doing so compromised the ability of the state to effectively monitor and enforce policies designed to influence and direct economic activity.
L52|تحسين الجودة: أية مقاربة لقطاع الصناعة التقليدية ؟<BR>[Improving quality: what approach for the craft sector in Algeria?]|Different actors show good signs of growing awareness about the complex nature of the process of developing handicraft sector. If much time has passed since the implementation of best practices in handicraft production, the basic problem remains centered around product quality. Often and for some time it was thought that the poor quality of craftsmanship is inevitable, and some of it shortcomings are normal. These beliefs still exist even today and are important reasons for the continuing damage. Quality is a prerequisite for improving the competitiveness of small businesses in handicraft sector and their Successful market access. But for many craftsmen, it is difficult to meet quality requirements, especially in light of the increasing number of required standards to protect the health and safety of consumers, and to respond to the buyers needs. Experience has shown that these two elements, quality and standards, open up more business opportunities for developing economies. This paper aims to contribute to the growing body on the promotion of quality in the crafts sector in Algeria, by answering two fundamental questions: is there really a specific approach to improving the quality of craft products and what are those basics? What additional measures can be made to achieve more in the field of quality improvement?
L52|Productivité, innovation et politique sectorielle des industries de transformation au Maroc (1985-2013) : Fondements théoriques et proposition d’une méthodologie<BR>[Productivity, Innovation and Sectoral Policy of Manufacturing Industries in Morocco (1985-2013): Theory and Proposition of a Methodology]|The determinants of total factor productivity (TFP) of the manufacturing industries, in particular innovation and industrial policy, constituted the seminal contribution of Crépon, Duguet and Mairesse in the late 1990. This study aims to explain the TFP of the 5 branches composing the manufacturing industries in Morocco on the 1985-2013 period through its panel regression on innovation, trade openness and industrial policy variables, as well as their interactions, while testing the model assumptions in the light of the Moroccan reality. This study will also provide conclusions related to the relevance of the original model as well as extensions and implications for further research.
L52|Credit allocation based on journal impact factor and coauthorship contribution|Some research institutions demand researchers to distribute the incomes they earn from publishing papers to their researchers and/or co-authors. In this study, we deal with the Impact Factor-based ranking journal as a criteria for the correct distribution of these incomes. We also include the Authorship Credit factor for distribution of the incomes among authors, using the geometric progression of Cantor's theory and the Harmonic Credit Index. Depending on the ranking of the journal, the proposed model develops a proper publication credit allocation among all authors. Moreover, our tool can be deployed in the evaluation of an institution for a funding program, as well as calculating the amounts necessary to incentivize research among personnel.
L52|Институты Догоняющего Развития<BR>[Institutions of Catching-up Development]|"It is shown that the institutional trajectories of catching-up development in successful countries contained similar interim institutions; this similarity is explained by common technological, institutional and cultural constraints that should be taken into account and to overcome. Corporatism, indicative planning, the presence of the ""main"" development agencies with broad powers, maintaining an undervalued exchange rate - due to these and a number of other mechanisms, countries of economic miracle were able to initiate and maintain rapid growth, despite low level of human capital, underdevelopment of civic culture, and market failures. Institutes of catching-up development contributed to the formation of collaborative relationships between the government, business and society. They softened the existed constraints, and they itself were gradually modified to ensure the transition to modern democracy with effective market economy. The analysis allows to outline а plan of institutional reform , taking into account the institutional particularities of Russia. The principles of the administrative reform are considered. The problem of the formation of a hybrid national planning system is formulated, which includes indicative planning and program budgeting. To finance the planned projects, it is offered a mix of public-private partnership and project financing. It is proposed to use the Japanese experience of stimulating temporary association of companies for the development of modernization projects. The principles of reforming of the state property governance, as well as education and science sectors are discussed."
L52|Governance Innovation for SOEs in Bulgaria: Based on Korean Experience|The recent financial performances of many Bulgarian SOEs have revealed the shortcomings in the management of its SOEs. The main direction of Bulgarian reforms should be improving transparency, better selection and appraisal of management, sustainable dividend policy, strengthening financial discipline and coherent ways to reduce the debt burden. The institutional status quo is clearly inefficient and needs to be replaced. The direction of SOE governance reforms in Korea and Bulgaria are substantially different. Korea has maintained a very centralized grip over SOEs for an extended period of time, and it needs to reduce government intervention by guaranteeing more autonomy for SOEs. On the other hand, Bulgaria needs more centralized control over SOEs, which is expected to improve their performance. The Korean experience in reforming its SOE management system is highly relevant for Bulgaria and it complies with the OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises. This paper asks 31 questions regarding a system of good governance and presents options for each question regarding positive and negative aspects, followed by specific recommendations for the Bulgarian government. It is recommended that a centralized authority responsible for the management of SOEs be established which is composed of line vice-ministers and experts from academia and the private sector. Major tasks and responsibilities should be transferred gradually from line ministries to this new setting. Among these include increasing transparency, the introduction of an evaluation system with strict consequences and related open competitive procedures for the selection, the appointment and appraisal of CEOs, as well as an annual bonus system. SOE governance reform in Bulgaria will touch off strong resistance from both line ministries and their SOEs. Therefore, it will require a good deal of effort and strategy to accomplish the task. It is important to win the minds of the people and the political leadership in that the current system is subject to a number of problems, and that reform of the system is critical to a more efficient economy and provision of better public services to its citizens.
L52|Evaluating Public Supports To The Investment Activities Of Business Firms: A Meta-Regression Analysis Of Italian Studies|This paper presents a meta-regression analysis of recent micro-econometric evaluations of enterprise and innovation policies implemented in Italy. We categorise 478 programme impacts from 43 studies, all obtained using methods that are appropriate for causal inference in observational settings, and analyse which programme, study and estimate characteristics are associated with higher probability of success net of unobserved heterogeneity at the study level. We find that several types of programmes yield non-negligible probability of success and that the outcome variable used to measure programme impact matters. If there exist any differential in probability of success between the government levels that may deliver the programmes, this differential is favourable to regional governments.
L52|Smart Specialisation: Insights from the EU Experience and Implications for Other Economies|The paper discusses the origins and emerging ideas of smart specialization, and in particular its translation from a non-spatial concept to an explicitly spatial and regional concept. This discussion is then set in the context of debates regarding the nature, rationale, and role of modern innovation policy, and the governance and institutional issues arising are then examined. We extend this discussion to discuss the experience of these issues in EU regions, and the arguments are then broadened to the potential lessons for other parts of the world which are aiming to enhance their innovation potential.

L52|Indiaâ€™s Possible Response to the Challenge of the Mega-regionals|The mega-regional trade agreements, particularly the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, and the Trade in Services Agreement, represent a new phenomenon for the global trading system. As major preferential trade agreements that involve the worldâ€™s largest economies (the United States and the European Union), they cover a large share of global trade and, thus, generate large spillover effects on non-parties to the negotiations. Further, the ambitious rule-making agenda shifts the locus of global rule-making and standard-setting from the inclusive World Trade Organization to the small number of participants in these negotiations. These rules and standards will shape markets and, thus, amplify the direct effect of discriminatory preferences. This article discusses the factors driving the mega-regionals, considers the significance of these negotiations for excluded parties, and suggests how India, in particular, might respond.
L52|Industrial Trajectory and Economic Development|This article examines Brazilâ€™s industrial trajectory, beginning with an analysis of the process of import substitution industrialization and its role historically. This is followed by an analysis of industry after the transition to neoliberalism. The resulting evidence implies a clear process of deindustrialization, and upon examining the pattern of exports, a process of re-primarization as well. The paper concludes with a discussion of these troubling trends for the current trajectory of the Brazilian economy.
L52|Tort Law under Oligopolistic Competition|This article extends the unilateral accident standard model to allow for Cournot competition. Assuming risk-neutrality for the regulator and injurers, it analyzes three liability regimes: strict liability, negligence rule, and strict liability with administrative authorization or permits systems. Under competition the equivalence between negligence rule and strict liability no longer holds, and negligence insures a better level of social care. However, enforcing both a permit system and strict liability restores equivalence between liability regimes. However, whatever the current regime, competition leads to lower the global safety level of industry. Indeed, the stronger firm may benefit from safety rents, which they may use to increase production rather that maintaining a high level of safety.
L52|Southern Europe in crisis: industrial policy lessons from Italy and Portugal|Abstract Italy and Portugal have characteristics in common and some relevant differences, both of which provide useful inputs for a comparative analysis. Lucchese et al. (Industrial policy and technology in Italy, 2016) argue that deindustrialization in Italy stems partially from the shortcomings of industrial policy, which has been unable to promote the development of more knowledge-intensive activities. In contrast, our assessment of industrial policy in Portugal indicates that the absence of structural change towards more knowledge-intensive activities does not seem to result from the absence of adequate industrial policy measures. Even though most of the policy instruments that have been put in place in Portugal being of a ‘horizontal’ nature, support has been unevenly distributed across industries, often being concentrated in more technology-intensive industries. We conclude that despite existing room for improvements in the industrial policies, overcoming the current crisis in the Southern belt of the euro zone will require decisive changes in macroeconomic policies.
L52|Industrial policy options for sustaining growth in Italy|Abstract The paper discusses main features of the structural change that the Italian industry has undergone since the 1990s, the reduction of resources it can count on and the options available for the promotion of industrial competitiveness. Insufficient investment in R&D, education and digital infrastructure have undermined the performance of Italian industry and its capability of sustain high levels of economic growth and welfare. As traditional instruments for supporting the industry are not any more available, new financial instruments provide opportunities to redress international competitiveness.
L52|Mass Flourishing and Corporatism: Two Indian Stories|Abstract This paper examines Phelps’ notions of ‘corporatism’ and ‘flourishing’ from the point of view of India’s growth experience since independence in 1947 up to 1990s when economic reform was initiated. It looks at two pre-reform Indian stories, those of agriculture sector and industrial sector, which provide a developing country color to Phelps’ analysis.
L52|Evolutionary targeting for inclusive development|Abstract Many studies articulate a theoretical conceptual change—that is, a change from neo-classical economics and “Picking Winners” policy frameworks to a systemic-evolutionary targeting framework. Within such an intellectual context, this paper attempts to expand the evolutionary targeting framework to facilitate the process of inclusive industrial development. We present a unitary industrial development trajectory which is used as a narrative to articulate the evolutionary paths of Taiwan and Malaysia in making their respective sectoral changes (from informal to formal, and then to high technology sectors) endogenous. Building on both cases, we elucidate how the organization of subsistence farming contributes to development, and hence paves the way for new industrial takeoff. In this regard, the targeting programs that focus on the Schumpeterian segment are improved upon to offer support for (re)organization of the informal sector. This study, therefore, proposes a new analytical grid theorizing the current observations in inclusive development studies. It thus explicitly acknowledges the importance of transforming the informal sector to achieve inclusive development.
L52|Standortindex DIGITAL: Nützlich zum Erkennen von Handlungserfordernissen im IKT-Sektor?<BR>[Location Index DIGITAL – Useful for Justifying Economic Policy Action Requirements in the ICT Sector?]|Zusammenfassung Beim letzten Nationalen IT-Gipfel der Bundesregierung am 18./19.11.2015 haben die Kanzlerin und der Wirtschaftsminister einhellig hervorgehoben, dass Deutschland hinsichtlich des Digitalisierungsgrades von Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft im internationalen Vergleich allenfalls mittelmäßig abschneiden würde und zudem gegenüber anderen Ländern jüngst auch noch zurückgefallen sei. Diese Urteile wurden mit Ergebnissen einer neuen Studie begründet, in der von einem Marktforschungsunternehmen im Auftrag des Bundeswirtschaftsministeriums ein „Standortindex DIGITAL“ konstruiert und ermittelt wurde. Wie aussagekräftig ist dieses Messinstrument? Der Autor hält diesen Index nicht für geeignet, um darauf wirtschaftspolitische Schlussfolgerungen zu gründen.
L52|Standortindex DIGITAL: Nützlich zum Erkennen von Handlungserfordernissen im IKT-Sektor?|Both the German Federal Chancellor and Minster of Economic Affairs unanimously emphasised at the last “national IT summit” on 18-19 November 2015 that the degree of digitisation in the German economy and society is mediocre when compared internationally, and that in the recent past Germany has even lost ground to other countries regarding the nation’s “ICT isation”. These assessments were justified by the results of a new study commissioned by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs in which a market research firm construed a so called “location index DIGITAL”. The present article shows that the quality of this measurement instrument is poor. As a consequence, the tenability of the economic policy conclusions drawn from the index by high level government representatives is low. Copyright ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016
L52|Regulatory holidays and optimal network expansion|We model the optimal regulation of continuous, irreversible, capacity expansion, in a model in which the regulated network firm has private information about its capacity costs, investments need to be financed out of the firm’s cash flows from selling network access and demand is stochastic. If asymmetric information is large, the optimal mechanism consists of a regulatory holiday for low-cost firms, and a mark-up regime for higher-cost rms. With the regulatory holiday, a firm receives the full revenue of capacity sales, and expands capacity as if it were an unregulated monopolist. Under the mark-up regime, a firm receives only a fraction of the capacity revenues, and is obliged to expand capacity whenever the price for capacity reaches a threshold. The regulatory holiday is necessary to fund information rents to the most efficient firms, which invest relatively early, as direct investment subsidies are not feasible.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L52|Structural transformation in Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS)|This paper provides a comparative overview of the experiences of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) with structural transformation since the 1980s. We evaluate the different outcomes in industrialisation in these countries, explore the reasons for success (and failure); we also ask what currently industrially lagging countries can learn from the BRICS in this regard, and what impact their industrialisation had on poverty reduction. We point out that important areas for future research and current challenges remain. Foremost in this is the need for BRICS to drive their further structural economic transformation through innovation, taking into consideration their stage of development and the particulars of the sectors involved. As they develop, entrepreneurship and the role of the private sector seem to become more important. The paper is based on our edited book published in 2015 by Oxford University Press 'Structural Change and Industrial Development in the BRICS'.
L52|Innovation System in Development: The Case of Peru|Despite an exceptional economic performance achieved over the last decade, Peru still lags behind other middle-income Latin American economies in terms of per capita income and productivity. The Peruvian economy remains relatively undiversified, largely dependent on natural resources. The nationalinnovation system is under development, weakly integrated, and underfunded, with few incentives for its actors to engage in innovation activities and collaborate with others. This note summarises the current state of innovation in Peru and reviews the capacity of the innovation system to generate new competitive advantages in industry. It briefly discusses policies and policy gaps in research and innovation and benchmarks national innovation competences to other relevant economies, based on available indicators and surveys. Following a sequential approach, a strengthened policy agenda for innovation should tackle fundamental weaknesses of the innovation system and set the basis for its expansion and a better articulation. Examples of policy actions to improve research performance and business innovation are provided. The paper concludes with suggestions for reforming the innovation system and provides examples of policy actions.
L52|Russia and China in the 21th century. Moving towards cooperative behaviour|Cooperation between Russia and China is a slow process that both countries are pursuing in a difficult context moving from different interests. Russia moves eastwards in search of new partners and tries to foster the development of the Far East. China seeks faster routes to Europe through Central Asia. Given the participation of many actors, state agencies and private companies, negotiations of the terms of trade and investment are laborious. Joint or separate participation in financing require solid legal foundations. Institutions need to adapt. Both countries want to emancipate themselves from the dominance of the dollar in international payments. Domestic national payment systems have been created and the use of own currencies in mutual transactions is on the way in border regions. Some deals, such as in gas and high speed transport, have been successfully concluded, but progress is slow not least because the countries are competitors in Asia. China is stronger in economic terms, Russia’s military power remains unchallenged. Policy dialogue is needed. The Eurasian Economic Union and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation may provide convenient arenas for an exchange of views ahead of possible broader agreements.
L52|Competitiveness and industrial policy: from rationalities of failure towards the ability to evolve|This article elaborates a dynamic rationale of industrial policy, focusing on how to strengthen the socio-economic system’s ability to evolve, i.e. how to achieve high real income together with qualitative change. It highlights that the ubiquitous rationalities of failure, be it of markets, governments or systems, are rooted in a peculiar habit of accepting hypothetical perfect states as normative benchmarks. In contrast, a dynamic logic of intervention should start from the question, what the system aims to accomplish. Combining the structuralist ontology of micro-, meso- and macro with the functional principles of evolutionary change, the paper proposes a general typology of economic policies based on their respective contributions to the system’s ability to evolve.
L52|Investments, balance of payment equilibrium and a new industrial policy in Europe|This paper aims to indicate that an economic recovery of the European economy can be pulled by an increase of the aggregate demand and by the adoption of a new industrial policy having a territorial dimension. While the Domar's and Thirlwall's model indicates that growth is determined by the growth of exports and does not consider investments, the paper indicates that an appropriate distribution of investments between the exporting and the domestic sector can determine both an increase of GDP and an equilibrium of the balance of payment. The model of innovation and investment pulled growth illustrated in the paper, indicates that a greater immaterial investment in R&D, education and project design and planning leads to greater innovation; this latter is the factor leading to an increase of the propensity to invest by the firms and then the investment leads to an increase of GDP, which may be compatible with the constraint of the equilibrium of the balance of payment. The paper clarifies the specific characteristics of the domestic goods and services, such as those of: housing, mobility, health and education, leisure and culture, energy and environment, which aim to respond to the increasing needs by the European citizens of new goods and services and better infrastructures, especially in the largest European cities. A new industrial policy differs from horizontal policies aiming to enhance the supply of the production factors or by the traditional industrial policies focusing on key technologies and sectors or on selected leading companies and should be pulled by the demand and innovation and be organized according to the new markets (lead-markets) and productions, which are emerging in developed countries notwithstanding the current slow growth.

L52|Innovation and investments in a regional cross-sectoral growth model: A change is needed in European cohesion policies|This paper aims to indicate that an economic recovery of the European economy can be pulled by an increase of the aggregate demand and by the adoption of a new European cohesion policy having an industrial and a territorial dimension. The paper illustrates a theoretical model: the model of the 'cross-sectoral demand' and the 'cross-sectoral supply', where growth is based on the interdependent changes of the sectoral structure of the supply and the demand. A crucial role is attributed to the flows of new knowledge, innovation and investment, as factors which affect both the aggregate supply and the aggregate demand. The paper illustrates the characteristics of the equilibrium and the pattern of growth in the model of the 'cross-sectoral demand' and the 'cross-sectoral supply' and it compares this model with the traditional macroeconomic 'AD-AS model'. Then, it indicates that industrial and regional policies are complementary to the monetary and fiscal policies, as they may promote the creation of new productions and determine an increase of GDP and employment at the regional and national level, also in a short-medium term perspective and not only for long term development.
L52|Capital Market Distortion, Firm Dynamics and Wage Inequality|This paper examines the short- and long-run effects of capital market distortion on income distribution and social welfare in a developing dual economy. In addition to capital market distortion, we also consider the distortion that exists in the labor market. In particular, wage inequality is a consequence of the labor market distortion. The capital market distortion can lead to capital misallocation, which further affects the factor returns in the economy. We find that in the short run, a rise in the capital market distortion in favor of the urban firms do not yield a significant impact on wage inequality. However, the preferential policy on lower capital costs to the urban firms can attract new entry to the urban sector, which could raise skilled wages through an increase in the demand for skilled labor, but lower unskilled wages by substituting capital for unskilled labor. Thus, the existence of the capital market distortion can contribute to wage inequality in the economy via firm dynamics.
L52|Digitalisation: An engine for structural change - A challenge for economic policy|"Digitalisation is in everyone's hands. During the last nine years the smartphone tremendously changed private lifestyle. Anytime and everywhere we are connected, we have options for decision making and controlling in real-time. Producer of hardware as well as software service provider of platforms are driving these current structural change's aspects. However - although less visible publicly - digital transformation also includes traditional industry, this is what the buzzword ""Industrie 4.0"" stands for. The political and public debate on necessary control of this transformation is as much hallmarked by the search for starting points as by heated demands for targeted competition law based interventions. In this context, it has to be noted that the digital transformation's different aspects are neither adequately differentiated nor systematically captured. That is the task this contribution tackles. A classification for digital business models is developed, in order to analytically exploit the different scopes and consistently infer politico-economic need for action."

Die politische und öffentliche Diskussion über die notwendige Steuerung dieser Transformation ist durch ein Suchen nach Ansatzpunkten ebenso geprägt wie durch lautstarke Forderungen nach gezielte Interventionen auf Basis des Wettbewerbsrechts. Dabei fällt auf, dass die verschiedenen Ausprägungen der digitalen Transformation weder hinreichend differenziert noch systematisch erfasst werden. Dieser Aufgabe stellt sich der Beitrag. Es wird eine Systematik für die digitalen Geschäftsmodelle entwickelt, um diese in verschiedenen Wirkungsbereichen analytisch zu nutzen und einen wirtschaftspolitischen Handlungsbedarf konsistent abzuleiten."
L52|How to fill the digital gap? The (limited) role of regulation|This paper provides evidence on the migration from an 'old' technology to a 'new' technology, taking into account the impact that regulatory interventions on the old one might have on the incentives to invest and adopt the new one. This analysis has been applied to a sample of EU27 countries using panel data from 2004 to 2014 on the adoption, coverage and take-up rate of ultra-fast broadband infrastructures, whose development is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 programmes. Results show that a 1% increase in the regulated price to access the old technology increases the adoption and the investment on the new broadband technology by ~0.45% and ~0.47%. These effects are not homogeneous across countries and are weakened in Eastern European countries, where the existing old broadband infrastructures are less developed than in the rest of Europe. It has also been shown that the access price to old networks negatively affects the take-up rate of the new technology-based services, thus calling for the need of more specific and complementary demand side policy incentives to enhance service adoption.

L52|Determinants of hidden champions: Evidence from Germany|Our explorative study analyses the factors that affect the likelihood of German companies to be a hidden champion. Based on an econometric estimation model with quantitative data from 60 hidden champions and 346 non-hidden champions, we could confirm prior research findings that specific enterprise characteristics such as research and development, international business activities and the great ambition to maximise market shares have significant positive effects on the likelihood to belong to the group of hidden champions. Companies of the service and distribution industries have lower chances to be a hidden champion compared to manufacturing enterprises. Drawing on the empirical finding that hidden champions do not place great value on the use of public promotional funds, governments are advised to apply other support measures in order to foster the development of hidden champions. The startingpoint should be the improvement of framework conditions.
L52|Facility- and service-based competition and investment in fixed broadband networks: Lessons from a decade of access regulations in the European Union member states|This paper employs firm-level panel data of 57 incumbent and entrant firms for 23 European countries in the decade from 2003 to 2012. We examine the impact of service- and facility-based competition on firm-level investment as well as the strategic effects underlying infrastructure investment decisions. At the same time we explicitly model the structural dynamics of broadband investment by means of a flexible accelerator model. The empirical specification employs dynamic panel estimation techniques which allow us to account for various sources of endogeneity. We find that facility-based competition exerts a positive and significant impact on both incumbents and entrants implying that incumbents’ and entrants’ investment decisions are strategic complements. Moreover, we find that intermodal competition in terms of fixed-mobile substitution exerts different effects at the firm level. Finally, we show that service-based competition appears to have no significant impact on the investment decision of incumbents and entrants. However, with respect to the later phase of market liberalization, service-based competition exerts a negative impact on entrants’ investment. Our results thus also provide relevant policy guidance on the role of service-based competition in regulating emerging high-speed broadband infrastructure.
L52|Refinancing under yardstick regulation with investment cycles: The case of long-lived electricity network assets|In the context of yardstick regulation with long-lived assets, the influence of heterogeneous investment cycles on the ability to recover capital is found to be important. The application of efficient firm standards based on historic (straight-line) depreciation given heterogeneous investment and cost cycles will cause instantaneous yardstick levels below the long-run refinancing level. The efficient firm standard will prevent capital recovery in later periods. An illustrating example from electricity distribution illustrates the relevance of the problem. Finally, two alternatives, branch average cost yardstick determination and correction factors based on the share of capital under depreciation, are discussed.
L52|Economic determinants of optical fiber share in total broadband connections in OECD countries|This study realizes the benefits of optical fiber broadband as an economic stimulation thus it analyzes the determinants of optical fiber share in total broadband connections in OECD countries with the focus on the demand-driven factors and the government roles as the stimulator, the regulator and the investor in the optical fiber sector. It constructs a panel data set using the data during 2012-2014 and estimates the fixed and random effects model with the judgment of the best model by Hausman test. The results reveals that the share of optical fiber behaves well according to the demand theory on the own-price and cross-price effects. Education is a must to support the growth of optical fiber. The government roles differ in their effects, i.e. the role of stimulator and the regulation of local loop unbundling enhance the growth of optical fiber deployment and adoption while the role as the investor negatively impacts the share. Moreover, the study also examines the effects of government roles of regulation regarding to intra-platform competition on the unit price of optical fiber. It discovers that initially the larger number of competitors drives the unit price down by their competition, but later after the establishment of giant incumbent firms in the market and gain sufficient market power and the control over prices such that the number of new comers cannot affect the growing trend of the unit price of the optical fiber broadband.
L52|Sticky Spots on Slippery Slopes: The Development of the Integrated Circuits Industry in Emerging East Asia|This paper draws from an evolutionary study of 36 integrated circuit (IC) production firms to examine the role of institutions and intermediary organizations in supporting technological upgrading in the integrated circuit industry in emerging East Asia. The evidence shows that IC firms in Korea and Taiwan have reached the technology frontier to show that they are deeply rooted on the slope of competition. IC production has also become sticky in Singapore and China where the provision of grants and government-industry coordination have attracted participation in the high value added activities of wafer fabrication, IC design and supportive R&D activities. Although IC production in Malaysia has enjoyed functional upgrading, particularly since 2005, its capacity to follow the path of Singapore and China will depend heavily on the dismantling of ethnic considerations by the government in the promotion of the industry. IC production is not sticky at all in the countries of Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia because of a lack of institutional deepening. Consistent with the global production network approach, the successful experiences examined in this paper show that the development of institutions and intermediary organizations through effective coordination between governments and industry is critical to stimulate technological upgrading in the IC industry.
L52|Industrial Policy and Competition|Using a comprehensive dataset of all medium and large enterprises in China between 1998 and 2007, we show that industrial policies allocated to competitive sectors or that foster competition in a sector increase productivity growth. We measure competition using the Lerner Index and include as industrial policies subsidies tax holidays, loans, and tariffs. Measures to foster competition include policies that are more dispersed across firms in a sector or measures that encourage younger and more productive enterprises.

L52|Can Tax Breaks Beat Geography? Lessons from the French Enterprise Zone Experience|This paper shows that urban geography matters to the effectiveness of place-based policies, using the French enterprise zone program as a case study. Whereas this program created more jobs in spatially integrated neighborhoods, its impact on local wages was only visible in the more isolated ones. In addition, a focus on the average impact of the program would lead to the conclusion that it mostly succeeded in displacing preexisting firms, but a lower level of spatial isolation was a clear determinant of the decision to create new firms from scratch.

L52|Public Policy Objectives and the Next Generation of CPA Systems: An Analytical Framework|The payments landscape in Canada is rapidly changing and will continue to evolve, fuelled by strong and persistent drivers. In Canada, the Canadian Payments Association (CPA) is on a path to modernize Canada’s core payment systems. This paper contributes to the discussion in three ways. First, it translates the government’s public policy objectives (PPOs) for the broad payments ecosystem into desired outcomes for CPA payment systems. Second, it develops a taxonomy for clearly describing the defining attributes of a payment system. These defining attributes are access, functionality, interoperability, timeliness of payments and risk management. Finally, we develop an analytic framework to consider the trade-offs of the various attributes to achieve the PPOs for the Canadian payments ecosystem. A key output of these contributions includes a possibilities frontier that represents the set of systems with designs that best achieve the PPOs, subject to regulatory and technological constraints. Based on the results of this exercise, we recommend the most critical issues for the CPA to investigate as it considers the modernization of its systems.
L52|Net Neutrality with Competing Internet Platforms|" type=""main""> We propose a two-sided model with two competing Internet platforms, and a continuum of Content Providers (CP's). We study the effect of a net neutrality regulation on capacity investments in the market for Internet access, and on innovation in the market for content. Under the alternative discriminatory regime, platforms charge a priority fee to those CP's which are willing to deliver their content on a fast lane. We find that under discrimination, investments in broadband capacity and content innovation are both higher than under net neutrality. Total welfare increases, though the discriminatory regime is not always beneficial to the platforms as it can intensify competition for subscribers. As platforms have a unilateral incentive to switch to the discriminatory regime, a prisoner's dilemma can arise. We also consider the possibility of sabotage, and show that it can only emerge, with adverse welfare effects, under discrimination."
L52|Why corporations in developing countries are likely to be even more susceptible to the vicissitudes of international finance than their counterparts in the developed world: A Tribute to Ajit Singh|All things considered, anything up to US $7 trillion of so-called quantitative easing (QE) funds has flooded emerging markets since the 2008 global financial crisis. These funds, created to stimulate a recovery in the OECD and to stabilise international financial markets, ended up mostly as emerging markets’ corporate bonds and loans (often after being leveraged into many multiples of their original value). They were then either mainly invested (Asia), or used (as in Latin America and South Africa) at best to finance economic activities which do not enhance productive capacities, such as residential construction, or used to finance deficits, M&A, capital flight and all sorts of financial deeds - including as fuel for any conceivable asset bubble. The enquiries of these issues, especially how corporations financed their investment, and how much of it took place, were subjects that fascinated Ajit. He was the first to find out that corporations in emerging markets relied much more on external finance than those in the OECD (where retained profits played a major role). The implication was that they were likely to be even more susceptible to the vicissitudes of financial markets - and as these became ever more weird (the almost inevitable outcome of hasty deregulation cum excess liquidity), the financial balances of corporate sectors north and south of the Equator ended up moving in opposite directions further than ever before. This is a key (if not the key) difference between current global financial fragilities and those at the onset of the current global financial crisis in 2007. This highly asymmetric corporate balance scenario is part and parcel of such a low interest rate and highly financialised environment, as now (among other things) so-called “investors” in search for elusive yields, inevitably have to take on more risk, leverage and illiquidity. And emerging markets have always been their markets of last resort. This is a vital (yet only implicit) ingredient of the peculiar ideas behind super-accommodative monetary policy; but the downside is the risk of more volatile asset prices (including commodities), and unchartered financial fragilities all over. Closer regulatory scrutiny worldwide, therefore, should have been an intrinsic part of such risky reflationary and monetary policies. But try to get speculators, traders and rentiers (or politicians in need of donations) to understand something, when their (shortterm) earnings, bonuses, share options and corporate-sponsored retirement plans depended on them not understanding it. The stakes for emerging markets’ corporations, their economies, financial markets and wider society (and everybody else in the world for that matter) could scarcely be higher - but unfortunately these huge new challenges occur at the worst possible time, as our social imagination has seldom been so barren.
L52|Competitiveness-shifting effects and the prisoner?s dilemma in international R&D subsidy wars|We analyze the incentives to subsidize R&D when there is an R&D leader and an R&D follower. Without government intervention, the R&D leader always achieves higher cost competitiveness than the R&D follower. In the presence of R&D subsidies, the country that hosts the R&D follower offers higher R&D subsidies than the country that hosts the R&D leader. As a result, competitiveness-shifting effects arise, since due to the R&D subsidy the R&D follower achieves higher cost competitiveness than the R&D leader. Consequently, the country that hosts the R&D follower does not face a prisoner?s dilemma in international subsidy wars, since even when the foreign country retaliates, it is always better off when it intervenes.
L52|Entrepreneurship and its analysis in Colombia: A contextualized literature review|This paper presents a literature review contextualized through the different stages of Colombian industrial history up to the first decade of the XXI century, when an attempt is made to organize the growing interest in the topic of entrepreneurship. We find a tight connection between public policy agenda setting and the definition of the research agenda of the topic. We also find a dualistic approach in the research of the topic, with universities and think-tanks leading the investigation on accumulative / innovative entrepreneurship, and a consultancy-bias group dedicated to the study of subsistence entrepreneurship. ***** Este artículo presenta una revisión del avance en el estudio de emprendimiento, contextualizado a través de las diferentes fases de la historia empresarial colombiana. El artículo presenta una marcada conexión entre las motivaciones detrás de la definición de las políticas industrial y de emprendimiento, y la definición de la agenda de investigación de la comunidad académica. Asimismo, se encuentra un dualismo en el estudio del tema; por un lado, grupos de investigación (universidades e instituciones gubernamentales) dedicados al estudio de emprendimientos acumulativos/ de innovación; y por otro, un sesgo proconsultoría dedicado al estudio de emprendimientos de subsistencia.
L52|La clasificación por tamaño empresarial en Colombia: Historia y limitaciones para una propuesta|El propósito del documento es presentar un panorama general sobre la distribución de las empresas, haciendo énfasis sobre un aspecto que tiene efectos en el desarrollo de la política industrial en Colombia: la clasificación de las Mipymes. En las dos primeras secciones se presenta una breve descripción sobre dos aspectos fundamentales relacionados con el tamaño empresarial: los factores que explican el tamaño de las empresas y el sesgo a la derecha observado en la distribución de las empresas por tamaño en varios países. Las secciones tres y cuatro contienen una revisión de los marcos legales existentes en América Latina y en Colombia para la clasificación de las empresas por tamaño. Las secciones cinco y seis presentan las metodologías tradicionales utilizadas en Colombia para clasificar las empresas y se señalan las principales limitaciones para alcanzar una clasificación utilizando únicamente métodos numéricos.
