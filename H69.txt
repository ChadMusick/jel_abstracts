H69|Reaganomics: A Historical Watershed|The socio-economic impact of Reaganomics and its long-run deleterious legacy is documented. The preponderance of data indicate that economic growth was not particularly impressive in the wake of the tax cuts of 1981 or 1986. GDP did snap back to potential but failed to accelerate beyond the rates achieved in prior or subsequent decades. The supposed incentives of supply-side economics failed to materialize. People did not work more, they did not save or invest more than they did before, and the benefits trickled down like molasses and got stuck at the very top of the income distribution. Instead, Reagan’s presidency was a watershed in U.S. economic development in the sense that it reversed many of the accomplishments of the New Deal and inaugurated an era in which low-skilled men’s wages began a long period of decline, and labor’s share of GDP continued to fall. Reagan’s true legacy is a dual economy that accompanied the hollowing out of the middle class, a more business-friendly regulatory and oversight framework for Wall Street that ultimately led to the financial crisis, a stupendous increase in the national debt from 30% to 50% of GDP that put it on a path such that by 2012 it exceeded 100%, anti-statism that contributed to the rise of Trumpism, a remarkable rise in inequality that gave rise to an oligarchy, and the benign neglect of blue-collar workers who eventually became Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables.” Reagan put the economy on a trajectory to ultimately, even if not inevitably, led to the triumph of Trumpism and an economy of malaise.
H69|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
H69|Fiscal consolidation in Croatia and other post-transition countries|Recent global economic crisis and the concerns about sustainability of public finances have resulted in stronger implementation of fiscal consolidation measures. The literature does not offer a consensus on the impact of these measures. Empirical research offers a rationale for both contractionary and expansionary effect of fiscal consolidation on economic activity. Studies that examine the macroeconomic and fiscal effects of consolidation in developed countries are not frequent either have a long history, while the same effects in the post-transition countries are un-investigated. This paper tries to shed some light on this relationship. Additional contribution of this paper relates to the usage of the narrative approach introduced by Romer and Romer (2010). The research results do not support the expansionary fiscal consolidation hypothesis. Therefore, analysis suggests that fiscal consolidation in the Republic of Croatia and other post-transition countries was not successful in achieving macroeconomic goals such as economic growth.* This paper was supported by Croatian Scientific Foundation under the project ?Public Finance Sustainability on the Path to the Monetary Union? (IP-2016-06-4609).
H69|Funding for Overseas Contingency Operations and Its Impact on Defense Spending|Since 2001, the Department of Defense (DoD) has received about $2.2 trillion to supplement the base-budget funding provided in its regular, annual appropriationsâ€”amounting to about 20 percent of DoDâ€™s appropriations over that time. Almost all of that sum has been designated for overseas contingency operations (OCO) that began after 9/11.
H69|Quasi-fiscal deficits in the electricity sector of the Middle East and North Africa : sources and size|The annual electricity investments needed in the Middle East and North Africa region to keep up with demand have been estimated at about 3 percent of the region's projected gross domestic product. However, in most economies of the region, the ability to make those investments is limited by fiscal and macroeconomic constraints. This paper demonstrates that the solution is readily available: by improving the management and performance of the region's utilities, more than enough resources could be freed up to make the investments needed. The paper presents the first evaluation of the size and composition of the quasi-fiscal deficit associated with the management of the electricity sector in 14 economies in the Middle East and North Africa region. The estimations are for 2013. They show that the average quasi-fiscal deficit is 4.4 percent of gross domestic product (but goes down to 2.9 percent if Lebanon, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Jordan are excluded). Only five economies have a quasi-fiscal deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar, and the West Bank), and hence would not be able to finance the average investment requirement through elimination of inefficiencies. For most economies, the main driver of the quasi-fiscal deficit is the underpricing of electricity, which costs on average 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (but 2.2 percent without Lebanon, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Jordan). Commercial inefficiency comes next, at an average cost of 0.6 percent of gross domestic product. Technical and labor inefficiencies represent, respectively, 0.4 and 0.2 percent of gross domestic product.

H69|Does purchase centralization reduce public expenditure? Evidence from the Italian healthcare system|The introduction of Central Purchasing Bodies within the regional health care systems in Italy during the first decade of 2000s constituted a call for cost reduction and public expenditure restraint in the public health sector. Indeed, regional CPBs operating for local hospitals were introduced to centralize purchases of goods and services, with the aim of reducing prices and facilitate cost reductions, mainly leveraging on economies of scale and larger bargaining power. In this work, we examine this hypothesis adopting a difference-in-difference model to test the causal relationship of the introduction of regional CPBs operating in the health-care systems. Our findings show that per capita total expenditure is reduced to a range of 3-4%, according to the specification of the model, where local hospitals are supplied through a regional CPB. Specifically, this reduction is mainly driven by a subset of supplies, that is health services (e.g., medical and other health-related professional consultancies), while the impact on goods and other non-health services expenditure is not significant. Moreover, the obtained expenditure reduction is achieved without a significant downsizing of local services to citizens.
H69|Fiskalna konsolidacija: teorijski okvir i slučaj Republike Hrvatske|Fiskalna konsolidacija ili fiskalna prilagodba pojmovi su kojima se u makroekonomiji označava proces usklađivanja javnih prihoda i javnih rashoda, putem smanjenja rashoda i/ili povećanja prihoda. Istraživanja koja proučavaju makroekonomske i fiskalne efekte konsolidacije u razvijenim zemljama nisu česta niti imaju dugu povijest, dok su isti efekti u Republici Hrvatskoj nedovoljno istraženi. Ovaj rad mali je korak u pravcu rasvjetljavanja te veze. U radu se statistički analiziraju makroekonomske i fiskalne varijable prije, za vrijeme i nakon razdoblja konsolidacije. Rezultati istraživanja ne idu u prilog tezi o ekspanzivnom djelovanju fiskalne konsolidacije. Stoga, deskriptivna analiza upućuje na zaključak da fiskalna konsolidacija u Republici Hrvatskoj nije ostvarila makroekonomske ciljeve kao što su ekonomski rast i smanjenje nezaposlenosti.
H69|Georgian Public debt Tendency and its impact on the economic growth|This paper analyses the tendency of Georgian Public debt and its impact on the economic growth. Public debt plays important role in the process of developing state?s macroeconomic system. It can be explained by the fact that debt arising and its services greatly affect the country's financial status, the size of the savings, the amount of money, the investment environment, the consumption structure and the international relationship with the rest of the country. It is very difficult to find a country in the whole world which did not face Public debt problem at least once. The issue of Public debt problem can be also explained by the fact that most countries have a tendency to increase debt. The burden of the debt affects on the economic and social conditions of the country and consequently, it is crucial for the government to find ways to solve it. Stabilization of internal and external debt is one of the most essential factors for long-term economic development of the country. Nowadays budget deficit is not surprising, it is well-known method to use debt obligations to fund deficits.Current financial crisis in the modern world have changed the attitude of the countries to be more cautious when it comes to the Public debt. Public debt is mostly used to finance social and economic needs. Country?s solvency and its international reputation is related to the Public debt, so it is very important for any country to determine the exact amount of Public debt and develop an optimal system of management. Based on the above mentioned, this paper studies Georgian public debt effects on the economic growth, the debt management methods and ways of spending. As a result of this study, Georgian Public debt appears not to be big burden for the country, but it has the tendency of growing. At the same time, various problems have been identified in the debt management process.
H69|Public Debt Episodes in Irish Economic History 1950-2015|In this paper I study the public debt dynamics of three episodes (the crises of the 1950s, the 1980s and 2010-15) in Ireland’s modern economic history. By using traditional debt dynamic decomposition formulae, I measure the components which contributed most to public debt ratio reduction following previous high debt episodes. I also employ the case of Sweden for comparative purposes, in how it emerged from the increase in public debt in the aftermath of its banking crisis 1991-1993. The key findings which emerge are 1) the reduction of the public ratio following the 1980s episode was predominantly driven by cumulative primary surpluses, though a favourable growth and interest rate differential emerged as the key determinant in the late 1990s. Additionally, public debt in the 1980s was considerably more difficult to service in terms of tax revenues and maturity structures than the current event. 2) Public debt continued to increase following the crisis of the 1950s due to higher interest rates and lower inflation, despite a recovery in growth and fiscal contraction. 3) In line with other research isolating the uniqueness of open economy debt reductions, I find that though Sweden (like Ireland) reduced public debt in an environment of strong international growth, it did so in a macroeconomic environment of higher interest rates and falling inflation, entirely through budget surplus accumulation.
H69|An Evaluation of the Policies on Repayment of Government’s Trade Debt in Italy|Abstract Since 2012 the Italian Government made several steps to repay its commercial debts. By using a composite dataset, we evaluate the effect of these policies on the financial performances of a representative sample of Italian firms. We distinguish between firms beneficiaries of these repayments, those that were not repaid, although they had a legitimate right, and those that did not have commercial relations with the General Government. We find that receiving money had a significant positive impact on firms’ financial position.
H69|Assessment Of Shadow Economy In Moldova Using The Input-Output Model In 2014|The shadow economy is the bane of modern society. Paradoxically, as the community is poorer, the level of the shadow economy is higher, which in turn leads to lower allocations in the budget, and as a consequence reduces social benefits, reducing the real wages of public sector employees, and the decline in living standards. Therefore, evaluation of the shadow economy is actual for any country in the world. The purpose of research is assessment of the shadow economy in the Republic of Moldova for 2014. From the methodological point of view, the authors used input-output balance method to identify and assess non-observed economy. As a result, the authors had identified elements of non-observed economy for a product group, and had calculated the losses of the state budget.
H69|Foreign Debt: Causes and Measures Taken|In an increasingly globalized world, any crisis, including the ones caused by the foreign debtdefault of a country, may have a negative impact which can be contagious both at regional and atglobal level. Taking into account all the risks to which international creditors were subjectedover time, thestock of foreign debt worldwide has experienced a significant increase in the current millennium,actually demonstrating that international lending is profitable. The causes of default, the measures taken by the concerned countries to get out of this situationand the specific examples were the elements which I have tried to capture in this paper. Last butnot least, I have performed an analysis of the evolution of the foreign debt stock and the repaymentcapacity of small and medium-income countries, respectively the most vulnerable countries interms of debt repayment.
H69|Reverse Charge and the Cash Flow of the Public Budgets in the Czech Republic|Reverse charge is currently used as a measure against VAT carousel fraud. Its extension to all goods and services is discussed among the tax policy makers at the national and EU level. Opponents of general reverse-charge argue that this method of VAT collection would completely change the nature of the VAT system. One of the practical drawbacks of reverse charge is the negative impact on the cash flow of the public budgets. This article quantifies the average monthly financing available to the State thanks to delayed repayments of input tax to VAT payers under the normal VAT system. This amount equals to almost 53 billion CZK and represents the negative impact of the general reverse charge on the cash flow of the public budgets. A change in the deadline for remitting VAT or introducing VAT advances to be paid prior to the final tax payment would reduce the negative influence on public finances.
H69|Implications of Public External Debt for Social Spending: A Case Study of Selected Asian Developing Countries|For developing countries with budgetary and balance-of-payments gaps to meet, maintaining large stakes of external debt is not free of cost. Highly indebted countries have to set aside a sizeable fraction of their scarce resources to service their debt, which naturally affects their development spending in general and allocations for the social sector in particular. This study examines the behavior of seven developing Asian countries and analyzes the impact of public external debt on social sector spending. The panel dataset includes Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, the Philippines, and Indonesia, and spans the period 1980–2010. Our empirical analysis is based on three interrelated equations for different spending categories, which are estimated using the general method of moments. The study’s results confirm the common wisdom that outstanding external debt and its servicing liability have an adverse impact on public spending, particularly on social sector spending. This suggests that developing countries need to mobilize their own resources and minimize their dependence on external borrowing as far as possible.
H69|Use Of The European Union Financial Resources|In terms of the destination of revenues (secondary function of the EU laws on finances), the EU conception, transposed into its own budgetary policy, focuses on strategies meant to ensure an economic growth that is smart - the focus being on education, sustainable - by eliminating dependence on limited resources and favorable - making the social factor a priority. By analyzing EU budgets for the period 2012 - 2015, it can be observed that the principle of budget deficit is not used in the projection of the EU budget, the balance being the true engine of development of the European Union since exceeding revenues create the possibility of making new expenditures and not the circumstantial needs that generate costs, the principal reason for exceeding the approved budgetary provisions.
H69|Work of grief over infancy in street adolescents in Cameroon|"Adolescence is a period that is marked by an identity crisis which is itself a consequence of the balance-unsettling puberty transformations following the earlier resolution of the oedipal complex. Balance will be once again activated after the latency period. These transformations trigger others on the affective level (emotional, bonds to earlier objects). A crisis in the social bond can also be observed through this questioning of norms along with family and social values. These different crises contributing to identity construction are ""developmental tasks"" typical in subjects who actually go through this period; hence they constitute an important process of maturation. The subject can however face difficulties fulfilling those tasks. The article engages this challenge of grieving the passing infancy with its particular symbols as experienced by some adolescents in their responsibility to work out new symbols. In fact, every developmental crisis should, according to Wallon (1963), mediate the passing to the next stage. It is therefore manageable. In the special case of adolescents in the street, the persistence of the crisis characterized by anti-social behaviors specific to this population is nothing else but the difficulty in letting go of the symbols of infancy. This argument about the â€˜grieving over infancyâ€™ or mourning of infancy draws on works such as Nasio (2004); Delvenne Nicolis (2007); Marteaux (2008) and Franceschini (2012). The results collected through interviews and observations show the persistence in â€˜street adolescentsâ€™ of behaviors unfavorable to the realization and reorganization of identity."
H69|Do fiscal rules constrain fiscal policy? A meta-regression-analysis|We implement a meta-regression-analysis for the budgetary impact of numerical fiscal rules based on 30 studies published in the last decade. The existing empirical evidence points to a constraining effect of rules on fiscal aggregates. However, this seemingly optimistic message is strongly weakened as our analysis points to a bias if the potential endogeneity of fiscal rules is not explicitly taken into account. Furthermore, our analysis provides evidence for the presence of a publication bias. Both sources of bias reduce the statistical precision of obtained effects below usual levels of statistical significance. In addition, we offer suggestive evidence for the effect size based on a small coherent sub-sample and provide recommendations for future research on the budgetary impact of fiscal rules.
H69|The extended meanings of medical terms. Difficulties in the practice of translation|"Taking into account that the structure of a specialized field is never homogeneous, in order to interpret or translate a term, we should define and know its different possible ""semantic manifestations"" (Martin, 1972: 125). In order to facilitate understanding and to ensure translation accuracy, we analyze - from the perspective of an internal polysemy - the terms of the medical lexicon which constitute a specific and restrictive use of the common language lexicon. Through the study of a selection of terms extracted from a specialized dictionary (DicÅ£ionar Medical, Rusu V. 2010), this communication illustrates the restrictions and the extensions of meaning in a double translation: the terms taken from the common language with a restrictive meaning in the specialized field; the terms belonging to related disciplines and various fields adopting a specific meaning in the medical area. All these directions of change of meaning are thus envisaged to facilitate the practice of translation which raises both general and specific difficulties."
H69|Sind neue Ziele für den Länderfinanzausgleich erforderlich?|For many months, there has been a dispute among the German federal states about the Länderfinanzausgleich. However, neither the German Federal Constitutional Court nor negotiations among the federal and state governments can find a viable solution. The interests of the federal states are extremely different from one another, as the high tax states want to pay less to the other states, which are of course opposed to such a change. Political majorities are not visible, and thus proposals which require a constitutional majority have no chance. In the meantime, other major financial problems have come to the foreground.

H69|The Forecasting Capacity of Indicators Measuring Budget Sustainability|Since the outbreak of the European debt crisis, fiscal sustainability as a research area became more and more popular. This paper aims to assess the predicting power of the basic types of the following five fiscal sustainability indicators: primary gap (1), stationary tests for public debt (2), stationary test for the first differential of public debt (3), public revenues and expenditures cointegration (4); fiscal reaction function (5). The results indicate that predictive power is rather low for all indicators except for the first one. One reason for this may be that these indicators ignore the factors outside the range of fiscal policy. After comparing our result with previous research studies, we conclude that the results of these tests are heavily influenced by the choice of parameters, samples and the econometric methods used. For these reasons, it appears reasonable to evaluate and compare the predictive power of all fiscal sustainability indicators. By utilising the lessons learned, certain procedures should be standardised on the one hand, where this is possible, and on the other, methodology should be developed further in order to increase effectiveness.
H69|Euro membership and fiscal reaction functions|The paper uses fiscal reaction functions for a panel of euro-area countries. We investigate whether euro membership has reduced the responsiveness to shocks in the level of inherited debt. Compared with the performance in the period between signing of the Maastricht Treaty and introduction of the euro, membership has significantly reduced the average responsiveness. Conversely, when compared to the period before the Maastricht Treaty, euro membership is associated with a larger responsiveness. The results are sensitive to changes in the specification, such as an exclusion of Greece from the panel. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
H69|Wird es bald einen neuen Länderfinanzausgleich geben?|The federal financial equalisation among the 16 German federal states has once again become politically controversial. Two highly taxed states (Bavaria and Hesse) have appealed to the Federal Constitutional Court against excessive payments. Most of the other states have objected to this action. The contested regulations, created in 2001, are to apply until the end of 2019. How long the Court will need to reach a decision in the case is an open question. Parallel political negotiations on federal financial relations are also taking place. This short report provides an overview of the current financial dispute.

Apsorpcioni instrument (redukcija budžetskog deficita) i politika promene (devalvacija nacionalne valute) jesu oslonci makroekonomske stabilnosti i programa strukturnog prilagocavanja, i, narocito, politike uspostavljanja kreditne sposobnosti i iznalaženja balansa izmecu finansiranja i prilagocavanja (Reisen, 1988. str. 1-3.)
H69|Eurobonds: politisch erwünscht, ökonomisch sinnvoll, juristisch machbar?|This research focuses on the question of to what extent Eurobonds are feasible and which problems may arise in the political, economic and juridical areas. The contribution shows possible forms of the arrangement and discusses a justification from the regulatory point of view. It also examines the extent to which Eurobonds have already become reality by the rescue aid of the European Union. The economic analysis demonstrates the interrelated benefits and problems, especially redistribution, misdirected incentives and misallocation of capital. Finally, establishing Eurobonds is the cornerstone of the political and normative question of which direction the Eurozone will or rather should move within the scope of the sovereign debt crisis.

H69|Overcrowding Versus Liquidity In The Euro Sovereign Bond Markets|With the adoption of a common currency the degree of substitution between financial instruments supplied by EMU Member States to finance their national debts has risen. Providing the market for euro-denominated government securities with a large volume of similar financial instruments is likely to increase liquidity and lower yields. By contrast, providing an excessive volume of the same instrument might increase the return demanded by investors. This paper aims at empirically assessing the balance between liquidity and overcrowding effects by EMU countries’ issuance plans. Our results document a significant relationship between bunching in issues and bond yields.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H69|Government science and technology budgets in times of crisis|Following a recent paper by Filippetti and Archibugi [Filippetti, A., Archibugi, D., 2011. Innovation in times of crisis: National systems of innovation, structure and demand. Research Policy 40(2), 179–192], this article aims to contribute to the sparse literature on the impacts of the recent economic downturn on the government expenditures and innovative activities of the countries of the enlarged European Union (EU-27). Using Eurostat's socio-economic objectives i.e. the Nomenclature for the Analysis and Comparison of Scientific Programmes and Budgets (NABS 2007 classification), this paper addresses the impact of the recent economic downturn on governments’ science and technology (S&T) budgets across the 27 EU countries. Most countries followed a pro-cyclical pattern, where the government S&T budgets in most NABS shrunk along slowing gross domestic product growth in similar pace with total government expenditure. The new member states of Eastern Europe were the most affected.
H69|Eurozone Public Debt Problem: An Analysis From The Perspective Of The Institutions And Policies|Based on a synthetic literature review, the present article summarizes the main characteristics of the Eurozone institutional setup and the related economic and political incentives that drive Eurozone governments to increase their public debts, disregarding the limits agreed in the European treatises. We propose a theoretical and qualitative approach, taking into account the general features and the nature of Eurozone institutional setup. The second and third part of the paper contains a review of the Eurozone institutional setup and its role in sovereign debt problem of Euro area while the fourth part of the paper carries out a concise analysis of some proposed strategies and policy tools to fight Eurozone debt problem: ECB bond buying, EFSF/ESM leverage, Eurobonds and Euro-TARP.
H69|Tales of three budgets: Changes in long-term fiscal projections through the GFC and beyond|This paper examines fiscal projections based on three consecutive budget forecasts (2009-2011) and provides cautionary insights as to how these projections only a year or two apart can lead to dramatic differences in projected debt levels in the future. Projections of net debt from a Budget 2011 forecast base are much lower, by 2050, than those for Budget 2009. This is largely due to the Budget 2011 forecast base having lower expenditure and higher revenue than the forecast base of the Budget 2009 projections. The paper also underscores how short-term policy changes, if sustained, can make a big difference over the long term and how, over time, the more fundamental structural factors such as demographics can prove to be more durable in influencing fiscal sustainability. Finally, it argues that, even though the level of debt-to-GDP shifts by mid-century, the messages we take from these projections remain the same: spending and possibly tax policies need to change, if we are to avoid passing debt that generates little social return onto our descendants, and early changes alleviate the need for more drastic revisions in the future.
H69|Governments and legislative production in France: the database (1959-2012)|This article introduces a new dataset focusing on the characteristics of the government members as well as on the legislative production in France, from the early months of the Vth Republic in January 1959 to the end of the XIIIth legislature in March 2012. It is composed of two distinct parts. The first part provides detailed characteristics of each government member, such as age, diploma and period in oÿce. The second part aggregates these characteristics at the government level and contains a large amount of variables covering several aspects of the legislative production, classified into three di?erent groups: political constraints, institutional variables and legislative production. Most of the variables are observed at a monthly rate.
H69|Estimating the structural budget balance of the Australian Government: An update|This Working Paper presents an overview of structural budget balance models and the adjustments most relevant for Australia. Three models (the OECD model, the IMF model and Treasury’s previously published model in the Australian Government’s 2009-10 Budget and McDonald et al (2010)) are discussed. Updated estimates of the Australian Government’s structural budget balance are presented alongside analysis showing the sensitivity of the results to plausible changes in key parameters. The updated structural budget balance estimates are based on the model used by McDonald et al (2010) and updated for the Australian Government’s 2013-14 Budget.
H69|Tax-Spend or Spend-Tax: An Ampirical Survey on Turkey|In general, governments attempt to prepare balanced budgets. But countries’ specific economic conditions often lead to politicians to prepare budgets with deficits. However, if the economic policies can not be sustained, economic crisis become unavoidable. There is a causal relationship between tax revenues and increase in public expenditures. This relation could take the form of tax-spend or spend-tax, or both instruments could be synchronized. This study examines Turkey’s budget in respect to taxation and public expenditures. Examination of data for 1924-2009 suggests that it is better first to collect tax revenues and then plan the public spending program.
H69|The Political Foundations of Economic Crises and the Economic Foundations of Political Crises; The Intermingling Relationship: Turkish Case 1950–2002|The political foundations of economic and financial crises have been examined solely vis-à-vis populist macroeconomic policies, but the political consequences of such economic crises have seldom been discussed in the literature. There have been ten notable political crises and six major economic crises in the last half-century of Turkish history. All political crises in Turkey involved a priori economic slowdown. Some of them even followed economic crises, especially sharp devaluations. Secondly, all political crises had social implications, as they all occurred as a result of severe welfare losses of the civilian and military bureaucracy due to inflation. Thirdly, the nature of political crises has recently changed, as they no longer involve overt military interventions. On the contrary, consecutive coups have enhanced the deepening of democracy, as there is a stronger embrace of civil democracy and hostility against the military intentions by the society. Our research demonstrates that all economic crises have occurred during populist right-wing governments and involved budget deficit problems, while only some of them also involved foreign debt crises. Naturally, all economic crises had political consequences. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2013
H69|A Review on the Assessment of Public Debt Sustainability|In light of the growing public debt, the issue of debt sustainability has increasingly attracted attention. At least half of the EU countries will have to implement stringent fiscal consolidation programmes over the next few years in order to prevent already high public-debt-to-GDP ratios from a further significant rise, also the case of Romania. However, drastic fiscal policy adjustment may be not feasible in the short term and hence public debt is likely to grow further.
H69|The Fiscal Union and the Eurozone Debt Problem|The present paper summarizes the main characteristics of the Eurozone institutional setup and the related economic and political incentives that drive Eurozone governments to increase their public debts, disregarding the limits agreed in the European treatises. The first part of the paper contains a review of the Eurozone institutional setup and of the incentives it creates for Eurozone member states to increase their deficits and public debts. The second part of the paper carries out a short review and criticism of the main strategies and policy tools to fight Eurozone debt problem: ECB bond buying, EFSF/ESM leverage, Eurobonds and Euro-TARP. The main conclusion of the paper is that establishing a fiscal union in EU does not solve by itself the public debt problem of Eurozone member states if the institutional mechanism of debt accumulation, debt rollover and risk socialization are not dismantled.
H69|The Implications of Public Indebtedness on Public Expenditures in Romania|In this article we analyze which are the mutations of public debt stock and public debt service on the structure of public expenditures. We use functional classification of public expenditures and observe their evolution by using multiple regression equation in order to emphasize the shifts of public expenditures as a response at public debt service and its stock variations along with other macroeconomic indicators which bear a significant influence on public expenditures dynamic.

Finally, some concluding remarks about the role manufacturing industry could play in the future are provided.
H69|Vietnam's SCIC: a gradualist approach to sovereign wealth funds| Vietnam's State Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC) was established in 2005, with the primary goal of helping the authorities to make, under market conditions, the most of state capital investments in business enterprises. To date, SCIC has had to grapple mainly with facilitating the ‘equitization’ (that is privatization) of large numbers of state-owned enterprises. As yet it is still too early to make a firm assessment of SCIC's performance with regard to either of the above objectives. Nevertheless, a discernable picture has begun to emerge, in which SCIC appears to have been a typical example of Vietnam's gradualist approach in transitioning to a more market-oriented economic system: the pace of change may have been slow and uneven, but there are clear indications of movements toward the end goal.
H69|Public Debt Sustainability Analysis: Eu Case|The global crisis has caused a serious fiscal deterioration that leaves the world economy with serious challenges. In many developed markets as well as in a few emerging markets (Emerging markets) public finances have already become, or are at least at risk of becoming, unsustainable. Commonly, public debt sustainability is defined as a sovereign's ability to service debt without large adjustments to public revenue and/or expenditure and without ever-increasing public-debt-to-GDP ratios. Hence, this definition refers to both a country\'s ability and willingness to repay its debt. We also have to add the fact that there isn`t an universal accepted definition of fiscal or debt sustainability. In light of the growing public debt, the issue of debt sustainability has increasingly attracted attention. In this paper we analyse public debt sustainability scenario in EU economies. At least half of the EU countries will have to implement stringent fiscal consolidation programmes over the next few years in order to prevent already high public-debt-to-GDP ratios from a further significant rise, also the case of Romania. However, drastic fiscal policy adjustment may be not feasible in the short term and hence public debt is likely to grow further. In some scenarios the public-debt-to-GDP ratio is predicted to soar to 133% in 2020, from just over 100% in 2010. By contrast, nearly all EM countries, including major economies, appear to be well positioned to stabilise or even outgrow their current debt ratios without drastic fiscal adjustment. Institutional improvements may help European countries to maintain fiscal credibility. In light of the future fiscal challenges, many European governments may introduce new or more effective national debt limits, similar to those put in place in the past with good results by some Emerging markets. Such institutional reforms could help to insulate fiscal policies from political pressure and to anchor financial market expectations.
H69|Pension Reform Options for Russia and Ukraine: A Critical Analysis of Available Options and Their Expected Outcomes|This paper provides the results of analyses of key problems related to pension systems and their reforms in Russia and Ukraine. The pension systems and their reforms in both countries are compared. They are also compared with the general picture observed in the OECD or selected countries belonging to that area. The analysis focuses on long-term trends rather than short-term shocks. The recent economic crisis is not covered since the analysis was mostly completed by 2008. First, we present the general picture which describes the current demographic and economic situations as well as the challenges that are being faced. Then we turn to reform options and actions already taken. We particularly focus on issues that are specific to the countries analyzed.
H69|Comportamiento Y Evolución Del Déficit Fiscal En Colombia Durante El Período 1990 - 2008|El presente artículo realiza una descripción del comportamiento y la evolución del déficit fiscal en Colombia desde el año 1990 hasta el año 2008, realizando un análisis del gasto público y los Ingresos en el mismo período, resaltando los cambios de carácter estructural que se dieron por las principales transformaciones institucionales a principios de la década de los noventa, como lo fueron la Constitución Política de 1991, la Autonomía otorgada al Banco de la República y la implementación de la Apertura Económica. Por consiguiente, el objetivo principal del trabajo es analizar las causas y consecuencias del déficit fiscal dentro de este período y su relación con la deuda colombiana tanto interna como externa.
H69|Fiscal policy consistency and implications for macroeconomic aggregates: the case of Uganda| The relationship between growth in monetary aggregates and price changes continues to be a subject of considerable debate both in the academic and policy circles. Whereas the more ‘conservative’ policy makers hold that growth in monetary aggregates bear proportionately on prices, ‘liberals’ on the other hand suggest a fairly weak relationship and instead mainly attribute sustained price changes to other innovations (including structural weaknesses and poor productive capacity). This study employed vector autoregression techniques (and its variants) to examine both short term as well as long term interactions between selected macroeconomic aggregates with particular focus on the relationship between money growth and price changes. Results from both the reduced form vector autoregression specification and the contemporaneous structural vector autoregression show a weak causation from growth in monetary aggregates to price changes, but the link between changes in monetary aggregates and prices becomes stronger in the long run. The results also point to a strong relationship between price changes on the one hand and exchange rate depreciation, and past inflation outcomes on the other. The results imply a potential for increased revenue from monetisation, at least up to some feasible as well as the need to focus on other possible sources of price variations. In general, whereas it is possible for the relationship between prices and money to weaken, budget deficits beyond ‘certain financeable limits’ will clearly negate the possibility of attaining other objectives of macroeconomic policy. A natural concern that arises in such a context is one of sustainability and compatibility of the budget deficit with other macroeconomic targets. We also employed the government budget accounting framework to analyse sustainability of Uganda’s current fiscal stance. The results show that the consolidated deficit is consistent with attainment of target outcomes for other macroeconomic variables, most notably the rates of inflation and GDP growth rates. The inflation target has however, been achieved at the cost of an unsustainable domestic debt. From a policy perspective, issuing domestic debt at such a high real interest rates will allow lower money growth but at the cost of future increases in debt service obligations and thus future budget deterioration.
H69|Pension Reform Options for Russia and Ukraine: A Critical Analysis of Available Options and Their Expected Outcomes (with a Focus on Labour Market, Industrial Restructuring and Public Finance)|"Russia and Ukraine are in the process of many changes stemming from economic transition, restructuring, demographic change and other various ongoing challenges. In terms of the ongoing challenges in each country, there are specific problems related to historical developments, such as large scale heavy industry, but also potential opportunities that rarely occur in other countries such as the significant additional income from the countries' abundant natural resources. Both countries have good prospects for the future despite the many challenges. Among the challenges is industrial restructuring taking into account the social dimension, which includes adjusting the current arrangements of pension systems. In the best scenario this could mean a pension reform. The term 'pension reform' can be understood in various ways. In this paper we analyse a wide variety of possible pension system designs. The designs vary by target as well as the various ways to reach those targets. In all cases there may be costs and/or savings problems (as well as liquidity problems, which are not a ""cost"" from the economic viewpoint as liquidity is accounted as if additional cost were created) and various positive and/or negative economic, financial, and social externalities associated with the pension system designs."
H69|Romanians’ Public Debts Saga|By the end of 2009, a very cold breath of austerity was blowing from the European financial and banking system and thoroughly was touching every Member State’s economy, but only for some of them perspective of this severe situation is called bankruptcy frequently. By the spring of this year (2010 – author’s note), Greece’s financial problems set all the Europeans governments on fire and, according on the most worrying news alerts, Germany was terribly angry and eager to treat this country as an undisciplined schoolchild. Many and heavy financial disasters are forecast for other countries as well, and it seems that Spain’s, Portugal’s or Italy’s Mediterranean structure and behaviour would be the reason, since these countries are in pretty identical trouble just like Greece. The ex-communist recently EU Member States, that are united into the so-called platoon of the emergent economies, rapidly detected their own vulnerabilities and their well-known resources leakages. Then, in the old-time verified and practiced tradition of “cuts and poverty under oppression” which communism taught them well, they were abruptly compelled to conform and to adopt dreadful austerity measures. Although among them, Romania is again a special case, taking into account but the heavy burden of the 80’s unbelievable sacrifices and privations, which the population endured because of the totalitarian decision of paying its whole debt. The paper reveals and analyses that, despite the actual context and the political circumstances which are totally different, Romania applied an unprecedentedly severe plan of cuts and privations, installing a general and bitter sensation of déjà-vu, instead of living and feeling the European membership status!

H69|EU Budget – An Economic Integration Support|It is very difficult to calculate net financial benefits that a state derives from its membership of the EU, because other important advantages related to the domestic market (economies of scale, increased competition), the development of external relations development funds, security and justice are not considered. It should also be taken into consideration the redistributive function of the Community budget, which is based on the principle of EU solidarity. International crisis cut Romania's high economic growth in recent years. It has highlighted major weaknesses of the local economy, which were reflected by large structural budget deficits (over 5% of GDP during 2006-2008) and external imbalances by two digits (remember that structural imbalance is obscured by an economic growth above potential, which brings only temporary additional budgetary receipts).
H69|Medellín: una evaluación del comportamiento de las finanzas públicas municipales, 2000-2006|"Resumen: desde el año 2000, el comportamiento de las finanzas públicas deMedellín ha venido mostrando una tendencia positiva escalando en la posición del ranking realizado por el Departamento Nacional de Planeación (DNP), lo que le ha permitido localizarse en el primer lugar dentro de las ciudades capitales del país en 2005 y 2006. El objetivo de este trabajo es evaluar las finanzas públicas del municipio de Medellín en el período 2000-2006, a través de la lectura de la información disponible y de la modelación econométrica de algunos componentes de la contabilidad financiera local. En tal sentido se encontró que el comportamiento financiero de Medellín presenta particularidades en relación con otros municipios y ciudades capitales del país en cuanto a la gran dependencia de los ingresos tributarios al PIB, a la no existencia de pereza fiscal con respecto a las transferencias nacionales y a la importancia de los ingresos no tributarios dentro de los ingresos totales. Finalmente, los ejercicios realizados dan cuenta de una regularidad empírica en el manejo de las finanzas públicas locales, la cual se ha denominado efecto relajación"", que manifiesta el tradeoff existente entre los ingresos tributarios y los no tributarios. El trabajo concluye que el municipio de Medellín debe procurar un mayor esfuerzo fiscal y limitar el gasto excesivo y la dependencia a las utilidades de empresas descentralizadas, en orden a obtener unas finanzas públicas realmente sanas"""
H69|An Evaluation on the Determinants of FinancialDevelopment: Literature Survey|In the economic development process, important role of financial sector has long been emphasized in the literature. Especially with the emergence of endogenous growth theory, this relationship has again become very attractive and it is stated that financial development is one of the determinants of economic growth. However this whole literature did not sufficiently explain how the financial development occurs. Financial liberalization hypothesis has been a starting point to explain the financial development. In addition, recently, it is seen that studies which examine the process of financial development has increasingly increased and, within this vein, it is emphasized that legal origin, liberalizations of foreign trade and capital account, institutional structure, deposit insurance, efficient supervision and regulation and policy framework for macro economy influence financial development
H69|EU: Can federalism become the chief integration theory?|Federation is one type of state characterised by a contractual and constitutional structure, multilevel power redistribution, a written constitution, and duality of power. Federalism is a philosophy and a political instrument enabling a federation to function. The principle of federalism is an aggregation of cultural, social, economic, linguistic, and intellectual disparities within a federation. Federalism can become a mainstream integration theory: the present MLG can be defined as an umbrella theory based on the federalist principles. The EU can be defined as a specific type of evolving, decentralised federation. Finally, fiscal federalism can provide EU policy with a significant instrument.
H69|One-off and off-budget items: An alternative approach|Fiscal analysis requires a set of indicators. For calculating the structural deficit, it is examined whether measures have permanent or temporary budgetary impacts, if any (creative accounting). For measuring fiscal impulse, it is examined when a given measure has a ‘true’ economic impact, if ever (creative accounting). For example, capital transfers to cover the losses of quasi-fiscal activities do not spread to the actual (‘true’) period of time by accrual recording. It is important to remove such illusory items from statistical expenditures and revenues, but in order to account for the ‘true’ effect, expenditures must be augmented, e.g. by quasi-fiscal losses and PPP investment. This type of analytical indicator has been employed by the central bank of Hungary for a decade. According to our experience, this ‘true’ measure is consistent in a macroeconomic sense and methodologically more robust than the statistical deficit, which often requires a subsequent upward revision. This kind of analytical methodology allows flexibility supported by expert judgement, and at the same time it requires transparency of methods and data.
H69|Fiscal transparency from central banks’ perspective: off-budget activities and government asset funds|This paper reviews how central banks in emerging market countries assess fiscal positions, and discusses two aspects of fiscal transparency that have recently gained importance from central banks’ perspective: off-budget activities and special fiscal funds. By increasing uncertainty about the true fiscal position of the government, these activities are of concern both to central banks that set monetary policy on their own, taking fiscal policy as given, and to those that have adopted an institutional framework for coordinating monetary and fiscal policies.
H69|Maastricht Antlaşması Yakınlaşma Kriterleri Çerçevesinde Bütçe Disiplini ve Türkiye ile İlgili Bir Karşılaştırma|It is known that Turkey has to achieve some financial conditions in addition to the conditions on political and economic area to be a full member to European Union (EU) for which Turkey has been trying for more than 40 years. The primary condition of fiscal policy is the budgetary discipline which was determined by the Maastricht Treaty. It needs some time to adopt the EU budget discipline that is based on to limit the public debt and budget deficit. On that point, Turkey is tried to be determined and be evaluated how much it achieves those conditions with compare to its current financial structure in terms of public debt, interest expenditure and budget deficit.
H69|The stability and growth pact : an eventful history|When it was adopted in 1997 the stability and growth pact was considered as one of the cornerstones of the European monetary union. However, against the background of the economic downturn starting at the turn of the century, this perception changed and some observers criticised the pact for unduly constraining governments’ fiscal room for manoeuvre. This sparked a long debate on the appropriateness of the fiscal rules in the monetary union that has finally ended in March 2005 when a political agreement was reached in the Council of the European Union that announces substantial changes to the pact. This article first recalls the reasons for fiscal rules, especially in a monetary union with a fragmented budgetary policy, and the main provisions of the original pact. It then shows that despite the strengthening of the fiscal rules nearly all EU-15 Member States have significantly relaxed budgetary discipline after 1997, i.e. the year in which compliance with the Maastricht convergence criteria was tested, which led to significant budgetary slippages in a number of countries. It is argued that this is due to specific institutional, political and statistical factors. Finally, the reform of the pact is assessed. Without prejudging the application of the new framework, the fiscal rules are found to be significantly weakened and there is a clear shift towards a more judgement-based institutional framework.
H69|Social security finances|One of the government’s main functions is to protect the population against a number of social risks. Hence, replacement incomes are provided in the event of unemployment, old age or occupational disability. Income supplements are granted to compensate in part for the financial burden associated with illness or with bringing up children. These social benefits are an important facet of the redistribution of income effected by the government. In Belgium, social protection is provided mainly by the social security sub-sector, which is the largest component of the general government sector. The level of government expenditure on social protection in Belgium is, expressed as a percentage of GDP, above the European Union average. This is due mainly to relatively higher expenditure on pensions and unemployment. The Belgian social security sector expanded strongly in the 1970s. In the ensuing period, total social security receipts and expenditure remained relatively stable on average; expressed as percentages of GDP, they stood in 2000 at roughly the same level as in 1980. During this period, however, there was a “stop and go” policy on expenditure and receipts : expansion periods were followed by periods in which a more restrictive policy was pursued. In recent years, social security has again been expanding, although only to a more limited extent. Over the years, the structure of social security spending has changed significantly : due to the strong rise in health care expenditure, this spending item has now become the most important component, just ahead of pensions. Since receipts and expenditure have hitherto moved very much in parallel, the financial balance of social security has always hovered around equilibrium. At present, the social security sector is not only free of any financial liabilities, it actually has substantial financial assets. Population ageing will clearly exert strong upward pressure on future expenditure on pensions and health care. This increase can be only partly offset by the predicted decline in unemployment expenditure and family allowances. Therefore, social security will have to face a major financial challenge in the (near) future.
H69|The Impact of Fiscal Restraint on Budgetary Allocations for Women's Programs|The paper reviews the gender-differentiated effect of macro-economic policies by examining the impact of persistent revenue shortfalls on the part of the national government in 1997-2003 on the budget allocations for programs that support gender equality and womens priority public services in selected departments -- Department of Health (DOH), Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), and Department of Education (DepEd). The analysis includes grouping the agencies programs, activities and projects (PAPs) into gender-relevant categories and tracking the impact of the overall contraction of national government expenditures on the expenditure obligations for these expenditure categories. At the same time, the study undertakes a gender disaggregated benefit incidence analysis of the mainstream or untargeted expenditures of the selected departments. Lastly, the study emphasizes that budget analysis has to be better informed by gender analysis given that, even if there is no gender bias in the formal policies and procedures that govern the delivery of services of various government agencies, gender bias might result from the informal rules, attitudes and behavior not only of service providers but also that of the target clientele.

H69|Federal Government Budget Deficits and the Crowding Out of Private Investment in the United states: Evidence for the 1990s|This study investigates whether federal government budget deficits in the U.S. over the 1990-99 time period acted to crowd out private investment in new plant and equipment. Using quarterly data, empirical estimations clearly indicate that private investment was in fact negatively impacted by the budget deficit.
H69|Structural Deficits in Czech Public Finances|The paper analyzes the fiscal position of Czech public budgets. It focuses on the structural and the cyclical parts of the budget deficits and concludes that public budgets were in structural deficit as early as 1994. The authors propose three methods toward estimating the potential output of the Czech economy and demonstrate how these estimates lead to different conclusions vis-a-vis fiscal policy. Their analysis shows that the Czech economy under-performs with respect to its perceived convergence with the European Union. The authors also adjust the official budget numbers for one-off privatization revenues. These revenues considered, public budgets appear significantly less balanced, and recent practice suggests a mounting budgetary dependence on privatization revenues.
H69|Fiscal crises and aggregate demand: can high public debt reverse the effects of fiscal policy?|This paper shows how the power of fiscal policy to affect consumption can vary depending on the level of public debt. At moderate levels of debt fiscal policy has the traditional Keynesian effects. Current generations of consumers discount future taxes because they may not be alive when taxes are raised (or there will be a larger population available to pay the taxes). But when debt reaches extreme values, current generations of consumers know there is a high probability that they will have to pay extra taxes. An increase in the fiscal deficit has a contractionary effect in these situations.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><sma<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

H69|Estimating the Payoff to Schooling Using the Vietnam-era Draft Lottery|"During the Vietnam draft priority for military service was randomly assigned to draft-age men in a series of lotteries. However, many men managed to avoid military service by enrolling in school and obtaining an educational deferment. This paper uses the draft lottery as a natural experiment to estimate the return to education and the veteran premium. Estimates are based on special extracts of the Current Population Survey that the Census Bureau assembled for 1979 and 1981-85. The results suggest that an extra year of schooling acquired in response to the lottery is associated with 6.6 percent higher weekly earnings. This figure is about 10 percent higher the OLS estimate of the return to education for this sample, which suggests there is little ability bias in conventional estimates of the return to education. Our findings are robust to a variety of ""alternative assumptions about the effect of veteran status on earnings."
H69|Crowding out, deficits, and interest rates: Reply|Spector and Van Cott argue that ‘... statistical significance of the relationship between interest rates and the deficit is irrelevant for the question of crowding out.’ This Reply in turn argues that studies of the impact of deficits upon interest rates may be very useful in determining whether (and perhaps how) crowding out occurs and that additional empirical analysis involving the interest sensitivity of commodity demand is necessary to then quantify the actual degree of crowding out.

H69|Federal deficits and the real rate of interest in the United States: A note|This brief Note provides strong empirical evidence that federal govern­ment deficits can indeed have a positive and significant impact upon short­ term interest rates; the findings in this paper thereby establish another mechanism for the transmission of crowding out. This study differs from most other studies in the adoption of two particular procedures. First, unlike most (although not all) other related studies, the rate of interest is expressed as a real rate; this is done in simple fashion by subtracting the inflation rate (of the GNP deflator) from the nominal rate of interest (taken to be the 3 month T-bill rate). Second, also unlike most (although not all) other related studies, the deficit is expressed in real terms and then divided by the real GNP level; expressing the deficit in this ratio form enables us to judge the deficit relative to the size of the economy which must finance it. No previous related study to date has adopted both of these procedures, and most studies of this topic have adopted neither procedure.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H69|Crowding Out: An Empirical Note: Reply|This study examines the existence of crowding-out in the United States by determining to what degree the proportion of GNP devoted to private investment in new capital was affected by the proportion of GNP devoted to aggregate federal government spending. The evidence here strongly supports the crowding-out thesis but indicates that there is only incomplete crowding out. This evidence of incomplete crowding out is at odds with the extreme monetarist position; the existence of a definite but only partial crowding-out effect, however is also at odds with the extreme Keynesian position.
H69|Deficit Spending, Expectations, and Fiscal Policy Effectiveness|This paper develops a formal theoretical model within which it investigates mathematically the policy implications of adverse business expectations involving deficit financing. It is found that hostility towards deficit financing will always diminish the effectiveness of fiscal policy and render the ultimate impact of fiscal policy indeterminate. Potentially, a fiscal policy aimed at expansion may lead to a perverse final effect: a decline in economic activity. The model constructed allows deficit financing to influence the money supply.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H69|Fisher Dynamics in Household Debt: The Case of the U.S. 1929-2011|We examine the importance of what we term ‘Fisher dynamics’- the mechanical e?ects of changes in interest rates, growth rates and in?ation rates on debt levels independent of borrowing -for the evolution of household debt in the U.S. over a long time horizon (1929- 2011). Adapting a standard decomposition of public debt to household sector debt, we show that these factors have been important in explaining rising debt levels, especially in the past thirty years. We identify and describe three broad regimes in the growth of household debt and several shorter episodes, distinguished by the distinct roles played Fisher dynamics and borrowing behavior in the evolution of household debt. We then provide some counterfactual trajectories of debt burdens that suggest how important ?nancial changes beginning around 1980 have been in contributing to household debt, independent of any changes in household behavior. Speci?cally, if average rates of growth, in?ation and interest remained the same after 1980 as before 1980, household debt burdens in 2011 would have been roughly the same as they were in the early 1950s, despite the sharp increase in borrowing in the early 2000s. We then discuss the di?culties involved in deleveraging. Under scenarios involving even substantial reductions in household expenditure, returning to debt levels of the 1980s could take decades. If lower private leverage is a condition of acceptable growth,then in the absence of a substantial fall in interest rates relative to growth rates, large-scale debt forgiveness of some form may be unavoidable.
H69|"Watering the Garden of Government Securities:Measuring the ""Bunching"" Effect in Euro Sovereign Bond Markets"| The adoption of a common currency raised the degree of substitution between financial instruments supplied by EU Member States to finance their national debts. In this framework, our paper looks at a particular determinant of liquidity-related spreads in euro-area government bonds. Simultaneous issuance of similar bonds floods the market with paper and could lead to higher funding costs for sovereign borrowers. We test the significance of this problem, over-supplying liquidity due to a bunching of contemporaneous issues, in a government bond market where borrowers do not coordinate their issuance plans. We find that there is a significant relationship between bunching in issues and higher yield spreads. Moreover, in line with the existing literature, we find a negative correlation between liquidity and bond yields.
