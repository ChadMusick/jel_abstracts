H73|Kant-Nash tax competition|In a two-country economy we analyze how tax competition differs from the standard all-Nashian tax competition, if one or both countries are Kantians in Roemer’s sense. Kantians are shown to choose a higher tax rate than Nashians for any given tax rate of the other country, which indicates that they seek to mitigate the (Nashian) race to the bottom. We avoid dealing with multiple equilibria by assuming that capital is sufficiently scarce, and we find for symmetric countries that the all-Kantian tax competition is efficient and that the inefficient race to the bottom is weakened in economies with a Nashian and a Kantian. That confirms the intuitive idea that countries following the Kantian categorical imperative avoid or at least soften the socially undesirable impact of (Nashian) self-interest. We also investigate the incentives of opportunistic countries to choose Nashian or Kantian behavior out of self-interest and find that either both governments choose to behave as Kantians or that - under different conditions - the robust Nashian selfinterest supersedes Kantian moral principles such that the inefficient all-Nashian tax competition results.
H73|Sales Taxation, Spatial Agglomeration, and the Internet|Technological innovations facilitating e-commerce have well-documented effects on consumer behavior and firm organization in the retail sector, but the effects of these new transaction technologies on fiscal systems remain unknown. By extending models of commodity tax competition to include urban spatial structure (agglomeration) and online commerce, one can analyze strategic tax-policy interactions among neighboring localities. Consumers buy different types of commodities, sold either by traditional or by online vendors. When the cost of online shopping falls, we show that equilibrium tax rates and revenues increase in small jurisdictions and decrease in large jurisdictions with retail shopping centers. Policy commentators warn that e-commerce erodes tax revenue - true enough for some localities - but, more accurately, changing transaction costs can generate entirely new commercial and fiscal equilibria that ultimately “redistribute” tax revenues from localities with concentrations of traditional vendors toward other, typically smaller, localities.
H73|A Fistful of Dollars? Foreign Sales Platforms and Profit Shifting in Tax Havens|Using public macro-level data on activities of multinationals, we document that U.S. firms geographically disconnect sales and production to avoid paying corporate taxes. We revisit both theoretically and empirically the location determinants of foreign platforms and show that market access motives are far less relevant when considering tax havens. We characterize these countries and shed light on the attractiveness of different tax havens for specific sectors of activity. Our quantification shows that profit shifting by foreign sales platforms in tax havens amounts to about $80bn in 2013. Our findings contribute to the recent policy debate on the reform of international taxation.
H73|Targeting FDI|We study the tax/subsidy competition between the governments of two countries to attract the FDI projects of two firms. We assume that governments lack the capacity to target every potential inward investor with a tailored fiscal offer. Consequently, each government is constrained to bid for a single firm. In this environment, we show that subsidy competition, where both governments bid for the same firm, arises only if there is uncertainty over which country offers the more profitable location for the firm's plant. Intuitively, such uncertainty leads to both governments believing that they might win the subsidy competition. In contrast, when the characteristics of the two countries are common knowledge, subsidy competition never arises in equilibrium, as the losing country would prefer to target the other firm. We also explore some of the welfare implications of governmental targeting constraints.
H73|Hump-shaped cross-price effects and the extensive margin in cross-border shopping|This paper examines the effect of cross-border shopping on grocery demand in Norway using monthly store*category sales data from Norway's largest grocery chain 2011-2016. The sensitivity of demand to foreign price is hump-shaped and greatest 30-60 minutes' driving distance from the closest foreign store. Combining continuous demand, fixed costs of cross-border shopping and linear transport costs `a la Hotelling we show how this hump-shape can arise through a combination of intensive and extensive margins of cross-border shopping. Our conclusions are further supported by novel survey evidence and cross-border traffic data.
H73|Capitalization as a Two-Part Tariff: The Role of Zoning|This paper shows that the capitalization of local amenities is effectively priced into land via a two-part pricing formula: a “ticket” price paid regardless of the amount of housing service consumed and a “slope” price paid per unit of services. We first show theoretically how tickets arise as an extensive margin price when there are binding constraints on the number of households admitted to a neighborhood. We use a large national dataset of housing transactions, property characteristics, and neighborhood attributes to measure the extent to which local amenities are capitalized in ticket prices vis-a-vis slopes. We find that in most U.S. cities, the majority of neighborhood variation in pricing occurs via tickets, although the importance of tickets rises sharply in the stringency of land development regulations, as predicted by theory. We discuss implications of two-part pricing for efficiency and equity in neighborhood sorting equilibria and for empirical estimates of willingness to pay for non marketed amenities, which generally assume proportional pricing only.
H73|How do judges judge? Evidence of local effect on French bankruptcy judgments|"Law and Economics literature recently gazed upon the ""failure of judges"" showing the various biases, psychological but also political, they can display. One of the seminal criticisms against bankruptcy judges focused on their attempt to go beyond the strict applications of law in their decisions. The main drawback is their lack of business-related expertise. The French bankruptcy system was created four centuries ago with this last problem in mind and remains unique today. The bankruptcy judges are elected among local businessmen and top executives. They rule without any professional judge along them, like in mixed courts in Belgium. They are given a key role in the decision as in the U.S.. This chapter shows how judges display a home bias when the area suffers from economic turmoil. They attempt to favor the reorganization of bankrupt firms when the local unemployment rate is high. The analysis is based on an original dataset of all filings for restructuring (Redressement Judiciaire) from 2006 to 2013. This is shown to hold robust despite several tests using survival analysis in a competing risk setting. This effect is found to reduce the time of negotiation between the firm and its creditors with no effect on the survival of the firm after the reorganization plan was agreed upon. We infer that judges cram-down decisions faster in these contexts and let creditors bear the costs of these reorganisations. It underlines how Courts wish to implement decisions that exceed solely debt-collection with a concern for the local area at the risk of hurting the firm's creditors.

H73|Kommunal medfinansiering og kampen for at forebygge indlæggelser: Viden om effekt / Municipal co-financing of regional health services and the fight to prevent hospital admissions: Knowledge about effects|Municipal co-payment is an arrangement where municipalities pay a variable amount to the regions whenever municipal citizens utilize regional health services, e.g. hospital services og GPs. The 5 Danish regions provide somatic and mental health services while municipalities mainly provide home nursing, home help, health visitors, rehabilitation, and child and youth dental services. Municipalities cannot employ physicians who actively treat patients. Municipal co-payment was introduced in 2007 in connection with the structural reform of municipalities and counties. The main idea was that economic incentives in the form of potential savings on co-payment would lead municipalities to look for alternatives to (some) regional health services. The municipalities have developed, among other things, acute beds (usually in conjunction with nursing homes) staffed by experienced home nurses that GPs can refer patients to instead of hospitalizing them, acute nursing teams that provide services in the homes of citizens, follow-home-service where home nurses follow discharged hospital patients to their homes (occasionally together with a GP) and evaluate care needs – in the hope of avoiding rehospitalizations. To the extent that these arrangements have been evaluated they are discussed in this paper. None have shown clear-cut indications of preventing or postponing hospitalizations. The paper services two aims: A literature review of above reports and an econometric analysis of panel data for 2007-2016/17. The econometric analysis did not show any significant effects on hospital admissions.
H73|2019/01 Merging city and suburban governments: A public choice perspective on the Norwegian local government reform|The administrative boundaries of the central city almost universally cover a smaller area than its functional boundaries. As mobility patterns go mainly into the central city, local governments in central cities supply public goods beyond their own residents. They should want to extend their boundaries in order to internalize more of these externalities, while suburban municipalities should oppose this. This implication is clear from a theoretical perspective, but can rarely be tested given that local government reform is infrequent and typically top-down. However, the 2014-2017 Norwegian municipal reform offers a rare opportunity for empirical evidence to test this proposition. The paper examines the merger decisions made by municipalities in all city regions in Norway. The analysis provides support for the proposition that central cities want to internalize more of the externalities from their public goods production, while suburban municipalities oppose this: First, central cities tend to have higher property tax rates and to provide more public goods compared to suburban municipalities. Second, central cities were much more interested in merging than suburban municipalities: while the central cities wanted to merge with a total of 75 suburban municipalities, only 15 of the latter were positive to merging with the central city.
H73|Effetti finanziari delle richieste di autonomia regionale: prime simulazioni|Il 15 febbraio 2019 sono state rese disponibili le bozze di intesa tra il Governo e le Regioni Emilia- Romagna, Veneto e Lombardia, in seguito alla pressante richiesta di maggiore autonomia da parte di queste tre regioni. Basandoci su questi testi e sulla spesa statale regionalizzata, ricostruiamo i flussi di risorse necessari a soddisfare le richieste di decentramento delle funzioni. E’ possibile individuare uno schema di compartecipazioni che finanzino le spese devolute. Nell’ipotesi in cui non siano approvati i fabbisogni standard entro tre anni dall’emanazione dei decreti che avviano le autonomie regionali simuliamo, come previsto nelle intese, l’adozione della spesa media nazionale pro capite per tutte le regioni. Ciò implica un trasferimento di risorse da alcune regioni con spesa pro-capite superiore alla spesa media nazionale ad altre regioni con spesa pro-capite inferiore alla spesa media nazionale. Esaminiamo anche il caso in cui l’istruzione non venga riconosciuta tra le materie devolute. In entrambi i casi le regioni che chiedono autonomia riceverebbero risorse aggiuntive. Nel caso in cui tutte le funzioni di spesa siano considerate ad Emilia Romagna, Veneto Lombardia spetterebbero 2,7 miliardi in più rispetto alla spesa storica, il 17% in più. Nel caso in cui l’istruzione venga esclusa dalla funzioni di spesa devolute vi sarebbe un incremento di risorse di 1,3 miliardi, 21% in più. Infine ipotizzando una crescita dei gettiti asimmetrica tra Nord e Sud Italia, che riprende la previsione di crescita dei consumi per il 2019 di Prometeia, otteniamo un incremento di gettito nelle tre regioni che chiedono l’autonomia pari al 45% dell’incremento di gettito totale.
H73|Policy in the Pipeline: Identifying Regional Public Investment Priorities Using a Natural Experiment|We identify regional public investment priorities by studying the development of the water pipe system in the largest district in Poland. For this purpose, we take advantage of a major administrative re-form, implemented on 1 January 1999, which substantially changed the structure of Polish local government and reduced the number of top-tier administrative regions from 49 to 16. We treat the reform as a natural experiment, and apply the difference-in-differences approach to study developments along the boundary of the new Mazovian voivodeship. We find strong and positive implications for the development of the water pipe system in municipalities within the Mazovian voivodeship compared with those just outside its boundaries. The overall post-reform difference in the length of the total water pipe network is 25% and the difference in the per-capita length of the network is 30%. Local public investment priorities at the voivodeship level, potentially related to effective use of EU funds, are the most likely determinants of these differences.

H73|The Political Economy of Immigration Enforcement: Conflict and Cooperation under Federalism|We study how the shared responsibilities over immigration enforcement by local and federal levels in the US shape immigration enforcement outcomes, using detailed data on the Secure Communities program (2008-2014). Tracking the movement of arrested unlawfully present immigrants along the several steps of the immigration enforcement pipeline, and exploiting a large shift in federal enforcement priorities in mid 2011, we disentangle the three key components of the variation in deportation rates: federal enforcement efforts, local enforcement efforts, and the composition of the pool of arrestees. This decomposition allows us to recover the local (county) level response to changes in federal enforcement intensity. Among urban counties, 80 percent, mostly Democratic but with small shares of Hispanics, exhibit strategic substitutabilities. The inverse relationship between federal and local efforts allowed most counties to reduce opposition to the policy, and was accompanied by an increased alignment of local and federal preferences. The federal level was very effective in directing its enforcement efforts towards counties where it expected local collaboration, but conflict was mostly driven by a change in the types of unlawfully present immigrants it prioritized for removal.
H73|Tax Revenue Efficiency of Indian States: The case of Stamp Duty and Registration Fees|The Federal structure of India divided taxation powers between Union government and state government on certain principles. But, due to the goods and service tax (GST) implementation, states have lost jurisdiction over many taxes, since many state taxes were subsumed into GST. The extent of revenue losses to states due to subsuming certain taxes is not clear. On the other hand, the revenue situation of the states has not improved sufficiently. Despite of states tax efforts, improvement in own tax revenues are marginal. Under this back ground, states need to focus on the other existing taxes to improve its own tax revenues. The major revenue yielding taxes to states in the post GST regime are excise tax and stamp duty and registration fees. This study attempts to measure tax capacity and tax effort of stamp duty and registration fee for 16 major Indian states from 2001 to 2014 using stochastic frontier analysis. It is found that Bihar is operating at high efficient levels with efficiency and Odisha and Jharkhand are operating with low efficiency. State government's needs to focus on the relevant stamp duty policy changes and potential determinants of the model, which will help them improve their efficiency. The gap between predicted tax revenue and frontier tax revenue is more the case of Gujrat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and West Bengal.
H73|Nash equilibrium in tax and public investment competition|We analyze Nash equilibrium in fiscal competition with tax and public investment between symmetric regions. We show that given the opposite strategic nature of tax (strategic complement) and public investment (strategic substitute), there is possibility of multiple equilibria. We find that if strategic substitute effect dominates strategic complement effect, then both regions have first mover advantage in a timing game and simultaneous move Nash equilibrium (early, early) emerges; otherwise sequential move equilibria-(early, late) and (late, early) emerges. Also, sequential move Nash equilibria are Pareto improving than simultaneous move outcome. Lastly, race-to-the-bottom in taxes is restricted in sequential move equilibria.

H73|City Size, Pollution and Emission Policies|This paper develops a micro-founded city systems model with an endogenous number of cities to explore whether local governments establish the optimal city size when production processes involve environmental pollution. Our analysis delivers two key insights. First, if an optimal scheme to regulate environmental pollution is implemented, cities chosen by local governments are never too large. They are too small if pollution is purely global, but at the optimal size, if pollution is purely local. Second, if no emission scheme is implemented or if emission policies are too lax, then cities steered by local governments, become too large, however.
H73|Women legislators and economic performance|There has been a phenomenal global increase in the proportion of women in politics in the last 20 years. While there is evidence that raising the share of women politicians has substantive impacts on the composition of government spending, there is scarcely any evidence of how it influences economic performance.We investigate this using comprehensive data on competitive elections to Indiaâ€™s state legislative assemblies, exploiting close elections between men and women to isolate the causal effect of legislator gender in a regression discontinuity design. We identify significantly higher growth in economic activity in constituencies that elect women. Probing mechanisms, we find evidence that women legislators are less likely to be criminal and corrupt, more efficacious, and less vulnerable to political opportunism.We find no evidence of negative spillovers to neighbouring (male-led) constituencies, consistent with net growth.
H73|Fiscal competition and public debt|This paper explores the implications of high indebtedness for strategic tax setting when capital markets are integrated. When public borrowing is constrained due to sovereign default or by a binding fiscal rule, a rise in a country's initial debt level lowers investment in public infrastructure and makes tax setting more aggressive in that jurisdiction, while the opposite occurs elsewhere. On net a jurisdiction with higher initial debt becomes a less attractive location. Our analysis is inspired by fiscal responses in severely hit countries after the economic and financial crisis which are consistent with the theoretical predictions. We find a similar pattern on the sub-national level using administrative data from the universe of German municipalities.
H73|Tax Competition - An intertemporal perspective|The paper focuses on intertemporal tax competition between jurisdictions that differ in size. Given that the existing literature is mainly based on static models, it is in- teresting to investigate which new insights tax competition in an intertemporal setting may provide. In this respect, how does the fact that agents anticipate possible future changes, once they moved capital abroad, modify their behavior and the tax policy of the competing jurisdictions? Does tax competition become more intense? Are capital outflows and tax losses incurred by high tax jurisdictions exacerbated ? To answer these questions, we assume that a small and a large country compete for internationally mobile capital within a two-period model. We demonstrate that tax competition is less fierce in an intertemporal setting relative to a static one. It also appears that the tax loss of the large country induced by tax competition is higher relative to a static model. This means that tax competition becomes more deleterious for the country that suffers from capital outflows.
H73|Decentralisation in a Globalised World: Consequences and Opportunities|Globalisation accompanied by the growing importance of information technology and knowledge-based production pose challenging problems for federations. We summarise the difficulties that traditional decentralised federations face in addressing problems of competitiveness, innovation and inequality brought on by globalisation. Adapting to these challenges involves rethinking the roles of various levels of government and rebalancing them appropriately. On the one hand, responding to inequality enhances the policy role of the federal government. On the other hand, state and local governments must respond to the imperative of providing education and business services to equip citizens and firms to compete in the knowledge economy. Perhaps most important, large urban governments are best placed to provide the physical and social capital to support innovation hubs. A key challenge for fiscal federalism is to facilitate the decentralisation of responsibilities to urban governments. This entails new thinking about revenue decentralisation, policy harmonisation and the structure of intergovernmental transfers so that cities can implement their policies effectively and accountably.
H73|On the political economy of state corporate tax reforms in the U.S|This paper discusses the political economy of U.S. state corporate tax reforms. Using a unique dataset of state effective corporate tax rates over the period 1969-2015, I observe that business tax changes are associated with tax competition, swings in economic cycles, and left-right political ideology. In contrast, long-term debt and budgetary pressures do not correlate with state corporate tax policies. Moreover, I document a regional heterogeneity and notice a slowdown in state tax changes after the Federal Reform Act of 1986. These findings matter for the empirics of corporate tax incidence, which is increasingly concerned with the endogeneity between tax reforms and other economic developments.
H73|Patent boxes design, patents location, and local R&D|Maria Skonieczna, and Antonio Vezzani?>Patent boxes have been heavily debated for their role in corporate tax competition. This paper uses firm-level data for the period 2000–12 for the top 2,000 corporate research and development investors worldwide to consider the determinants of patent registration across a large sample of countries. Importantly, we disentangle the effects of corporate income taxation from the tax advantage of patent boxes and exploit a new and original dataset on patent box features such as the conditionality on performing research in the country or their coverage. We find that patent boxes have a considerable effect on attracting patents, mostly because of their favourable tax treatment. Patents with high earnings potential are particularly sensitive. Patent boxes with a large coverage also have stronger effects on the location of patents. We also analyse the impact of patent boxes and their tax advantages on local R&D activities and find that R&D development conditions tend to attenuate the dominant fiscal effect of patent boxes.
H73|Women Legislators and Economic Performance|There has been a phenomenal global increase in the proportion of women in politics in the last two decades, but there is no evidence of how this influences economic performance. We investigate this using data on competitive elections to India's state assemblies, leveraging close elections to isolate causal effects. We find significantly higher growth in economic activity in constituencies that elect women and no evidence of negative spillovers to neighbouring male-led constituencies, consistent with net growth. Probing mechanisms, we find that women legislators are less likely to be criminal and corrupt, more efficacious, and less vulnerable to political opportunism.
H73|Relocation of the Rich: Migration in Response to Top Tax Rate Changes from Spanish Reforms|A Spanish reform granted regions the authority to set income tax rates, resulting in substantial tax differentials. Using administrative data, we find that conditional on moving, taxes have a significant effect on location choice. A 1% increase in the net-of-tax rate for a region relative to others increases the probability of moving to that region by 1.7 percentage points. We estimate an elasticity of the number of top taxpayers with respect to net-of-tax rates of 0.85. The mechanical increase in tax revenue due to higher tax rates is larger than the loss in tax revenue from the net outflow of migration.
H73|Spatial effects on local government efficiency|Little attention has been paid to the spatial pattern in local governments' efficiency. This paper intends to fill this gap by conducting an empirical analysis on a sample of 246 Italian municipalities over the decade 1998-2008. The efficiency of the municipal government is measured in terms of the speed of payments for different categories of public spending. Estimation results reveal the presence of spatial interdependence in the speed of payments among the geographically close municipalities, with a greater magnitude for the speed of current outlays. Thus, municipalities mimic the speed with which public spending is carried out by their neighbors.
H73|Culture and Colonial Legacy: Evidence from Public Goods Games|We conduct a public goods game in three small towns in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Due to historical military conquest, until 1947 these towns were on (barely) opposite sides of a colonial border separating British India from the Princely States. Our research design offers a treatment comparison between the towns of (British) Kekri and (Princely) Sarwar, and a control comparison between (Princely) Sarwar and (Princely) Shahpura. We find no significant difference in contributions to home town groups, but a significant difference in contributions to mixed town groups. Participants in (British) Kekri are more co-operative (i.e., contribute more) in mixed town groups compared to those in (Princely) Sarwar. We find the differences are driven by individuals with family ties to the towns, and we find no differences in the control comparison. Our results highlight the enduring effects of colonial rule on social norms of co-operation
H73|Corruption in Russia - Historic Legacy and Systemic Nature|This paper argues that corruption in Russia is systemic in nature. Low wage levels of public officials provide strong incentives to engage in corruption. As corruption is illegal, corrupt officials can be exposed any time, which enforces loyalty towards the powers that be; thus corruption is a method of governance. We trace the systemic corruption back to the Mongolian empire and demonstrate its persistence to the current regime. We show the geographic distribution of contemporary corruption within Russia, survey the literature on the causes, consequences, and cures of corruption in Russia, and discuss entry points to fighting it.
H73|Fiscal Federalism and Economic Performance - New Evidence from Switzerland|The link between federalism and economic performance is still ambiguous. Aiming at clarification, we improve on a widespread shortcoming by measuring federalism not just by one variable but by various institutions that constitute it. To this end, Switzerland provides for a laboratory as its 26 cantons share a common framework, while the extent of federalism varies between the cantons and across time. By exploiting this setting, the paper provides evidence for the expected heterogeneity: The impact of federalism on economic performance differs conditional on the federal instrument considered. Overall, instruments of competitive federalism appear to improve economic performance of the cantons, while adverse effects are reported for cooperative elements.
H73|How Will Brexit Affect Tax Competition and Tax Harmonization? The Role of Discriminatory Taxation|This paper develops a model of tax competition with three countries that initially form a union where countries refrain from using different tax rates in different sectors of the economy. We study the impact of one country leaving the union. We show that the introduction of discriminatory taxation in one country increases tax policy heterogeneity within the remaining union. Moreover, the incentives for the two remaining countries to harmonize their tax rates decline. We discuss these results in the context of the debate on the tax policy implications of Brexit.
H73|Culture and Colonial Legacy: Evidence from Public Goods Games|We conduct a public goods game in three small towns in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Due to historical military conquest, until 1947 these towns were on opposite sides of a colonial border separating British India from the Princely States. Our research design offers a treatment comparison between the towns of (British) Kekri and (Princely) Sarwar, and a control comparison between Princely Sarwar and Shahpura. We find that participants from (British) Kekri are more co-operative in mixed-town groups. The differences are driven by individuals with family ties to the towns, highlighting the enduring effects of colonial rule on co-operation norms.
H73|Net Direct Taxes and Double Taxation Avoidance|Double taxation can only arise in the case of direct taxes: taxes on income and wealth taxes, and adversely affect the international capital movement, the exchange of persons, goods, capital services and impedes the development of economic relations between countries. Given that the double taxation is a global problem that increases the fiscal pressure and diminishes the investment attractiveness, and it becomes necessary to improve the domestic tax system, we intend to analyze the imposition of revenues, by emphasizing the necessity, the measures and the methods undertaken to eliminate the double taxation. To this end, the analysis between two countries: of Romania and France has been carried out and we find that the application of the methods of avoiding double international taxation has contrary effects on the state of residence compared to the consequences of the company in question because the tax relief is advantageous for the company but constitutes a disadvantage for the granting State; but it is fundamental to choose a method because the amount of tax revenue, is maximum in the absence of a tax convention between the two signatory states. By international agreement, taxpayers are guaranteed that their income will not be subject to double taxation and are protected against fiscal discrimination in the Contracting State in which they operate.
H73|When does money stick in education? Evidence from a kinked grant rule| We study the effects of intergovernmental grants on school spending within the Finnish system of high school education funding. The system allocates lump-sum intergovernmental grants to local education organizers using a kinked grant rule. Utilizing the quasi-experimental variation in grants given by the rule, we identify the effects of grants on municipal high school education expenditures. Our results indicate that grants stimulate spending while local tax rates or revenues do not seem to be responsive to grants, thus suggesting the presence of a typical flypaper effect. However, we also consider the possibility that grant responses might be heterogeneous among municipalities. Based on our heterogeneity results, the grant response is positively associated with the share of high school age population, while the higher share of elderly is related to a lower propensity to spend on education out of grant funding. This result is in line with the idea of intergenerational conflict in education spending preferences often presented in education finance literature.
H73|“Love thy neighbour”? The effect of income and language differences on votes for municipal secessions|This paper studies voters’ preferences on municipal borders in a setting with cohabiting linguistic communities. It takes advantage of unique data from referendum results in the Canadian province of Quebec in 2004, which allow a direct investigation of voter preferences. I find that differences in income and language affect the likelihood of secession. Notably, I also find that these effects are interdependent, suggesting that the support for a local secession is affected to some degree by out-group aversion. Finally, I find that voters are willing to pay additional taxes to live in their jurisdiction of choice.
H73|Spatial renewable resource extraction under possible regime shift|How will countries harvesting mobile natural resources react to the threat of regime shift? We address the non-cooperative exploitation of a migratory renewable resource in the presence of possible regime shift that a_ects its movement. Motivated by the anticipated effects of climate change, we model a regime shift that will alter the spatial movement patterns of the resource at some point in the future. We develop a stochastic spatial bioeconomic model to address the effects of this class of regime shift on non-cooperative harvest decisions made by decentralized owners such as countries exploiting a migratory fish or other natural resource stock. We find that the threat of a future shift modifies the standard golden rule and may induce more aggressive harvest everywhere, irrespective of whether the owner will be advantaged or disadvantaged by the shift. We also identify conditions under which the threat of regime shift induces owners to reduce harvest rates in advance of the shift. Our analysis suggests that different property rights structures (single ownership vs common property) or heterogeneous growth can give rise to previously unexplored incentives and can even reverse conventional wisdom about how countries will react to the prospect of future environmental change
H73|Effects of Pay-For-Performance on Prescription of Hypertension Drugs among Public and Private Primary Care Providers in Sweden|This study exploits policy reforms in Swedish primary care to examine the effect of pay-for-performance (P4P) on compliance with hypertension drug guidelines among public and private health care providers. Providers in regions with P4P are compared to providers in other regions in a difference-in-differences analysis using data from the Swedish Prescription Register for the period 2005-2013. The results indicate that P4P improved guideline compliance regarding prescription of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB). The effect is mainly driven by private providers, suggesting that policy makers should take ownership into account when designing incentives for health care providers.
H73|Hump-shaped cross-price effects and the extensive margin in cross-border shopping|This paper examines the effect of cross-border shopping on grocery demand in Norway using monthly store×category sales data from Norway’s largest grocery chain 2011-2016. The sensitivity of demand to foreign price is hump-shaped and greatest 30-60 minutes’ driving distance from the closest foreign store. Combining continuous demand, fixed costs of cross-border shopping and linear transport costs `a la Hotelling we show how this hump-shape can arise through a combination of intensive and extensive margins of cross-border shopping. Our conclusions are further supported by novel survey evidence and cross-border traffic data.
H73|Political institutions and federalism: a “strong” decentralization theorem|In this article, we investigate how differences in the political institutions necessary for implementing decentralization reform may affect the efficiency and welfare properties of decentralization itself. We incorporate insights from political science and economics into a rigorous and formal extension of the influential “decentralization theorem” first developed by Oates in 1972. In our analysis, we go beyond Oates by producing a strong decentralization theorem that identifies the political conditions under which democratic decentralization dominates centralization even in the presence of interjurisdictional spillovers. More specifically, we find that beneficial outcomes for public service delivery will obtain when democratic decentralization (i.e. the creation of popularly elected sub-national governments) is combined with party centralization (i.e. the power of national party leaders to nominate candidates for sub-national office). We also find that the participation rules of primaries, whether closed or open, have important implications for the expected gains from decentralization. Most notably, we find that, when primaries are closed, even Oates’ conventional decentralization theorem does not hold. In summary, our theory shows that political institutions matter considerably in determining the welfare gains of decentralization outcomes.
H73|The Territorial Fiscal Gap in Colombia|This paper presents an estimation of expenditure needs and fiscal capacity of Colombia’s municipalities and departments in 2014. We use standard per capita norms to estimate the spending needs and data envelopment analysis for the local fiscal capacity. The results show that: (i) there are high horizontal fiscal disparities in Colombia, with greater incidence in municipalities than in departments; (ii) these disparities favor more developed territories; and (iii) there is evidence of a centerperiphery pattern in the horizontal fiscal disparities, causing central regions of the country to have a lower imbalance between expenditure needs and fiscal capacity. An equalization transfers system is an option for public policy to eliminate these disparities.
H73|Tax revenue losses through cross-border loss offset: An insurmountable hurdle for formula apportionment?|This paper analyzes the relevance of firm losses for tax revenues and welfare when switching from separate accounting to a system of tax base consolidation with formula apportionment. We find that a system change unambiguously decreases tax revenues in the short run, in which neither firms nor governments can adjust their behavior, due to the cross-border loss offset inherent in formula apportionment. In the medium run, in which only firms can adjust their strategies, tax revenues are still lower under formula apportionment if the probability of incurring losses or the costs of profit shifting are sufficiently small. However, in the long run, where firms and governments can adjust their behavior, a switch from separate accounting to formula apportionment is beneficial under the aforementioned conditions. Furthermore, we show that a higher weight on input shares in the apportionment formula may mitigate tax competition and thus increase tax revenues because, contrary to output factors, input factors provide a backstop against a shortfall of tax revenues due to loss-making subsidiaries.
H73|More Gas, Less Coal, and Less CO2? Unilateral CO2 Reduction Policy with More than One Carbon Energy Source|Natural gas is hoped to effectively help shale gas producing regions meet their carbon emission reduction commitments. We examine an open economy that produces both gas and another, more carbon intensive fuel like coal. In presence of two carbon energy sources, the analysis sharply contrasts with the standard single-energy case in which leakage is less than 100%: We show that, in general, an economy that relies on domestic gas to meet its emission commitment may contribute to increase global emissions. Indeed, gas production releases coal that is exported instead of being consumed domestically, potentially increasing emissions in the rest of the world. In this new context, we establish testable conditions as to whether a governmental emission reduction commitment warrants the domestic exploitation of shale gas, and whether this unilateral strategy increases global emissions. We also characterize the extent to which this unilateral strategy makes the rest of the world’s emission commitment more difficult to meet. Finally, we show how our results apply to the case of the US.
H73|Tax Havens, Accounting Experts, and Fee-Setting Rules|Tax havens differ in the specific tax planning arrangements multinational firms can use to reduce their tax liabilities. Given the complexity and cost associated with identifying the most effective tax haven to use, an accounting firm can act as an intermediary between tax havens and multinational corporations. We analyze a model with horizontally differentiated multinationals and tax havens to study the role accounting firm intermediation has on tax haven prices, multinational tax planning choices, accounting firm profits, and tax revenues. In equilibrium, uniform accounting firm fees generate higher accounting firm profit, less tax avoidance, and higher tax revenues than either full price discrimination or haven-specific fees.
H73|Essays on the Behavior of Firms and Politicians|Die vorliegende Dissertation besteht aus sechs eigenständigen Kapiteln, die vom Verhalten von Firmen und Politikern im weiteren Sinne handeln. Nach einer Einführung in die Thematik wird im ersten Teil der Dissertation ausgeführt, wie institutionelle und politische Rahmenbedingungen das Verhalten von Firmen beeinflussen. In Kapitel 2 werden die Einflussgrößen von Schenkungen von Betriebsvermögen in deutschen Familienunternehmen untersucht. Umfrageergebnisse zeigen, dass bei größeren Unternehmen und bei Unternehmen mit guter Geschäftslage die Schenkungswahrscheinlichkeit stieg. In Kapitel 3 wird untersucht, wie politische Unsicherheit Investitionsentscheidungen von Unternehmen beeinflusst, wofür Daten über realisierte Investitionsquoten, Investitionspläne und -revisionen verwendet werden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die realisierten Investitionsquoten in den Jahren, in denen Landtagswahlen stattfanden im Durchschnitt niedriger waren als in Jahren, in denen keine Landtagswahlen stattfanden. Unternehmen schienen jedoch schon bei der Investitionsplanung die Wahlunsicherheit zu antizipieren, denn sie revidierten ihre Pläne kaum. In Kapitel 4 wird untersucht, ob politische Unsicherheit beeinflusst, wie Unternehmer ihre aktuelle Geschäftslage und zukünftige Geschäftsentwicklung wahrnehmen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Unternehmer erwarteten, dass ihr Geschäft sich besser vor Landtagswahlen und schlechter nach Landtagswahlen entwickeln wird. Der zweite Teil dieser Dissertation untersucht, wie ideologische Orientierung und Eigeninteresse von Politikern ihr Ethos und Verhalten prägen. Kapitel 5 beschreibt, wie ideologische Orientierung Einstellungen und Handlungen von Politikern in Deutschland prägt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Worte und Taten deutscher Landespolitiker und -regierungen in Bezug auf Haushaltskonsolidierung und Schuldenbremsen voneinander abgewichen haben. In Kapitel 6 wird untersucht, ob Parteien Politiker, die in namentlichen Abstimmungen von der Parteilinie abweichen, bestrafen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen nicht, dass Parteien das Abstimmungsverhalten beachteten und Politiker bestraften, die gegen die Parteienlinie gestimmt haben. In Kapitel 7 wird untersucht, inwiefern unterschiedliche ideologische Orientierungen der deutschen Wirtschaftsforschungsinstitute die Politikberatung in der Gemeinschaftsdiagnose beeinflusst haben.
H73|Handelseffekte von Grenzkontrollen|Eine neue empirische Untersuchung des ifo Instituts zeigt, dass selbst bei einem vollständigen Zusammenbruch des Schengen-Raums das BIP in Deutschland lediglich zwischen 4 und 11 Mrd. Euro pro Jahr sinken würde; die weitaus realistischere Wiedereinführung von Kontrollen an den Flüchtlingsrouten würde zu Effekten zwischen 1 und 3 Mrd. Euro führen. Für Österreich liegen die Verluste bei 80 bis 210 Mio. Euro. Diese Kosten machen jedoch nur einen Bruchteil jener Belastungen aus, die durch fortgeführte ungeregelte Massenzuwanderung entstehen würden.
H73|Handelseffekte von Grenzkontrollen|Das am 26. März 1995 in Kraft gesetzte Schengener Abkommen hat einen Europäischen Binnenraum der Personenfreizügigkeit geschaffen und damit ein beispielloses kontinentales Integrationsziel erreicht. Die Bedrohung durch globalen Terrorismus sowie ein starker Anstieg der Flüchtlingszahlen in Europa seit Sommer 2015 haben eine Grundsatzdebatte darüber hervorgerufen, inwieweit offene Binnengrenzen politisch und ökonomisch haltbar sind. Diese Studie adressiert drei Fragestellungen: Wie stark wird die Reisezeit durch Grenzkontrollen beeinträchtigt? Beeinflusst die Abschaffung der Grenzkontrollen durch das Schengener Abkommen den grenzüberschreitenden Handel in Waren und Dienstleistungen? Welche Wohlfahrtseffekte sind aufgrund einer Veränderung internationaler Handelsvolumina in Folge einer Wiedereinführung von Grenzkontrollen im Schengen-Raum zu erwarten? Die Studie findet, dass die Überwindung von Ländergrenzen innerhalb des Schengen-Raumes um etwa 20 Minuten schneller gelingt als zwischen zwei Ländern, von denen mindestens eines nicht dem Schengen-Raum angehört. Eine Wiedereinführung der Grenzkontrollen im Schengen-Raum würde die bilateralen Warenexporte je Grenzübertritt um 2,7% reduzieren; entspricht einem Zolläquivalent von 0,54%. Die bilateralen Dienstleistungsexporte je Grenzübertritt würden um 4,2% reduziert; entspricht einem Zolläquivalent von 0,82%. Die deutschen BIP Einbußen durch einen vollständigen Zusammenbruch des Schengen-Raumes lägen zwischen 4 und 11 Mrd. Euro pro Jahr. Die weitaus realistischere Wiedereinführung von Kontrollen an den Flüchtlingsrouten würde für Deutschland zu BIP Effekten zwischen -1 und -3 Mrd. Euro jährlich führen. Ähnliche Analysen wurden für Bayern, Österreich und die Europäische Union durchgeführt.

H73|The National and Regional Consequences of Australia's Goods and Services Tax|The major political parties support the tenet of the original GST agreement that GST change requires unanimous state approval. However, GST change could differentially affect state economies, and thus influence support from individual states. We investigate the potential for GST change to differentially affect state economies. We do this by developing a multi‐regional model of the Australian economy that contains details of the legislated features of the GST. In this model, when we change any element of the GST, the economic effects are informed by regional differences in economic structure and their interactions with the details of our GST theory.
H73|The effect of a local allowance on the endogenous formation of jurisdictions|This paper analyses the effect of allowances, whose amount depends on jurisdictions, on the segregative properties of endogenous formation of jurisdictions. Households choosing to live at the same place form a jurisdiction whose aim is to produce a local public good and to implement a redistribution policy, by granting every household an allowance whose amount is determined by the jurisdiction. In every jurisdiction, the production of the local public services and the allowance are financed with a local tax based upon the householdsâ€™ wealth. Local wealth tax rates and the level of the allowance are exogenously determined in every jurisdiction. Households are free to leave their jurisdiction for another jurisdiction that would provide them with their highest utility. We find that the existence of an allowance mitigates the segregative properties of endogenous jurisdiction formation, as the condition identified by Gravel and Thoron to ensure the segregation of any stable jurisdiction structure remains necessary, but is no longer sufficient.
H73|Are local agreements on equalization grants possible? A bargaining model with quasi-linear local preferences on local public goods|The art. 13 of the Italian law n. 42/2009 theoretically allows for local negotiations between municipalities on the allocation of equalization funds. However, in the subsequent practice and legislation, such form of local negotiation has never been adopted.
H73|Unauthorized immigration and fiscal competition|Reflecting upon recent enforcement policy activism of US states and countries within the EU towards unauthorized workers, we examine the overlap of centralized (federal) and decentralized (state or regional) enforcement of immigration policies in a spatial context. Among other results, we find that if interstate mobility is costless, internal enforcement is overprovided, and border enforcement and local goods are underprovided when regions take more responsibility in deciding policies. This leads to higher levels of unauthorized immigration under decentralization. Interregional migration costs moderate such over/underprovision. Moreover, income distributive motives in the host country may shape the design of immigration policies in specific ways. The basic model is extended in several ways. First, we study how the policies change when regions can exclude unauthorized immigrants from the consuming of regionally provided goods or services. Second, we assume that the potential number of unauthorized immigrants is endogenous. And finally, we examine the effect of considering an alternative spatial configuration that includes border and “interior” regions.
H73|Taxing income in the oil and gas sector — Challenges of international and domestic profit shifting|This paper provides specific estimates on the scale of profit shifting among hydrocarbon MNEs. We estimate a semi-elasticity of reported Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) to sector specific income taxation of −1.68. Observed effects are larger when using Profit and Loss before Taxes, allowing for debt shifting. We find no profit-shifting among entities that are majority-owned by a national government. We also observe a higher vulnerability of non-OECD economies in our sample, which consists of 294 domestic and multinational parents and subsidiaries during the period from 2004 to 2012. To assess the importance of domestic profit-shifting channels, we take advantage of domestic tax differentials among hydrocarbon producers facing additional rent taxes and find that domestic profit shifting accounts for about one third of total income concealed.
H73|Errores fiscales en el ámbito federal|Este trabajo documenta dos errores conceptuales presentes en la reforma a la Ley de Coordinación Fiscal que entró en vigor en 2008. Los errores de diseño afectaron tanto al antiguo Fondo de Aportaciones para la Educación Básica y Normal como al Fondo General de Participaciones.
H73|Hacia una nueva Ley de Coordinación Fiscal|Este trabajo reseña y complementa las críticas a la actual Ley de Coordinación Fiscal hechas con anterioridad, además de proponer un nuevo mecanismo de distribución de las participaciones federales; esto último con la esperanza de ayudar a guiar las reformas venideras que se hagan a la actual Ley.
H73|A Situational Theory of Pork-Barrel Politics: The Shifting Logic of Discretionary Allocations in India|Despite the extensive literature on distributive politics, we still lack a theory of how political and fiscal institutions interact to shape the pork-barrelling ability of national leaders in a federal parliamentary democracy. Focusing on party system attributes and governmental incentives attached to different types of discretionary grants, this article examines the extent to which a shift in the priorities and interests of the prime minister's party - effected by the change from a dominant-party system to a multiparty-coalition system - is responsible for the change in the dynamics of distributive policies. I use a rich panel dataset on Indian states to propose a situational theory of distributive politics which states that incentives for exclusive targeting of affiliated states in dominant-party systems drive national ruling parties towards particularism, while the shrinking opportunity to indulge in such a policy in multiparty-coalition systems creates a universalisation effect. Additionally, the disaggregated analysis of discretionary grants brings to the fore the fact that the shift from particularism to universalism occurs for schematic grants, which provide an opportunity for credit-claiming. The ad hoc grants, which are like side payments, remain subject to particularism.
H73|Endogenous sanctioning institutions and migration patterns: Experimental evidence|We experimentally analyze the effect of the endogenous choice of sanctioning institutions on cooperation and migration patterns. Subjects are assigned to one of two groups, are endowed with group-specific preferences, and play a public goods game. We compare an environment in which subjects can move between groups and vote on whether to implement sanctions, to one in which only one group is exogenously endowed with sanctions. We find that the possibility of voting leads to a more efficient partition of subjects across groups, higher payoffs, lower inequality, and lower migration rates. Over time, subjects tend to vote for institutions.
H73|Why Haven’t Regional Wages Converged?|Regional wage convergence has long been predicted across the United States as barriers to factor mobility have fallen, yet there is little evidence (apart from a brief period in the 1970s and 1980s) that convergence has actually occurred. Why not? I reexamine this issue by developing a model in which fiscal policy differences across states endogenously impact labor supply across jurisdictions. I find that states whose safety nets are relatively generous will tend to drive out workers, raising wages for those who remain while also prompting net outmigration to less generous states. This suggests that regional wage convergence requires not only free factor mobility but also the coordination of fiscal policy across jurisdictions.
H73|Is the Rent Too High? Aggregate Implications of Local Land-Use Regulation|Highly productive U.S. cities are characterized by high housing prices, low housing stock growth, and restrictive land-use regulations (e.g., San Francisco). While new residents would benefit from housing stock growth in cities with highly productive firms, existing residents justify strict local land-use regulations on the grounds of congestion and other costs of further development. This paper assesses the welfare implications of these local regulations for income, congestion, and urban sprawl within a general-equilibrium model with endogenous regulation. In the model, households choose from locations that vary exogenously by productivity and endogenously according to local externalities of congestion and sharing. Existing residents address these externalities by voting for regulations that limit local housing density. In equilibrium, these regulations bind and house prices compensate for differences across locations. Relative to the planner's optimum, the decentralized model generates spatial misallocation whereby high-productivity locations are settled at too-low densities. The model admits a straightforward calibration based on observed population density, expenditure shares on consumption and local services, and local incomes. Welfare and output would be 1.4% and 2.1% higher, respectively, under the planner’s allocation. Abolishing zoning regulations entirely would increase GDP by 6%, but lower welfare by 5.9% because of greater congestion.
H73|Not in My Backyard? Not So Fast. The Effect of Marijuana Legalization on Neighborhood Crime|This paper studies the effects of marijuana legalization on neighborhood crime using unique geospatial data from Denver, Colorado. We construct a highly local panel data set that includes changes in the location of marijuana dispensaries and changes in neighborhood crime. To account for endogenous retail dispensary locations, we use a novel identification strategy that exploits exogenous changes in demand across different locations. The change in geographic demand arises from the increased importance of access to external markets caused by a change in state and local policy. The results imply that retail dispensaries lead to reduced crime in the neighborhoods where they are located. Reductions in crime are highly localized, with no evidence of benefits for adjacent neighborhoods. The spatial extent of these effects are consistent with a policing or security response, and analysis of detailed crime categories provides indirect evidence that the reduction in crime arises from a disruption of illicit markets.
H73|Anti-Crime Laws and Retail Prices|The fear of becoming a victim of crime acts as a barrier to retail trade for consumers, where retailers attempt to reduce such barriers by enduring additional costs such as insurance or security/surveillance; as a result, retail prices are affected by the possibility of crime. This paper attempts to measure such effects by considering the recent experience of Sacramento County in California, where an anti-panhandling ordinance has been issued to protect retailers. As an application, a difference-in-difference approach is employed to identify the effects of the ordinance on Sacramento gasoline prices at the retail level, by considering the gasoline prices in neighboring counties as the control group of a natural experiment. The results show that the anti-panhandling ordinance has resulted in lower gasoline prices in Sacramento County.
H73|Asymmetric incidence of sales taxes: A short-run investigation of gasoline prices|This paper investigates the shifting of sales taxes to consumers through retail prices in the short run. Retail data on gasoline prices are used at the station level within the U.S., including observations from all fifty states and the District of Columbia. A difference-in-differences approach is employed to identify the short-run effects of the changes in state taxes as of January 1st, 2015, when five states have increased their gasoline sales taxes, while five other states have decreased theirs. States experiencing such changes in sales taxes (between December 31st, 2014 and January 1st, 2015) are analyzed as the treatment group of a natural policy experiment, where the control group consists of states with no changes in their sales taxes. The results show that both sales-tax increases and decreases are under-shifted to consumer prices, although the under-shifting of sales-tax decreases is much higher (i.e., the asymmetric incidence of sales taxes). The pass-through measures also differ significantly across states, showing the importance of having a nationwide analysis. The results are robust to the consideration of retailer characteristics, wholesale prices, retail brand effects and hourly price changes within each day.
H73|More Gas, Less Coal, and Less CO2? Unilateral CO2 Reduction Policy with More than One Carbon Energy Source|We examine an open economy’s strategy to reduce its carbon emissions by replacing its consumption of coal—very carbon intensive—with gas—less so. Unlike the standard analysis of carbon leakage, unilateral carbon-reduction policies with more than one carbon energy source may turn counter-productive, ultimately increasing world emissions. Thus, we establish testable conditions as to whether a governmental emission-reduction commitment warrants the exploitation of gas, and whether such a strategy increases global emissions. We also characterize the extent to which this unilateral policy makes the rest of the world’s emission commitments more difficult to meet. Finally, we apply our results to the case of the US.
H73|Which Antidumping Cases Reach the WTO?|This article examines the distribution of antidumping (AD) disputes across countries and industries, and examines which AD cases reach the dispute settlement system of the WTO. Our general finding is that neither the country nor the industry distribution of AD cases remains constant across the different levels of disputes, as cases proceed from notifications to requests for consultations and third party adjudication at the WTO. The US is the main user of AD measures, as well as the main target for complaints at the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body. However, emerging markets have increasingly started using AD law to protect their domestic firms. We find that the typical AD notification is submitted by an upper middle-income country, and it focuses on a medium low-technology industry with differentiated products, but low relationship-specificity. The most typical complainant at the WTO is also an upper middle-income country, challenging a high-income country (most likely the US) that is allegedly giving unfair protection to an industry producing differentiated goods that are not very relationship-specific, using medium-low technologies. The analysis also reveals that when lower middle-income countries are challenged at the WTO, disputes are often resolved before third party adjudication is needed.
H73|Infant Mortality and the Repeal of Federal Prohibition|Exploiting new data on county-level variation in alcohol prohibition from 1933 to 1939, we investigate whether the repeal of federal prohibition increased infant mortality, both in counties that repealed and in their neighboring counties. Using a binomial fixed-effects model, we find that repeal is associated with a 4.0% increase in infant mortality rates in counties that chose wet status via local option elections or state-wide legislation and with a 4.7% increase in neighboring dry counties, suggesting a role for cross-border policy externalities. Cumulatively, these estimates imply 26,960 infant deaths that could potentially be attributed to the repeal of federal prohibition.
H73|Towards a European R&D incentive? An assessment of R&D provisions under a common corporate tax base| A recent proposal for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) across the European Union (EU) includes provisions in support of business R&D investment. This paper presents the rationale for the inclusion of R&D provisions, quantifies the subsidy implied by alternative options using the user's cost approach and approximates aggregate impacts by means of simple extrapolations from elasticities found in literature. We find that the provisions for immediate expensing of R&D included in the 2011 proposal would be less generous than what national schemes currently offer. We present alternative allowances that would serve to either maintain present levels or increase business R&D expenditure and we cost them in terms of foregone CIT revenue. In view of the pressing current need for a boost in business investment and the EU's R&D investment targets for the year 2020, we argue that the level of support should be ambitious. Importantly, to take full advantage of the opportunities afforded by this tax reform, EU member states will have to engage in complementary interventions in their national innovation systems. We conclude with a broad consideration of what these may be for the varied and variably developed business innovation capabilities found across the EU.
H73|Taxation, social protection, and governance decentralization|Governments do not have perfect information regarding constituent priorities and needs. This lack of knowledge opens the door for groups to lobby in order to affect the governmentâ€™s taxation levels. We examine the political economy of decentralized revenue-raising authority in light of social protection expenditures by constructing a theoretical model of hierarchical contests and comparing the implications of centralized with decentralized governance. Increasing information available to the government may generate additional expenditures by interest groups trying to affect government taxation decisions. We show the potential existence of a poverty trap as a result of decentralization in taxation decisions.
H73|Information sharing, neighborhood demarcation, and yardstick competition: an empirical analysis of intergovernmental expenditure interaction in Japan|Abstract The Japanese government provides information on local fiscal performance through the Fiscal Index Tables for Similar Municipalities (FITS-M). The FITS-M categorize municipalities into groups of “similar localities” and provide them with the fiscal indices of their group members, enabling municipalities to use the tables to identify their “neighbors” (i.e., those in the same FITS-M group) and refer to their fiscal information as a “yardstick” for fiscal planning. We take advantage of this system to estimate municipal spending function. In particular, we examine whether the FITS-M help identify a defensible spatial weights matrix that properly describes municipal spending interactions. Our analysis shows that they do. In particular, geographical proximity is significant only between a pair of municipalities within a given FITS-M group, and it does not affect competition between pairs belonging to different groups even if they are located close to each other. This would suggest that the FITS-M work as intended, indicating that spending interaction among Japanese municipalities originates from yardstick competition and not from other types of fiscal competition.
H73|Financing Central Cities: The Economics Underlying Fiscal Strategy Options With Special Reference to Syracuse City and the Consensus Report|A consortium of Syracuse City and Onondaga County governments along with a number of local area non-profit organizations have recently organized a commission on Local Government Modernization for the Syracuse area. The Report makes three major recommendation to strengthen the local public sector in the Syracuse region: seek opportunities to share public services across local jurisdictions to reduce costs, adopt the Minneapolis region model for sharing revenues from new commercial and industrial development across localities, and work toward merging Syracuse City government with Onondaga County government. At the same time, current non-city residents would not have responsibility for the city or school district’s legacy debts or post-employment benefit obligations. The working paper reviews the urban economics and local public finance literature in the context of fiscal viability of central cities. Central cities form the heart of knowledge-based economies and those benefits redound to the entire region in the form of higher property values and incomes. In addition, suburban enclaves have developed in part through discriminatory policies and practices at the federal and local levels and they have weakened the fiscal viabilities of central cities. It also reviews the relevant local public finance literature on city annexation and government mergers, optimally sized jurisdictions, non-profit entities’ payments in lieu of taxes in cities, efficient local government taxes, and related topics. Based on the review, the economic development of a region depends on the economic and fiscal sustainability of its central city. Suburban resident benefit in tangible ways from the economic activities in their respective cities and suburban areas could reasonably devote a portion of their tax base to enhance the resources available to the city to service the city’s legacy debts and other obligations. The working paper concludes with fiscal implications for Syracuse City and its metropolitan area.
H73|Infant Mortality and the Repeal of Federal Prohibition|Exploiting a newly constructed dataset on county-level variation in prohibition status from 1933 to 1939, this paper asks two questions: what were the effects of the repeal of federal prohibition on infant mortality? And were there any significant externalities from the individual policy choices of counties and states on their neighbors? We find that dry counties with at least one wet neighbor saw baseline infant mortality increase by roughly 3% while wet counties themselves saw baseline infant mortality increase by roughly 2%. Cumulating across the six years from 1934 to 1939, our results indicate an excess of 13,665 infant deaths that could be attributable to the repeal of federal prohibition in 1933.
H73|What Makes Cities More Productive? Agglomeration Economies and the Role of Urban Governance: Evidence from 5 OECD Countries|This paper estimates agglomeration benefits across five OECD countries, and represents the first empirical analysis that combines evidence on agglomeration benefits and the productivity impact of metropolitan governance structures, while taking into account the potential sorting of individuals across cities. The comparability of results in a multi-country setting is supported through the use of a new internationally-harmonised definition of cities based on economic linkages rather than administrative boundaries. In line with the literature, the analysis confirms that city productivity increases with city size but finds that cities with fragmented governance structures tend to have lower levels of productivity. This effect is mitigated by the existence of a metropolitan governance body.

H73|Regulatory Competition In Capital Standards with Selection Effects among Banks|Several countries have recently introduced national capital standards exceeding the internationally coordinated Basel III rules, which is inconsistent with the \'race to the bottom\' in capital standards found in the literature. We study regulatory competition when banks are heterogeneous and give loans to firms that produce output in an integrated market. In this setting capital requirements change the pool quality of banks in each country and inflict negative externalities on neighboring jurisdictions by shifting risks to foreign taxpayers and by reducing total credit supply and output. Non-cooperatively set capital standards are higher than coordinated ones and a \'race to the top\' occurs when governments care equally about bank profits, taxpayers, and consumers.
H73|Tax Competition with Heterogeneous Capital Mobility|An ongoing debate in the tax competition literature is whether a system of countries or regions should restrict the preferential tax treatment of different types of firms or capital. We further investigate this issue by departing from the bulk of the literature in three ways: (1) rather than maximize only tax revenue, governments also put positive weight on the income generated by resident-owned firms; (2) under preferential taxation, firms are distinguished by their country of origin; and (3) the competing regions are allowed to differ in size. Under the assumption of uniformly-distributed moving costs, identical regions always prefer the non-preferential regime. But when a small and large region compete, the small region prefers the preferential regime in some cases. We also identify non-uniform distributions of moving costs where the preferential regime is preferred by identical competing regions. This finding is related to differences in tax-base elasticities.
H73|Tax attractiveness and the location of German-controlled subsidiaries|Abstract This paper analyzes whether taxation has an influence on the location decisions of multinational enterprises. We employ a novel set of 22 tax variables, such as the taxation of dividends and capital gains, withholding taxes, the existence of a group taxation regime, and thin capitalization rules. Furthermore, we use the Tax Attractiveness Index, a new aggregate measure containing the 22 tax variables. Our count data regression analysis is based on a novel hand-collected dataset consisting of the subsidiaries of German DAX30 companies in 97 countries. Controlling for non-tax effects, we find that a country’s tax environment has a significantly positive effect on the number of German-controlled subsidiaries and, therefore, on the location decisions of German multinational enterprises. Specifically, our analysis reveals that German multinational firms place affiliates in countries that offer favorable statutory tax rates, withholding taxes, double tax treaty networks, and holding incentives. Additionally, we find that the Tax Attractiveness Index has explanatory power in subsidiary location decisions and, therefore, it can be used as alternative composite measure, for example, when 22 single tax variables are not at disposal.
H73|Endogenizing government’s objectives in tax competition with capital ownership|Abstract In this study, we extend the standard approach of horizontal tax competition by endogenizing the policy objectives that governments pursue. Following the literature on strategic delegation games, we consider a pre-play stage, where jurisdictions commit themselves to act as Leviathan or as benevolent agents. We show that the symmetric sub-game perfect equilibria correspond to three cases of tax competition among the Leviathan governments, moderate Leviathans, and benevolent governments, depending on the form of capital ownership. Further analysis reveals that asymmetric tax competition generates competition between the benevolent government and the (moderate) Leviathan government. The results provide grounds for benevolent or Leviathan objectives and explain why some governments act as one, while others aim toward a different objective.
H73|La politica di coesione della UE in Provincia di Ferrara 2007-2013|Nel presente Quaderno si cerca di far luce sul contenuto e soprattutto sulla effettiva consistenza della politica di coesione economica, sociale e territoriale dellâ€™Unione europea in provincia di Ferrara, mediante lâ€™analisi dei risultati finanziari che sono stati conseguiti per il periodo 2007-2013 fino alla fine del 2016. Tale analisi viene condotta in termini comparati al fine di verificare in quale posizione si colloca la provincia di Ferrara rispetto alle altre dellâ€™Emilia-Romagna, tra cui il capoluogo regionale.
H73|Depressing dependence? Transfers and economic growth in the German states, 1975–2005| Depressing dependence? Transfers and economic growth in the German states, 1975–2005. Regional Studies. Most countries pay substantial intergovernmental transfers to poor regions with the aim of achieving regional convergence. Consequently, transfers should have a positive effect on economic growth. However, it is equally possible that transfers perpetuate underdevelopment. This paper studies empirically the effect of intergovernmental transfers on economic growth with a panel of West German states over the period 1975–2005. The findings suggest that transfers do not foster economic growth, presumably because the recipients use them to subsidize declining industries.
H73|Formula apportionment: Factor allocation and tax avoidance|This paper addresses the question of how firms react to tax incentives in a formula apportionment (FA) tax regime. Under FA, the profits of all consolidated entities of a business group are summed and then allocated according to a formula based on FA factors. We hypothesize that firms may change the allocation of real production factors and/or manipulate the FA factor through tax avoidance strategies. Analysing FA tax effects of the German local business tax with payroll expense as the exclusive FA factor, we find empirical evidence consistent with both hypotheses. Regarding the allocation of production factors, we observe significant tax effects on labour input at the intensive margin but not on labour input at the extensive margin. In addition, we find evidence of an indirect FA spillover effect on capital investment. Our findings on tax avoidance proxies are consistent with tax-induced manipulations of payroll expense as an FA factor to save tax payments.

H73|Federalism and Foreign Direct Investment: How Political Affiliation Determines the Spatial Distribution of FDI – Evidence from India|This paper links the foreign economic engagement of India's states with the literature on federalism, thereby contributing to an understanding of the political economy of FDI inflows in a parliamentary federal system. More specifically, it studies subnational governments' international engagements to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and investigates whether the political affiliations of states' chief ministers and parliamentarians determine the spatial distribution of FDI across the Indian states, correcting for the influence of per capita income, population density, urbanisation, infrastructure, policy regime, and human development. Although the central government plays no direct role in determining the state to which FDI goes, the centre-state relations in a federal structure play a role in creating perceptions about the relative political risk involved in different investment destinations. Employing multiple linear regressions to analyse time-series (2000-2013) cross-sectional (12 states) data using the panel procedure, the study finds that affiliated states attract relatively more FDI per capita in comparison to states ruled by opposition parties or coalition partners. However, some exceptions do result, primarily due to two phenomena: first, the presence of a strong state leadership and, second, the presence of a significant share of members of parliament belonging to the prime minister's party in the non-affiliated states. Further, states ruled by outside supporters have been most successful in attracting FDI inflows during the coalition period.
H73|International taxation and M&A prices|We show that corporate taxation systems regarding foreign dividends and capital gains across 49 countries differ in many aspects, contradicting the requirements for capital ownership neutrality and indicating that ownership patterns are distorted. Consequently, a national tax policy maker may ask which taxation system improves the position of its multinational entreprises in bidding for foreign targets. To address this question, we develop a theoretical model on the impact of foreign dividends and capital gains taxation on cross-border M&A prices from the acquirer's perspective and theoretically compare different taxation systems. In a next step, we empirically validate our model in a regression analysis on a large cross-border M&A data set. Based on this analysis, we find that foreign dividends taxation rather than capital gains taxation impacts M&A prices. Finally, we provide tax policy suggestions.
H73|Impact of controlled foreign corporation rules on post-acquisition investment and profit shifting in targets|We investigate real investment, financial revenues and profits in formerly domestic firms once they enter a multinational entity (MNE) through an acquisition. We argue that following the acquisition, those targets are tax-optimized in a profit shifting context if they are acquired by MNEs with no controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules in their headquarters' countries. In this case, we hypothesize that MNE-wide profit shifting opportunities decrease high-tax targets' cost of capital, which may have a positive effect on real investment of these targets. In addition, we hypothesize that financial revenues respectively profits of low-tax targets increase after the acquisition, since they may become destinations of profit shifting themselves. In line with the effects on real investment, profits of high-tax targets should decline. We find evidence for the effects on real investment. Further, these effects can no longer be observed in case of existing CFC rules in the acquirer's headquarters' country. This finding may suggest that CFC rules effectively mitigate MNE-wide profit shifting which in turn has detrimental investment effects. We also find some evidence for the expected effects for financial revenues but not for the profit measure.
H73|Amalgamation, free-rider behavior, and regulation|Abstract Amalgamation incentivizes municipalities to increase public debt because it allows them to subrogate their repayment and interest burden on the entire municipality after amalgamation. Smaller municipalities, in particular, tend to accumulate public debt in order to free-ride. Previous studies have shown this kind of opportunistic behavior in countries where municipalities can issue bonds freely in the market. However, in Japan, municipalities cannot issue bonds freely by regulation. When such regulation controls debt accumulation by the merging municipality, the free-rider effect should be weak. This study examines the relationship between the regulation of local government borrowing and free-rider behavior of Japanese municipalities. The difference-in-difference regression results confirm the existence of a free-rider effect in this regard. Moreover, the debt expenditure ratio, the index of the regulation of local public bond issues, has the same effect that prevents local public debt from increasing for both merging and never-merged municipalities. This fact shows that a merging municipality with a free-rider incentive cannot increase local public debt to excess by using the regulation. Therefore, the average free-rider effect per capita is approximately 7 % of the average local public debt per capita for the end of the pre-treatment period. This result is considerably lower than the effects of the Swedish cases.
H73|Regulatory Competition in Capital Standards with Selection Effects among Banks|Several countries have recently introduced national capital standards exceeding the internationally coordinated Basel III rules, thus suggesting a ‘race to the top’ in capital standards. We study regulatory competition when banks are heterogeneous and give loans to firms that produce output in an integrated market. In this setting capital requirements change the pool quality of banks in each country and inflict negative externalities on neighboring jurisdictions by shifting risks to foreign taxpayers and by reducing total credit supply and output. Non-cooperatively set capital standards are higher than coordinated ones when governments care equally about bank profits, taxpayers, and consumers.
H73|Optimal Policies against Profit Shifting: The Role of Controlled-Foreign-Company Rules|By introducing controlled-foreign-company (CFC) rules, the parent country of a multinational firm reserves the right to tax the income of the firm’s foreign affiliates if the tax rate in the affiliate’s host country is below a specified threshold. We identify the conditions under which binding CFC rules are part of the optimal tax mix when governments can set the statutory tax rate, a thin capitalization rule and the CFC rule. We also analyze the effects of economic and financial integration on the optimal policy mix. Our results correspond to the actual development of anti-avoidance rules in OECD countries.
H73|Multinational banks: Supranational resolution regimes and the importance of capital regulation|The lack of coordination in the resolution of multinational banks has led to demands for the increased centralization of resolution regimes. However, as this paper argues, the anticipation of resolution procedures affects the incentives of host countries to impose capital standards on their resident banks. Critically, it is shown that overall welfare can even be decreased by introducing a centralized resolution regime without fully centralizing capital requirements. As, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, only countries that are not part of a supranational resolution regime unilaterally and significantly increased the capital requirements for their largest resident banks, this paper can help to understand and study the heterogeneity of the observed regulatory approaches.
H73|Fiscal Decentralisation, the Knowledge Economy and School Teachers’ Wages in Urban China| We examine how fiscal decentralisation and progress towards the development of a knowledge-intensive economy has affected teachers’ wages in China, utilising panel data from 2001 to 2013. We find that fiscal decentralisation has a negative impact on teachers’ wages and that this effect is magnified through a deepening of the knowledge economy, while the knowledge economy itself has no effect on teachers’ wages. The findings suggest that incentives being offered to local administrators need to be revisited if China is convinced of the need to increase teacher quality in ways suited to the knowledge economy which it wishes to construct.
H73|Unobserved Heterogeneity and Bias in Tests of the Leviathan Hypothesis|This paper highlights a potential source of bias in empirical tests that attempt to link the level of fiscal centralization to the total amount of public spending in a given jurisdiction. This paper is the first to propose biased estimation as a possible explanation for the mixed results in this line of literature and is also the first to test for this bias by controlling for both time-variant and time-invariant population heterogeneity. We begin by establishing a link between government centralization and the level of heterogeneity of preferences among constituents. We then combine this link with results from recent studies that link heterogeneity to lower levels of public provision, which highlights the source of our proposed bias. Our model uses ethnic fractionalization as well as income inequality as measures of time-variant heterogeneity of preferences. We find that the omission of time-invariant heterogeneity has an impact on the estimated relationship between centralization and public spending. Depending on the specification, the resulting bias can be severe enough to change the estimated direction of the relationship between centralization and spending.
H73|School Finance Reform and the Distribution of Student Achievement|"We study the impact of post-1990 school finance reforms, during the so-called ""adequacy"" era, on absolute and relative spending and achievement in low-income school districts. Using an event study research design that exploits the apparent randomness of reform timing, we show that reforms lead to sharp, immediate, and sustained increases in spending in low-income school districts. Using representative samples from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, we find that reforms cause increases in the achievement of students in these districts, phasing in gradually over the years following the reform. The implied effect of school resources on educational achievement is large."
H73|The optimal distribution of population across cities|The received economic wisdom is that cities are too big and that public policy should limit their sizes. This wisdom assumes, unrealistically, that city sites are homogeneous, migration is unfettered, land is given freely to incoming migrants, and federal taxes are neutral. Should those assumptions not hold, large cities may be inefficiently small. We prove this claim in a system of cities with heterogeneous sites and either free mobility or local governments, where agglomeration economies, congestion, federal taxation, and land ownership create wedges. A quantitative version of our model suggests that cities may well be too numerous and underpopulated for a wide range of plausible parameter values. The welfare costs of free migration equilibria appear small, whereas they seem substantialwhen local governments control city size.
H73|Governance Performance of Indian States 2001-02 and 2011-12|There is a core concept of good governance, the combination of authority and responsibility to pursue the common good that goes back over millennia in different geographies around the world. Based on a contemporary interpretation of this concept, the paper develops a measure of the quality of governance as service delivery. This measure is applied to rate and rank the governance performance of major states in India in 2001-02 and 2011-12. The governance measure has been derived from the three main pillars of the government, i.e., the legislature, the judiciary and, especially, the executive. These pillars are represented by five dimensions: infrastructure services; social services; fiscal performance; justice, law order; and quality of the legislature. Performance on each dimension of governance has been measured using indicators that are based exclusively on official factual data, not perceptions or opinions drawn from unrepresentative samples. The results show considerable stability of the cluster of high performing and low performing governments at the top and the bottom of governance rankings over the period analysed, though there are also some interesting dynamics of change. The paper also presents a second set of results that correct for the strong correlation between governance quality and the level of development. When we correct for the effect of development on the quality of governance, it turns out that some of the poorer states significantly improve their rank, implying their governance performance is much better than would be expected at their level of development.
H73|Oklahoma Oil and Gas Severance Taxes: A Comparative Analysis|Oklahoma assesses a production tax of seven percent on the extraction of oil, natural gas, and other minerals. However, since July 2002, it has taxed production from horizontal wells at only one percent for the first 48 months of production. This is a significant tax incentive relative to its neighboring states, Texas and Kansas, particularly considering the limited evidence as to the effectiveness of severance tax incentives for increasing in-state development of immobile resources. This paper empirically examines whether the severance tax incentive has encouraged horizontal development in Oklahoma relative to Texas and Kansas. Our findings indicate that the Oklahoma tax exemption has not had a significant influence on horizontal drilling.
H73|Political Centralization and Government Accountability|This article explains why decentralization can undermine accountability and answers three questions: what determines if power should be centralized or decentralized when regions are heterogeneous? How many levels of government should there be? How should state borders be drawn? We develop a model of political agency in which voters differ in their ability to monitor rent-seeking politicians. We find that rent extraction is a decreasing and convex function of the share of informed voters, because voter information improves monitoring but also reduces the appeal of holding office. As a result, information heterogeneity pushes toward centralization to reduce rent extraction. Taste heterogeneity pulls instead toward decentralization to match local preferences. Our model thus implies that optimal borders should cluster by tastes but ensure diversity of information. We also find economies of scope in accountability that explain why multiplying government tiers harms efficiency. A single government in charge of many policies has better incentives than many special-purpose governments splitting its budget and responsibilities. Hence, a federal system is desirable only if information varies enough across regions. JEL Codes: D72, D82, H73, H77.
H73|Fiscal Incentives in Federations: Russia and the US Compared|I compare fiscal incentives in Russia and the US according to the conventional measures employed in the relevant literature. Although Russia is more fiscally centralized as measured by shares of budget expenditures and revenues, measures of fiscal incentives at the margin are largely similar in the US and Russia both at the regional and municipal levels. These results are contrary to the estimates obtained for Russia in the earlier literature. It appears that fiscal federalism reforms undertaken in Russia throughout the 2000s improved fiscal incentives of subnational governments. However, these results should be treated with great caution as fiscal incentive measures employed in this paper and in the literature at large are far from perfect. This might provide an explanation for the result that intraregional fiscal incentives do not have a significant effect on economic growth.
H73|Evaluation of the fiscal effect on municipal mergers: Quasi-experimental evidence from Japanese municipal data|The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a fiscal common pool problem in Japanese municipal mergers. Specifically, we investigate whether the merged municipalities rapidly increase their expenditures and bonds just before mergers. Because the likelihood of Japanese municipal mergers depends on a municipality's characteristics such as population size, area, and fiscal conditions, municipal mergers are a non-voluntary and non-random phenomenon in Japan. Therefore, we identify causal effects by applying propensity score matching within a differences-in-differences framework to address the problems of endogeneity bias and sample selection bias. In particular, we focus on the subordinate merger partner in absorption-type mergers. Our results show that the subordinate merger partner suffers from adverse fiscal conditions and creates a fiscal common pool problem in public projects just before mergers.
H73|Change in Strategic Interaction after Introducing Policy|This study investigates the change in the strength of strategic interaction from a policy introduction stage to a mature stage. The bulk of literature confirms the strategic interaction among local governments, but does not consider the change in the strength of strategic interaction. Our hypothesis is that the strength of strategic interaction decreases from a policy introduction stage to a mature stage because uncertainty at the policymaking stage might become weaker as time elapses. We focus on the Japanese long-term care insurance (LTCI) system that was introduced in fiscal year 2000. Our findings suggest that since municipalities should forecast the demand for long-term care and set the premium over a three-year “program management period,” they have a strong incentive to refer to the premium setting of surrounding municipalities. Moreover, the incentive would decrease as periods elapse. The empirical evidence is consistent with our hypothesis that the strength of strategic interaction on LTCI premium setting is gradually reduced from the early stage to the mature stage.
H73|Free‐rider behaviour under voluntary amalgamation: The case of setting the long‐term care insurance premium in Japan|This study confirms free‐rider behaviour of pre‐merger municipalities in the case of voluntary amalgamation. The novel contribution of this study is dividing pre‐merger municipalities into two groups: those that had the chance to free ride when setting the long‐term care insurance premium and those that did not. Moreover, it focuses on the revision of the long‐term care insurance premium as the target of free‐rider behaviour. Therefore, the present study is able to capture free‐rider behaviour before the amalgamation. The regression results confirm that only pre‐merger municipalities that had the chance to free ride showed free‐rider behaviour. Este estudio confirma el comportamiento oportunista de los municipios antes de una fusión en el caso de la fusión voluntaria. La contribución novedosa de este estudio es dividir los municipios antes de una fusión en dos grupos: los que pudieron comportarse de manera oportunista al establecer la prima del seguro de cuidado a largo plazo y aquellos que no pudieron hacerlo. Además, se enfoca en la revisión de la prima del seguro de cuidado a largo plazo como el objetivo del comportamiento oportunista. Por lo tanto, el presente estudio es capaz de identificar el comportamiento oportunista antes de la fusión. Los resultados de la regresión confirman que solo los municipios antes de una fusión que pudieron comportarse de manera oportunista mostraron un comportamiento oportunista. 本稿では、自主的合併の場合における、合併前の自治体によるフリーライダー行為を確認する。本研究の新たな試みとして、合併前の自治体を、長期介護保険プレミアムを設定するときにフフリーライダー行為の機会を得た自治体と、それを行わなかった自治体の2つのグループに分ける。さらに、フリーライダー行為を目的とした長期介護保険プレミアムの改訂にも注目する。本研究は、これによって、合併前のフリーライダー行為を捉えることが可能である。回帰分析の結果は、フリーライダー行為の機会を得た合併前の自治体のみがそれを実行していることを示している。
H73|Identifying Discretion of Municipalities to Undertake Eligibility Assessments for Japan’s Long-Term Care Insurance Program|Eligibility assessments play an important role in Japan’s long-term care insurance program and have been designed so that municipalities do not have discretion in their working. However, there are doubts about eligibility assessments based on the municipal fiscal situation. This study empirically identifies the discretion of municipalities to undertake eligibility assessments employing the idea of opportunistic municipal behavior at amalgamation. Amalgamation offers municipalities an incentive to free ride (e.g., public debt accumulation) when they can subrogate the load to a new municipality after amalgamation. If so, pre-merger municipalities might increase the eligibility ratio before amalgamation. Difference-in-difference regression confirms a free-rider effect of pre-merger municipalities in the eligibility assessments for long-term care by Japanese municipalities. Smaller pre-merger municipalities increase the eligibility ratio immediately before amalgamation. These results mean that the Japanese long-term care insurance system is not managed in accordance with the institutional design.

H73|Decentralization, fiscal transfers and income inequality in Central and Eastern European countries|Although income redistribution is primarily a central government responsibility, decentralization can improve or deteriorate the equity in resource and income redistribution depending on how the process of decentralization is designed and implemented. This paper provides empirical evidence on the association between fiscal decentralization and income distribution for a panel of 11 economies from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) during 1995-2011. In these regards, we focus on three research topics: the effect of decentralization on income inequality; the effects of the structure of local government finance on income inequality; and the validity of the Kuznets-hypothesis. The main findings from the empirical exercise are as follows: first, we cannot provide firm evidence on the presumes favourable effects of fiscal decentralization on income distribution in the CEE countries; second, our empirical model suggests that the effects of fiscal decentralization on income inequality depend on the source of finance of sub-national governments, i.e. intergovernmental transfers might have a role in income equalization; third, we provide empirical support for the validity of the Kuznets-hypothesis in the CEE countries in which there is a nonlinear relationship between the level of economic development and income inequality.
H73|Descentralización fiscal, capacidades administrativas y recaudación del impuesto predial en los municipios de México: Una aproximación teórica|El valor-trabajo, desde sus orígenes en la economía política, ha tenido una relación central en su explicación del precio y la moneda, el autor cuyo prototipo llevó hasta sus últimas consecuencias dicha concepción de manera crítica, fue Marx. Se retoma aquí dicha relación entre valor, precio y moneda en su desarrollo teórico-abstracto y la finalidad que subyace en dichos postulados. La pertinencia de la teoría de Marx se hace presente, al introducir el dinero en una sociedad descentralizada, que permita hacer las transacciones superando el dualismo producción-mercado, en una visión heterodoxa, es decir monetaria institucional.
H73|Forms of government decentralization and institutional quality: evidence from a large sample of nations|This chapter studies the effects of various forms of government decentralization on institutional quality across countries. Using corruption and the shadow economy to proxy for institutional quality, as well as three forms of government decentralization (i.e., virtual, physical, and fiscal), the econometric results show virtual decentralization to be the most effective in improving institutional quality. The effects on transition and countries in Asia are also considered.
H73|Looking Beyond Conventional Intergovernmental Fiscal Frameworks: Principles, Realities, and Neglected Issues|Fiscal decentralization and intergovernmental fiscal relations reform have become nearly ubiquitous in developing countries. Performance, however, has often been disappointing in terms of both policy formulation and outcomes. The dynamics underlying these results have been poorly researched. Available literature focuses heavily on policy and institutional design concerns framed by public finance, fiscal federalism, and public management principles. The literature tends to explain unsatisfactory outcomes largely as a result of some combination of flawed design and management of intergovernmental fiscal systems, insufficient capacity, and lack of political will. These factors are important, but there is room to broaden the analysis in at least two potentially valuable ways. First, much can be learned by more robustly examining how national and local political and bureaucratic forces shape the policy space, providing opportunities for and placing constraints on effective and sustainable reform. Second, the analysis would benefit from moving beyond design to considering how to implement reform more strategically.
H73|Changes in Beer Excise Tax Levying: Consequences for Budget and Regional Development (Case of St.Petersburg)<BR>[Изменения Во Взимании Акцизов На Пиво: Последствия Для Бюджета И Развития Региона (На Примере Санкт-Петербурга)]|The gradual increase of excise duties on beer provided under the Law on indexation of excise rates in the years 2015–2017 aims to reduce beer consumption by population and to contribute to the growth of related tax revenues for regional budgets. However, the issue of increasing excises on beer’ rates is not so clear. On the one hand, with the decline in consumer activity of the population during the crisis period, the brewing industry will be under attack with the evident consequence of reducing tax revenues to the regional budget. On the other hand, the “grey” schemes of beer import from the EAEU are beginning to appear in Russia, as well as the switching of low-income groups to poor-quality alcohol, including surrogates. In addition, the desire to withdraw the administration of excise taxes on beer from the regional level to the federal one does not meet the objectives of sustainable development of regions, especially St. Petersburg as the largest metropolis in North-West of Russia. The article discusses the following issues: the role of excise taxes on beer for the regional budget revenues formation in Russia, the impact of excise taxes on beer increasing on their collection rates in the current conditions, as well as the increase in the consumption of other types of alcohol; and the prospects of a partial transfer of administration of the excise taxes on beer from regional budgets to the federal one.
H73|The Contribution of Fiscal Decentralization to Regional Inequality: Empirical Results for South African Municipalities|Over the past two decades, many African countries have carried out reforms aimed at decentralizing the political, administrative and fiscal structures of the public sector. The need to transform the structure of governance is informed by the view that decentralization increases the overall efficiency and responsiveness of the public sector in providing services, an outcome that enhances economic development and contributes to a reduction in regional disparities. Using panel data for South Africaâ€™s 234 municipalities over the period 2003â€“2012, we test whether the decentralization of some fiscal powers to municipalities acts as a commitment tool that motivates local authorities to implement policies that reduce interâ€“regional inequality. The results of the empirical analysis provide evidence of a statistically significant relationship between fiscal decentralization and inequality in the context of South Africaâ€™s local government sphere, with the specific nature of the relationship contingent on how fiscal decentralization is measured. In the case of revenue based measures of fiscal decentralization, the results support the hypothesis that the commitment device of fiscal decentralization provides incentives that decrease interâ€“municipal inequality. On the other hand, expenditure based fiscal decentralization contribute to increased interâ€“municipal disparities.

H73|Disparitäten in der Entwicklung der Gemeindesteuern<BR>[Disparities in the Development of Municipal Revenues]|Zusammenfassung Steuern stellen die wichtigste Einnahmequelle der Kommunen dar. Sie sind von 2004 bis 2014 sehr dynamisch gewachsen. Allerdings profitieren nicht alle in gleichem Maße. Die Länderdurchschnitte sind daher wenig repräsentativ. Besonders in den Kommunen der wirtschaftsstarken Länder sind die landesinternen Differenzen tendenziell groß. Gemessen an den absoluten Maßzahlen wachsen die Disparitäten bundesweit zwischen den Kommunen, was an wenigen Ausreißern hoher Steuereinnahmekraft liegt. Die relative Ungleichheit bleibt hingegen stabil. Die Mobilität der Kommunen in der Verteilung ist gering. Insbesondere für die steuerschwachen Kommunen ist dies betrüblich, denn deren Chance aufzuholen, ist begrenzt.

Daher sind Alternativen gefragt.
H73|Beggar-Thy-Neighbour Tax Cuts: Mobility after a Local Income and Wealth Tax Reform in Switzerland|Tax competition raises the question to which extent taxpayers respond to differences in income tax rates by migrating to low-tax areas. This paper analyzes a large, two-step tax reform in the canton of Obwalden in central Switzerland in 2006 and 2008. The canton first introduced a regressive income tax scheme with the explicit purpose of attracting affluent taxpayers, followed by a change to a flat rate tax, thereby lowering taxes for all taxpayers. Using individual tax data from the cantonal tax administration, I apply a 2SLS approach to estimate how responsive migration was to the tax reduction. I estimate an elasticity of the stock of rich taxpayers in the canton with respect to the average net-of-tax rate of 2.4 in the first two years after the reform, increasing to 3.5 over the five post-reform years. The corresponding elsticities of the inflow of rich taxpayers are even larger. These estimates are larger than what the few studies on tax induced mobility elasticity have found so far. I can further rule out that these results are due to an exogenous positive income shock to top incomes. DiD estimations comparing the share of rich taxpayers and net income per taxpayer in Obwalden to two neighboring cantons confirm that the reform was successful in increasing the canton's tax base. The large elasticities can be explained by two aspects. First, by the sizable pool of intentionally treated and the prevailing residence-based taxation, as opposed to source-based taxation. Through relocating to Obwalden, any Swiss and European citizen could take advantage of this tax scheme. Second, by the initially low share of rich taxpayers in Obwalden and the small size of the canton.
H73|From broken windows to broken bonds: Militarized police and social fragmentation|Expansion of police militarization in the U.S. raises questions about how such policing affects society and minority communities. We estimate the impact of one particular aspect of police militarization—the Department of Defense’s Excess Property Program 1033—on civic engagement—which we capture primarily by examining charitable giving among households—via an instrumental variables approach. The instrument stems from plausibly exogenous variation in federal defense spending, which affects awareness of military culture and capabilities, and thus encourages the adoption of military equipment and tactics by local police departments. Estimates show that the 1033 Program has a fragmenting effect on society: As the transfer of surplus military equipment to local law enforcement increases, black households reduce their total charitable donations more than all other households.
H73|What Makes Cities More Productive? Evidence from 5 OECD Countries on the Role of Urban Governance|In estimating agglomeration benefits across five OECD countries, this paper represents the first empirical analysis that contrasts cross-country evidence on agglomeration benefits with the productivity impact of metropolitan governance structures, while taking into account the potential sorting of individuals across cities. The comparability of results in a multi-country setting is supported through the use of a new internationally-harmonised definition of cities based on economic linkages rather than administrative boundaries. The analysis finds that cities with fragmented governance structures tend to have lower levels of productivity. The estimated elasticity for an increase in the number of local jurisdiction is 0.06, which is halved by the existence of a metropolitan governance body. The effect is sizeable, as the analysis confirms the result in the literature that city productivity increases with city size with an elasticity in the range of 0.02 to 0.05.
H73|Property Taxation, Zoning, and Efficiency in a Dynamic Tiebout Model|This paper presents a dynamic Tiebout model and uses it to revisit a classic argument in public finance. The argument, due to Hamilton (1975), is that a system of governments financing services with property taxes will produce an efficient allocation of housing and services if governments can implement zoning ordinances. In the model, when governments choose zoning along with taxes and services, there does not exist an equilibrium that is both efficient and locally stable. Moreover, there exists an equilibrium in which governments over-zone and households over-consume housing. These findings challenge the Benefit View of the property tax.
H73|Regulatory Races: The Effects of Jurisdictional Competition on Regulatory Standards|This article surveys the literature on regulatory arbitrage in four settings: labor regulation, environmental protection, corporate governance, and banking and finance. For a regulatory race to occur, firms must migrate across state or country borders in response to geographic differences in the costs and benefits of regulation, and governments must shape their regulatory policies with the aim of affecting those migration flows. We find that both these conditions hold only in rare circumstances. Instead, the much more common outcome is for political pressures within jurisdictions to produce a heterogeneous pattern resembling Tiebout sorting. Such regulatory convergence as occurs is more often the result of deliberate harmonization or imitation. ( JEL G18, G28, G38, H73, J08, L51, Q58)
H73|The determinants of tax morale in Pakistan|This paper examines the determinants of tax morale in Pakistan, a country that has struggled with low tax effort over the past decade. We exploit novel data for individual taxpayers collected in 2014 by Pakistan’s Federal Board of Revenue to estimate a binary probit regression model. Our results are generally in line with the findings of the modern empirical literature on tax morale in other countries. Overall, groups with lower labor force participation show more positive attitudes toward tax compliance. Educated respondents exhibit higher tax morale than the illiterate, but only for those with very low or very high educational attainment is tax morale higher than for those with bachelor’s degrees. Tax morale is highest in major industrialized population centers that serve as seats of government. Females show generally higher tax morale than males, however, their attitudes tend to worsen with age to such an extent that elderly females have lower tax morale than elderly males. Our findings on gender suggest potential gains from increasing female labor force participation rates. More generally, addressing the current failures of tax administration and dealing with horizontal inequity arising from administrative weaknesses may contribute materially to improving voluntary compliance.
H73|La brecha fiscal territorial en Colombia|Este trabajo presenta una estimación de las necesidades de gasto y de la capacidad fiscal de los municipios y departamentos de Colombia para el año 2014. Para estimar la primera se emplea la norma de gasto por habitante, mientras que el análisis envolvente de datos se usa para estimar la segunda. Los resultados muestran que existen disparidades fiscales horizontales en Colombia con mayor incidencia en los municipios que en los departamentos, y que estas son en mayores en los territorios con mayor atraso relativo. Se encontró evidencia de un patrón centro periferia en las brechas fiscales territoriales, donde regiones del centro del país registran menores desequilibrios entre sus necesidades de gasto y su capacidad para generar recursos propios. Un sistema de transferencias de igualación que cubra esas brechas sería la opción una política pública viable para corregirlas. ******ABSTRACT: In this paper, we present an estimation of expenditure needs and fiscal capacity of Colombia’s municipalities and departments in 2014. We use standards per capita norms to estimate the spending needs and data envelopment analysis for the local fiscal capacity. The results show that there are high horizontal fiscal disparities in Colombia with the greater incidence in the municipalities than in the departments, and that these disparities are in favor of more developed territories. There is also evidence of a center-periphery pattern in the horizontal fiscal disparities, where central regions of the country have lower imbalance between spending needs and their ability to generate their own resources. An equalization transfers system is an option for public policy to eliminate these disparities.
H73|Special-Interest Spillovers And Tobacco Taxation|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12116-abs-0001""> This study explores the effects tobacco special interest has had on cigarette tax rates. Using a spatial econometric model to control for tax competition and the endogeneity present in state tax rates, this study finds that tobacco special interest has played a significant role in influencing state cigarette tax rates. Pounds of tobacco grown in a state and tobacco industry campaign contributions are associated with lower cigarette tax rates. The empirical results show that the magnitude of the special-interest effect can be two to five times as large when the spatial spillover effects are included. (JEL C23, H71, H73)"
H73|Wages and International Tax Competition|Firms generating larger surpluses on average pay higher wages. We study the effect of this rent-sharing between firms and workers on international tax competition. In our model, firms in a large country can shift surplus to a tax haven. In the benchmark case firms only have a tax incentive for profit shifting as shifted surplus is fully taken into account in the wage bargaining. In this case rent-sharing decreases the competitive pressure on the large country and leads to higher equilibrium tax rates. When workers do not observe the full surplus shifted, a wage incentive arises. Profit shifting then becomes more attractive as it reduces the surplus bargained over with workers. If this effect is sufficiently strong, rent-sharing increases the competitive pressure on the large country, which implies a lower equilibrium tax rate.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H73|Tackling Spillovers by Taxing Corporate Income in the European Union at Source|This paper surveys and evaluates the corporation tax (CT) systems of the Member States of the European Union on the basis of a comprehensive taxonomy of actual and potential regimes, which have as their base either profits, profits and interest, or economic rents. The current regimes give rise to various instate and interstate spillovers, which violate the basic tenets – neutrality and subsidiarity – of the single market. The trade-offs between the implications of these tenets – harmonization and diversity, respectively – can be reconciled by a bottom-up, reversible strategy of strengthening source-based taxation and approximating tax rates. The strategy starts with dual income taxation, proceeds with final source withholding taxes and rate approximation, and is made complete by comprehensive business income taxation. Common base taxation, if desired, should probably be left to the Member States themselves.
H73|The Assignment and Division of the Tax Base in a System of Hierarchical Governments|"The existence of either ""horizontal"" fiscal externalities, in which changes in one jurisdiction's policies affect the government budget of other jurisdictions and therefore the utility of its residents or ""vertical"" externalities, in which changes in one level of government's policies affect the budget of another level of government, may lead to non-optimal government policies. These fiscal externalities, then, suggest the possibility of corrective policies. The focus here is on vertical externalities. In a growing literature, these externalities are associated with the extent that tax bases are shared or ""co-occupied"" by two different levels of government. Given that co-occupancy is the cause of or at least exacerbates the externality, I consider, the optimal ""assignment"" of the tax base and, more specifically, whether the co-occupancy of tax bases is desirable. Specifically, I examine the optimal extent of the tax base of a lower level of government (local) and a higher level (state) in a hierarchical system of governments. The co-occupancy of the tax base influences the magnitude and possible the direction of ""vertical"" fiscal externalities associated with the taxes of one or both of the levels of government. Using a model in which there is a continuum of commodities, each with the same demand characteristics, I formally consider whether, as has been asserted in a number of studies, whether it is optimal to eliminate all co-occupancy between the tax bases of the two levels of government. While I find that it is indeed not optimal to have co-occupancy in the tax base in the absence of other corrective policies for the fiscal externality, eliminating co-occupancy does not, in general, eliminate fiscal externalities, meaning that tax rates can still be above or now below the socially-optimal level. Thus elimination of co-occupancy in the tax base is not a substitute for a policy such as intergovernmental matching grants which directly eliminates fiscal externalities. If alternative policies are available such as matching grants that do eliminate fiscal externalities and governments are restricted to set the same tax rate on all commodities in their base, the optimal division of the tax base changes dramatically -- optimality requires both governments tax the entire base.

H73|Effective Tax Rates and Effective Progressivity in a Fiscally Decentralized Country|This paper proposes measures to quantify the effective level and the effective progressivity of taxation in a fiscally decentralized country taking income sorting into account. Using data on the universe of Swiss taxpayers, we find that rich households effectively face significantly lower average and marginal tax rates and lower progressivity than in the benchmark case that does not consider income sorting. This is because high-income households systematically avoid high taxation by locating in low-tax jurisdictions. The results are stronger for singles than for families, indicating that singles are more sensitive to spatial tax differentials than families. Although income tax schedules of the Swiss federation, the 26 cantons and the more than 2,600 municipalities are all strictly progressive, the effectively paid country-wide average tax rate is regressive for households with very high incomes and without children. The proposed measure of the effective average and marginal tax rates also allows us to adequately describe the evolution of the country-wide tax burden over time. We document that about half of the reduction in the tax burden on top incomes between 1975 and 2009 is due to reductions in statutory tax rates and about half to stronger income sorting of the population. Our results also hold when we account for the disutility from housing prices into which tax rates capitalize.
H73|Regulatory competition in capital standards with selection effects among banks|Several countries have recently introduced national capital standards exceeding the internationally coordinated Basel III rules, thus suggesting a `race to the top' in capital standards. We study regulatory competition when banks are heterogeneous and give loans to firms that produce output in an integrated market. In this setting capital requirements change the pool quality of banks in each country and inflict negative externalities on neighboring jurisdictions by shifting risks to foreign taxpayers and by reducing total credit supply and output. Non-cooperatively set capital standards are higher than coordinated ones when governments care equally about bank profits, taxpayers, and consumers.
H73|Optimal Policies against Profit Shifting: The Role of Controlled-Foreign-Company Rules|By introducing controlled-foreign-company (CFC) rules, the parent country of a multinational firm reserves the right to tax the income of the firm's foreign affiliates if the tax rate in the affiliate's host country is below a specified threshold. We identify the conditions under which binding CFC rules are part of the optimal tax mix when governments can set the statutory tax rate, a thin capitalization rule and the CFC rule. We also analyze the effects of economic and financial integration on the optimal policy mix. Our results correspond to the actual development of anti-avoidance rules in OECD countries.
H73|Taxing Wealth: Evidence from Switzerland|We study the effects of wealth taxation on reported wealth. Our analysis is based on data for Switzerland, which has the highest rate of annual wealth taxation in the developed world. While the wealth tax base is defined at the federal level, tax rates vary considerably across locations and over time. We use aggregate data on wealth holdings by canton and individual-level data for the canton of Bern. Our estimated behavioral elasticities substantially exceed those of the taxable income literature. We also find that taxpayers bunch below the tax threshold, that observed responses are driven by changes in wealth holdings rather than mobility, and that financial wealth is somewhat more responsive than non-financial wealth.
H73|Der lange Schatten der Stasi-Überwachung|Staatliche Überwachung war und ist allgegenwärtig. Nichtsdestotrotz sind Erkenntnisse zu Nutzen und Kosten staatlicher Überwachungsmaßnahmen begrenzt. Dieser Beitrag fasst die Ergebnisse einer aktuellen Forschungsarbeit zusammen, in der die langfristigen Auswirkungen der Überwachung durch die DDR-Staatssicherheit auf das gesellschaftliche Sozialkapital sowie die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung in Ostdeutschland nach dem Ende der DDR-Diktatur untersucht werden. Die Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit zeigen, dass flächendeckende Überwachung der Bevölkerung stark negative und langanhaltende Konsequenzen haben kann.
H73|Corporate investment decisions under political uncertainty|I investigate how political uncertainty influences corporate investment decisions employing a unique panel dataset of German manufacturing firms. I use data on firms’ self-reported investment realizations, plans and revisions. The firm-specific user cost of capital captures the current institutional framework, but does not reflect the uncertainty about changes in government policies firms are faced with. I therefore augment the neo-classical investment model by a measure of political uncertainty resulting from the electoral process. The results show that realized investment ratios decreased by 10.5% in years when state elections occurred relative to the average investment ratio in years with no state election. Firms however seem to anticipate electoral uncertainty already when making investment plans and hardly revise their plans. Investment revisions occur because of updated information about realized sales growth and not because of resolved electoral uncertainty. I also find that electoral uncertainty negatively influences add-on investments which face a high degree of irreversibility, while non-capacity expanding investments are not influenced by electoral uncertainty.
H73|Implementing partial tax harmonization in an asymmetric tax competition game with repeated interaction|This paper investigates the conditions under which partial harmonization for capital taxation is sustained in a repeated interactions model of tax competition when there are three countries with heterogenous capital endowments. We show that regardless of the structure of the coalition (i.e., full or partial tax coordination), whether partial tax harmonization is sustainable or not crucially depends on the extent to which the capital endowment of the medium-sized country is similar to that of the large or small country. The most noteworthy finding is that the closer the capital endowment of the median country is to the average one, the less likely the tax harmonization including the median country is to prevail and the more likely the partial tax harmonization excluding the median country is to prevail. We also show that partial tax harmonization makes the member countries of the tax union better off and non-member countries worse off, which stands in sharpe contrast with previous studies, such as Konrad and Schjelderup (1999) and Bucovetsky (2009).
H73|La brecha fiscal territorial en Colombia|Este trabajo presenta una estimación de las necesidades de gasto y de la capacidad fiscal de los municipios y departamentos de Colombia para el año 2014. Para estimar la primera se emplea la norma de gasto por habitante, mientras que el análisis envolvente de datos se usa para estimar la segunda. Los resultados muestran que existen disparidades fiscales horizontales en Colombia con mayor incidencia en los municipios que en los departamentos, y que estas son en mayores en los territorios con mayor atraso relativo. Se encontró evidencia de un patrón centro periferia en las brechas fiscales territoriales, donde regiones del centro del país registran menores desequilibrios entre sus necesidades de gasto y su capacidad para generar recursos propios. Un sistema de transferencias de igualación que cubra esas brechas sería la opción una política pública viable para corregirlas.

H73|Racism and judicial corruption in the US|Is racial hate reflected in the degree of judicial corruption? Using US state-level data, we find racial hate to be a positive and statistically powerful predictor of judicial corruption. This relationship prevails after the inclusion of the conventional control variables and regional fixed effects. In terms of magnitude, one standard deviation increase of racial hate relates to an increase of 70 percent of one standard deviation in corruption. Interestingly, no such relationship can be found for corruption in the executive or legislative branch.

H73|The Optimal Distribution of Population across Cities|The received economic wisdom is that cities are too big and that public policy should limit their sizes. This wisdom assumes, unrealistically, that city sites are homogeneous, migration is unfettered, land is given freely to incoming migrants, and federal taxes are neutral. Should those assumptions not hold, large cities may be inefficiently small. We prove this claim in a system of cities with heterogeneous sites and either free mobility or local governments, where agglomeration economies, congestion, federal taxation, and land ownership create wedges. A quantitative version of our model suggests that cities may well be too numerous and underpopulated for a wide range of plausible parameter values. The welfare costs of free migration equilibria appear small, whereas they seem substantial when local governments control city size.
H73|(De-)zentrale Energiewende und soziale Konflikte: regionale Konflikte um die Vertretung des Gemeinwohls|While the „Energiewende“ is a national and moreover global topic, the actual increasing conflicts are taking place at the local level. But who claims to represent the common good? Which impact do protests concerning the „Energiewende“ have on the local social structure? In our text we discuss these questions based on two case studies on conflicts about the construction of new overhead power cables and wind farms. We focus on the cleavage between common good and particular interests. Furthermore we analyze certain regional cleavages. We integrate the perspectives of all actors involved in these conflicts, such as local politicians and authorities, companies, protest groups, as well as those affected citizens who decided not to join the protests. We show that the conflicts are not just dealing with their specific issues but that there are deeper regional conflicts concerning the question who is legitimated to represent the common good. Obwohl die Energiewende als gesellschaftlicher Konsens gilt, nehmen lokale Proteste gegen Energiewendeprojekte zu. Doch welche Auswirkungen haben diese Proteste auf das soziale Gefüge in den Regionen? Wer beansprucht in diesen lokalen Konflikten, das Gemeinwohl zu vertreten? Diese Fragen werden im vorliegenden Artikel empirisch auf der Grundlage von zwei Fallstudien zu den Themenbereichen Stromtrassenbau und Windenergie diskutiert. Vor allem wird auf die Konfliktlinie der Allgemeinwohlvertretung sowie auf regionale Konfliktlinien eingegangen. Dabei werden die Sichtweisen aller beteiligten Akteure sowie der betroffenen, aber nicht aktiven Bevölkerung berücksichtigt. Es wird gezeigt, dass es in den Konflikten um mehr geht als um das spezifische Projekt, das verhindert werden soll. Vielmehr wird, eingebunden in lokale Konfliktlinien, der Vertretungsanspruch des Gemeinwohls verhandelt.
H73|Long-run impacts of land regulation: Evidence from tenancy reform in India|Agricultural tenancy reforms have been widely enacted, but evidence on their long-run impact remains limited. In this paper, we provide such evidence by exploiting the quasi-random assignment of linguistically similar areas to different South Indian states that subsequently varied in tenancy regulation policies. Given imperfect credit markets, the impact of tenancy reform should vary by household wealth status, allowing us to exploit historic caste-based variation in landownership. Thirty years after the reforms, land inequality is lower in areas that saw greater intensity of tenancy reform, but the impact differs across caste groups. Tenancy reforms increase own cultivation among middle-caste households, but render low-caste households more likely to work as daily agricultural laborers. At the same time, agricultural wages increase. These results are consistent with tenancy regulations increasing land sales to relatively richer and more productive middle-caste tenants, but reducing land access for poorer low-caste tenants.
H73|Progressive taxes and top income shares: A historical perspective on pre- and post-tax income concentration in Switzerland|The literature on income concentration largely focuses on pre-tax income; the current study provides new data concerning both pre- and post-tax top income shares in Switzerland, from the 1945–2012 period. Redistribution due to progressive income taxes increased until the 1970s, and since then, the highest-income households have avoided increased cantonal income taxes by taking residence in low-tax cantons. Lower-level top income groups are less mobile than the highest-level groups, but have benefited from tax policy reforms since the 1980s. Nonetheless, despite fiscal federalism, redistribution and post-tax income concentration have been exceptionally stable in Switzerland.
H73|Gale–Nikaido–Debreu and Milgrom–Shannon: Communal interactions with endogenous community structures|This paper examines Nash jurisdictional stability in a model with a continuum of agents whose characteristics are distributed over a unidimensional interval. Communal benefits and costs of each individual depend on her identity and the composition of the community which she belongs to. Since the framework is too general to yield an existence of Nash equilibrium, we introduce the essentiality of membership in one of the communities for all individuals. We highlight the Border Indifference Property (BIP), when all individuals located on a border between two adjacent jurisdictions are indifferent about joining either of them and show that BIP is a necessary condition for yielding a Nash equilibrium. We invoke the celebrated Gale–Nikaido–Debreu Lemma to guarantee the existence of a partition that satisfies BIP. We then proceed to demonstrate that BIP is not sufficient to yield a Nash equilibrium. The equilibrium existence under BIP is rescued when we use the Milgrom–Shannon monotone comparative statics conditions.
H73|Patient mobility and health care quality when regions and patients differ in income|We study the effects of cross-border patient mobility on health care quality and welfare when income varies across and within regions. We use a Salop model with a high-, middle-, and low-income region. In each region, a policy maker chooses health care quality to maximise the utility of its residents when health care costs are financed by general income taxation. In equilibrium, regions with higher income offer better quality, which creates an incentive for patient mobility from lower- to higher-income regions. Assuming a prospective payment scheme based on DRG-pricing, we find that lower non-monetary (administrative) mobility costs have (i) no effect on quality or welfare in the high-income region; (ii) a negative effect on quality but a positive effect on welfare for the middle-income region; and (iii) ambiguous effects on quality and welfare for the low-income region. Lower monetary mobility costs (copayments) might reduce welfare in both the middle- and low-income region. Thus, health policies that stimulate cross-border patient mobility can be counterproductive when regions differ in income.
H73|Local fiscal competition: An application to sales taxation with multiple federations|Local sales tax rates influence the location of retail activity. This paper develops a theory and empirical identification strategy for studying sales tax competition with “multiple federations,” as exemplified by multiple counties each containing several cities. In addition to strategic interactions with nearby cities and a city’s own county, city tax rates are influenced by the tax rates of neighboring counties. Cities react heterogeneously to own-county sales tax rates depending on distance to the county border. Using data on the driving time to county borders and a comprehensive cross-section of local sales tax rates, I exploit variation in proximity to county borders to identify vertical fiscal competition. Cities located near county borders react more intensely to their county’s tax rate in comparison to towns at the interior. An increase in the neighboring county tax rate raises city tax rates in nearby counties.
H73|Why truck distance taxes are contagious and drive fuel taxes to the bottom|This paper analyzes the way in which countries with international and local truck traffic decide to switch from a simple fuel tax system to a dual system of fuel and distance charge taxes. We show what drives a country to switch and how this affects the level of fuel taxes as well as incentives for other countries to also adopt the dual system. The model is partially able to explain the gradual extension of kilometer charging for trucks in Europe. The model also shows that, in the absence of diesel cars, the gradual introduction of kilometer charges will make fuel taxation for trucks virtually disappear and will lead to a system where truck use is (1) taxed mainly based on distance, (2) is taxed too heavily, and (3) where highest distance taxes are expected in transit countries with a strong market position. When the fuel tax must in addition serve as an externality tax for diesel cars, the introduction of distance charges for trucks will give rise to diesel taxes that are lower than the external cost of diesel cars. For trucks, this leads to a sum of diesel taxes and distance charges that are higher than the external cost of trucks.
H73|Local representation and strategic voting: Evidence from electoral boundary reforms|We analyze whether voters value local political representation by exploiting municipal mergers, which increase the number of candidates available to voters and intensify political competition. In the Finnish open-list proportional representation system, voters rank the candidates within parties, and thus, concentrating votes to local candidates increases the extent of local representation. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that the vote distributions become more concentrated in municipalities less likely to gain local representation after the mergers. Moreover, the effect is much larger in municipalities where the benefits of local representation to voters are large. The latter result disentangles voters' responses from the responses of other political actors. The results are important also for designing local government mergers, which are an important policy tool in many countries. They highlight that concerns over deteriorating local democracy due to mergers have merit, because voters have preferences for local representation. At the same time, the vote concentration patterns we find alleviate these concerns.
H73|Income redistribution in open economies|I propose a model of income redistribution in an open-economy environment. The world consists of a finite number of countries whose governments seek to maximize the welfare of their low-skilled populations by taxing skilled workers' labor income. While tax competition limits the extent to which redistribution is possible—as compared to the closed-economy outcome—when skilled people are internationally mobile, I argue that race to the bottom does not necessarily occur, even if the number of countries becomes arbitrarily large. The asymptotic sustainability of the welfare state crucially depends on the statistical properties of the probability distribution of skilled people's location preferences.
H73|Do tax incentives affect charitable contributions? Evidence from public charities' reported revenues|This paper estimates the effect of the charitable contribution tax deduction on charities' donation revenue from charities' tax filings. A one percent increase in the tax cost of giving causes charitable receipts to fall by about four percent, an effect three times larger the consensus in the literature. Further analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity in the tax response by subsector: health care and home care are more tax-sensitive than other charities, while higher education and arts are less tax-sensitive. The results are consistent with substantial tax response heterogeneity within the sample and between sampled and unsampled charities, implying that the mean tax elasticity of charitable contributions is a poor predictor of tax incentive effects for individual charities.
H73|Allowing firms to choose between separate accounting and formula apportionment taxation|This paper analyzes the effect on firm behavior and national tax revenues of allowing multinational firms to choose to be taxed under separate accounting rules or an apportionment formula. Separate accounting always generates more profitable output and conditional labor demand distortions from tax differentials while either method can generate a more profitable income-shifting distortion. Both low-cost and high-cost firms can prefer separate accounting while medium-cost firms prefer formula apportionment. With symmetric countries, a firm's preferred method generates greater tax revenues in the country with the lower tax rate. With asymmetric countries, a firm's preferred method need no longer generate greater tax revenues in the lower-tax-rate country due to the fact that countries and firms now value tax base distortions differently. With this misalignment of preferences, some firms can choose the preferred method of both countries at fixed tax rates.
H73|The fiscal externality of multifamily housing and its impact on the property tax: Evidence from cities and schools, 1980–2010|Negative fiscal externalities produced by apartments and other small housing units are commonly cited as the justification for many local land-use restrictions, such as minimum lot requirements and limits on multifamily developments. Because these laws effectively limit the number of small dwellings that can be built within a community, proponents argue that restrictions of this type help to guarantee that new homes will “pay for themselves” by discouraging free-riding behavior within a system of property tax funded local governments. Critics, however, have maintained that such policies constitute a veiled attempt by suburban communities at restricting entry for low-income families. Focusing on the clear distinction between housing units located in multifamily structures (i.e., apartments) and single-family homes, this paper finds strong evidence that residential per-capita values, measured as value per person and value per child, are actually higher for apartments, not single-family residences. Consequently, communities' effective property tax rates decline as apartments' share of the housing stock rises, holding all else equal. These findings are contrary to the set of assumptions that are often used to justify many of today's land-use restrictions and raise serious questions regarding the efficacy of modern fiscal zoning as a tool for promoting efficient fiscal federalism.
H73|When ad valorem tax prevails in international tax competition|The studies on capital tax competition have assumed that the governments compete for mobile capital in unit tax, and this assumption is partially justified by Lockwood (2004), which proves that unit tax competition is always welfare superior to ad valorem tax competition within a framework of symmetric tax competition. This paper presents the reexamination of governments' choice on tax method in the framework of asymmetric tax competition. The results show that asymmetric countries do not compete in the same tax instrument, as assumed in the literature. The capital importing countries compete in ad valorem tax, while the capital exporting countries compete in unit tax.
H73|La Ley de Coordinación Fiscal en México: Una crítica aritmética|From a political standpoint, the current Fiscal Coordination Law is surprising, since it redistributed federal transfers without causing an upheaval among the federal states. But, as this study shows, this law is even more surprising from an economic point of view, since it does not encourage economic activity and it does not stimulate the tax collection effort, as dictated by the original spirit of the initiative.
H73|Cooperazione locale in Italia: le unioni di comuni|This study presents an analysis of the financial statements of consortia from 2005 to 2012. The data come from the final accounts made available by the Ministry of Interior and cover 404 consortia and 2,090 participating municipalities that, with an average adhesion of 5.17 municipalities per consortium, represent 25.95% of the total municipalities. The goal of the analysis is to identify the existence of different types of consortia, characterized by both the composition of joint expenses and financing sources, and to assess the effect that the consortium has on both the overall levels of spending and its composition. In light of the above data, we can state that the weight, in terms of revenue and expenditure of municipal consortia, within the Italian public administration has so far been modest. However, the degree of activism of consortia, in terms of the ratio between the consortium per capita expenditure and the per capita expenditure of the belonging municipalities, is very heterogeneous both regionally and for spending functions.
H73|Why have revenue-strapped New England school districts been slow to turn to alternative funding sources?|During and even after the Great Recession, numerous popular press stories commented on the apparent growth of non-tax revenues in the face of school district budget deficits. But Downes and Killeen (2014) show that nationally the growth of non-traditional revenues has been far less than these articles may lead the reader to believe. This paper uses data from the New England states to assess the empirical content of some of the possible explanations of this slow growth. In New England, as in the rest of the nation, non-tax revenues per pupil have grown in real terms but have not become a more important source of local revenues. Further analysis of Massachusetts offers equivocal evidence on whether non-tax revenues substitute for or are complements to revenues from overrides of revenue limits. Results from Vermont show that, when the incentives created by a school finance reform are sufficiently strong, districts turn to non-tax revenues in place of property taxes. However, once those incentives are removed, districts shift back to traditional revenues, indicating that districts are not inclined to use alternative revenues as a permanent replacement for property tax revenues.
H73|Spanish fiscal federalism at the crossroad: A survey|In just over three decades Spain became one of the most decentralized countries in the world, at least in the tax area. This paper aims to conduct a detailed analysis of this unplanned process, showing the successful aspects, but also its shortcomings and failures. Furthermore, this analysis will also help to understand current political tensions in Catalonia, and, to a lesser extent, the Basque Country. Our second aim is to review the way in which the Spanish sub-central levels of government have responded to the so-called “great recession”. Spain is a good laboratory for what actually works and what does not in the area of stability and fiscal sustainability in decentralized states, for two reasons. First, it is by far the country which has suffered the brunt of the economic and financial crisis most acutely among those with a federal structure. And second, subsequent different solutions for tackling the fiscal crisis of sub-central governments have been tested.
H73|An economic explanation of the nationalization of electoral politics|The literature on the nationalization of electoral politics focuses on the institutional characteristics of political regimes and the structure and organization of social cleavages. We argue that the nationalization of electoral politics is also driven by economic performance. Short-term economic perturbations increase vote transfers from large (and highly nationalized) parties to small (and weakly nationalized) parties. On the contrary, sharp improvements in economic performance may generate vote shifts towards large parties, and then nationalization should increase. Permissive electoral systems exacerbate the influence of economic performance on nationalization. Pooled cross-sectional time-series regression analysis is conducted on data from 43 countries and 475 elections between 1950 and 2012. The party-level mechanisms are shown through a closer look at Austria and Portugal.
H73|Rethinking the Political Economy of Decentralization: How Elections and Parties Shape the Provision of Local Public Goods|As more and more of the world’s states devolve power and resources to sub-national governments, decentralization has emerged as one of the most important global trends of the new century. Yet, there is still no consensus as to the benefits of decentralization and how to design institutions that can realize these benefits. We investigate the political conditions under which the decentralization of authority will improve the delivery of public goods. Building off Oates’ “decentralization theorem” to include inter-jurisdictional spillovers, we develop a new theory suggesting that the interaction of democratic decentralization (the popular election of sub-national governments) and party centralization (the power of national party leaders over sub-national office-seekers) will produce the best service delivery outcomes. To test this argument empirically, we develop a new dataset of sub-national political institutions. Our analyses, which examine educational and health service delivery in 135 countries across thirty years, provide support for our theoretical expectations.
H73|"Political Institutions and Federalism: A ""Strong"" Decentralization Theorem"|In this article, we investigate how differences in the political institutions necessary for implementing decentralization reform may affect the efficiency and welfare properties of decentralization itself. We incorporate insights from political science and economics into a rigorous and formal extension of the influential “decentralization theorem” first developed by Oates in 1972. In our analysis, we go beyond Oates by producing a strong decentralization theorem that identifies the political conditions under which democratic decentralization dominates centralization even in the presence of interjurisdictional spillovers. More specifically, we find that beneficial outcomes for public service delivery will obtain when democratic decentralization (i.e. the creation of popularly elected sub-national governments) is combined with party centralization (i.e. the power of national party leaders to nominate candidates for sub-national office). We also find that the participation rules of primaries, whether closed or open, have important implications for the expected gains from decentralization. Most notably, we find that, when primaries are closed, even Oates’ convhaentional decentralization theorem does not hold. In summary, our theory shows that political institutions matter considerably in determining the welfare gains of decentralization outcomes.
H73|Tax morale, aversion to ethnic diversity, and decentralization|This paper analyzes theoretically and empirically the relationship between individuals' aversion to ethnic diversity, the degree of fiscal and political decentralization, and tax morale. We present a model showing how higher degrees of individuals' aversion to ethnic diversity may reduce tax morale and why this effects may be smaller in decentralized political and fiscal systems. We test these results by using individual data from the World Value Survey and several measures of decentralization. Our estimates robustly confirm that higher degrees of individuals' aversion to ethnic diversity are associated to lower tax morale and that this correlation is smaller or null in decentralized systems.
H73|Quasi-Experimental Evidence on the Connection between Property Taxes and Residential Capital Investment|Do low property taxes attract new home construction? This question is answered using a large shock to property tax burdens caused by an unusual school finance reform in the state of New Hampshire. The estimates suggest that, in most of the state, communities with a reduced tax burden experience a substantial increase in residential construction. In the area of the state near the region's primary urban center (Boston), however, the shock clears through a price adjustment—i.e., by capitalizing into property values. The differing responses are attributed to differing housing supply elasticities. (JEL H71, H73, R31)
H73|The Tax Gradient: Spatial Aspects of Fiscal Competition|State borders create a discontinuous tax treatment of retail sales. In a Nash game, local tax rates will be higher on the low state tax side of a border. Local taxes will decrease from the nearest high-tax border and increase from the low-tax border. Using driving time from state borders and all local sales tax rates, local tax rates on the low tax side of the border are 1.25 percentage points higher, reducing the differential in state tax rates by over three-quarters. A ten minute increase in driving time from the nearest high-tax state lowers a border town's local tax rate by 6 percent. (JEL H25, H71, H73, H77)
H73|Why Finance Ministers Favor Carbon Taxes, Even If They Do Not Take Climate Change into Account|Abstract Fiscal considerations may shift governmental priorities away from environmental concerns: finance ministers face strong demand for public expenditures such as infrastructure investments but they are constrained by international tax competition. We develop a multi-region model of tax competition and resource extraction to assess the fiscal incentive of imposing a tax on carbon rather than on capital. We explicitly model international capital and resource markets, as well as intertemporal capital accumulation and resource extraction. While fossil resources give rise to scarcity rents, capital does not. With carbon taxes, the rents can be captured and invested in infrastructure, which leads to higher welfare than under capital taxation. This result holds even without modeling environmental damages. It is robust under a variation of the behavioral assumptions of resource importers to coordinate their actions, and a resource exporter’s ability to counteract carbon policies. Further, no green paradox occurs—instead, the carbon tax constitutes a viable green policy, since it postpones extraction and reduces cumulative emissions.
H73|Transferencias intergubernamentales y disparidades fiscales horizontales en Colombia|Este documento estima las disparidades fiscales horizontales en municipios y departamentos de Colombia con datos de las Ejecuciones Presupuestales para el período 1985-2014. Además, se evalúa el efecto igualatorio de las transferencias condicionadas del Sistema General de Participaciones (SGP) y las no condicionadas del Sistema General de Regalías (SGR), con base en indicadores como el coeficiente de variación y de Gini. Como resultado, se encontró que las transferencias reducen las disparidades fiscales horizontales tanto en municipios como en departamentos, con un mayor efecto en los primeros. Por tipo de transferencia, los resultados son diferentes dado que el SGP reduce las disparidades, mientras que el SGR aumenta la desigualdad fiscal. ******ABSTRACT: In this paper, horizontal fiscal disparities in municipalities and departments of Colombia are estimated using data from the Budget Executions between 1985 and 2014. In addition, we evaluate the equalizing effect of the conditioned transfers from the General System of Participations (SGP) and the unconditioned transfers from the General System of Royalties (SGR) based on indicators such as the coefficient of variation and the Gini. As a result, we found that transfers reduce horizontal fiscal disparities in both municipalities and departments, with a greater effect in the first. By sort of transfer the results are different since the SGP reduce disparities while SGR increase fiscal inequality.
H73|Public Input Competition under Stackelberg Equilibrium: A Note| This paper examines the Stackelberg equilibrium for public input competition and compares it with the noncooperative Nash equilibrium. Given two asymmetric regions, we show that under the Nash equilibrium the more productive region tends to spend more on public input, which results in this region attracting more capital than the less productive region. The comparison of the two equilibria reveals that the leader region obtains a first-mover advantage under the Stackelberg setting. This suggests that if regions interact with each other sequentially as in the Stackelberg equilibrium, then the regional disparity that is due to the heterogeneity of productivity is likely to be mitigated or enlarged, depending on which region performs the leadership role in the competition process.
H73|Estimating The Rivalness Of State-Level Inward Fdi|" type=""main""> We develop a method for estimating the rivalness of tax bases using the structures of the conditional logit, Poisson, and nested logit models. As an illustration, we apply this method to estimate the effect of state-level capital taxation on U.S. inward foreign direct investment (FDI). The assumption of perfect nonrivalness can in some cases be rejected, but the assumption of perfect rivalness cannot. Competition over FDI across U.S. states could well be a zero-sum game."
H73|Spatial Administrative Structure And Intra-Metropolitan Tax Competition|" type=""main""> I investigate whether the spatial administrative structure of agglomerations is associated with local business tax rates in core cities of agglomerations. Using data for German municipalities, I define agglomerations based on distances and based on cumulative population densities. The results show that the population share of the core in its agglomeration is positively associated and the number of surrounding municipalities is negatively associated with the tax rate of the core. When municipalities consolidate, the core has the opportunity to increase the tax rate."
H73|Fiscal decentralization and regional disparities: The importance of good governance|In this paper we consider how government quality mediates the relationship between fiscal decentralization and regional disparities. Previous work has argued that fiscal decentralization has the potential to reduce income difference across regions but that this potential may not be realized because of governance problems associated with subnational authorities. Our empirical evidence based on a sample of 24 OECD countries over the period 1984 to 2006 lends a measure of support to this idea. We find that fiscal decentralization promotes regional convergence in high government quality settings but, worryingly, it leads to wider regional disparities in countries with poor governance. Because most poor countries are plagued with governance problems, this would caution against fiscal decentralization with a view to reducing regional disparities in these countries.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H73|Tax Competition and Economic Integration| This article examines the role of tax competition and economic integration in a core–periphery setting, where agglomeration forces are present. I present a New Economic Geography model, which accounts for firm entry/exit and international mobility of skilled labor employed in the public R&D sectors. In contrast to other literature on tax competition, I focus on its impact on labor migration and net earnings of skilled and unskilled labor. Economic integration is modeled as trade liberalization, an easing of factor mobility restrictions and technology diffusion. I find that tax competition favors skilled labor when trade costs are reduced. In contrast, unskilled labor benefits when factor mobility restrictions are eased and technology diffusion is enhanced.
H73|Limiting Profit Shifting in a Model with Heterogeneous Firm Productivity|This paper analyzes measures that limit firms’ profit shifting activities in a model that incorporates heterogeneous firm productivity and monopolistic competition. Such measures, e.g. thin capitalization rules, have become increasingly widespread as governments have reacted to growing profit shifting activities of multinational companies. However, besides limiting profit shifting, such rules entail costs. As the regulations can only focus on the means to shift profits, not on profit shifting itself, they impose costs on all firms, no matter whether these firms shift profits abroad or not. In the model, these costs force some firms to exit the market. Thus, as the resulting lower competition makes the remaining firms more profitable, regulations to limit profit shifting may even increase the aggregate amount of profits shifted abroad. From a welfare point of view, it can be optimal not to limit profit shifting by such rules.
H73|Reinventing the wheel: what we can learn from the Tax Reform Act of 1986|In 2010, when former Senate Finance Committee Chair Sen. Max Baucus was beginning his push toward tax reform, he held a hearing featuring veterans of the great tax reform of 1986.2 The main conclusion from this hearing was that Congress has changed too much since then to make a repeat of 1986 likely. We are now five years later, Sen. Baucus is the US Ambassador to China, and no tax reform appears likely in the immediate future, thus confirming what the veterans told the Chair in 2010. Nevertheless, I believe that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA 86) offers some useful lessons for the current tax reform effort, less on process (because of the aforementioned changes in Congress) but more on substance. Specifically, I think TRA 1986 is a useful model because: (a) It suggests that individual rates on ordinary income can be cut if the tax rate on capital gains is increased; (b) It suggests that overall revenue neutrality can be achieved by cutting taxes on individuals and increasing the effective tax rate on corporations (while reducing the nominal corporate rate); (c) It suggests that corporate/shareholder integration is unnecessary. This paper elaborates on these suggestions.
H73|Political centralization and government accountability|This paper explains why decentralization can undermine accountability and answers three questions: what determines if power should be centralized or decentralized when regions are heterogeneous? How many levels of government should there be? How should state borders be drawn? We develop a model of political agency in which voters differ in their ability to monitor rent-seeking politicians. We find that rent extraction is a decreasing and convex function of the share of informed voters, because voter information improves monitoring but also reduces the appeal of holding office. As a result, information heterogeneity pushes toward centralization to reduce rent extraction. Taste heterogeneity pulls instead toward decentralization to match local preferences. Our model thus implies that optimal borders should cluster by tastes but ensure diversity of information. We also find economies of scope in accountability that explain why multiplying government tiers harms efficiency. A single government in charge of many policies has better incentives than many special-purpose governments splitting its budget and responsibilities. Hence, a federal system is desirable only if information varies enough across regions.
H73|What makes cities more productive? Agglomeration economies and the role of urban governance: evidence from 5 OECD countries|This paper estimates agglomeration benefits across five OECD countries, and represents the first empirical analysis that combines evidence on agglomeration benefits and the productivity impact of metropolitan governance structures, while taking into account the potential sorting of individuals across cities. The comparability of results in a multi-country setting is supported through the use of a new internationally-harmonised definition of cities based on economic linkages rather than administrative boundaries. In line with the literature, the analysis confirms that city productivity increases with city size but finds that cities with fragmented governance structures tend to have lower levels of productivity. This effect is mitigated by the existence of a metropolitan governance body.
H73|Income Redistribution in Open Economies|I propose a model of income redistribution in an open-economy environment. The world consists of a finite number of countries whose governments seek to maximize the welfare of their low-skilled populations by taxing skilled workers’ labor income. While tax competition limits the extent to which redistribution is possible—as compared to the closed-economy outcome—when skilled people are internationally mobile, I argue that race to the bottom does not necessarily occur, even if the number of countries becomes arbitrarily large. The asymptotic sustainability of the welfare state crucially depends on the statistical properties of the probability distribution of skilled people’s location preferences.
H73|Taxing mobile capital and profits: The nordic welfare states|This paper discusses trends in capital taxation and the role of the corporate tax rate in a welfare state. It provides a summary of the tax competition literature with special application to capital taxation in small versus large countries. A main finding from this literature is that small countries set lower taxes on capital than large countries. In line with this prediction the paper shows that the Nordic countries undertook tax reforms in the 1990s, which lead to lower ratios of statutory corporate to wage taxes than in most OECD countries. The second part of the paper is devoted to tax base erosion by multinationals and how to combat it. Finally, the paper offers some concluding remarks on redistribution and the pressures of tax competition.
H73|Immobilizing corporate income shifting: Should it be safe to strip in the harbor?|Many subsidiaries can deduct interest payments on internal debt from their taxable income. By issuing internal debt from a tax haven, multinationals can shift income out of host countries through the interest rates they charge and the amount of internal debt they issue. We show that, from a welfare perspective, thin capitalization rules that restrict the amount of debt for which interest is tax deductible (safe harbor rules) are inferior to rules that limit the ratio of debt interest to pre-tax earnings (earnings stripping rules), even if a safe harbor rule is used in conjunction with an earnings stripping rule.
H73|Tax Competition with Heterogeneous Capital Mobility|An ongoing debate in the tax competition literature is the desirability for a system of countries, or regions, to restrict the preferential treatment of different forms of capital. A widespread belief is that without such restrictions, countries would aggressively compete for mobile capital, resulting in taxes that are far below their desirable level. We further investigate this question by departing from the bulk of the literature in three important ways. First, we assume that in addition of caring about tax revenue, countries also care about private sector income. Second, firms are distinguished by their country of origin. Finally, we consider both identical countries and countries that differ in size. We demonstrate how the relative desirability of the two tax regimes depends critically on country size differences and the distribution of moving costs. In some cases, preferential treatment is preferable. Large and small countries may also disagree about which regime is best.
H73|Steuerwettbewerb im Kleinen – Ein Blick auf den Fall Monheim|Im Jahr 2012 erfolgte die radikalste Gewerbesteuersenkung einer Kommune in Nordrhein-Westfalen seit Jahrzehnten: Die Stadt Monheim am Rhein reduzierte den Hebesatz der Gewerbesteuer um insgesamt mehr als ein Drittel. Dies brachte der Stadt den Vorwurf ein, den Steuerwettbewerb deutlich verschärft, Unternehmen aus der Umgebung abgeworben und hierdurch „Wirtschaftskannibalismus an den Nachbarstädten“ betrieben zu haben. In diesem Beitrag wird empirisch untersucht, ob und inwiefern die Hebesatzentscheidung Monheims tatsächlich Auswirkungen auf die Steuerpolitik anderer Gemeinden hatte – gegeben der geographische Distanz zur Stadt Monheim. Die vorgelegten Ergebnisse liefern dabei Hinweise, dass die extreme Hebesatzpolitik der Stadt Monheim am Rhein einen Einfluss auf die Hebesatzpolitik der anderen Gemeinden in Nordrhein-Westfalen gehabt haben könnte. Um diese Schlussfolgerung zu verifizieren, bedarf es jedoch weiterführender Analysen, die in weiteren Arbeiten erfolgen sollen.

H73|Gale-Nikaido-Debreu and Milgrom-Shannon: Market Interactions with Endogenous Community Structures|This paper examines a model of market interactions with a continuum of agents whose characteristics are distributed over the unidimensional interval. The society is endogenously partitioned into several communities, whose members are engaged in costly market interactions. The interaction or communication costs between every pair of agents depend on their identity and the size and composition of community to which they belong. By using the celebrated Gale-Nikaido-Debreu Lemma and invoking the Kantorovich continuity over agents' distributions, we prove that there exists a partition of the society into a given number of connected intervals which satisfies the Border Indifference Property (BIP). Namely, individuals on the border of each community are indifferent between joining either of the adjacent communities. We demonstrate that while BIP does not, in general, yield Nash equilibria, the equilibrium existence is erescued under the Milgrom-Shannon (1994) monotone comparative statics conditions.
H73|Fiscal Multipliers and Beyond|This paper seeks to link the debate surrounding short-term fiscal multipliers with the medium and longer-term impact of fiscal consolidation on public debt sustainability. A literature review and empirical findings for state-dependent multipliers confirm that there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the size of the short-term multiplier. Notably, multipliers may be larger in deep recessions or financial crises, but the negative impact of fiscal consolidation is mitigated when public finances are weak. Using a stylised framework and a range of plausible values for the fiscal multiplier, simulations suggest that an increase in the debt ratio following episodes of fiscal consolidation is likely to be short-lived. Even in a macroeconomic context in which multipliers are high, a frontloaded fiscal consolidation reduces the total consolidation effort and implies a faster stabilisation of the debt ratio. In general, backloading is subject to higher implementation risks, most notably in the light of political economy considerations. Overall, when determining the fiscal adjustment path, both the short-term costs and the longer-term benefits need to be taken into account. Particular attention should be paid to the composition of consolidation packages, with well-designed adjustments likely to imply a faster stabilisation of the debt ratio.
H73|The treatment-effect estimation: A case study of the 2008 economic stimulus package of China|Researchers often face the challenge of estimating the counterfactuals to evaluate the treatment effects. Hsiao et al. (2012) propose a method that offers more flexibilities by allowing the influence of the unobservable latent factors to vary cross-section. This paper relaxes the linear conditional mean assumption in their method by extending it to a semi-parametric setting. The asymptotic distribution properties of the average treatment effect estimator is derived and studied. The semi-parametric model and the Hsiao et al. (2012) are both applied to study the macroeconomic effect of the 2008 Chinese Economic Stimulus Program. The estimation results show the fiscal stimulus plan had raised the annual real GDP growth in China by about 3.2%, but only temporarily. These results are robust to linear setting, semiparametric setting, and various control group selections. The temporary boost in economic activities of the stimulus plan is also evident in the estimation of other economic indicators such as real investment, real consumption, real export, and real import.
H73|Cultural identity, mobility and decentralization|Regionalism and efforts to reinforce regional cultural identities are on the rise in Europe. Examples can be found in Spain, Belgium, Italy, Great Britain, and other countries. Regional governments may invest in cultural identity due to beneficial effects on social capital. However, this comes at the cost of cultural adaption costs for non-natives. We propose a simple model of regional culture investments in a federation to investigate such a trade-off. The model shows that uncoordinated cultural policies generally lead to oversupply of regional culture, and that richer regions face higher incentives to invest in regional culture. We conclude that only mild assumptions are necessary to make a strong case for regional cultural integration.
H73|Election cycles and electricity provision: Evidence from a quasi-experiment with Indian special elections|We present evidence from India showing that state governments induce electoral cycles in electricity service provision. Our data and research strategy allow us to build on models of political business cycles and targeted distribution in two important ways. First, we demonstrate that by manipulating the flow of critical inputs into economic activity like electricity, elected leaders can influence economic outcomes even in contexts where they have constrained fiscal capacity. Second, we identify the effect of elections on electricity provision by focusing on special elections held for exogenous reasons. Our results show that state governments induce substantive increases in electricity service to constituencies that hold special elections. Manipulation of the power supply is stronger in contested constituencies and during special elections held in states where the government commands only a small majority. Overall, we find no evidence of positive welfare effects from the electoral manipulation of electricity supply.
H73|Taxes in Cities|Most cities enjoy some autonomy over how they tax their residents, and that autonomy is typically exercised by multiple municipal governments within a given city. In this chapter, we document patterns of city-level taxation across countries, and we review the literature on a number of salient features affecting local tax setting in an urban context. In OECD countries, urban local governments on average raise some 10% of total tax revenue, and in non-OECD countries, they raise around half that share. We show that most cities are highly fragmented: urban areas with more than 500,000 inhabitants are divided into 74 local jurisdictions on average. The vast majority of these cities are characterized by a central municipality that strongly dominates the remaining jurisdictions in terms of population. These empirical regularities imply that analyses of urban taxation need to take account of three particular features: interdependence among tax-setting authorities (horizontally and vertically), jurisdictional size asymmetries, and the potential for agglomeration economies. We survey the relevant theoretical and empirical literatures, focusing in particular on models of asymmetric tax competition, of taxation and income sorting, and of taxation in the presence of agglomeration rents.
H73|Comparison of Nash and evolutionary stable equilibrium in asymmetric tax competition|We show that under suitable assumptions the evolutionary stable tax rate in asymmetric tax competition is strictly lower than all tax rates obtained in Nash equilibrium, generalizing in this way a recent result by Sano (Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review 9 (2012), S1–S23) and Wagener (International Economic Review 54 (2013), 1251–1264) obtained in the context of symmetric tax competition. Our assumptions are satisfied in several models of capital and commodity tax competition.
H73|Accountability and yardstick competition in the public provision of education|This paper explores the institutional change introduced by the public disclosure of an education development index (IDEB, Basic Education Development Index) in 2007 to identify the effect of education accountability on yardstick competition in educational spending among Brazilian municipalities. An exploratory analysis of the data shows a minor reduction (20%) in spatial interaction in public educational spending after IDEB disclosure—compared with the spatial correlation before disclosure of the index. Our main results explore a discontinuity around the cutoff of 30 students enrolled in the grade under assessment after IDEB disclosure. The estimates suggest that the spatial autocorrelation—and, thus, yardstick competition—is reduced by 52%. Falsification and robustness tests were performed and suggest that we can claim causality around small bandwidths of the cutoff. This finding suggests that the public release of information may decrease the importance of neighbors’ information on voters’ decisions.
H73|From urban core to wealthy towns: nonschool fiscal disparities across Connecticut municipalities|Fiscal disparities occur when economic resources and public service needs are unevenly distributed across localities. There are two equity concerns associated with fiscal disparities. First, as Yinger (1986) shows, it is not considered fair to require two otherwise-identical households to pay a different amount of taxes for the same level of public services simply because they live in different towns. Second, fiscal disparities render some towns at a disadvantage in economic competition (Downes and Pogue 1992). These towns must impose a higher tax rate and/or provide a lower level of public services, making them less attractive to private businesses and residents. Using a cost-capacity gap framework and a newly assembled dataset of local financial records, this paper is the first study to quantify nonschool fiscal disparities across Connecticut municipalities. Municipal gap is defined as the difference between municipal cost and municipal capacity. A positive gap indicates greater need (measured by the cost to fund the common nonschool services) than capacity, while a negative gap indicates more capacity than need.
H73|Regional inequalities, fiscal decentralization and government quality: empirical evidence from simultaneous equations|There are theoretical arguments supporting the view that regional income inequalities, the degree of fiscal decentralization and the quality of government are simultaneously determined. To the extent that previous work has considered feedback effects between them, it has done so through instrumental variable estimates based on instruments whose validity can be questioned. Moreover, most existing work has estimated the relationship between any two of these variables in the absence of the third. Our empirical evidence, drawn from a sample of 23 OECD countries and based on a simultaneous equation model which accounts for the joint determination of these three variables, suggests that a process of fiscal decentralization, accompanied by measures to improve the quality of government, would be an effective strategy for reducing regional inequalities.
H73|Can pay‐for‐performance to primary care providers stimulate appropriate use of antibiotics?|Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health worldwide. As the healthcare sector's use of antibiotics is an important contributor to the development of resistance, it is crucial that physicians only prescribe antibiotics when needed and that they choose narrow‐spectrum antibiotics, which act on fewer bacteria types, when possible. Inappropriate use of antibiotics is nonetheless widespread, not least for respiratory tract infections (RTI), a common reason for antibiotics prescriptions. We examine if pay‐for‐performance (P4P) presents a way to influence primary care physicians' choice of antibiotics. During 2006–2013, 8 Swedish healthcare authorities adopted P4P to make physicians select narrow‐spectrum antibiotics more often in the treatment of children with RTI. Exploiting register data on all purchases of RTI antibiotics in a difference‐in‐differences analysis, we find that P4P significantly increased the share of narrow‐spectrum antibiotics. There are no signs that physicians gamed the system by issuing more prescriptions overall.

Finally, the paper offers some concluding remarks on redistribution and the pressures of tax competition.
H73|Where is a Teacher Happy in Russia? Indicators of Teachers’ Salaries|This article considers the uneven positions of school teachers in different regions of the Russian Federation. There exist numerous research works on the relation of school teachers’ salaries to the characteristics of regional educational systems and regional economies. A range of indicators is used to calculate school teachers’ salaries. It is necessary to consider the ratio of the teachers’ salary to the average salary in the region, the latter serving as a target indicator in government programs, in combination with other indicators, such as the ratio of the salary to the price of a fixed set of goods and services and the ratio of the teachers’ salary fund to total regional government expenditures. Research based on cluster data analysis statistical methods allowed the author to distinguish four types of regions. We used official data provided by Russian Federal State Statistics Service and the Russian Federal Treasury. The recommendations developed for each cluster of regions seek to improve the efficiency of the steps aimed at the implementation of the educational policy tasks through differentiating the support measures by the federal government.
H73|Key Enabling Technologies and Smart Specialization Strategies. European Regional Evidence from patent data|The paper aims at investigating whether Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) can have a role in facilitating regional Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3). Drawing on the economic geography approach to S3, we formulate some hypotheses about the impact that KETs-related knowledge can have on the construction of new regional technological advantages (RTAs). By crossing regional data on patent applications, in KETs-mapped classes of the International Patent Classification (IPC), with a number of regional economic indicators, we test these hypotheses on a panel of 26 European countries over the period 1980-2010. KETs show a positive impact on the construction of new RTAs, pointing to a new “enabling” role for them. KETs also exert a negative moderating role on the RTAs impact of the density of related pre-existing technologies, pointing to the KETs capacity of making the latter less binding in pursuing S3. Overall, the net-impact of KETs is positive, pointing to a new case for plugging KETs in the S3 policy tool-box.
H73|Urban sprawl and regional growth: first empirical evidence from Italian Regions|There are many factors inducing to think that urban sprawl can affect economic growth trough its negative effects on a number of relevant aspects of the economic activity. The negative effect may be due either by the increase in infrastructure's cost of provision within the national area and the reduction in productivity of farmland or by the increase in distortionary local taxes or subsidies. Furthermore, urbanization of remote rural area may also have important negative effects on public health. Using Italian regional data, this paper provides empirical evidence of the negative impact of urban sprawl on economic growth. The results suggest that reducing urban sprawl may leads to an increase in economic growth and that planning policies aimed to this intent are strongly recommended for Italy.
H73|State and Local Sales Taxes and Business Activity in the United States|There has been an increasing reliance on sales taxation in both the states and counties in the United States. In this paper, we are examining the relationship between state and local sales taxation and business activity in the U.S. by utilizing county-level data for the period 2002-2011. We have found significant negative association between the state and county combined sales tax rate and annual payroll of businesses particularly in the manufacturing sector. There is also evidence of spatial dependence particularly in the payroll response of businesses within the contiguous region. While we found no significant relationship with employment, there is also statistically significant negative association with retail establishments and small establishments with less than 10 employees. It is possible that businesses respond to a sales tax rate increase first, or more directly, by reducing payroll rather than employment. While the economic significance of these results, however, is not found to be overwhelmingly strong, policymakers should still pay attention particularly to how manufacturing businesses respond to sales tax rate tax changes in the form of changes in payroll, and the responses from the small retail establishments.
H73|The importance of the political process on corporate tax policy|Few would argue that the difficulty in making legislative changes influences policy decisions and often results in less timely and responsive legislation. Despite this, economic research on corporate tax policy often excludes consideration of the political process. This study examines the impact of the political and economic factors on several measures of corporate tax rates and tax incentives offered across 19 developed countries. Our results indicate that while economic conditions influence the rate of tax set by governments, the political process of the federal government also has a significant impact on the economic stimulus given. The impact of the political process on the ability to enact legislation is significant after controlling for economic factors indicating that in a global economy, it will become increasingly important for governments to find opportunities to work within their systems to enact legislation that attracts foreign direct investment and increases domestic growth.

H73|A race beyond the bottom: the nature of bidding for a firm|We examine how the bidding environment may affect the outcome of tax competition between two countries (or two regions) in attracting a firm’s foreign direct investment (FDI). We compare the equilibrium location choice and payoffs from an English auction, with both complete and incomplete information, relative to those in the traditional setting of a sealed-bid first-price auction. We find that an English auction leads to more aggressive bidding in “race beyond the bottom,” where the nations may bid beyond their own valuations of the FDI. We also discuss the roles of auction protocol and information asymmetry on the auction outcome. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
H73|A political economy of tax havens|The welfare effect of the existence of tax havens on high-tax countries has not been conclusive in the theoretical literature. Some papers show that the existence of tax havens is harmful to high-tax countries, while other studies argue that the opposite could occur. We aim to address a question: Do these welfare-reducing or welfare-enhancing properties still hold in the presence of lobbying? We find that the welfare-enhancing property does not hold, provided that the policy-maker attaches a sufficiently large weight to the political contribution received. Moreover, we point out that the cooperation among high-tax countries in restricting the international tax planning activity can lead to a lower level of social welfare in all high-tax countries.

H73|State funeral regulations: inside the black box|This study estimates the effects of state regulations affecting funeral markets. It accounts for multiple major categories of regulations and demand inducement as well as direct price effects. While concurring with prior studies that find ready-to-embalm regulations increase funeral costs and decrease the percentage of cremations, this study finds that several other state regulations are associated with significantly higher receipts per death. The regulation with the largest apparent effect on average funeral costs is the direct disposition license, which is associated with a $1250 reduction in receipts per death. Restrictive regulations affect the revenues of funeral homes and services to a much greater extent than they affect the revenues of cemeteries and crematories, and in some cases the regulations even increase funeral homes and services’ share of industry revenues. Thus, it appears that funeral homes receive most of the benefits of regulation. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
H73|International evidence of nexus between positive operating cash activities and cost of debt|This paper identifies the affiliation between the ending cash balance of the operating section in the cash flow statement and the bonds ratings. Our sample includes 600 companies from 26 countries. The study was conducted over a period of 18 years. An Ordered Probit regression analysis had been applied to identify how the positive cash balance of the operating section in the cash flow statement shapes the probability of escalating the bonds ratings. We find burly proof that the positive operating cash balance considerably affects the bonds ratings. In other words, when a company is able to generate enough cash from its main operating activities, the likelihood of having higher bonds ratings raises; this entails a low cost of debt since higher bond ratings have been proven to lessen the companyâ€™s cost for raising funds (in the form of bonds). The results add more confirmation to the creditorsâ€™ rights shields and how it affects the cost of debt.
H73|Un cuarto de siglo de modelos de financiación autonómica. Análisis de los resultados distributivos del sistema/A Quarter Century of Models of Regional Financing in Spain. An Analysis of Distributional Results of the System|Este trabajo tiene como objetivo medir y evaluar el efecto redistributivo de las transferencias y la distribución de los recursos financieros entre las CC.AA. de régimen común para los distintos modelos de financiación autonómica, desde 1987 a 2010. Para el análisis utilizamos indicadores de desigualdad basados en índices de concentración, ya que los mismos nos permiten medir el efecto redistributivo, la progresividad y la reordenación con la misma tipología de indicadores. Los resultados ponen de manifiesto que el sistema ha evolucionado claramente hacia un menor efecto redistributivo de las transferencias en las CC.AA. del 151, que las CC.AA del 143 han convergido hacia los resultados distributivos de las CC.AA del 151 y que las transferencias han ido reduciendo su efecto sobre la progresividad y la reordenación. This paper aims to measure and evaluate the redistributive effect of transfers and distribution of financial resources between common regime Spanish Autonomous Communities (ACs) for different models of regional funding, from 1987 to 2010. The analysis relies on inequality indicators based on concentration indices, which allow to measure the redistributive effect, the progressivity and the reranking on the same type of indicators. Results show that (a) the system has clearly evolved towards less redistributive effect of the transfers in the ACs of art.151, (b) the ACs of Art.143 have converged towards the distributional outcomes of the ACs of Art.151, and (c) transfers' effect on progressivity and reranking has been diminishing along time.
H73|Does tax competition increase disparity among jurisdictions?|This paper investigates whether a less-developed economy can catch up with a more developed one when they compete for foreign direct investments. The main message of the paper is that jurisdictional competition can enable the lagging country to catch up if capital mobility is sufficiently high and the productivity gap is not too large. Further, we show that size asymmetry reinforces (weakens) the productivity catch-up resulting from interjurisdictional competition when the lagging economy is small (large). Finally, we demonstrate that the development gap widens when capital becomes less mobile, which is at odds with previous findings
H73|A Normative Analysis of Impact Fees for Suburban Commercial Development|Using a circular city model to represent commercial development in a suburban setting, we present a normative analysis showing that complete reliance on impact fees is economically superior to any alternative relying on taxes levied on households. The reason is that impact fees allocate the cost of maintaining infrastructure services to those who benefit from the commercial development, whereas tax financing creates a fiscal externality wherein part of the cost of a commercial development is borne by households other than those who benefit, leading to inefficient over entry.
H73|Endogenous Timing in Tax and Public-Investment Competition|This study analyzes an endogenous order of moves in an interregional competition for mobile capital, where countries choose their tax or subsidy rate and public-investment levels. In equilibrium, countries set tax or subsidy rates simultaneously, but choose their public-investment levels sequentially. In addition, on comparing the welfare between the simultaneous-move and sequential-move outcomes, we find that (i) the sequential-move welfare levels are always larger, and (ii) the regional disparity in the sequential-move outcome is larger (smaller) than that in the simultaneous-move outcome if the capital-exporting (-importing) country leads in public investment.
H73|State Taxation and the Reallocation of Business Activity: Evidence from Establishment-Level Data|In a sample of over 27 million establishments of U.S. firms with activities in more than one state, we estimate the impact of state business taxation on business activity. Only firms organized as subchapter C corporations are subject to the corporate tax code, whereas the income of partnerships, sole-proprietorships, and S corporations is passed through annually to the firm's owners and taxed at individual rates. For C corporations, both employment at existing establishments (intensive margin) and the number of establishments in the state (extensive margin) have corporate tax elasticities of -0.4. Pass-through entities, which serve as a control group for the corporate tax reforms, respond only to the personal tax code, with tax elasticities of -0.2 to -0.3. Around half of the effects are driven by reallocation of productive resources to other states where the treated firms have establishments. Capital shows similar patterns but is 36% less elastic than labor. A narrative approach confirms that the results are robust and strongest in the sample of tax changes that were implemented due to inherited budget deficits, long-run goals, or cross-state variation caused by Federal tax reforms.
H73|Measuring Institutions in?Russian Regions: Methodology, Sources of Data, Analysis|The paper explores various measures of institutional quality in Russian regions, and compares those measures to each other. Such analysis leads to the conclusion that Russian regional institutions are essentially multidimensional, and therefore comparisons of Russian regions in terms of their overall institutional quality could be problematic. New institutional indexes are derived from Russian enterprise surveys held under the BEEPS project of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. Such indexes yield a typology of Russian regions in terms of efficacy of regional administrations’ control over economy and bureaucracy in their regions. Dynamics of regional institutional indexes is investigated against the backdrop of Russia-wide institutional trends.
