P50|Dynamic Determinants of Access to Weapons: Global Evidence|This study investigates the determinants of and persistence in access to weapons using a global sample of 163 countries for the period 2010 to 2015. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments (GMM). Hysteresis in access to weapons is consistently more apparent in countries with below-median levels in access to weapons, compared to their counterparts with above-median levels in access to weapons. The hysteresis hypothesis within this context is the propensity of past values of access to weapons to influence future values of access to weapons. Factors that consistently drive access to weapons are: perceptions of crime; criminality; conflict intensity; political instability; military expenditure, violent demonstrations and terrorism. The effects of these drivers are contingent on initial levels of access to weapons. Policy recommendations for managing access to weapons are discussed.

P50|How Did EU Membership of Eastern Europe Affect Student Achievement?|The accession of Eastern European countries to the European Union increased family wealth and the returns to schooling. I analyze the change in student achievement due to the EU accession of Eastern Europe building on a panel of six PISA waves covering more than 1 million students in 32 countries. Using a difference-in-differences approach I find a positive and statistically significant link of EU membership to reading scores by one decile of a standard deviation. Mediation analysis suggests school efficiency, family wealth, and family structure as key transmitters of EU membership to student achievement.
P50|The Right to Life: Global Evidence on the Role of Security Officers and the Police in Modulating the Effect of Insecurity on Homicide|Abstract The study investigates the role of security officers and the police in dampening the effect of insecurity on homicides. Insecurity dynamics are measured in terms of access to weapons, violent crime, perception of criminality and political instability. The geographical and temporal scopes are respectively 163 countries and 2010–2015. The empirical evidence is based on negative binomial regressions. Three main findings are established. First, security officers and the police significantly lessen the effect of political instability and perception of criminality on homicides. Second, an extended analysis with thresholds suggest that a maximum deployment of security officers and the police is required in order to completely cancel out the impact of both insecurity dynamics on homicides. The concept of threshold represents the critical mass at which the negative conditional effect from the interaction between security officers and the police completely dampens the effect of insecurity dynamics on homicides. Third, the use of security officers and the police is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the complete eradication of insecurity-related homicides. Policy implications are discussed.
P50|An Analysis of the Credit Behaviors of North Korean Defectors in South Korea (in Korean)|This paper examines the credit behaviors of North Korean defectors living in South Korea, using Korean credit bureau data. We construct individual-level panel data on North Korean defectors and South Korean residents sharing similar characteristics in terms of demographic and economic variables. The results of our panel analyses reveal a significantly higher number of delinquencies and defaults by North Korean defectors compared to the South Korean control group. Subsequent analysis of the credit management determinants also indicates significant differences between the two groups. While the number of delinquencies by North Korean defectors falls more rapidly than that in the control group as their credit histories lengthen, the number of defaults, which are long-term delinquencies, increases more rapidly. This implies that defectors' credit management capacities are improving as they accumulate financial experience, but that their resilience can be weaker in conditions of heavy debt. While the number of delinquencies in the control group does not differ by gender, the North Korean male defectors, who because of their long-term mandatory military service are expected to lack experience in informal economic activities compared to the female defectors, show a significantly higher number of delinquencies. These findings suggest that the lack of financial knowledge stemming from prolonged residence in a socialist society has a negative impact on defectorsâ€™ financial adaptation in South Korea. Therefore, in order to increase the degree of financial inclusion for North Korean defectors, additional support, such as financial education, should be considered.
P50|Shareholder protection, stock markets and cross-border mergers|This paper is the first one that uses a panel data of different types of shareholder protection in order to examine (i) the effect of such laws on stock market development and (ii) the convergence of shareholder protection laws through cross-border mergers and acquisitions. We find significant results for enabling laws but less so for paternalistic ones.
P50|Creative Differences? Measuring Creative Economy Employment in the US and UK Using Microdata|Using high-quality administrative microdata spanning 2011-2013, this paper develops new routines to compare creative economies using the creative trident framework, and applies them to the UK and US national and regional contexts. We find the UK creative economy is larger in workforce shares, and grows faster over the study period; the US' is absolutely larger, and is distributed more evenly across industries. Regional results are shaped by deeper differences in national urban systems. The paper highlights possibilities for widely varying national configurations of creative economies, considers potential mechanisms driving differentiation, and reflects on the usefulness of the creative trident approach.
P50|Demand regimes, financialisation and hysteresis. New Keynesian and post-Keynesian macroeconomic underpinnings of the Varieties of Capitalism|The recent integration of post-Keynesian insights into Comparative Political Economy is an exciting development. Post-Keynesian theory differs from neoclassical and Marxist theories in its analysis of the role of income distribution and of finance. It allows for wage-led demand regimes and it regards finance to be endogenously created and a source of instability. The paper contributes to the debate on the integration of demand regimes in the Varieties of Capitalism analyses. It contrasts post-Keynesian theory to the New Keynesian three equation model. It highlights that post-Keynesian theory gives prominence to the role of income distribution and allows for wage-led demand regimes; financial variables play a key role, which gives rise to endogenous instability and financial cycles (Minskyan debt cycles); economic growth is regarded as a path dependent process (with unemployment hysteresis due to wage norms) and is not anchored in a supply side equilibrium. However, PKE has so far mostly provided a normative analysis of government interventions. The ability to generate income and wealth rather than competitiveness is regarded as key criteria for a viable variety of capitalism.
P50|Varieties of Capitalism and post-Keynesian economics on Euro crisis|The 2008 global financial crisis that began in the US housing sector mutated into a sovereign debt crisis and an economic depression for countries in southern Europe, threatening the very existence of the Eurozone. The paper contrasts analyses of the eurocrisis based on the Varieties of Capitalism (VoC) approach and post-Keynesian analysis. The VoC analysis has argued that the eurocrisis is ultimately a crisis of incompatible institutional settings, in particular wage bargaining institutions, tied together in a monetary union. The Mediterranean Market Economies lack the institutional capacities to restrain wage growth. The Coordinated Market Economies (in northern Europe) have managed to maintain modest wage growth and inflation because export-oriented sectors play the role of wage leader. Post-Keynesian analysis has interpreted the crisis as the outcome of the unsustainable growth models and neoliberal policies in Europe; i.e. a neo-mercantilist export-led demand regime in the North and a debt-driven demand regime in the South and the EMU policies of financial deregulation that accompanied European economic integration. What is specific to the Euro area is the absence of adequate central fiscal stabilization or effective lender of last resort facility for the member countries. The ECB was hesitant in its unconventional monetary policy and began buying government bonds of countries under pressure only at a late stage of the crises. The imbalances resulted in a full blown sovereign debt crisis. We argue that the VoC analysis has important shortcomings as it focuses excessively on labour market institutions and that the post-Keynesian approach integrates financial factors and economic policy in explaining the crisis.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P50|Public expenditure management in Indonesia: Islamic economic review on state budget 2017|This paper discusses the management of public expenditures in Indonesia in State Budget 2017. The data collected from fiscal policy documents, especially about government spending plans in 2017, and then be reviewed by policy analysis, the theory of public expenditures, and the theory of public goods, and compared with the theory of public expenditure in Islamic economics. Public expenditure management in Indonesia has implemented a distribution system that divided public expenditure for central government expenditures, transfers to the regions, and the village fund. In terms of fiscal policy, public expenditure priorities to support the achievement of sustainable economic growth, job creation, poverty reduction, and the reduction of gaps in the welfare of the whole community. In Islamic economics, public expenditure is used to meet the needs of the community based on the principles of general interest derived from the shari'a. Public expenditure on Indonesia's government as an effective tool to divert economic resources and increase the income of society as a whole, and focused on the embodiment of the people's welfare
P50|Economic Systems and Economic Growth|In a planned economy, state monopoly ensures that economies of scale are exploited. However, state monopoly could not commit to reward its workers. Anticipating this, individuals will exert less effort. In a market economy, competition among firms ensures that higher effort from workers will be rewarded. However, competition means that economies of scale are not fully exploited. Per capita output growth is generated by continuous adoption of new technologies substituting labor for capital. Growth rate in a market economy is higher than that in a planned economy when the incentive to exert effort is relatively more important. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2011
P50|Liberalism, Islam and the idea of Mankind|Religious war and the separation of Church and state affairs in the global north contributed in the emergence and implementation of various ideologies. Instead of its positive impact these ideologies became a source of extreme violence and corruption across the planet. Liberalism, non-intervention in the socio-economic affairs of mankind is considered as an advanced state of mankind ideological evolution and End of History. In addition, it is believed that liberalism is free from internal contradiction and which can be settle by an alternate ideology. In sharp contrast, Muslims believes that beside other one of the unresolvable contradictions between liberalism and Islam is the gnosis of human being which the present study will undertake. Question to be explored that what concept of man has been held by economists (Liberals/Islamic) in their analysis of the behaviour of individual man, and to what extent they have universalized their concept of the individual to mankind?
P50|Liberalism, Islam and the idea of Mankind|After the defeat of Marxism and the triumph in the war in Iraq, pundit in the global north labelled neoliberalism as the End of History and last form of mankind ideological evolution. It is believed that neoliberalism successfully satisfied all the previous ideological contradiction. In contrast, Muslims believe that besides others one of the prominent and unresolvable contradictions between Neoliberalism and Islam is the gnosis of humanity which the present study will undertake. In this paper using the methodology of library research we will explore how the liberal and Islamic economists conceptualize man in their analysis of human behaviour and the degree to which the concept of man has been universalized.
P50|Comparative Economic Studies and Comparative Economics: Six Decades and Counting|Abstract This paper reviews the history of Comparative Economic Studies and the role that it has played in the development of the field of comparative economics. While we emphasize developments in the past 10 years when we served as co-editors, the development of the journal and of the field of comparative economics is placed in the context of the entire 60-year history of Comparative Economic Studies and of its predecessors.
P50|Persistence in Incarcerations: Global Comparative Evidence|Purpose - The purpose of this study is to assess how incarcerations persist across the world. The focus is on 163 countries for the period 2010 to 2015. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments. In order to increase room for policy implications, the dataset is decomposed into sub-samples based on income levels, religious domination, openness to the sea, regional proximity and legal origins. Findings - The following main findings are established. Incarcerations are more persistent in low income, Christian-protestant and Latin American countries while comparative evidence is not feasible on the basis of landlockedness and legal origins owing to unfavorable post-estimation diagnostic tests. Justifications for the comparative advantages and relevance of findings to theory-building in public economics are discussed. Practical implications - First, income levels matter in the persistence of incarcerations because low income nations vis-Ã -vis their high income counterparts, have less financial resources with which to prevent and deal with events like terrorism, political instability and violence that lead to incarcerations. Second, the intuition for religious domination builds on the fact that liberal societies can be more associated with incarcerations compared to conservative societies. The main theoretical contribution of this study to the literature is that we have built on empirical validity to provide theoretical justification as to why categorizing countries on the basis of selected fundamental characteristics determine cross-country variations in incarcerations. Such evidence is important for theory-building in public economics. Originality/value- It is important for policy makers to understand the persistence of incarcerations across nations because resources could be allocated to regions and countries, contingent on the relative importance of future incarceration tendencies.
P50|The Murder Epidemic: A Global Comparative Study|We build on literature from policy and academic circles to assess if Latin America is leading when it comes to persistence in homicides. The focus is on a global sample of 163 countries for the period 2010 to 2015. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments. The following main finding is established. The region with the highest evidence of persistence in homicides is sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), followed by Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and then by Europe & Central Asia (ECA). In order to increase room for policy implications, the dataset is decomposed into income levels, religious domination, landlockedness and legal origins. From the conditioning information set, the following factors account for persistence in global homicides: crime, political instability and weapons import positively affect homicides whereas the number of â€œsecurity and police officersâ€ has the opposite effect.

P50|Tax policy and economic growth: does it really matter?|Abstract We study the relationship between per capita GDP, overall tax revenue and tax composition. We find that there is some evidence of a negative and statistically significant relationship between tax revenue and economic growth, while there are no robust relationships between revenue-neutral tax shifts and economic growth. The results hold in different samples of OECD countries for different time periods. We also identify different relationships between the short run and long run. Overall, our results cast doubts on the potential growth enhancing effects of a shift from direct to indirect taxation, with paramount consequences on tax policy.
P50|Strategies and public propositions in games of institutional change: Comparative historical cases|This paper argues that the game-theoretic approach is incomplete for institutional studies, because comparative institutions as well as institutional changes involve the possibility of multiple equilibria. In order to solve the common knowledge problem, this paper proposes to unify game theoretic thought with an analysis of public representations/propositions to summarize salient features of the recursive/emergent states of play. From this perspective the paper tries to reconcile differences in three accounts of institutions: endogenous outcome, exogenous rules and constitutive rules accounts. Then, the unified approach is applied to comparative and historical cases of Tokugawa Japan and Qing China. Specifically it sheds new light into the coalitional nature of the Tokugawa Baku-Han regime nesting the fundamental Samurai-village pact as well as the tendency toward decentralization of political violence and fiscal competence to the provincial level toward the end of Qing China. From these new historical interpretations, endogenous strategic forces and associated public propositions leading to institutional changes through the Meiji Restoration and the Xinhai Revolution are identified and compared.
P50|Measurement of Validity of Corruption Indices|Corruption is an intrinsically latent phenomenon, which makes it a challenging task to measure it and requires the use of indirect indicators. The academic community and non-government organizations have proposed various indices that differ in terms of their methodology, data and coverage. In this paper, we estimate construct validity of the most widely used indices of corruption: The Corruption Perceptions Index, The Control of Corruption Index, The Bribing and Corruption Index, The Corruption Index, and The Rule of Law: Absence of Corruption. In this paper we show that Corruption Index by the International Country Risk Guide and Absence of Corruption Index are not constructively valid and, therefore, are not suitable for the use in scholarly research. We also show that all indices provide poor estimates of a corruption level in the highly corrupted group of countries
P50|Bank Capital, Liquidity Creation and Deposit Insurance|Abstract This paper examines how the introduction of deposit insurance influences the relationship between bank capital and liquidity creation. As discussed by Berger and Bouwman (Rev Financ Stud 22:3779–3837, 2009), there are two competing hypotheses on this relationship which can be influenced by the presence of deposit insurance. The introduction of a deposit insurance scheme in an emerging market, Russia, provides a natural experiment to empirically investigate this issue. We use the difference-in-difference approach on a large dataset of all Russian banks. Our findings suggest that the introduction of the deposit insurance scheme has different effects on the relationship between capital and bank liquidity creation across different types of banks. It is those banks characterized by relatively high household deposit ratios that are most affected by the introduction of deposit insurance program. For these banks, deposit insurance reduces the impact of capital on liquidity creation. These findings have important policy implications as they suggest that deposit insurance and capital requirements should not be considered separately by bank regulators.
P50|Social trust, workplace organization, and the comparative advantage of nations|In this paper, I consider a specific channel through which trust between parties to an exchange can go on to affect nations’ comparative advantage in certain industries. My approach revolves around the autonomy that employers (principals) grant to workers (agents), which is a key feature of workplace organization. I hypothesize that social trust generates a comparative advantage in industries with more autonomous micro production environments. I employ individual-level data on work autonomy to construct a measure of the extent to which industries are characterized by autonomy in the production process. Results of a cross-country cross-industry analysis confirm that countries with higher levels of social trust have a comparative advantage in high-autonomy industries and vice versa. Results are robust to the possibility of reverse causality. The paper’s key contribution is to provide a link between the microeconomic literature on workplace organization and the comparative macroeconomic literature on social trust.
P50|Is there a Link between Profit Share Rate of Participation Banks and Interest Rate?[:] The Case of Turkey|Today, the sensitive side of national economies is financial sector. The main reason for this sensitivity is financial crises. This situation has increased the demand and orientation for Islamic finance as a substitute for the modern financial system. The Islamic finance is discussed as a real solution to financial crises because the Islamic finance methods and applications depend on real economic activities. Both this case and the distance that is taken by Muslim countries in recent years has increased the share of Islamic banking/finance in the world. Thus, it has been a long debate in Islamic finance literature to investigate the presence of dependency between profit share rate settled by participation banks and deposit interest rate offered in conventional banking. In this study, variables that affect profit share rate of participation banks and deposit interest rate of conventional banks are examined over the period between January 2006 and May 2015 in Turkey. OLS method is constructed and empirical results are pointed out that interest rate on government security and foreign exchange rate are significantly effective on participation banks’ profit share rate. In addition, the profitability of conventional banks, government security, and foreign exchange rate are significantly effective on deposit interest rate settled by conventional banks. The main reason for this link between conventional interest rate and profit share rate arises with the domiance of murabahah, simple buy and sell with term sale transactions, at Islamic financial institutions. The interest rate is a benchmark for participation banks to determine the profit share rate. To get rid of this dependency, Islamic financial institutions may tend towards mudarabah transactions.

P50|Law, Politics and the Quality of Government in Africa|This paper examines interconnections between law, politics and the quality of government in Africa. We investigate whether African democracies enjoy relatively better government quality compared to their counterparts with more autocratic inclinations. The empirical evidence is based on Instrumental variable Two-Stage-Least Squares and Fixed Effects with data from 38 African countries for the period 1994-2010. Political regimes of democracy, polity and autocracy are instrumented with income-levels, legal-origins, religious-dominations and press-freedom to account for government quality dynamics, of corruption-control, government-effectiveness, voice and accountability, political-stability, regulation quality and the rule of law. Findings show that democracy has an edge over autocracy while the latter and polity overlap. As a policy implication, democracy once initiated should be accelerated to edge the appeals of authoritarian regimes.
P50|Bridging the Divide: Measuring Party System Change and Classifying Party Systems|Party systems research has proceeded along two parallel lines of inquiry, one predominantly “qualitative” and the other “quantitative.” This article attempts to bridge this divide in two ways. First, by showing that qualitative information can be valuable in the construction of quantitative measures. Second, by showing that the results from applying theoretically- sensitive measurement tools can be useful for qualitative classification. These analyses are performed using an original dataset of party system changes in Sub-Saharan Africa.
P50|Oligarchies And Development In A Global Economy: A Tale Of Two Elites|" type=""main"" xml:id=""ecin12284-abs-0001""> This paper studies how comparative advantage and the political elites' endowments shape long-run performance in economies with imperfect political institutions. The trade regime interacts with industrial policy and regulations on capital mobility in governing capital accumulation. In a capital-scarce economy, capitalist oligarchs striving for import substitution industrialization (ISI) initially shelter the economy from trade, while promoting industrial policies that promote total factor productivity growth in the manufacturing sector. This gradually shifts the comparative advantage toward manufacturing and renders the economy attractive to foreign investors. Allowing for trade and foreign capital inflows are thus complementary policies that spur growth in the capital oligarchy. By contrast, landed oligarchs in a capital-scarce economy favor openness to trade at an early stage of development, neglect industrial policies, and block foreign capital to maximize extractable rents. The policy mix causes the economy to stagnate. Consistent with the experiences of South Korea and Argentina in the postwar era, the model predicts that the success of ISI policies depends crucially on the conditions governing the incentives for capital accumulation.

P50|The Exchange Activity And Quantic Economics|"The work defines the concept of ""exchange activity"" as a constant equivalent of human activity and gives a brief insight in a possible social-economic system the single purpose of which is to enhance the quality of man forcing him to redefine himself - not by wealth but through the quality of his work. In this macroeconomic system work is no longer an option but the only way to ensure a living. The social level is given by the intelligence applied to work. Notions such as currency, usage value, profit, etc. disappear them being impossible subjective variables in a quantum based system which should verify at all times the wavy nature of the system they are part of. The work proposes a way to annul the discrimination of the work force."
P50|Teaching comparative economic systems 25 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union|Twenty-five years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, we reflect on contemporary teaching of undergraduate comparative economic systems (CES). Using qualitative and quantitative measures, we consider how the field responded to the collapse by examining CES textbooks from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. We also consider how the dissolution of the Soviet Union affected economics course offerings at the undergraduate level. Based on our findings, we suggest two strategies for reimagining CES for the 21st century by: (1) changing textbook organization and content, and (2) incorporating more comparative economic concepts throughout the undergraduate curriculum.
P50|Time-varying individual risk attitudes over the Great Recession: A comparison of Germany and Ukraine|We use the panel data of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and of the Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (ULMS) to investigate whether risk attitudes have primary (exogenous) determinants that are valid in different stages of economic development and in a different structural context, comparing a mature capitalist economy and a transition economy. We then analyze the stability of the risk measures over time. Between 2007 and 2012 we have the Great Recession, which had a mild impact in the German labor market while it had a more profound impact on the Ukrainian labor market. This enables us to investigate whether and how the crisis impacted on the risk attitudes in the two countries. By focusing on self-employment we also investigate whether the reduced willingness to take risks as a consequence of the Great Recession affects labor market dynamics and outcomes.
P50|The dynamics of revolutions|We study the dynamics of revolutions and mass protests. In a uni ed framework we explain three classes of observed revolutions, two of which are unexplained by earlier models: 1) a revolution initiated by extreme regime opponents dissenting greatly, later joined by moderate dissidents dissenting less; 2) a revolution initiated by moderates dissenting moderately, later joined by extremists; 3) a revolution where extreme regime opponents gradually push the freedom of speech, backed by increased dissent of mod- erates. These match the dynamics of many major revolutions, e.g., the Iranian Islamic Revolution, the fall of the USSR, the Egyptian Arab Spring and the Tiananmen-Square protests
P50|The evolution of law under communism and post-communism: a system-theory analysis in the spirit of Luhmann|The paper suggests that Luhmannâ€™s theory of social systems and evolution offers a powerful approach for analyzing law and the economy. It considers Yugoslavia and some Central European countries before and after 1990. Luhmannâ€™s concept of evolution stands in stark contrast to mainstream economic theory. It enables us to clarify the concept of transformation. A transformation became necessary because communism was an evolutionary dead end. According to this view, in postcommunism the primacy of functional differentiation needs to be reestablished because it was partially reversed under communist rule. In these circumstances, the popular call for â€œsufficientâ€ public control over the market is asking for the impossible. Post-communist law is bound to fall behind the evolution of markets. This causes economic problems and retards financial deepening.
P50|Religion, Economy, and State: Economic Thought of al-Mawardi in Adab al-Dunya wa-al-Din|The relation between religion, economy and the country became a major topic in the development of public welfare systems. Humans are political creatures that have the potential to realise the level of moral conscience to meet the needs of a better life, but humans as spiritual beings must have a balance between religious morality and economic morality. With economic ethics are supported by religious morality, the welfare system can be realised systemically if the state, communities and individuals can realise the six-dimensional form: religious observance, good governance, justice, national security, the prosperity of society and the nation's vision.
P50|The Impossibility of Democratic Socialism: Two Conceptions of Democracy|Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny (1994) have used Public Choice analysis to criticize market socialism. Peter J. Boettke (1995) and Peter T. Leeson and Boettke (2002) have argued that F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom (2007 [1944]) constituted a form of Public Choice analysis as well, in particular presaging an application of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem to democratic socialism. This essay demonstrates that additionally, Hayek's book adumbrated the distinction between liberal or limited democracy and illiberal or totalitarian democracy. This distinction between two conceptions of democracy provides another means of criticizing democratic socialism. The democratic political system and socialist economic system are fundamentally incompatible, making democratic socialism impossible, in the sense that democracy cannot fulfill for socialism what democratic socialists expect from it. Democratic socialism will fail, not because those in power will betray their trust or abuse their power, but because the fundamental institutional constraints of democracy are incompatible with socialist economics.

This essay shows that Hayek was joined by John Jewkes in presaging a form of the Arrow theorem. In addition, this essay expands on the analysis by Boettke and Leeson, elucidating the broader implications which the Arrow theorem has for democratic socialism in particular. Democratic socialism is demonstrated to be impossible, in the sense that it cannot successfully accomplish the goals of its advocates. This is because the Arrow theorem implies that democratic political institutions are fundamentally incompatible with socialist economics.
P50|Labor Economics in a Planned Economy: F. A. Hayek and John Jewkes on the Impossibility of Democratic Socialism|Milton Friedman (1962) is associated with the claim that political and economic freedom cannot be distinguished (cf. Lawson and Clark 2010), using the famous example that there can be no freedom of speech where the government owns the printing presses. Less well-known is F. A. Hayek's example, drawn from labor economics, used to illustrate the same principle. Hayek was joined in this by his less well-known colleague, John Jewkes. Hayek and Jewkes argued that without a freely operating price system, central economic planning cannot function without compulsory regimentation of labor. Similarly, no state may simultaneously fix “fair” wages and demand a given pattern of productive output and employment. It is impossible to both achieve income equality and accomplish an economic plan. Hayek's and Jewkes's examples help explain why democratic socialism is impossible, in the sense that it cannot accomplish what its advocates desire.
P50|The Foreign Policy of a Democratic Socialist Regime: From Intervention to Protection to Warfare|Discussions of democratic socialism have focused on whether that system is compatible with domestic civil liberties. Less attention has been paid to its foreign policy implications. Despite the widespread acceptance of the democratic peace hypothesis, democratic socialism would be incompatible with peaceful foreign relations. Economic intervention and economic planning – even democratic – cannot be successful without insulating the domestic economy from foreign competition. This implies economic nationalism and autarky. Moreover, democratic socialism is often justified by the notion that the democratic will of the people should be absolutely sovereign. Such a conception of democracy has no place for constitutional limits on power. Such an unlimited democracy would soon prove illiberal and liable to be captured by a demagogic authoritarian dictator, and this would only exacerbate the deleterious foreign policy consequences of economic nationalism. Democratic socialism is therefore incompatible with the cosmopolitan and humanitarian values of democratic socialists.
P50|The Freedom of the Prices: Hayek's Road to Serfdom Reassessed|Recent debate has centered around the contemporary relevance and even the original validity of F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom. Was it directed against command socialism only or against welfare-state interventionism as well? Should the book even be read anymore? This essay takes a step back from the dichotomy between socialism and interventionism and explores two specific ideas of Hayek's which deserve renewed attention: first, his claim that economic liberty is the fundamental liberty and that political liberty is merely secondary in value. Second, Hayek's conception of the rule-of-law, which has implications for contemporary command-and-control regulation. Furthermore, that Hayek's philosophical conception of the rule-of-law in the Road to Serfdom is related to his economic theory of prices in “The Use of Knowledge in Society.” While Hayek's specific target in the Road to Serfdom was command socialism, his book embodied arguments which are more widely applicable and relevant today.
P50|Understanding the Course of Social Reality|This book offers a comparison between our earthly society and the society of a hypothetical twin planet with the aim to understand and deal with some of the main problems of our global society, as well as to advance interaction with some extra-terrestrial society no less advanced than ours that sooner or later will be discovered. The underlying premise of the book is that the contemporary world finds itself in what may well be the most confused age of human history. Growing technological changes and innovation make it difficult to understand the course of social reality, while the intensification of the relations between different regions of the Earth and the power achieved by financial capital on a world scale amplify the dimensions and visibility of disequilibria and iniquities, and sharpen frustration and sentiments of insecurity. Social thought, as it has developed at the service of a quasi-stationary world, lacks the ability to understand and govern the tumultuous economic and social processes in progress. The most efficacious way to meet this fleeting social reality is to scientifically highlight basic institutions and values and their steady changes caused by the accumulation of creative and choice processes. In doing so, long-run trends can be explored in order to understand and manage the disequilibrating-reequilibrating motion characterizing the life of dynamic societies. This book shows the ‘necessity’ of institutional and ethical transformations utilizing a utopian flavour.
P50|Law, Politics and the Quality of Government in Africa|This paper examines interconnections between law, politics and the quality of government in Africa. We investigate whether African democracies enjoy relatively better government quality compared to their counterparts with more autocratic inclinations. The empirical evidence is based on Instrumental variable Two-Stage-Least Squares and Fixed Effects with data from 38 African countries for the period 1994-2010. Political regimes of democracy, polity and autocracy are instrumented with income-levels, legal-origins, religious-dominations and press-freedom to account for government quality dynamics, of corruption-control, government-effectiveness, voice and accountability, political-stability, regulation quality and the rule of law. Findings show that democracy has an edge over autocracy while the latter and polity overlap. As a policy implication, democracy once initiated should be accelerated to edge the appeals of authoritarian regimes.
P50|Integrating the Concepts of Global Freedom: Economics versus Society|The paper carries out a context specific debate on why the real sector of the economy is important to look into to establish a framework of effective development. While doing that the paper highlights that the economic policy in the real sector is to be complemented by intervening in the progress of the society by developing social, political and legal institutions. This paper presents a post Washington consensus intellectual debate that eventually made the Prelog for first Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) and now Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
P50|Optimality of Social Choice Systems: Complexity, Wisdom, and Wellbeing Centrality|Since circa 1900, civilization has experienced radical changes including changes in the size and distribution of populations, the power of technologies, the magnitude of energy and materials use, and the depth of scientific knowledge. With these have come increasingly complex challenges and elevated risks, and thus a heightened need for wise decision making. Accordingly, the need has grown for efficient and functional decision-making systems, also called social choice systems. I use these terms to refer to economic, governance, and legal systems. The seeming inability of societies, both individually and collectively, to effectively mitigate excessive climate change, poverty, income inequality, pollution, habitat loss, and other major problems suggests that underlying social choice systems are sub-optimal relative to need. I raise two overarching questions: (1) What characteristics would more optimal social choice systems exhibit? (2) How could research and development of more optimal systems best proceed? The answers I explore in this paper are based on the premise that the relative optimality of a social choice system is a measure of its relative capacity to help communities solve problems and organize activities such that collective wellbeing is elevated. The characteristics of complex adaptive systems, successful problem-solving systems found in nature, are explored in order to suggest useful design motifs and monitoring indicators. I emphasize the need for research and development of new social choice system designs, and argue that field testing of these can best occur at the local (e.g., community, city, or county) level. Efforts in this direction by the science and technology sectors and academic community are still nascent. The work described here suggests a new multidisciplinary program that I term wellbeing centrality: the design, testing, promotion, and operation of social choice systems that place wellbeing measurement, evaluation, forecasting, and deliberation at the center of decision-making activities.
P50|Sukuk: a potential for stability and development in the GCC|This paper explores the significance of Islamic Sukuk instruments for stability in the GCC. As a result of the financial crisis of 2007-2008, interest in financial stability has increased. Islamic scholars suggest that Islamic financial institutions and products have the potential to contribute in achieving a more stable economic environment. This paper analyses Sukuk, an Islamic financial instrument with both bond and equity traits; and how it can contribute to achieving a more sound and resilient economic environment in the GCC. Findings suggest that Sukuk do have the potential to effectively contribute to the GCC’s economic stability; as long as they adhere to the pure Islamic financial principles and avoid trying to be comparable to conventional bonds. Currently, however there appears a heavy reliance on shorter term issuances, along with the majority of issuances in the USD, a heavy reliance on real estate as both a means of financing an underlying collateral in Islamic securitization; elements which could be destabilising especially during destress. The originality of this paper lies in its empirical contribution, as it, for the first, time sets out systematically the characteristics of Sukuk issuance in the GCC region with respect to Sukuk maturity, issuance currency and sectoral distribution. It also assesses the various Sukuk structures and the underlying risks involved; as well as the impact of collateral in Islamic securitization.
P50|European Funds Fraud: The Impact on the Process of Absorption of Structural and Cohesion Funds in Romania|The increase of the degree of absorption of European funds offered to Romania by the European Union represents one of its main objectives in the present and future situation. One of the main reasons that the funds are so important is the fact that, taking into consideration the microeconomic and macroeconomic situation that Romania is in, it represents an alternative financing mechanism of the economy that Romania can benefit in very advantageous conditions. Even under these conditions Romania- within 2007-2013 period of programming – couldn’t benefit from it by attracting as many structural and cohesion funds as possible, at least in comparison to other member states. In our opinion, that of the authors’ one of the reasons that led to such a low rate of absorption, alongside with the low administrative capacity of the state is the excessive bureaucracy, an inefficient legislative framework which is not harmonized with the European one, the lack of experience in using and administrating of European funds, the beneficiaries’ incapacity to sustain the financial support of the project (to assure the co-financing of the project), a low involvement of Romanian banking institutions in the process of supporting the beneficiaries of European funds. Another cause is the European funds fraud that happened in Romania. In the present article, the authors have decided to analyze the influence of European funds fraud on the degree of absorption of structural and cohesion funds in Romania.

P50|Islamic conscious capitalism: a ‘Third Way’ in light of classical scripture|"The economic paradigm and framework advocated for in Islam is one that entails a unique combination of various socio–economic philosophies. This article advances the notion that Islam promotes a capitalistic economic model wrapped in its own garment of understanding—fashioned with threads of equity and stitched in patterns of benevolence and justice. This article examines the Islamic theological framework relating to the profit incentive and its spiritually–conscious methodology of capital procurement. The Qur’an contains around 370 references in regard to commerce, from which much of Islamic law relating to lending, banking and trading originates (Heck in Muhammad and the Arab roots of capitalism (Studien zur Geschichte und Kultur des Islamichen Orients)—Band 18. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, p 5, 85, 2006 ). This article intends to explore the potential that these teachings have for an Islamic ‘Third Way’ (i.e. an Islamic contribution to economic philosophy and discourse that is in-between of, or an alternative to, both the purely individualistic primary concerns on prices, profits, and private property inherent in ""pure"" capitalism, and the purely communal command economics of communism, which often negates or discourages the promotion of self-interests). Part I of this paper intends to introduce the reader to the various sources of Islamic ‘law’ and its scope. In doing so, the philosophical nature and objectives of the Shariah will become evident, through the exploration of specific theological economic teachings. Part II intends to study Islam’s theological attitude toward entrepreneurship and the profit incentive, as well as the concept of the potential for salvation through ethical profits. Part III explores, in light of classical Islamic scripture, the various prohibitions within the Islamic concept of the economy. In doing so, the paper shall explore how values and theories found in classical Islamic scripture have found contemporary application within the growing modern Islamic finance industry, for example, through Shariah ‘screens’ applied on market indicies, such as the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index. Part III shall also explore Islamic edicts with regards to business practices, as well as environmental ethics. In doing so, Part IV concludes that there can indeed be such an Islamic ‘Third Way’, drawn along similar shared values found amongst other world religions.

P50|Economic systems and risk preferences: evidence from East and West Germany|For standard economic models it is typically assumed that preferences are given and stable. But do economic systems shape individuals' risk preferences? Using the reunification of East and West Germany as a natural experiment I evaluate differences in financial risk taking comparing Eastern and Western German households for almost two decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Controlling for a large set of socio-economic variables East Germans having been ``treated'' by a command economy were more prone to taking financial risk than West German citizens. The differences were quantitatively relevant after the fall of the Iron Curtain and almost vanished by 2008.
P50|Marketing and Business Development between Idea, Scientific Discovery and Innovation|Starting from the emergence of the basic ideas, scientific development of them to successive innovations derived from, the paper develops around the way in which marketing science contributes to the business development. It is presented the vision of marketing from a historical perspective that characterized feudalism, communism, capitalism and knowledge based society. Based on documentary research is discussed the necessity of adopting innovations and the multidisciplinary nature of innovation as a process. European policies are presented for the development of innovation and regional development programs already implemented. The paper concludes by highlighting new facets of the innovation concept in economic theory, the legal framework for the marketing of innovative technologies and the limits of intellectual property rights of those who innovate.
P50|The Comparative African Regional Economics of Globalization in Financial Allocation Efficiency|The study assesses the role of globalization-fuelled regionalization policies on financial allocation efficiency in four economic and monetary regions in Africa for the period 1980 to 2008. Banking system and financial system efficiencies are used as dependent variables whereas seven bundled and unbundled globalization variables are employed as independent indicators. The bundling exercise is achieved by means of principal component analysis while the empirical evidence is based on interactive Fixed Effects regressions. The following findings are established. First, financial allocation efficiency is more sensitive to financial openness compared to trade openness and most sensitive to globalization. The relationship between allocation efficiency and globalization-fuelled regionalization policies is: (i) Kuznets or inverted U-shape in the UEMOA and CEMAC zones (evidence of decreasing returns to allocation efficiency from globalization-fuelled regionalization) and (ii) U-shape overwhelmingly in the COMESA and scantily in the EAC (increasing returns to allocation efficiency from globalization-fuelled regionalization). Established shapes are relevant to specific globalization dynamics within regions. ‘Economic and monetary’ regions are more prone to surplus liquidity than purely economic regions. Policy implications and measures of fighting surplus liquidity are discussed.
P50|Comparative Analysis Of The Number Of Sheep In Fyr And Some European Countries| Sheep farming in Serbia, from year to year, notices a descending course in number of sheep, as well as in production of milk and meat. The main objective of this paper is the analysis of the number of sheep in Serbia and the surrounding countries (FYR). By comparing the current state of the total number of sheep (in 2011) with the state in the former Yugoslavia, the result shown is that there are 66% less sheep in Serbia compared to the total number seen in 1967 (base year). Compared to the last census from 2012, there is an increased number of sheep in Serbia, compared to previous year (2011) by 18.4%. Other former Yugoslav republics (FYR) also have a decrease in the total number of sheep: in Bosnia and Herzegovina by 76.5%, in Montenegro by 64.3%, in Croatia by 41.3%, in Macedonia by 63.5% compared to 1967 (base year), except for Slovenia, which has an increase in the total number of sheep by 83,000 head of cattle. In paper is given overview of the number of sheep for some European countries and for some part of world, in purpose of comparison with sheep state in FYR.
P50|Labour Force Participation and Tax-Benefit Systems: A Cross-Country Comparative Perspective|This paper investigates the extent to which cross-country differences in aggregate participation rates can be explained by divergence in tax-benefit systems. We take the example of two countries, the Czech Republic and Hungary, which â€“ despite a lot of similarities â€“ differ markedly in labour force participation rates. We first replicate for Czech household-level data the labour supply estimation for Hungary presented in Benczur et al. (2014) and use the two perfectly comparable estimates to simulate how the aggregate participation rate would change in one country if the other country's tax and social welfare system were adopted. Our estimation results yield similar labour supply elasticities for both countries, suggesting that individual preferences are essentially identical. The simulation results show that about one-half of the total difference in the participation rates of the 15â€“74 years old population can be explained by differences in the tax-benefit systems. The highest response is obtained for married women or women of childbearing age. This is related to the more generous maternity benefit system in place in Hungary as compared to the Czech Republic.
P50|Labour market institutions, crisis and gender earnings gap in Eastern Europe|" type=""main"" xml:id=""ecot12072-abs-0001""> We study gender pay inequality in ten Central and Eastern EU countries before (2007) and during the economic crisis (2009) using quantile regression methods. The analysis reveals remarkable cross-country diversity in levels and patterns of the gender gap along the earnings distribution; for the majority of the countries the crisis is associated with declining male/female disparities. We address the role played by labour market institutions in shaping the observed gender pay gap levels and patterns. Labour market deregulation increases gender inequality at the middle and at the top of the pay distribution, but reduces disparities at the bottom. Higher union density and wage coordination reduce the pay gap, with stronger equalizing effects on better-paid jobs. The crisis seems to weaken the already poor role of institutions in the low-pay sector."
P50|Disappearing Paradigms in Shareholder Protection: Leximetric Evidence for 30 Countries, 1990-2013|Scholars frequently claim that path dependency of the law, the influence of the US model of corporate governance, and the role of legal origin and the stage of legal development are key for a comparative understanding of shareholder protection. This article, however, suggests that these paradigms of comparative company law gradually seem to disappear. The basis for our assessment is an original leximetric dataset that measures the development of shareholder protection for 30 countries over the last 24 years. Using tools of descriptive statistics, time series and cluster analysis, our main findings are that all legal origins have now in average about the same level of shareholder protection, that paternalistic tools have overtaken enabling tools of protection, and that after the global financial crisis this area has become a less frequent object of law reforms.
P50|Fondement historique de la qualité des institutions politiques : l’expérience parlementaire à l’indépendance|This paper proposes a new variable to explain contemporary democracy in Africa: parliamentary experience independence defined as the difference between the Parliament's date of birth and independence. In doing so, this study explores a potential transmission channel of the Acemoglu et al. (2001) thesis concerning the colonial origin of institutional quality. Taking into account this new variable leads to a negative relationship between the lack of parliamentary experience at the time of independence and the quality of democracy in a sample of 42 countries. By combining variables of the theory of modernity, historical, geographical and socio-cultural variables, we provides a robust evidence that the negative dynamic of the contemporary democracy in Africa is explained by the lack of parliamentary experience at the time of independence.
P50|Utilization Of An Agricultural Land As A Basic Capacity For Corn And Wheat Production In Serbia And Ex-Yu Countries|Analysis of collected data from 2011, in structure of used agricultural land in Serbia shows that dominated plough land and gardens and meadows and pastures, until in smaller percentage are orchards and vineyards. Almost the same relation is noticed in other republics of former Yugoslavia (meadow and pastures are the most prevalent view of using the agricultural land in Slovenia, Macedonia, B&H and Montenegro). Share of area under wheat notice smaller oscillation in all republics in the period 2008-2010, until yield per hectare is equalized for the same observed period. Share of area under corn in correlation with sown areas, for the period 2008-2012 is almost equalized for all republics. The average yield of corn per hectare records declining trend from 2008-2012, and it shows that by production Serbia is behind Slovenia and Croatia. Also, it was stated that world production of cereals grow in 2012 and in 2013, contributed by corn and wheat production in China, North America, European countries and former Soviet Union. Analysis of used land capacities is emphasized importance of land as a limited factor in production and base on that has given recommendation for alleviating problems in agriculture and food production. Conclusions are given based on calculation of percentages and their mutual comparisons for every country included in the research.
P50|Who Got What, Then And Now? A Fifty Year Overview From The Global Consumption And Income Project|Using newly comprehensive data and tools from the Global Consumption and Income Project or CGIP, covering most of the world and five decades, we present a portrait of the changing global distribution of consumption and income and discuss its implications for our understanding of inequality, poverty, inclusivity of growth and development, world economic welfare, and the emergence of a global ‘middle class’. We show how regional distributions of income and consumption have evolved very differently over time. We also undertake sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of various choices made in database construction and analysis. We find that levels of consumption and income have increased across the distribution, that the global distribution has become more relatively equal due to falling inter-country relative inequality, and that by some measures global poverty has declined greatly but by others it has hardly declined at all, even over the fifty years. The global middle class has grown markedly in certain countries but only slightly worldwide. Most of the marked changes have occurred after 1990. China’s rapid economic growth is by far the most important factor underlying almost all of them, notwithstanding sharply increasing inequalities within the country. Most improvements outside of China are associated with rapid developing country growth after 2000, and are of unknown durability. Country-experiences vary widely; there is for instance some evidence of ‘inequality convergence’ with previously more equal countries becoming less equal over time and the obverse. We provide support for previous findings (e.g. the replacement of the global ‘twin peaks’ by a unimodal distribution) but also arrive at some conclusions that overthrow old ‘stylized facts’ (e.g. that the Sub-Saharan African countries, and not Latin American ones, have the highest levels of inequality in the world, when measured using standardized surveys). The GCIP provides a resource for ongoing analysis, and forecasting, of developments in the world distribution.
P50|Banking Unconditionally: The Political Economy of Chinese Finance in Latin America|Globalization scholars have long-debated to what extent economic integration, and specifically, mobile private capital constrains national policymaking. With Western capital reeling from the 2008 financial crisis, state-owned capital made inroads globally. China, as the world's largest saver, expanded its cross-border lending, funneling almost US$300 billion to developing countries since the crisis. What are the implications for debtor governments' room to maneuver? I argue that China's rapid financial expansion globally has helped increase national-level policy flexibility by removing the budget constraint traditionally imposed by the IMF and global markets. Unlike their stringent borrower conditionality, Chinese investors tend not to impose onerous policy conditions. Given the recent emergence of Chinese financing, I employ a comparative case study analysis of two of China's largest debtors â€” Brazil and Venezuela â€” before and after the introduction of Chinese credit. I find that government budget deficits increase as Chinese state-to-state financing accounts for a larger share of total external public financing. These findings offer important new insights for the study of globalization, the Latin American left, and China-Latin American relations, by helping explain the structural conditions that enable nations to veer from Western governance models.

P50|International currency exposures, valuation effects and the global financial crisis|We examine the evolution of international currency exposures, with a particular focus on the 2002–12 period. During the run up to the global financial crisis, there was a widespread shift towards positive net foreign currency positions, such that relatively few countries exhibited the archetypal emerging-market “short foreign currency” position on the eve of the global financial crisis. During the crisis, the upheaval in currency markets generated substantial currency-generated valuation effects — much of which were not reversed. There is some evidence that the distribution of valuation effects was stabilizing in the sense of showing a negative covariation pattern with pre-crisis net foreign asset positions.

P50|Rounding the Corners of the Policy Trilemma: Sources of Monetary Policy Autonomy|A central result in international macroeconomics is that a government cannot simultaneously opt for open financial markets, fixed exchange rates, and monetary autonomy; rather, it is constrained to choosing no more than two of these three. This paper considers whether partial capital controls and limited exchange rate flexibility allow for full monetary policy autonomy. We find partial capital controls do not generally allow for greater monetary control than with open capital accounts, unless they are quite extensive, but a moderate amount of exchange rate flexibility does allow for some degree of monetary autonomy, especially in emerging and developing economies. (JEL E52, F32, F33)
P50|Firm Learning and Growth|We study the implications of introducing learning (Jovanovic, 1982) in a standard monopolistically competitive environment with firm productivity heterogeneity. Our setup predicts that firm growth rates decrease with age, holding size constant, and decrease with size, holding age constant, a fact that models focusing on idiosyncratic productivity shocks have difficulty matching. We characterize the planner's problem and show that relative quantities between any two firms are the same in both planner's allocation and the decentralized economy. As a result, any inefficiency is driven by a discrepancy in the firm entry and exit thresholds. We calibrate the model using Colombian plant-level data and demonstrate how policies directly affecting firm entry and exit can be welfare enhancing. In particular, age-dependent subsidies allow young firms to avoid early exit and thus benefit consumers through access to a larger number of varieties. (Copyright: Elsevier)
P50|Political Economy of Crony Capitalism: The Prospect and the Bane|The world over, capitalism had encroach the economy of nations turning governments against the people, employers against the workers all in the name of surplus values and profiteering motives. Although capitalism had made economies of nations to boom without much stress due to the fluid faces of its operations, nevertheless, it has more havocs than good. The review of most government policies has shifted to accommodate the growing bane of cronies of capitalism. This research shows the tactics employed by bourgeoisies in colliding with the government. What are the implications of these profiteering motives on the economy? The methodology adopted is the survey analysis of institutional data base. The theoretical framework of deprivation theory coupled with Marxian theory were used to x-tray the prospect and the bane of crony capitalism in the economy of polities.

P50|The Role Of The Level Of Development, Geographical Factors, And Culture For The Efficacy Of Economic Freedom|There are many studies focused on the role of economic freedom in creating conditions supportive for economic growth. Most of the recommendations in this area are based on the observations of the highly developed countries. But is it reasonable to generalize these findings to other countries, independently from their conditions? Contemporarily, the number of the research conducted for the countries outside the world's forefront is growing. Results are varied – some elements of economic freedom seem to be effective unconditionally, some of them bring different results. The aim of the paper is to examine the role of such factors as a stage of economic development, geographical location, and culture in the context of the efficacy of economic freedom. The study was conducted with usage of regression models for panel data and based on the indicators connected with economic freedom and economic growth.

P50|George Orwell and the Incoherence of Democratic Socialism|George Orwell's famous fictions, Animal Farm and Nineteen-Eighty Four were intended to advocate democratic socialism by portraying undemocratic forms of socialism as totalitarian. For Orwell, democracy was a political institution which would limit the abuse of power. But there are several problems with democratic socialism which ensure its failure. In Orwell's novel A Clergyman's Daughter, Orwell's views of economics and politics are inconsistent and conflicting in a way that ensures democratic socialism will not succeed on Orwell's terms. Democratic socialism in general is criticized according to F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom and John Jewkes's The New Ordeal by Planning, whose arguments differ crucially from those against market socialism by Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny. An economic analysis of the political institutions of democratic socialism shows that democratic socialism must necessarily fail for political (not economic) reasons even if nobody in authority has ill-intentions or abuses their power.

P50|Across the crises of modern capitalism|This essay provides a preliminary assessment of the transition from the 1929 crisis (and its solution) to the 2008 crisis. It points out how the modalities of the solution of the first crisis have paved the way for the recent crisis. The paper hangs the description and explanation of the whole process on a combination of the notions of business cycles and phases of development, a combination that allows the representation and explanation of the successive and various patterns of capitalism across the considered historical period. Thereafter we underline, mainly using the notion of functional imperatives, the important institutional transformations required in the passage from one type of capitalism to another, and the destabilizing effects that have resulted from the absence of those transformations in the wake of the emergence of conflictualconsumeristic capitalism and financial capitalism. On this analytical basis, we ground the widening of the recent crisis, showing a growing menace of long-term stagnation, contradictions and conflicts. Finally, the paper delineates some institutional reforms essential to overcoming the structural deficiencies inherited by conflictual-consumeristic capitalism and the dawning and no less damaging drawbacks that are being prepared by financial capitalism
P50|Sylos Labini su Marx: implicazioni per la politica economica (Sylos Labini on Marx: economic policy implications)|This article considers Sylos Labini’s works on Marx (Sylos Labini, 1991; 1994). It places the Italian economist’s assessment of Marx in the context of the former’s wider economic production (both previous and subsequent to the 1991 article) and the debate that followed his “Carlo Marx: è tempo di un bilancio”. Such article, written right after the fall of Berlin’s Wall, attempted at developing a fair assessment of Marx’s thought, seen as one of the most important Classical economists and, from many points of view, a precursor of Keynes. Sylos Labini criticised Marx’s political position and what Sylos perceived as his “unethical behaviour”. On the contrary, he held Marx the economist in great regard.
P50|An Overarching Model For The Micro And Macro Psychological And Social Sciences|This paper introduces the methodology to create a unified theory of the philosophical and social sciences in the behavioral-political-economic-demographic sequence. The two major ideological political-economic philosophies (Hume-Smith and Marx-Engels) are systematized into competing integrated three dimensional behavioral-political-economic models. The paper argues that Hume-Smith?s empathy-sympathy behavioral assumptions are a sufficient starting point to create the integrated causal model sought by Tooby and Cosmides. The author then shows that the prerequisite advances in psychology and demographic studies now exist to generate the universal economic theory sought by von Neumann-Morgenstern and the integrated behavioral-economic method of Gintis?a psychological (i.e., behavioral) socio-economic model. By updating Hume-Smith?s work with a modern understanding of psychology, as presented by Fromm and others, a new integrated societal model as postulated by Harsanyi can be created that intertwines the social and psychological sciences. The author argues that this fundamentally psychology-based model also can serve as a baseline equation for all social sciences as desired by Kant and Mach, as well as the ahistorical (psychological) philosophic model noted by Husserl, Heidegger, Tillich, and Strauss. The author concludes with a discussion of the necessary next steps to generating a detailed model that fuses these disciplines.
P50|The Nordic Model: Existence, Emergence and Sustainability|In a world where inequality is on the rise alongside an increase in income, it becomes of paramount interest for anyone to find a nation or a group of nations which manage to have well-performing economic and social indicators. This curiosity about finding a ?third? model led us to the Nordic Model.Our qualitative paper titled ?Establishing the existence of Nordic model and its sustainability? is aimed at documenting the present condition of the Model in the five countries that come under the purview of the Model: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. We begin with establishing the existence of the Model using certain social and economic indicators. We look at the various reasons, both historical and those unique to these countries, behind the emergence and success of the model. We discuss the major problems that these countries as a whole are facing with regard to continuing the existing system or improving it. We look at possible ways in which the countries could sustain the model.
P50|Breaking down the wall between nature and nurture: An exploration of gendered work preferences in East and West Germany|We study a possible nurture effect of political systems on the evolution of gender differences in work preferences by exploiting the 41-year division of Germany and its reunification in 1990 as a natural experiment. We investigate whether disparate political and social systems produced different gender gaps in preferences with respect to work and specific job attributes (high income, promotion opportunities) as, e.g., the higher female labour force participation in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) suggests. Based on the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS) in years 1991, 1998/2000 and 2010/2012, our analyses reveal substantial differences between East and West gender gaps in preferences for work directly after reunification and hardly any convergence over the following 20 years. Regarding job attributes, gender-specific preferences in 1991 do not differ between East and West regions. Until 2010, the gaps vanish in the East but remain stable, or even widen, in the West. Cohort analyses confirm that the effect is driven by respondents who lived their adolescence in separated Germany. Accordingly, our results provide strong evidence for the impact of nurture on preference formation, while age and length of exposure are important determinants of the extent of such impact.

P50|Land, Men, Taxation - An Application to Pre-Modern China and Europe: Erik Jones' European Miracle Revisited|Eric Jones has found that excessive taxes were detrimental for pre-modern China’s economic growth whereas moderate taxes were conducive for Europe’s economic growth. This paper provides a political-economic answer to the question why these two tax systems came about. Taxation is only feasible when men and land can be linked as a single bundle. Taxation of land is not feasible without men, and taxation of men is not feasible without land. A tax maximizing bureaucrat has to combine the two variables in such a way that tax revenues are maximized given the constraints of land and men in his country. China’s contiguous geography allows bureaucrats to establish an autocratic tax system whereas Europe’s split geography enforces a competitive tax system. Therefore often contiguous states reveal to be stable states whereas split states turn out to be unstable and prone to collapse.
P50|Le rôle des sociétés de capital-investissement dans la formation d’alliances dans une approche cognitive|(VF) Les coopérations inter-firmes, telles que les alliances, jouent un rôle important dans l’innovation,facteur de croissance économique des pays développés. Ces alliances sont particulièrement importantes pour le développement des PME, prépondérantes en Europe. Cet article a pour objectif d’analyser le rôle des sociétés de capital-investissement, qui constituent la plus importante source de financement des PME et de l’innovation, dans la formation d’alliances pour leurs participations. Des études préalables explorent ce rôle sur les marchés américain et italien dans une approche contractuelle, mettant en évidence le rôle du capital-investissement dans la réduction d’inefficiences permettant d’empêcher la formation d’alliances entre PME. Dans la présente étude, nous recourons à l’approche cognitive, nous permettant d’étudier le rôle de ces sociétés dans la création même d’opportunités de croissance. Ce rôle est étudié et confirmé au travers d’une étude de cas multiples, centrée sur huit exemples d’alliances formées en présence de quatre sociétés de capital-investissement françaises.
P50|Do island states have better institutions?|Since the end of World War II, the number of countries in the world has increased dramatically. Many of these newly independent countries are small both in terms of population and geography, and several are islands. The purpose of this paper is to explore the effects of island status and country size on institutional quality, and to determine if these institutional effects can explain the relatively strong economic performance of islands and small countries. I distinguish between political institutions (Democracy) and economic institutions (Rule of Law). One of the main findings of this paper is that the relationship between island status and institutional quality is significantly positive, and that these results are robust to the inclusion of a number of control variables. Further, I find that country size is negatively related to institutional quality, which is in keeping with previous results. These results provide further support for the hypothesis that institutions account for these countries’ relatively better economic performance.
P50|Indices, Institutions and Economic Growth: In Search of Reliable Indicators (recount)|The ratings of economic and political institutions are well-known and widely used in the Social Science literature. These ratings are heavily relied on Experts' evaluations with subjective ordinal ranking (i.g., from -10 to 10 points). Such evaluations can be occasionally driven by ideological considerations. Much worse – they are essentially incompatible with each other, and therefore inapplicable in a comparative study at some one specific point in time chosen for observation (i.e., for a cross-section analysis). In this paper we propose two new indicators of institutional quality for 154 countries. These indicators are constructed in a way that minimizes the subjectivity of the evaluations. Only the presence or absence of a particular institutional phenomenon is identified. This puts much less weight on possible bias and makes it easy to verify. We show that these indices predict economic growth at least not worse, than those commonly used. The indicators proposed, include information about institutions that has been accumulated over a period of approximately two centuries and our expert’s evaluations are less vulnerable to political bias and provide better compatibility of the estimations of various experts for various countries.
P50|How Democracy could foster Economic Growth: The Last 200 Years|In this paper we explore current understandings of the influence of political rights, among historical legacies, on economic development. We construct variables for selected political regimes for 1811-2010. We find significant association between individual rights and economic growth. We argue that current understanding of political regimes supportive of growth (Acemoglu, etc), should parse the concept of property rights to include the protection of the individual in their focus on private property rights protection, alone, respected in various forms of government, are insufficient; what matters is the security of individuals from arbitrary arrest, regardless of “type of regime”. Discretionary rights of rulers or democratic governments to arrest citizens undermines the protection of private property rights and other attributes classically given to democratic foundations of economic growth, for example, free press, freedom of the exercise of religious belief. We suggest, as a research agenda, that the power of the politically competitive system therefore comes from weakening discretionary authority over law enforcement
P50|The China Boom in Latin America: An End to Austerity|How does a shifting economic power balance between the United States and China affect the strategic choices of Latin American governments? During the last several decades, Latin America has often relied on a Western development model that aimed to attract global market capital. After excessive borrowing led to financial busts, however, many countries have sought to insulate themselves from market volatility. Rising terms of trade and a commodity boom, driven in part by China, helped buttress economic growth during much of the 2000s. But, what accounts for the growing variation in national policy approaches, ranging from ongoing market orthodoxy to heavy government intervention? I argue that governments that tap new Chinese income streams – both non-conditional lending and taxable commodity flows – have reduced their reliance on conditionality-linked Western financing, giving them more autonomy to use budget deficits to intervene in their economies. Employing a systematic comparative analysis of three Latin American countries – Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela – I find that Chinese non-conditional funding endows governments with greater budgetary discretion, making austerity less likely. These findings offer important new insights for the study of globalization, the Latin American left, and China-Latin American relations, by helping explain the structural conditions that enable nations to veer from Western governance models.
P50|The Political Economy of Sovereign Debt: Global Finance and Electoral Cycles|Political economy theory expects politicians to use budget deficits to engineer an election-timed boom, known as the political business cycle. We challenge and contextualize this view by incorporating the financial constraints faced by governments into an electoral framework. We argue theoretically that the extent of ownership dispersion among creditors has important effects for governments’ policy autonomy. Specifically, we contend that when highly indebted governments become more reliant on international bond markets – as opposed to traditional bank lending – politicians alter the way they respond to domestic constituents. In an econometric test of 16 Latin American countries from 1961 to 2011, we show that financial decentralization breeds austerity. More specifically, we find that politicians exhibit more fiscal discipline when they fund a greater share of their spending through decentralized bond markets. Furthermore, we find this disciplining effect to be particularly strong during election periods.
P50|Key Enabling Technologies, Technology Entrepreneurship and Smart Specialisation in Europe|"In this article we intend (1) to broadly introduce the smart specialisation policy within European context, which is strongly interrelated with the research and innovation strategies for smart specialisation (RIS3), and to critically evaluate its relationship with KETs; (2) to shed light on the manner in which the theoretical framework of smart specialisation policy reconnects the notion of entrepreneurship â€“ via technology entrepreneurship â€“ with the global economy and sets it in the middle of an analysis of the structural changes the latter is facing; and (3) to evaluate to what extent RIS3â€™s approach to KETs allows a more refined use of the notion of ""technological emergence""."
P50|Wealth transfer taxation: an empirical investigation|We present an empirical model of wealth transfer taxation in the revenue systems of the G7 countries—Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US—over the period from 1965 to 2009. Our model emphasizes the influences of population aging and of the stock of household wealth in an explanation of the past and likely future of this tax source. Simulations with the model using U.N. demographic projections and projections of household wealth suggest that even in France and Germany where reliance on wealth transfer taxation has been increasing for part of the period studied, wealth transfer taxes can be expected to wither away as population aging deepens over the next two decades. Our results indicate that recent tax designs that rely upon the taxation of wealth transfers to preserve equity in the face of declining taxation of capital incomes may be, in this respect, politically infeasible for the foreseeable future. We conclude by using the case of wealth transfer taxation to raise the general question of the extent to which the consistency of a proposed reform with expected political equilibria ought to play a role in the design of a normative policy blueprint.

P50|Tax Reforms in the EU Member States Since the Turn of the New Century: Selected Observations|The aim of this paper is to discuss certain critical aspects of the tax reform process that has been taking place in the EU MS since the beginning of the new century. Two separate periods may be identified here. The first -from 2000 to 2011- witnessed very few tax reforms: according to the EU Commission itself, tax reforms were episodic, sparse and generally of a limited nature, To check this hypothesis, the present paper analyzes tax trends during the period 2000-2011, both at aggregate EU level and by disaggregating such trends into those pertaining to each EU MS. In the wake of the great economic crisis, there has been a broader process of tax reform in almost all EU Member Countries, albeit characterized by a reluctance to accept the tax reforms that the European Commission has been recommending to certain specific countries for a number of years now. The final, concluding issue dealt with briefly in this paper, is that of the various obstacles to tax reforms, starting from a recent OECD study of the matter.
P50|Worker displacement in transition economies and in China|Continuous enterprise restructuring is needed for the transition and emerging market economies to become and remain competitive. However, the beneficial effects of restructuring in the medium run are accompanied by large worker displacement. The costs of displacement can be large and long-lasting for some workers and for the economy. To devise the right policy interventions, governments need to fully understand which workers are displaced and what costs they bear.
P50|Political institutions and income (re-)distribution: evidence from developed economies|We discuss the effect of formal political institutions (electoral systems, fiscal decentralization, presidential and parliamentary regimes) on the extent and direction of income (re-)distribution. Empirical evidence is presented for a large sample of 70 economies and a panel of 13 OECD countries between 1981 and 1998. The evidence indicates that presidential regimes are associated with a less equal distribution of disposable incomes, while electoral systems have no significant effects. Fiscal competition is associated with less income redistribution and a less equal distribution of disposable incomes, but also with a more equal primary income distribution. Our evidence also is in line with earlier empirical contributions that find a positive relationship between trade openness and equality in primary and disposable incomes, as well as the overall redistributive effort.

P50|Understanding the culture of markets: A reflection|This essay examines Virgil Storr’s ( 2013 ) Understanding the Culture of Markets, particularly the relationship between cultures and constitutions and the particulars of the ideal-typical ‘spirit’ of capitalism. Culture cannot be viewed as a constitution, I argue, because of fundamental differences between the two types of guidance to conduct, both for the actors within them and the researchers studying them. I also consider possibly conflicting interpretations of the idea of the animating spirit(s) of a market in the context of Storr’s example of the economic culture of the Bahamas.

P50|Study on the Influence of the Number of the ATMs and Population upon Bank Branch Evolution|The present work consists of two parts: the first part is a comparative analysis of the number of bank branches per 100,000 adults and of population and ATMs per 100,000 adults in Romania and other four EU countries (Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Poland), and the second part consists in an analysis of the correlation between the three indicators. Actually, we shall determine if there is a strong correlation between the influenced factor (the number of bank branches per 100,000 adults) and the other two influential factors (population and number of ATMs per 100,000 adults), and the intensity of this correlation. We shall present primary statistical data for all the indicators of the above mentioned countries.
P50|Changes in workplace situation and work values. Relations and dynamics within different employment regimes|Workplace situation as well as work values have apparently changed in the last decades. However, up to now we do not know how these changes are related. This article considers both, workplace situation and work values, together and analyses theoretically and empirically how different developments can either lead to match or mismatch between workplace situation and work values. It refers to the employment regime approach to analyse the potential influence of different institutional frameworks. Findings have revealed various change patterns where developments regarding different dimensions of work life follow different logics: If employment becomes less secure, job security becomes more important. With respect to other dimensions (income, career opportunities, interesting job, and independence at work), an adaptation can be observed. The existing employment regime theory helps little in explaining the dynamics between workplace situation and work values.
P50|Spatial-autoregressive model for the two groups of related regions (eastern and western parts of Russia)|The present study suggest a generalization of the spatial autoregressive model for the case when considered regions are split into two different groups, which have a mutual influence on each other. The weighing matrix in this model is split into four parts and four spatial coefficients are estimated. The proposed model is applied for the analysis of three macroeconomic indicators using the data for Russian regions, previously divided into western and eastern. Our analysis revealed: 1) a positive spatial correlation of the main macroeconomic indicators for the western regions, 2) both positive and negative externalities for the eastern regions and 3) the asymmetric influence of eastern and western regions on each other. Usually «impulses» from the western regions have a positive effect on the eastern regions, but the «impulses» from the eastern regions usually do not affect the western regions.
P50|Law, Finance and Investment: Does Legal Origin Matter in Africa?|This paper assesses if legal origin explains domestic, foreign, private and public investments through financial intermediary channels of depth, efficiency, activity and size. The findings show that legal origin matters in the finance-investment nexus, though its ability to explain aggregate investment dynamics only through financial intermediary channels is limited in the cases of private and public investments.

P50|Finance and Democracy in Africa|This paper focuses on how political regimes affect financial developments in Africa and the role of dominant religion, income levels and colonial legacies in this regard. The findings indicate that authoritarian regimes have a higher propensity to effect policies that favour the development of financial intermediary depth, activity and size. Democracy has important effects on the degree of competition for public offices but is less significant in influencing policies related to promoting financial development when compared with autocracies. Once democracy is initiated, it should be accelerated (to edge out the appeals of authoritarian regimes) to reap the benefits of level and time hypotheses in financial development.

P50|Die Bedeutung des Wettbewerbs in Wissenschaft und Hochschule|Wettbewerb ist in vielen gesellschaftlichen Bereichen wie Wirtschaft, Politik und Sport, aber auch in Wissenschaft und Hochschule wichtig. Wettbewerb hat positive Wirkungen auf die Leistungen und Auswahl der Wettbewerbsteilnehmer gemäß den geltenden Wettbewerbskriterien. Deshalb kommt es auf wissenschaftsadäquate Kriterien an, zumal die Alternativen zum Wettbewerb große Nachteile haben.
P50|Institutions, democracy and growth in the very long run|We tested the hypothesis of the political basis for economic rights and constructed our own variables of political regimes’ classification for the years 1820–2000. We found significant positive interdependencies between democracy indicators and economic growth. The protection of private property rights requires, first and foremost, due guarantees for personal immunity. Discretionary arrests and property seizures undermine any formal guarantees of private property, low taxation benefits, etc. Personal immunity should be defended even for “unpleasant” persons or for the possible political opponents of the country’s ruler.
P50|The Costs of Worker Displacement in Urban Labor Markets of China|This paper analyzes the costs of job loss in China, using unique new data from the Rural-to-Urban Migration in China (RUMIC) data set for the year 2009. We investigate conventional labor market outcomes upon displacement like the length of unemployment spells, hours worked and monthly earnings. We also analyze whether displaced workers are more likely to be in informal employment relationships or self-employed or less happy than their non-displaced counterparts. We also look at health and psychic costs as additional outcomes. Displaced migrant workers do not encounter losses in terms of longer unemployment spells or wage penalties, while urban displaced workers incur very large costs in terms of these two outcomes. These results point to segmented urban labor markets in China. All displaced workers have an increased likelihood of being informal, while only migrants among the displaced experience a lowered incidence of self-employment. Also, health costs and psychic costs can be linked to displacement although these costs are not prevalent in a uniform fashion. Stratification of the data by gender, level of development and ownership seems important as it shows substantial heterogeneity of the costs of job loss across these dimensions.
P50|What Does Politics Have to Do with Innovation? Economic Distribution and Innovation Policy in OECD Countries|Despite the fact that the distributional impact of innovation has been recognized in the social science literature, hardly any work has been done on the distributional politics of innovation policy. This study offers a first step in this direction as well as asking whether a government’s ideology affects innovation policy from a distributional viewpoint. The paper uses both qualitative case study method and a statistical analysis of government R&D outlays for social purposes in twenty-six countries. In terms of innovation policy, neo-corporatist interest group representation is linked to relatively equitable public R&D investment and left-oriented governments are more likely to invest in social innovation than their rightist counterparts. Nevertheless, governments rarely consider innovation policy in distributive terms. Despite the significant distributional implications of innovation, it remains depoliticized in policy making.
P50|Persistent effects of empires: Evidence from the partitions of Poland|We use spatial regression discontinuity analysis to test whether the historical partition of Poland among three empires--Russia, Austria‐Hungary, and Prussia--has a persistent effect on political outcomes in contemporary Poland and to examine the channels of this influence. We find that the main difference in voting across Polish territories attributed by many observers to the legacy of empires is driven by omitted variables. However, empires do have a significant causal effect. The lands that belonged to Prussia (compared with those that belonged to Russia) vote more for anticommunist (post‐Solidarity) parties. This difference is largely explained by the persistent effect of infrastructure built by Prussians at the time of industrialization. The former Austrian lands (compared with former Russian lands) votes more for religious conservatives and for liberals. The difference in the vote for religious conservatives is explained by persistent differences in church attendance driven by vastly different policies of the two empires toward the Catholic Church. Higher support for liberals on the Austrian side is partly explained by a persistent belief in democracy, which is a legacy of decentralized democratic governance of the Austrian empire.
P50|Can gender differences in the educational performance of 15-year old migrant pupils be explained by the gender equality in the countries of origin and destination?|We try to explain the differences between the performance (in both reading and math) of 8430 15-year-old daughters and 8526 15-year-old sons in 17 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development destination countries across Europe and Oceania with the PISA 2009 data from 45 origin countries or regions. In addition to the level of societal gender equality of the origin and destination countries (the gender empowerment measure, or GEM) we use macro indicators of the educational systems, economic development, and religions of the countries of origin. We find that migrant daughters from countries with higher levels of gender equality have higher reading scores than comparable migrant sons (but this is not the case for math scores). In addition, the higher the level of gender equality in the destination countries, the lower the reading and math scores of both the male and female migrants’ children in their destination countries. Further analyses suggest that the difference between the levels of gender equality, rather than the levels themselves, of the origin and destination countries explains more of the educational performance of both female and male migrant pupils. Our results also show that the low level of gender equality in Islamic origin countries is a sufficient explanation of the low educational performance of Islam male and female migrants’ pupils. Finally, migrants’ daughters seem to perform slightly better educationally than comparable migrants’ sons.
P50|Price, wage and employment response to shocks: evidence from the WDN survey|We analyse the relative intensity and character of price vs. cost and wage vs. employment firm-level adjustment to cost-push shocks in the European System of Central Banks Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) survey data set. The results document several statistically significant and theoretically sensible relationships: price increases are less likely when product market competition is more intense, and more likely when collective wage agreements or employment protection legislation constrain firm-level reactions. We discuss how changes of such structural and institutional features of firms and of their environment may underlie the evolution of macroeconomic adjustment mechanisms in Europe.
P50|Institutions, social capability, and economic growth|I discuss correlations between the historical growth of social capabilities and patterns of economic growth across world regions since the industrial revolution and especially in recent decades. Based on this analysis, I argue that the apparent relationship between institutions and economic growth results in part because better institutional performance goes hand in hand with more advanced social capabilities.
P50|Law and Finance After a Decade of Research|In the last dozen years, economists have produced a considerable body of research suggesting that the historical origin of a countryâ€™s laws is highly correlated with a broad range of its legal rules and regulations, as well as with economic outcomes. Much of this research has dealt with rules governing investor protection and their effects on financial markets. We summarize this evidence and attempt a unified interpretation. We also address several objections to the empirical claim that legal origins matter.
P50|Financial freedom and bank efficiency: Evidence from the European Union|This paper investigates the dynamics between the financial freedom counterparts of the economic freedom index drawn from the Heritage Foundation database and bank efficiency levels. We rely on a large sample of commercial banks operating in the 27 European Union member states over the 2000s. After estimating bank-specific efficiency scores using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), we develop a truncated regression model combined with bootstrapped confidence intervals to test our main hypotheses. Results suggest that the higher the degree of an economy’s financial freedom, the higher the benefits for banks in terms of cost advantages and overall efficiency. Our results also show that the effects of financial freedom on bank efficiency tend to be more pronounced in countries with freer political systems in which governments formulate and implement sound policies and higher quality governance.
P50|Europe and the logic of hierarchy|Building on the view that financial systems from contract and trading structures through regulation are artifacts of law and politics, this paper analyzes the fundamental reasons for the observed hierarchy in all financial systems. Why are financial systems hierarchical? The answer offered here is mutualization at scale: balance sheets with access to larger economic catchment areas impart liquidity discipline or elasticity on smaller balance sheets, thereby setting the terms on which the latter operate. Hierarchy then sets the logical limit to the constructive power of law viz. finance. Yet because hierarchy is an abstract, functional requirement, the concrete institutional form that expresses this function is indeterminate a priori. This openness is a key predicate of the constructive power of law and politics in finance, allowing us to conceptualize systems that are democratic even while they attend to the specific logic of financial systems. These themes are explored in the context of the European Economic and Monetary Union and its recent crisis.
P50|Does democracy affect taxation and government spending? Evidence from developing countries|Focusing on developing countries in three geographical areas (South-East Asia, Latin America and European Union), we explore the relation between political variables and tax revenue, public spending and their structure. We build a new dataset for the 1990–2005 period with fiscal, political and socio-economic variables. Since democracy is a complex and multidimensional concept, we measure it using two variables, the political strength of democratic institutions, and the protection of civil liberties. We perform three sets of estimates: (i) cross-country pooled OLS regressions with region fixed effects, (ii) country fixed effects regressions and (iii) region specific regressions with country fixed effects. While the first model delivers some significant correlations between political variables and tax items, when controlling for country fixed effects we find that tax revenue and tax composition are in general not significantly correlated with the strength of democratic institutions and the protection of civil liberties. The only exceptions are indirect, trade and property taxes. A similar result applies to public spending, with the exception of defense expenditure. Overall, our findings cast some doubt on the exact public policy channels through which political institutions affect economic development.
P50|The wage and non-wage costs of displacement in boom times: Evidence from Russia|This paper analyzes the costs of job loss over the years of a booming economy, 2003–2008, using unique data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey. In addition to analyzing standard labor market outcomes, such as forgone earnings, employment, hours worked and wage penalties, our unique data set allows us to investigate additional non-wage costs of displacement, in particular, fringe benefits, the propensity to have an informal employment relationship or a temporary contract. We find that displaced individuals face large foregone earnings following displacement, which are heterogeneous across education and ownership type of firm from which the worker separated. There is no evidence of wage penalties for re-employed displaced workers. However, we find an increased probability of working in informal or temporary jobs if previously displaced and a reduction in the number of benefits.
P50|Does a Protestant work ethic exist? Evidence from the well-being effect of unemployment|Evidence on Weber's original thesis on a Protestant work ethic is ambiguous and relies on questionable measures of work attitudes. We test the relation between Protestantism and work attitudes using a novel method, operationalizing work ethic as the effect of unemployment on individuals’ subjective well-being. Analyzing a sample of 150,000 individuals from 82 societies, we find strong support for a Protestant work ethic: unemployment hurts Protestants more and hurts more in Protestant societies. Whilst the results shed new light on the Protestant work ethic debate, the method has wider applicability in the analysis of attitudinal differences.
P50|Fighting consumer price inflation in Africa: What do dynamics in money, credit, efficiency and size tell us?|Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of policy options in financial dynamics (of money, credit, efficiency and size) on consumer prices. Soaring food prices have marked the geopolitical landscape of African countries in the past decade. Design/methodology/approach - The sample is limited to a panel of African countries for which inflation is non-stationary. VAR models from both error correction and Granger causality perspectives are applied. Analyses of dynamic shocks and responses are also covered and six batteries of robustness checks are applied, to ensure consistency in the results. Findings - First, it is found that there are significant long-run equilibriums between inflation and each financial dynamic. Second, when there is a disequilibrium, while only financial depth and financial size could be significantly used to exert deflationary pressures, inflation is significant in adjusting all financial dynamics. In other words, financial depth and financial size are more significant instruments in fighting inflation than financial efficiency and activity. Third, the financial intermediary dynamic of size appears to be more instrumental in exerting a deflationary tendency than financial intermediary depth. Fourth, the deflationary tendency from money supply is double that based on liquid liabilities. Practical implications - Monetary policy aimed at fighting inflation only based on bank deposits may not be very effective until other informal and semi-formal financial sectors are taken into account. It could be inferred that, tight monetary policy targeting the ability of banks to grant credit (in relation to central bank credits) is more effective in tackling consumer price inflation than that, targeting the ability of banks to receive deposits. In the same vein, adjusting the lending rate could be more effective than adjusting the deposit rate. The insignificance of financial allocation efficiency and financial activity as policy tools in the battle against inflation could be explained by the (well documented) surplus liquidity issues experienced by the African banking sector. Social implications - This paper helps in providing monetary policy options in the fight against soaring consumer prices. By keeping inflationary pressures on food prices in check, sustained campaigns involving strikes, demonstrations, marches, rallies and political crises that seriously disrupt economic performance could be mitigated. Originality/value - To the best of the author's knowlege, there is yet no study that assesses monetary policy options that could be relevant in addressing the dramatic surge in the price of consumer commodities.
P50|Freedom, Ratings and Economic Growth: In Search of Reliable Dependencies|Ratings evaluating the quality of institutions are widely known; they are generally used in academic and research literature. Among such ratings are some whose compilation procedure took decades to perfect. Dozens of assessments have been accumulated, pertaining to a large and growing list of countries. All these ratings use expert evaluations with country ranking. We suppose that such evaluations are essentially incompatible with each other, and therefore inapplicable in a comparative study at some one specific point in time chosen for observation (i.e., for a cross-section analysis). We propose a group of variables of our own, using evaluations of “political” institutions only to ascertain the presence or absence of a certain phenomenon (yes/no). Such a set of variables makes a cross-section analysis feasible. The countries' experience in Rule of Law Democracy and Limited Government (both are quite clearly defined in a formal manner) provides a long-term institutional development aggregate evaluation for cross-section analysis. We also propose a thoroughly simple rating based on combining the proposed variables with indices and indicators which have already become widely accepted, but taking this combination as part of a data panel. At the same time, using a panel regression makes it possible to mitigate the problem of poor compatibility of expert evaluations.
P50|Persistent effects of empires: Evidence from the partitions of Poland|We use spatial regression discontinuity analysis to test whether the historical partition of Poland among three empires—Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Prussia—has a persistent effect on political outcomes in contemporary Poland and to examine the channels of this influence. We find that the main difference in voting across Polish territories attributed by many observers to the legacy of empires is driven by omitted variables. However, empires do have a significant causal effect. The lands that belonged to Prussia (compared with those that belonged to Russia) vote more for anticommunist (post-Solidarity) parties. This difference is largely explained by the persistent effect of infrastructure built by Prussians at the time of industrialization. The former Austrian lands (compared with former Russian lands) votes more for religious conservatives and for liberals. The difference in the vote for religious conservatives is explained by persistent differences in church attendance driven by vastly different policies of the two empires toward the Catholic Church. Higher support for liberals on the Austrian side is partly explained by a persistent belief in democracy, which is a legacy of decentralized democratic governance of the Austrian empire.
P50|Institutions, ratings and economic growth: in search of reliable indicators|The ratings of political institutions are well-known and widely used in academic literature. These ratings are mostly based on expert evaluations. However, such evaluations can be subjective and occasionally driven by ideological considerations. In this paper we propose two new indicators of institutional quality for 154 countries. These indicators are constructed in a way that minimizes the subjectivity of the evaluations. Only the presence or absence of a particular institutional phenomenon is identified. This puts much less weight on possible bias and makes easy to verify. We show that these indices predict economic growth better than those commonly used, primarily because they include information about institutions that has been accumulated over a period of approximately two centuries
P50|The Costs of Worker Displacement in Urban Labor Markets of China|This paper analyzes the costs of job loss in China, using unique new data from the Rural-to-Urban Migration in China (RUMIC) data set for the year 2009. We investigate conventional labor market outcomes upon displacement like the length of unemployment spells, hours worked and monthly earnings. We also analyze whether displaced workers are more likely to be in informal employment relationships or selfemployed or less happy than their non-displaced counterparts. We also look at health and psychic costs as additional outcomes. Displaced migrant workers do not encounter losses in terms of longer unemployment spells or wage penalties, while urban displaced workers incur very large costs in terms of these two outcomes. These results point to segmented urban labor markets in China. All displaced workers have an increased likelihood of being informal, while only migrants among the displaced experience a lowered incidence of self-employment. Also, health costs and psychic costs can be linked to displacement although these costs are not prevalent in a uniform fashion. Stratification of the data by gender, level of development and ownership seems important as it shows substantial heterogeneity of the costs of job loss across these dimensions.
P50|The overlooked costs of the permanent war economy: A market process approach|How does the permanent war economy interact, and subsume, the private, non-military economy? Can the two remain at a distance while sharing resource pools? This paper argues that they cannot. Once the U.S. embarked upon the path of permanent war, starting with World War II, the result was a permanent war economy. The permanent war economy continuously draws resources into the military sector at the expense of the private economy, even in times of peace. We explore the overlooked costs of this process. The permanent war economy does not just transfer resources from the private economy, but also distorts and undermines the market process which is ultimately responsible for improvements in standards of living.

P50|Determinants of Ultimate Control of Large Firms in Transition Countries: Empirical Evidence|We identify the ultimate ownership structures of the 20 largest firms in 12 transition countries in 1996, and the subsequent patterns of ownership change over 1996-2008. Of the state-controlled companies in 1996 more than half are still in state hands in 2008. Better quality of governmental institutions, larger external but not domestic government debt, smaller company size, and higher company profitability increase the likelihood of privatization as well as the likelihood that the company ends up ultimately in foreign hands. We document that, after 20 years, control structure and institutional quality convergence on the West is still largely incomplete.
P50|Beyond the Usual Suspects: Rethinking the Mechanisms of Paradigm Shifts in Macroeconomic Policy|Economists and political economists emphasize the importance of exogenous shocks, international economic competition, policy conditionality and partisan politics as the main drivers of literature on economic policy change. This paper evaluates the explanatory robustness of these factors and stresses the importance of incorporating economic ideas as a fruitful new direction in research on this topic.
P50|Orthodoxy and the Extensive Social Division of Labour [Ortodoxia şi diviziunea socială extinsă a muncii]|The present paper tackles two broad theses. According to the first, in the Eastern Orthodox view wealth, riches, material prosperity and whatever these things presuppose (the extended division of labour, trade, money, profit oriented entrepreneurship etc.) are not evil or condemnable in themselves. According to the second, one cannot find a positive sanction of honest wealth and riches.
P50|Foundations of the economic and social history of the United States: Empirical|I argue that a form of consciousness may be found in American economic history, one which is both mathematically demonstrable and important. In this book I present a model of economic and political growth based upon systematic addition. We begin with a philosophic model of trade (pp. 34-46); aggregate this model over the course of year to state the real Gross National Product of the United States and its relationship to the rate of employment (pp. 47-62); aggregate this model over the course of many years to find the growth of the United States stated as a natural “14-year octave” within real GNP data (pp. 63-91); multiply this octave times two to find the 28-year natural rate of price fluctuation (pp. 92-112); and multiply this octave times four to find the 56-year natural rate of political change (p. 92-112). The final model (pp. 113-136) is the larger “fractal” of the model of trade which begins these essays, in essence demonstrating that the United States “trades” values over a period of time in much the same way the individual citizen trades goods and services for money on a personal basis.
P50|Understanding Islam: Development, Economics and Finance|In this paper, the foundational rules governing human, economic and financial development in Islam, as understood from the Quran and from the life and traditions of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), are summarized. These rules pave the path to development as the basis of institutional structure, which in turn, underpin the path of economic and social progress. The essential elements in the life of a Muslim—the unity of creation, freedom and freedom of choice, economic and human development, economic system and financial practice—are developed.
P50|Analysis of European Labour Market in the Crisis Context|The purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants of labour market dynamics in EU-27 in the recent period and to assess their impact on the process of economic development. The degree of originality is given by our choice to focus on the comparative analysis of two periods of time: 2000-2007, when the European Union as a whole, but especially Central and Eastern European countries as well as Mediterranean ones experienced significant improvements in labour market performances and overall competitiveness and 2008-2010, a recession period characterized by a massive loss of jobs and an equally large increase in unemployment, with anticipated consequences on economic growth. The main interest is to look for the key factors that determine the lasting performances of the leading European economies and possible solutions for ensuring the sustainable growth of the others.
P50|A new formal approach to evolutionary processes in socioeconomic systems|Generalized Darwinian evolutionary theory has emerged as central to the description of economic process (e.g., Aldrich et al., J Evol Econ 18:577–596, 2008 ). Just as Darwinian principles provide necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for understanding the dynamics of social entities, so too the asymptotic limit theorems of information theory instantiate another set of necessary conditions that constrain socioeconomic evolution. These restrictions can be formulated as a statistics-like analytic toolbox for the study of empirical data that is consistent with generalized Darwinism, but escapes the intellectual straightjacket of replicator dynamics. The formalism is a coevolutionary theory in which punctuated convergence to temporary quasi-equilibira is inherently nonequilibrium, involving highly dynamic ‘languages’ rather than system stable points.

P50|African Stock Market Performance Dynamics: A Multidimensional Convergence Assessment| The author dissects, with great acuteness, the issues of convergence in financial performance dynamics in the African continent through the lenses of stock market capitalization, value traded, turnover, and number of listed companies. The empirical evidence is premised on 11 homogeneous panels based on regions (Sub-Saharan and North Africa), income levels (low, middle, lower-middle, and upper-middle), legal origins (English common law and French civil law), and religious dominations (Christianity and Islam). Findings provide partial support for the existence of absolute convergence in some dynamics. Only Sub-Saharan Africa reveals conditional convergence in relation to per capita number of listed companies. The speed of convergence for the most part is between 12% and 28% per annum. As a policy implication, countries should work toward adopting common institutional and structural characteristics that favor stock market development.
P50|Can gender differences in the educational performance of 15-year old migrant pupils be explained by the gender equality in the countries of origin and destination?|We try to explain the differences between the performance (in both reading and math) of 8430 15-year-old daughters and 8526 15-year-old sons in 17 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development destination countries across Europe and Oceania with the PISA 2009 data from 45 origin countries or regions. In addition to the level of societal gender equality of the origin and destination countries (the gender empowerment measure, or GEM) we use macro indicators of the educational systems, economic development, and religions of the countries of origin. We find that migrant daughters from countries with higher levels of gender equality have higher reading scores than comparable migrant sons (but this is not the case for math scores). In addition, the higher the level of gender equality in the destination countries, the lower the reading and math scores of both the male and female migrantsâ€™ children in their destination countries. Further analyses suggest that the difference between the levels of gender equality, rather than the levels themselves, of the origin and destination countries explains more of the educational performance of both female and male migrant pupils. Our results also show that the low level of gender equality in Islamic origin countries is a sufficient explanation of the low educational performance of Islam male and female migrantsâ€™ pupils. Finally, migrantsâ€™ daughters seem to perform slightly better educationally than comparable migrantsâ€™ sons.
P50|Financial determinants of consumer price inflation. What do dynamics in money, credit, efficiency and size tell us?|Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of financial dynamic policy options in money, credit, efficiency and size on consumer prices. Soaring food prices have marked the geopolitical landscape of developing countries in the past few years. Design/methodology/approach – The estimation approach used is a Two-Stage-Least Squares Instrumental Variable technique. Instruments include: legal-origins; income-levels and religious-dominations. The first-step consists of justifying the choice of the estimation approach with a Hausman-test for endogeneity. In the second-step, we verify that the instrumental variables are exogenous to the endogenous components of explaining variables(financial dynamic channels) conditional on other covariates(control variables). In the third-step, the validity of the instruments is examined with the Sargan overidentifying restrictions test. Robustness checks are ensured by: (1) use of alternative indicators of each financial dynamic; (2) estimation with robust Heteroscedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent(HAC) standard errors; and (3) adoption of two interchangeable sets of instruments. Findings – Findings broadly reveal the following: (1) money(depth) and credit(activity) which are in absolute measures have positive elasticities of inflation; while (2) financial efficiency and size in relative measures have negative elasticities of inflation. Social implications – This paper helps in providing monetary policy options in the fight against soaring consumer prices. By keeping inflationary pressures on food prices in check, sustained campaigns involving strikes, demonstrations, marches, rallies and political crises that seriously disrupt economic performance could be mitigated. Originality/value – As far as we have perused, there is yet no study that assesses monetary policy options that could be relevant in addressing the dramatic surge in the price of consumer commodities.
P50|Politics and Consumer Prices in Africa|The motivations of the Arab Spring that have marked the history of humanity over the last few months have left political economists, researchers, governments and international policymakers pondering over how the quality of political institutions affect consumer welfare in terms of commodity prices. This paper investigates the effect of political establishments on consumer prices in the African continent. Findings suggest that in comparison with authoritarian regimes, democracies better provide for institutions that keep inflationary pressures on commodity prices in check. As a policy implication, improving the quality of democratic institutions will ameliorate consumer welfare through lower inflation rates. Such government quality institutional determinants include, among others: voice and accountability, rule of law, regulation quality, control of corruption and press freedom.
P50|Law and Finance in Africa|ABSTRACT :This paper assesses how legal origin influences financial development through regulationquality and the rule of law. It employs all the dimensions identified by the FinancialDevelopment and Structure Database of the World Bank. The law channels are instrumentedwith legal origins to account for financial intermediary dynamics of depth, efficiency, activityand size. The results broadly support the benefits of law mechanisms in financial development.The findings only show partial support for the consensus that English common law countriesprovide better conditions for financial development. While they dominate in dynamics of depth,activity and size, French civil law countries have an edge in financial allocation efficiency.Portuguese civil law countries broadly fall in-between. With the exception of financialefficiency, French civil law sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries are least while North Africancountries dominate even English common law countries in financial intermediary aspects ofdepth and activity. French SSA countries dominate overall in allocation efficiency.
P50|Was Brazil's recent growth acceleration the world's most overrated boom?|As soon as international financial markets felt reassured in 2003 by the surprisingly neoliberal orientation of President Lula’s government, the ‘spot-the-new-Latin-tiger’ financial brigade became dazzled by Brazil — they just couldn’t have enough of it. So much so, that they had little difficulty in turning a blind eye to the obvious fact that (except for several commodities, finance, and a small number of other activities) Brazil’s economic performance since the beginning of neo-liberal reforms (c.1990) had been remarkably poor. This not only contrasted with its own performance pre-1980, but also with what was happening in Asia. I shall argue that the weakness of the new neo-liberal paradigm is rooted as much in its intrinsic flaws as in the particular way it was implemented. As in the rest of Latin America, Brazil’s economic reforms were undertaken primarily as a result of its perceived economic weaknesses — i.e., there was an attitude of ‘throwing in the towel’ vis-à-vis the previous state-led import substituting industrialisation strategy, because most politicians and economists interpreted the 1982 debt crisis as conclusive evidence that it had led the region into a cul-de-sac. As Hirschman has argued, policy-making has a strong component of ‘path-dependency’; as a result, people often stick with policies after they have achieved their aims, and those policies have become counterproductive. This leads to such frustration and disappointment with existing policies and institutions that is not uncommon to lead to a ‘rebound effect’. An extreme example of this phenomenon is post-1982 Latin America, where the core of the discourse that followed ended up simply emphasising the need to reverse as many aspects of the previous development strategy as possible. This helps to explain the peculiar set of priorities, the rigidity and the messianic attitude with which the reforms were implemented in Brazil, as well as their poor outcome. As the then President of Brazil’s Central Bank explained at the time, their main task was “...to undo forty years of stupidity.” With this ‘reverse-gear’ attitude, this experiment in economic reform almost inevitably ended up as an exercise in ‘not-very-creative-destruction’ — especially vis-à-vis its manufacturing industry. Something very different happened in Asia, where economic reforms were often intended (rightly or wrongly) as a more targeted and pragmatic mechanism to overcome specific economic and financial constraints. Instead of implementing reforms as a mechanism to reverse existing industrialisation strategies, in Asia they were put into practice in order to continue and strengthen ambitious processes of industrialisation. Although the Brazilian economy has been unable to deliver sustainable productivity-growth since the beginning of economic reforms (just a few short growth-dashes), Brazilian-style neo-liberal capitalism became unrivalled when it came to offering world-class commodities, an abundance of precarious (mostly service) jobs, stylish retail, extremely lucrative finance, and the ‘purity of beliefs.’
P50|Les apports de la stratégie à la finance entrepreneuriale - The contributions of strategy to entrepreneurial finance|(VF)Le financement par fonds propres des firmes entrepreneuriales a fait l’objet d’une littérature foisonnante depuis les années 1980. Dans un premier temps, ce chapitre est consacré au courant de la finance entrepreneuriale, qui s’est essentiellement focalisé sur les problématiques liées au différentiel d’informations existant entre capital-investisseurs et entrepreneurs et sur les mécanismes de gouvernance disciplinaires mis en place en réponse. Mais ces travaux ignorent la notion de connaissance, pourtant centrale dans la relation établie entre capital-investisseurs et entrepreneurs, qui ne partagent pas tous le même modèle cognitif. La seconde partie de l'article est donc centrée sur la littérature stratégique qui a largement contribué à l’enrichissement des approches classiques de la finance entrepreneuriale en étudiant le rôle de soutien et d’orientation de ces investisseurs et en renouvelant la compréhension de leur contribution au processus de création de richesse des firmes qu’ils financent, de même que celle du système de gouvernance des firmes entrepreneuriales qui prend une orientation cognitive majeure. (VA)The equity financing of entrepreneurial firms has been a growing literature since the 1980s. This paper is firstly devoted to current entrepreneurial finance, which has mainly focused on issues related to the differential information between entrepreneurs and investors and on governance mechanisms in place in response. But these studies ignore the notion of knowledge, yet central to the relationship between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, who do not have the same cognitive model. The second section is focused on the strategic literature which has largely contributed to the enrichment of traditional approaches to entrepreneurial finance by studying the role of support and advice to investors and renewing the understanding of their contribution to the process wealth creation of the firms they fund, as well as the governance system of entrepreneurial firms that takes a major cognitive orientation.
P50|Wirtschaftlicher Wandel und unfreiwilliger Arbeitsplatzverlust in China und Russland: Inzidenz und Kosten|"This study analyzes the costs of displacement in the emerging economies Russia and China during a period of restructuring. In the case of Russia we use data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) for the years 2003 to 2008, including data from a supplement on displacement administered in 2008. For China we employ a sample of migrants and a sample of workers with urban residence permit (""hukou"") from the Rural-to-Urban-Migration-in-China (RUMIC) data. Our analysis shows that the displacement of workers during the restructuring process imposes large costs on the affected workers in both countries. In Russia, these costs consist above all in large foregone earnings due to a long average duration of non-employment, reduced hours worked and a low employment rate. Relative wage penalties for re-employed displaced workers cannot be found, however. The analysis of the Chinese samples points to a segmented urban labor market. Whilst workers with ""hukou"", if displaced, experience on average a long duration of non-employment and relative wage penalties upon re-employment, migrants do not experience these costs The labor market for migrants in China, can, therefore, be considered competitive while the labor market for workers with ""hukou"" exhibits substantial frictions. Diese Studie analysiert die Kosten des unfreiwilligen Arbeitsplatzverlustes in den Schwellenländern Russland und China. Im Falle Russlands benutzen wir die Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) Daten für die Jahre 2003-2008, einschließlich einer Zusatzumfrage zum Thema Trennungen von Arbeitsverhältnissen im Jahre 2008. Für China benutzen wir eine Stichprobe von Migranten und eine Stichprobe von Arbeitnehmern mit städtischer Wohnberechtigung (""Hukou"") der Rural-to-Urban-Migrationin- China (RUMIC) Daten. Unsere Analyse zeigt, dass die Freisetzung von Arbeitnehmern während des Umstrukturierungsprozesses in beiden Ländern große Kosten für die Betroffenen mit sich bringt. In Russland bestehen diese Kosten vor allem in starken Einkommensbußen aufgrund einer im Durchschnitt langen Dauer der Erwerbslosigkeit, einer geringeren Zahl der gearbeiteten Stunden sowie einer niedrigeren Beschäftigungsquote. Relative Lohneinbußen bei Wiederbeschäftigung können dagegen nicht ausgemacht werden. Bei den chinesischen Stichproben weisen die wichtigsten empirischen Ergebnisse auf einen segmentierten städtischen Arbeitsmarkt hin. Während Arbeitnehmer mit ""Hukou"" nach unfreiwilligem Arbeitsplatzverlust im Durchschnitt eine lange Dauer der Erwerbslosigkeit hinnehmen müssen und relative Lohneinbußen bei Wiederbeschäftigung erleiden, haben Migranten diese Kosten nicht. Der Arbeitsmarkt für Migranten kann also als wettbewerbsfähig angesehen werden, während der Arbeitsmarkt für die Arbeitnehmer mit ""Hukou"" starke Friktionen aufweist."
P50|The political economy of mass printing: Legitimacy and technological change in the Ottoman Empire|New technologies have not always been greeted with full enthusiasm. Although the Ottomans were quick to adopt advancements in military technology, they waited almost three centuries to sanction printing in Ottoman Turkish (in Arabic characters). Printing spread relatively rapidly throughout Europe following the invention of the printing press in 1450 despite resistance by interest groups and temporary restrictions in some countries. We explain differential reaction to technology through a political economy approach centered on the legitimizing relationships between rulers and their agents (e.g., military, religious, or secular authorities). The Ottomans regulated the printing press heavily to prevent the loss it would have caused to the ruler’s net revenue by undermining the legitimacy provided by religious authorities. On the other hand, the legitimizing relationship between European religious and political authorities was undermined over a century prior to the invention of the press. European rulers thus had little reason to stop the spread of printing as public policy, nor could the Church have stopped it had it wanted to. The Ottomans eventually sanctioned printing in Arabic script in the 18th century after alternative sources of legitimacy emerged.
P50|Money, Trust and Happiness in Transition Countries: Evidence from Time Series|Abstract Trends of subjective well-being (SWB) in transition countries are peculiar: they show substantial changes that are more strongly correlated with the trends of GDP than in other developed countries. This paper examines the role of the trends of GDP and of social trust in predicting the trends of well-being. We find that the strength of the relationship between social trust and SWB over the medium-term is comparable to that of GDP. We conclude that in the medium-term, even in countries where material concerns strongly affect well-being, social trust is a powerful predictor of the trends of SWB. However, in the short run the relationship between social trust and SWB does not hold and GDP stands out as the only significant correlate of SWB.
P50|Job Separations, Job Loss and Informality in the Russian Labor Market|Having unique data we investigate the link between job separations (displacement and quits) and informal employment, which we define in several ways posing the general question whether the burden of informality falls disproportionately on job separators in the Russian labor market. After we have established positive causal effects of displacement and quits on informal employment we analyze whether displaced workers experience more involuntary informal employment than their non-displaced counterparts. Our main results confirm our contention that displacement entraps some of the workers in involuntary informal employment. Those who quit, in turn, experience voluntary informality for the most part, but there seems a minority of quitting workers who end up in involuntary informal jobs. This scenario does not fall on all the workers who separate but predominantly on workers with low human capital. We also pursue the issue of informality persistence and find that informal employment is indeed persistent as some workers churn from one informal job to the next. Our study contributes to the debate in the informality literature regarding segmented versus integrated labor markets. It also contributes to the literature on displacement by establishing informal employment as an important cost of displacement. We also look at the share of undeclared wages in formal jobs and find that these shares are larger for separators than for incumbents, with displaced workers bearing the brunt of this manifestation of informality.

P50|The economic system as an end or as a means and the future of socialism: an evolutionary viewpoint|After the demise of “real” socialism and the decline of “western” socialism, socialism can be salvaged as a social preference system oriented towards equality and social justice, to be implemented without systemic constraints in the organizational and institutional sense. At the same time there is a case for maintaining an institutional framework allowing different forms of economic organization,capitalist and non-capitalist,to compete on equal footing, in an evolutionary perspective, thus allowing the second to develop if proven efficient. Another way for a spontaneous extension of the domain of socialism could derive from the socialization of consumption, if the consumption of public goods continues to make up a growing component of real consumption.
P50|Libertad y desempeño económico<BR>[Freedom and economic performance]|"From a broad philosophical framework, this paper addresses the relation between freedom and economic performance. It argues for the thesis that, although a liberal system does not guarantee absolute harmony, is the only ""convenient"" and morally valid for a modern society. The core of this argument is the acceptance of the permanent uncertainty about the great results of the world and the inability of a central entity to control them."
P50|A shift in the prevailing institutional models of the global order:is a new cycle starting?|This paper discusses some theoretical-methodological bases for comparative institutional analysis. First, it shows the specific approach of the Marxian school to analyzing social and economic institutions. Second, it discusses the most general features of the system paradigm in economic theory (Kornai, 1998 [2002]). Third, it presents institutional matrices theory, or IMT (Кирдина, 2001; Kirdina, 2001, 2010, etc.), which develops a Marxian approach together with systemic ideas. This section describes two basic institutional models, so-called X- and Y-institutional matrices. Fourth, it demonstrates that the economic dominance of Y-matrix countries (like the USA and European countries) since the 1970s has gradually decreased and that since 2008 the global GDP share of X-matrix countries (like Russia and China, e.g.) has prevailed and continues to grow.
P50|Green New Deal: A Green Way out of the Crisis?|The multi-dimensional nature of the current crisis requires a holistic approach in addressing economical, social and ecological problems. Following the crisis, several organizations started to publish reports on a concept called Green New Deal with reference to the New Deal policies of the 1930s in USA. Since then the concept started to gain increasing popularity among the public. On the other hand, it fueled a heated discussion between its supporters and ecosocialists. The aim of this paper is to highlight the points at which GND supporters and ecosocialists converge and diverge, and discuss critically the transformative capacity of different GND proposals. We conclude that GND policies can help to set the stage for the transformation long sought by ecosocialist agenda, and hence from this perspective, these two approaches can be seen as complementary rather than substitutes.
P50|On Typical Materials Acting as the Dividing Standard of the Development Stages of Human Substance Civilization|During more than three million years, the substance civilization of human society went through the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, the Steel and Cement Age, and the Silicon Age. At the beginning of the new century, the human society has entered into the Nanomaterials Age, which indicates that a completely new substance civilization of human society has started. This paper analyses and discusses why the typical materials serve as the only standard for dividing the eras of the substance civilization of human society. The author argues about the subject of dividing the substance civilization of human society. The goal is to initiate broad and thorough discussion of that subject so as to get a rather thorough understanding about it.
P50|Globalization, Financial Development and Regional Economic Dynamics: asymmetric panel evidence from Africa|This paper examines how regionalization in the face of globalization has affected financial development in the context of banking system efficiency in Africa. Results which are robust to financial system efficiency and growth-led-finance nexus reveal that in the post-regionalization era: (1) UEMOA and CEMAC regional banks’ ability to finance credit by deposits has reduced; (2) financial institutions of COMESA have improved their capacity to fund openness related activities/projects with deposits; (3) increase in welfare has positively affected the intermediary role of banks; (4) globalization tends to be more detrimental to financial systems of ‘economic and monetary’ regions than to those of purely economic regions. As a policy implication, national and regional authorities should gain knowledge of the fact that with openness, the role of domestic and regional banks seems to lessen in the funding of openness related activities and projects. Much needs to be done on the improvement of infrastructure that curtails information asymmetry in the banking industry.
P50|Law, Economic Growth and Human Development: Evidence from Africa|This paper cuts adrift the mainstream approach to the legal-origins debate on the law-growth nexus by integrating both overall economic and human components in our understanding of how regulation quality and the rule of law lie at the heart of economic and inequality adjusted human developments. Findings summarily reveal that legal-origin does not explain economic growth and human development beyond the mechanisms of law. Our results support the current consensus that, English common-law countries provide for better legal systems that improve conditions for economic growth and human development than French civil-law countries. Portuguese civil-law countries lie between the French-speaking and North African countries, while French sub-Saharan Africa is slightly below the average of Francophone Africa. As a policy implication, results support the benefits of the rule of law and quality of regulation as channels to economic growth and human development.
P50|Why Do French Civil Law Countries Have Higher Levels Of Financial Efficiency|The dominance of English common law countries in prospects for financial development in the legal origins debate has been debunked by recent findings Using exchange rate regimes and economic monetary integration oriented hypotheses this paper proposes an inflation uncertainty theory in providing theoretical justification and empirical validity as to why French civil law countries have higher levels of financial allocation efficiency Inflation uncertainty typical of floating exchange rate regimes accounts for the allocation inefficiency of financial intermediary institutions in English common law countries As a policy implication results support the benefits of fixed exchange rate regimes in financial intermediary allocation efficiency
P50|Law and Investment in Africa|Contrary to mainstream consensus on the dominance of English common law countries in investment prospects, this paper sets a new tone in the legal origins debate by providing empirical validity on the dominance of French civil law countries in private investment. This assessment is based on 38 African countries for the period 1996-2007. The law mechanisms of regulation quality and rule of law are used to investigate how legal origins (French, English, French sub-Saharan, Portuguese and North African) have influenced a plethora of investment dynamics (domestic, foreign, private and public). The dominance of French civil law countries in prospects for private investments could be traceable to their relatively low and stable inflation rates due to common monetary policies.
P50|Law, democracy and the quality of government in Africa|This paper examines the big questions of African comparative politics. It assesses the interaction of three crucial components in the development of the continent: law, democracy and quality of government. Political regimes of democracy, polity and autocracy are instrumented with income-levels, legal-origins, religious-dominations and press-freedom levels to account for government quality dynamics of corruption-control, government-effectiveness, voice and accountability, political-stability, regulation quality and rule of law. Findings indicate democracy has an edge over autocracy while the later and polity overlap. A democracy that takes into account only the voice of the majority is better in government quality than autocracy, while a democracy that takes into account the voice of the minority (polity) is worse in government quality than autocracy. As a policy implication, democracy once initiated should be accelerated to edge the appeals of authoritarian regimes and reap the benefits of time and level hypotheses.
P50|Is globalization a driver of economic growth and social development?|This article starts from the assumptions that the world can learn a lot from the empirical and theoretical debates and research results of dependency and world systems research. The European ‘political class’ seems to react more slowly to the implications of the global economic crisis. The policy package currently offered by the Commission still relies on open economies as pillar number 1 of any conceivable strategy. A rediscovery of this radical ‘dependency perspective’, first introduced by the Argentine economist Raúl Prebisch and other Latin American thinkers during the Great Depression of the 1930s, and more fully developed in the so-called Latin American ‘dependency debate’ of the late 1960s and 1970s; and the current empirical ‘world systems theory’ mean a fundamental break with the existing dominant thinking on the subject of economic and social convergence. Continuing critical perspectives, initiated by Polanyi, and developed in Hungary by Andor, Inotai and Szentes, and above all in the quantitative investigations by the Swiss sociologist Volker Bornschier and his associates, we show that on a global cross-national scale, very important indicators of the future and well-being of our continent, ranging from the famous ‘European social model’ to tertiary educational enrolment, infant mortality, rule of law, female survival rates, economic growth, inequality, unemployment, and environmental security are significantly being determined by our models, and all the explanations point in the direction of the penetration of multinational corporations (MNCs) and its growth over time as constituting a major and important development bottleneck. Our dependency approach thus re-iterates the substantial findings, proposed by the Bornschier sociological school. A thorough re-thinking of basic premises of policy-making in Europe is thus necessary. In our opinion, European policy-making finally should dare to take the globalization-critical organizations of ‘civil society’ seriously.
P50|Inward FDI Stock and Growth in Central and Eastern Europe|This article analyses the foreign direct investment (FDI) in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) during the post communist era and tests the hypothesis that FDI contributes to the economic growth of the CEE countries. It reflects macroeconomic changes in post communist CEE and estimates the impact of the FDI stock on economic growth in the CEE using model based on the production function. This paper finds a positive association between FDI and economic growth in the CEE and a tremendous impact of FDI stock on GDP growth.
P50|The Wage and Non-wage Costs of Displacement: Evidence from Russia|This paper is the first to analyze the costs of job loss in Russia, using unique new data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey over the years 2003-2008, including a special supplement on displacement that was initiated by us. We employ fixed effects regression models and propensity score matching techniques in order to establish the causal effect of displacement for displaced individuals. The paper is innovative insofar as we investigate fringe and in-kind benefits and the propensity to have an informal employment relationship as well as a permanent contract as relevant labor market outcomes upon displacement. We also analyze monthly earnings, hourly wages, employment and hours worked, which are traditionally investigated in the literature. Compared to the control group of non-displaced workers (i.e. stayers and quitters), displaced individuals face a significant income loss following displacement, which is mainly due to the reduction in employment and hours worked. This effect is robust to the definition of displacement. The losses seem to be more pronounced and are especially large for older workers with labor market experience and human capital acquired in Soviet times and for workers with primary and secondary education. Workers displaced from state firms experience particularly large relative losses in the short run, while such losses for workers laid off from private firms are more persistent. Turning to the additional non-conventional labor market outcomes, there is a loss in terms of the number of fringe and in-kind benefits for reemployed individuals but not in terms of their value. There is also some evidence of an increased probability of working in informal jobs if displaced. These results point towards the importance of both firm-specific human capital and of obsolete skills obtained under the centrally planned economy as well as to a wider occurrence of job insecurity among displaced workers
P50|Autocracies and Development in a Global Economy: A Tale of Two Elites| This paper studies how comparative advantage and the political elites endowments shape long-run performance in an economy with imperfect political institutions. In a capital-scarce economy, an autocrat catering to the needs of landowners favors openness to trade at an early stage of development, while an autocrat complying with the preferences of capitalists chooses to shelter the economy from trade. The resulting trade regime interacts with economic institutions, and with policies on capital mobility, to govern capital accumulation. A landed autocrat neglects to improve institutions and blocks foreign capital to maximise extractable rents, leading the economy towards stagnation. By contrast, a capitalist autocrat strengthens the institutional quality, which over time shifts the comparative advantage towards manufacturing and renders the economy attractive to foreign investors. Trade and capital market liberalisation are thus complementary policies that provide an environment of growth and development in the capital autocracy.
P50|Interjurisdictional Linkages and the Scope for Interventionist Legal Harmonization|We study the desirability of interventionist harmonization of legal standards across multiple, mutually interdependent jurisdictions which strive to adapt law to their local conditions, as well as to synchronize it with other jurisdictions. In a setting where jurisdictions are privately informed about their local conditions, we contrast the regime of decentralized standard-setting with two means of interventionist harmonization: through centralization and through allocation of lawmaking authority to a particular jurisdiction. Our analysis illuminates the importance of patterns of interjurisdictional linkages in delineating the scope for, and the appropriate means of, interventionist harmonization. We find that greater jurisdictional interdependence the hallmark of globalization does not per se justify interventionist harmonization, unless increased interdependence results in notable asymmetries in the pattern of jurisdictional interdependence. We also show that, in the presence of cross-jurisdictional externalities, harmonization is, contrary to conventional predictions, not desirable when local preferences are homogeneous across jurisdictions.
P50|Confidence as an Economic Indicator :A Cultural-Ecology Perspective|In previous research endeavours on national economic development, almost no studies exist on how regional confidence can influence industrial and economic well-being. This paper provides a cultural-ecology parenthesis, which integrates climatic, geographic and genetic factors to spell out the forces of confidence on national economic well-being, which is reflected by the gross national income per capita. The correlation between the mean level of the Rosenberg selfesteem scale and the GNI per capita growth of 45 countries across the globe supports the hypothesis that the cultural-ecology perspective of confidence has a positive influence on overall economic development.
P50|Autocracies and Development in a Global Economy: A Tale of Two Elites|Data on the growth performances of countries with similar comparative (dis)advantage and political institutions reveal a striking variation across world regions. While some former autocracies such as the East Asian growth miracles have done remarkably well, others such as the Latin American economies have grown at much lower rates. In this paper, we propose a political economy explanation of these diverging paths of development by addressing the preferences of the country's political elite. We build a theoretical framework where factors of production owned by the political elites differ across countries. In each country, the incumbent autocrat will cater to the preferences of the elites when setting trade policy and the property rights regime. We show how stronger property rights may lead to capital accumulation and labor reallocation to the manufacturing sector. This, in turn, can lead to a shift in the comparative advantage, a decision to open up to trade and an inflow of more productive foreign capital. Consistent with a set of stylised facts on East Asia and Latin America, we argue that strong property rights are crucial for success upon globalization.
P50|Le rôle des sociétés de capital-risque dans la formation d’alliances stratégiques:Une synthèse de littérature - The Role of Venture Capitalists in the Formation of Strategic Alliances:An academic literature review|(VF)Cet article dresse un bilan des travaux existants portant sur le rôle des sociétés de capital-risque dans la formation d’alliances stratégiques. Ils sont présentés en distinguant les points de vue des sociétés de capital-risque et des entreprises formant l’alliance, et, agencés en fonction des deux cadres théoriques qu’ils emploient : les théories contractuelles et cognitives. Au-delà, les limites de ces travaux sont mises en avant et des prolongations possibles sont présentées.(VA)This article reviews and analyses academic work on the role of venture capitalists in the formation of strategic alliances. The presentation takes into account both, the view of the venture capitalists and the view of the companies forming the alliance, and, differentiates between the theoretical frameworks the articles belong to: mainstream theories (transaction cost theory and the positive theory of agency) and the knowledge-based view. In addition, the limits of those contributions are highlighted and future investigations are suggested.
P50|An Alternative View on Law, Institutions, Finance and Growth|The spectacular economic growth in East Asian economies such as China, South Korea and Taiwan over the past five decades contradicts most of the existing research on law, institutions, finance, and growth. We propose an alternative view based on the comparison of legal institutions and alternative institutions outside the legal system. Despite well-known advantages, the legal system, as a monopolist institution, can be captured by interest groups and become a barrier to innovations. Moreover, in a dynamic environment alternative institutions can adapt and change much more quickly than when the law is used, as this process does not require persuading the legislature and the electorate to revise the law. We argue that in fast-growing economies and during early stages of economic growth, efficient alternative institutions are the main driver for finance, commerce and growth. In static environments with low and predictable growth, legal institutions can play a more important role in supporting finance and commerce. In these environments, however, viable alternative institutions and competition among different types of institutions remain keys to ensuring that the most efficient mechanism prevails and sustains long-term growth.
P50|Nota sull'alternativa al capitalismo proposta da Bruno Jossa|"The note is dedicate to comment of recent Bruno Jossa’s book on the possibility to find an alternative to capitalism. The Author proposes a form of ""market socialism"" that realizes the inversion of the power relation between labour and capital. But the thesis of the possible survival of capitalistic market in a economic-social formation dominated by labour managed firms is not fully persuasive."
P50|O Instututo Superior de Ciências Económicas e Financeiras e o Corporativismo (1934-1974)|O Instituto Superior de Ciências Económicas e Financeiras, de Lisboa, resultou da transformação do antigo Instituto Superior de Comércio, criado pelo governo da República em 1911. Esta mudança de nome esteve associada a uma importante transformação substantiva: não só este Instituto passou a estar integrado na universidade como passou de uma escola de dominante liberal a uma escola alinhada com a visão corporativa dominante após a institucionalização do Estado Novo em 1933. Surgiram assim no decurso daquela década elementos importantes de afirmação e difusão de uma cultura económica e jurídica corporativa. Após um hiato o imediato pós Segunda Guerra, o ISCEF voltou a ser um aparelho importante na renovação da doutrina corporativa. O objectivo da presente comunicação é justamente o de reconstituir e analisar criticamente a contribuição desta escola para esse movimento de ideias.
P50|Job Separations and Informality in the Russian Labor Market|In the years 2003-2008 the Russian economy experienced a period of strong and sustained growth, which was accompanied by large worker turnover and rising informality. We investigate whether the burden of informality falls disproportionately on job separators (displaced workers and quitters) in the Russian labor market in the form of informal employment and undeclared wages in formal jobs. We also pursue the issues whether displaced workers experience more involuntary informal employment than workers who quit and whether informal employment persists. We find a strong positive link between separations and informal employment as well as shares of undeclared wages in formal jobs. Our results also show that displacement entraps some of the workers in involuntary informal employment. Those who quit, in turn, experience voluntary informality for the most part, but there seems a minority of quitting workers who end up in involuntary informal jobs. This scenario does not fall on all separators but predominantly on those with low human capital. Finally, informal employment is indeed persistent since separating from an informal job considerably raises the probability to be informal in the subsequent job.

Ennek keretében a Hayek-Friedman-hipotézis értelmezésében a társadalmi rendekre vonatkozó elméletet (North és szerzőtársai [2009]) használjuk, s ez egy újfajta értelmezéséhez vezet. A hipotézis e gyenge formája azt állítja, hogy a gazdasági szabadság a politikai szabadság fenntartásának szükséges feltétele a szabad hozzáférést biztosító rendekben. Tehát a politikai szabadsághoz, ha egyszer megvalósult, szükséges a gazdasági szabadság annak érdekében, hogy az stabilan fennmaradjon, viszont a Hayek-Friedman-hipotézis nem érvényes a korlátozott hozzáférést biztosító rendekben. Az 1970-2005 közötti periódusra vonatkozó, 130 országra kiterjedő empirikus vizsgálataink alátámasztják a hipotézis gyenge értelmezését, és eredményeink robusztusak.* Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) kód: H11, O10, O57, P50.

Sokak szerint a szabadpiactól a szabadpiacig vezető kör bezárult, és ismét rendszerválság előtt állunk. Míg a jövő természetesen bizonytalanságokkal terhes, és így értelemszerűen nem kiszámítható, a múlt egyértelmű tanulsága az, hogy a közéletet végig formáló felzárkózási törekvés egészében sikertelennek bizonyult. Ennek alapja elemzésünk központi rejtélye egy régi fejlődéselméleti feladvány: miért van az, hogy Argentínához vagy újabban Olaszországhoz és Portugáliához hasonlóan a jó politika rossz eredményekkel jár(t), és fordítva?

P50|The distributional impact of privatization in developing countries: the role of democratic institutions|Focusing on developing countries which have recently experienced political and economic transitions, we study how income inequality is affected by privatization in the light of the democratization process. We find that privatization is negatively and significantly correlated with the inequality in the income distribution when, thanks to democratic institutions, the protection of the civil liberties and the guarantee of the political rights are widely ensured to all citizens. In fact, privatization generates revenue which well mature democracies can use to satisfy the redistributive pressures from the poor. Then, our evidence suggests an interesting policy implication for developing countries: only after having established mature representative political institutions, privatization can be implemented without producing a negative distributional impact.

P50|Globalization, financial allocation efficiency and regional economic dynamics: asymmetric panel evidence from Africa|This paper examines how regionalization in the face of globalization has affected financial development in the context of banking system efficiency in Africa. Results which are robust to financial system efficiency and growth-led-finance nexus reveal that in the post-regionalization era: (1) UEMOA and CEMAC regional banks’ ability to finance credit by deposits has reduced; (2) financial institutions of COMESA have improved their capacity to fund openness related activities/projects with deposits; (3) increase in welfare has positively affected the intermediary role of banks; (4) globalization tends to be more detrimental to financial systems of ‘economic and monetary’ regions than to those of purely economic regions. As a policy implication, national and regional authorities should gain knowledge of the fact that with openness, the role of domestic and regional banks seems to lessen in the funding of openness related activities and projects. Much needs to be done on the improvement of infrastructure that curtails information asymmetry in the banking industry.
P50|Law, Finance and Investment: does legal origin matter?|This paper assesses if legal origin explains domestic, foreign, private and public investments through financial intermediary channels of depth, efficiency, activity and size. Findings show that legal origin matters in the finance-investment nexus; though its ability to explain aggregate investment dynamics only through financial intermediary channels is limited in the cases of private and public investments.
P50|Law, Democracy and the Quality of Government in Africa|This paper examines the big questions of African comparative politics. It assesses the interaction of three crucial components in the development of the continent: law, democracy and quality of government. Political regimes of democracy, polity and autocracy are instrumented with income-levels, legal-origins, religious-dominations and press-freedom levels to account for government quality dynamics of corruption-control, government-effectiveness, voice and accountability, political-stability, regulation quality and rule of law. Findings indicate democracy has an edge over autocracy while the later and polity overlap. A democracy that takes into account only the voice of the majority is better in government quality than autocracy, while a democracy that takes into account the voice of the minority (polity) is worse in government quality than autocracy. As a policy implication, democracy once initiated should be accelerated to edge the appeals of authoritarian regimes and reap the benefits of time and level hypotheses.

P50|A Thorn by the Name of Rose: General Provident Fund, Interest Bearing Activityor Tohfa-e-Sultani|The paper addresses the question of legitimacy of pension fund given by the government of Pakistan to its employees at the time of retirement. The study is based on the hypothesis that since the fund amount is invested by the government in interest bearing investment areas so the profit is not Halal for the employees. But the government employees accept that money by having different justifications. Ulema have also expressed their opinion. The paper incorporates primary data covering the verdicts of the Ulema and of the researchers. Their opinions are then analyzed in the light of government rules and investment areas of General Provident Fund. The results show that the investment and profits of the fund is legitimized by giving different names thus violating the basic spirit of Shariah’s objective for which interest is forbidden. The same practice is carriedon indirectly and the responsibility is ill defined. It is therefore suggested that Ulema should get in depth knowledge of the problem and guide the people by considering different aspects of the matter.
P50|Outsourcing der Personalfunktion. Eine beschaeftigungssystemfundierte theoretische und empirische Analyse|Outsourcing der Personalfunktion als Sonderfall des „Make or Buy“ wird in dieser Arbeit primaer in Abhaengigkeit von den Merkmalen des Beschaeftigungssystems erklaert. Der Ausgangspunkt der Untersuchung liegt in dem Versuch, die unterschiedliche Neigung zum Outsourcing der Personalfunktion in westlichen und in asiatischen Laendern zu erklaeren. Die in den vorliegenden Untersuchungen dominierende Betrachtung der Kosten- und Ressourcenperspektive liefert zur Beantwortung dieser Frage keine befriedigenden Ergebnisse. Deshalb wurde ein neuer Weg durch die Einbeziehung des Beschaeftigungssystem-Ansatzes von Hendry gegangen. Am Beispiel Korea wurde untersucht, inwieweit das Beschaeftigungssystem auf die Outsourcing-Entscheidungen in den Unternehmen einwirkt. Die Verfasserin bezieht die bisher dominierenden Perspektiven der Kosten und der verfuegbaren Ressourcen sowie der Strategien in ihre Analyse mit ein und belegt die Plausibilitaet ihrer Aussagen anhand von zwoelf in koreanischen Unternehmen erhobenen Fallstudien. Die Untersuchungsergebnisse erhaerten die Annahme, dass das Beschaeftigungssystem einen relativ starken Einfluss auf die Entscheidung fuer oder gegen Outsourcing im Personalbereich hat.

It must be admitted that co-operatives have struggled through years of difficult survival in the past, but in the post-Fordist societies conditions have again become favourable for co-operation, above all in the services, where relational qualities, customization, intrinsic motivations, tacit knowledge and new welfare - all aspects typical of co-operative enterprises - are welcome. The need now, however, is to interpret markets with a pluralistic approach.

P50|The Economics of International Differences in Educational Achievement|An emerging economic literature over the past decade has made use of international tests of educational achievement to analyze the determinants and impacts of cognitive skills. The cross-country comparative approach provides a number of unique advantages over national studies: It can exploit institutional variation that does not exist within countries; draw on much larger variation than usually available within any country; reveal whether any result is country-specific or more general; test whether effects are systematically heterogeneous in different settings; circumvent selection issues that plague within-country identification by using system-level aggregated measures; and uncover general-equilibrium effects that often elude studies in a single country. The advantages come at the price of concerns about the limited number of country observations, the cross-sectional character of most available achievement data, and possible bias from unobserved country factors like culture. This chapter reviews the economic literature on international differences in educational achievement, restricting itself to comparative analyses that are not possible within single countries and placing particular emphasis on studies trying to address key issues of empirical identification. While quantitative input measures show little impact, several measures of institutional structures and of the quality of the teaching force can account for significant portions of the large international differences in the level and equity of student achievement. Variations in skills measured by the international tests are in turn strongly related to individual labor-market outcomes and, perhaps more importantly, to cross-country variations in economic growth
P50|What Does “Change of System” Mean?|The study discusses the concepts of capitalism, socialism, democracy and change of the system, which are since long interesting for the author. When discussing these fundamental problems of the post-socialist transformation, the distance from the daily events is maintained, though writing of this study is inspired by concrete political events. The main objective of the study is to present a mean and a method of approach. How can a person approach the positive definition of the social structure? How can the positive and negative approach be kept separate in the theoretical analysis? These are not easy problems and their solving is not a usual task. The study gives many examples of these theoretical tasks. To distinguish the less significant daily attempts from the really big historic transformation, fundamental facts of the change of the system are reminded, about how the capitalist economy and parliament democracy have emerged.
