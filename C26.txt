C26|The Importance Of Punishment Substitutability In Criminometric Studies|This study investigates the role of punishment substitutability in the empirical estimation of the economic model of crime. Using a dynamic panel data model fitted to a panel of Local Government Areas in New South Wales, Australia, we evaluate the effects of financial penalties and imprisonment on the crime rate. Our results show that crime is clearly a dynamic phenomenon, and that failure to incorporate both financial penalties and imprisonment can lead to a misspecified model. Furthermore, our results vary significantly for different crime categories, highlighting the importance of analysing specific crime categories separately.
C26|Innovación y empleo en la industria manufacturera peruana|En este documento se explora la relación de la innovación con el empleo en la industria manufacturera peruana, distinguiéndose entre dos tipos de innovación: en producto y en proceso. La innovación en producto corresponde a la introducción de un nuevo producto que mediante el mecanismo de mayor demanda de bienes afecta al factor trabajo, y la innovación en proceso corresponde a las mejoras en la eficiencia durante el proceso productivo (tecnológicos) que afectan el uso del factor empleo. Haciendo uso de la Encuesta Nacional Manufacturera de 2015 se encuentra que la innovación en proceso reduce el nivel de empleo, lo cual se genera por la sustitución del empleo por capital físico más eficiente. Asimismo, se reporta que la innovación en producto incrementa el nivel de empleo. Estos resultados se mantienen cuando se analiza según el tamaño de empresa (micro, pequeña y mediana/gran empresa), la estructura de calidad de mano de obra (calificado y no calificado) y la capacidad tecnológica de las empresas (alta y baja tecnología).
C26|Exporting and Pollution Abatement Expenditure: Evidence from Firm-Level Data|The relevance of analyzing whether exporting rms engage in greater pollution abatement cannot be overemphasized. For instance, the question relates to the possibility of export promotion policies being environmentally benecial. In fact, the issue is especially relevant for developing countries typically characterized by ine/ective environmental regulation. However, despite the signicance of the topic, the extant literature examining the environmental consequences of rm-level trade is skewed toward developed countries. Moreover, the existing contributions rarely attend to concerns over non-random selection into exporting. Accordingly, we employ cross-sectional data across Indonesian rms as well as a number of novel identication strategies to assess the causal e/ect of exporting on abatement behavior. Two of the approaches are proposed by Millimet and Tchernis (2013), and entail either minimizing or correcting for endogeneity bias. The remaining methods, attributable to Lewbel (2012) and Klein and Vella (2009), rely on higher moments of the data to obtain exclusion restrictions. While we largely nd exporting to encourage pollution abatement, the estimated impacts are more pronounced after accounting for selection into exporting.

C26|Twin instrument, fertility and women’s labor force participation: evidence from Colombian low-income families|This paper uses the twin births instrument to estimate the causal effect of fertility on labor market outcomes for first-time mothers in Colombia. The nature of the data used allows us to overcome previous concerns regarding the validity of this instrument. We can control for observed pre-pregnancy characteristics, and by including fixed effects, we can control for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. Results coming from the traditional instrumental variables approach suggest a reduction in female labor supply close to 5.2 percentage points (18%) due to a marginal increase in fertility. Additionally, after following Farbmacher, Guber and Vikström (2018) to eliminate the bias of twins resulting from mothers’ characteristics and in vitro fertilizations (e.g., a non-exogenous event), the obtained results are of the same magnitude but less significant than those of the traditional instrument. By making additional assumptions on the correlation of the twin instrument and the error of the structural equation following Nevo and Rosen (2012), we find an upper bound estimate for the reduction in female labor supply close to -5 ppt. **** RESUMEN: En este estudio usamos nacimientos múltiples como instrumento para estimar el efecto causal de la fecundidad en diferentes resultados de mercado laboral para madres primerizas en Colombia. La naturaleza de los datos nos permite superar problemas, sobre la validez de este instrumento, que han sido ampliamente documentados en la literatura. Esto principalmente porque podemos controlar por características observadas de la madre antes del parto, más aún, al incluir efectos fijos por madre podemos controlar por cualquier característica no observada que sea invariante en el tiempo. Nuestras estimaciones de regresiones tradicionales tipo variables instrumentales, sugieren una reducción de 5,2 puntos porcentuales (18%) como resultado de un incremento marginal en la fecundidad. Adicionalmente, después de seguir la metodología de Farbmacher, Guber and Vikström (2018) con el fin de eliminar el sesgo que resulta de diferencias inobservadas de las madres antes del parto y de posibles fertilizaciones in-vitro, las cuales no son un fenómeno exógeno, los resultados obtenidos se mantienen en magnitud. Finalmente, asumiendo la dirección de la correlación entre el instrumento y el error de la ecuación estructural, usando una metodología tipo Nevo and Rosen (2012), encontramos una cota superior del efecto de la fecundidad en la participación laboral femenina de -5 puntos porcentuales.
C26|Informal Sector and Mobile Financial Services in Developing Countries: Does Financial Innovation Matter?|This paper investigates the impact of mobile financial services - MFS (mobile money, and mobile credit and savings) on the informal sector. Using both parametric and non-parametric methods on panel data from 101 emerging and developing countries over the period 2000-15, we find that MFS negatively affect the size of the informal sector. According to estimates derived from propensity score matching, MFS adoption decreases the informal sector size in a range of 2.4 – 4.3 percentage points of GDP. These formalization effects may stem from different possible transmission channels: improvement in credit access, increase in the productivity/profitability of informal firms attenuating subsistence constraints typical of entrepreneurship in the informal sector, as well as possible induced growth of firms already in the formal sector. The robustness of these results is supported by the use of an alternative estimation approach (instrumental variables). These findings lay the groundwork for the scarce literature on the macroeconomic impact of mobile financial services, a major dimension of the growing drive towards economic digitalization transiting through industry-level MW.
C26|Time varying cointegration and the UK Great Ratios|We re-examine the great ratios associated with balanced growth models and ask whether they have remained constant over time. We first use a benchmark DSGE model to explore how plausible smooth variations in structural parameters lead to movements in great ratios that are comparable to those seen in the UK data. We then employ a nonparametric methodology that allows for slowly varying coefficients to estimate trends over time. To formally test for stable relationships in the great ratios, we propose a statistical test based on these nonparametric estimators devised to detect time varying cointegrating relationships. Small sample properties of the test are explored in a small Monte Carlo exercise. Generally, we find no evidence for cointegration when parameters are constant, but strong evidence when allowing for time variation. The implications are that in macroeconometric models allowance should be made for shifting long-run relationships, including DSGE models where smooth variation should be allowed in the deep structural relationships.
C26|Should We Care (More) About Data Aggregation? Evidence from the Democracy-Growth-Nexus|We compile data for 186 countries (1919 - 2016) and apply different aggregation methods to create new democracy indices. We observe that most of the available aggregation techniques produce indices that are often too favorable for autocratic regimes and too unfavorable for democratic regimes. The sole exception is a machine learning technique. Using a stylized model, we show that applying an index with implausibly low (high) scores for democracies (autocracies) in a regression analysis produces upward-biased OLS and 2SLS estimates. The results of an analysis of the effect of democracy on economic growth show that the distortions in the OLS and 2SLS estimates are substantial. Our findings imply that commonly used indices are not well suited for empirical purposes.
C26|Firms' Price, Cost and Activity Expectations: Evidence from Micro Data|Firms' expectations play a central role in modern macroeconomic models, but little is known empirically about how these are formed or whether they matter for economic outcomes. Using a novel panel data set of manufacturing firms' expectations about prices and wage rates, new orders, employment and unit costs for the United Kingdom, we document a range of stylized facts about the properties of firms' expectations and their relationship with recent experience. There is wide dispersion of expectations across firms. Expected future price and wage growth are influenced by firm-specific factors but macroeconomic factors also matter. Expectations of employment and new orders are influenced by firm-specific measures of past orders while expected unit costs seem to be influenced more by firm-specific cost pressures and aggregate import prices. After controlling for a wide range of variables we find a significant connection between past expected price and wage increases and their out-turns. But there is also strong evidence that firms' expectations are clearly not rational.
C26|I know, therefore I am healthier? The role of education in health-related behaviors|To know how better economic conditions impact health-related choices is critical when formulating public policies that aim at improving the population’s health, both in terms of outcomes and habits. Through the use of two national surveys, we investigate the effect of one additional year of schooling on the amount of time of physical activity done per week, and on the servings consumed of fruits and vegetables per day, in urban Colombia. Furthermore, intending to find causal links, we exploited as a source of exogenous variation a change in regulation concerning basic education implemented in the 1970s, in a 2SLS framework. Our results suggest that higher levels of education have a positive impact on food consumption habits, and on the undertaking of physical activity, especially when it is done for leisure. Conversely, transport-motivated physical activity is unaffected by higher educational attainment, which points to the presence of protective factors in low SES individuals. For the consumption part, we find that access is a necessary condition for individuals to make healthy diet choices. K
C26|Motherhood Timing and the Child Penalty: Bounding the Returns to Delay|"We use administrative data from Austria to analyze labor market returns to delaying motherhood. We exploit delays due to pregnancy loss to provide bounds on the returns that account for imperfect instruments and selection into the sample for mothers that suffer a loss. Our results suggest small effects of delay on earnings, employment, and firm quality--- in contrast with the prior literature. The lower bounds suggest little difference in earnings trajectories around the first birth. This raises the possibility that much of the return may come from delaying the ""child penalty"" rather than changing how the career responds to children."
C26|Breaking Ties: Regression Discontinuity Design Meets Market Design|Centralized school assignment algorithms must distinguish between applicants with the same preferences and priorities. This is done with randomly assigned lottery numbers, non-lottery tie-breakers like test scores, or both. The New York City public high school match illustrates the latter, using test scores, grades, and interviews to rank applicants to screened schools, combined with lottery tie-breaking at unscreened schools. We show how to identify causal effects of school attendance in such settings. Our approach generalizes regression discontinuity designs to allow for multiple treatments and multiple running variables, some of which are randomly assigned. Lotteries generate assignment risk at screened as well as unscreened schools. Centralized assignment also identifies screened school effects away from screened school cutoffs. These features of centralized assignment are used to assess the predictive value of New York City’s school report cards. Grade A schools improve SAT math scores and increase the likelihood of graduating, though by less than OLS estimates suggest. Selection bias in OLS estimates is egregious for Grade A screened schools.
C26|Investing in agriculture when it is worth it. Evidence from rural Uganda|One of the reasons for the persistent low agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa is the lack of adoption of pro table agricultural technologies. Yet, what is pro table in a controlled experimental setting may not be pro table in a real-world setting. Estimating the returns to a single input is, in fact, challenging as farmers may respond to adoption by re-optimizing the use of other inputs. This paper explores farmers behavioral response to a positive random shock on future productivity by disentangling inputs returns from farmers' response. Using a unique household panel dataset collected in rural Uganda, I proxy a future productivity shock with the birth of a female calf against that of a male calf. Calves have no technical returns, but female calves will become cows producing milk, providing a stable source of income, while bulls and oxen are of little use in this context. The main OLS and di erence-in-di erences results show the existence of a crowd-in e ect. Farmers react to the birth of a female calf by increasing inputs' expenditures. They invest more on their cattle's health, increase hired labor and are more willing to pay for cattle-related investments but not for other activities. This increase in investments leads to an increase in milk production and revenues that lasts over time. Further results show that economies of scale associated with the number of female animals seem to explain this behavioral response.
C26|The Economics of Recycling Rate: new insights from a Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment|In this paper, we address the issue relative to the determinants of metal recycling rate. The literature on recycling flows is scarce and does not directly address the issue of achieving high recycling rate. In addition, the existing literature has not quantified the recycling rate response to metal price. This is why we explore factors of the recycling rate of different metals embodied in computer. We examine the effect of metal price, metal concentration in product, and relative concentration ratio (competition between primary and secondary supply) on recycling rate. Although we find a significant effect of metal price on recycling rate, the marginal response is very low across different type of models (OLS, GLM, FRMER, left censored Tobit). This effect is not surprising and in line with the existing literature relative to recycling flows. Conversely, it seems that recycling rate is more elastic to other technical factors like the metal concentration in products or the relative concentration ratio. We discuss public policies deriving from our results. We need more data and interdisciplinary studies to support these preliminary results.
C26|Pre-event Trends in the Panel Event-study Design|"We consider a linear panel event-study design in which unobserved confounds may be related both to the outcome and to the policy variable of interest. We provide sufficient conditions to identify the causal effect of the policy by exploiting covariates related to the policy only through the confounds. Our model implies a set of moment equations that are linear in parameters. The effect of the policy can be estimated by 2SLS, and causal inference is valid even when endogeneity leads to pre-event trends (""pre-trends"") in the outcome. Alternative approaches perform poorly in our simulations."
C26|An introduction to flexible methods for policy evaluation|This chapter covers different approaches to policy evaluation for assessing the causal effect of a treatment or intervention on an outcome of interest. As an introduction to causal inference, the discussion starts with the experimental evaluation of a randomized treatment. It then reviews evaluation methods based on selection on observables (assuming a quasi-random treatment given observed covariates), instrumental variables (inducing a quasi-random shift in the treatment), difference-in-differences and changes-in-changes (exploiting changes in outcomes over time), as well as regression discontinuities and kinks (using changes in the treatment assignment at some threshold of a running variable). The chapter discusses methods particularly suited for data with many observations for a flexible (i.e. semi- or nonparametric) modeling of treatment effects, and/or many (i.e. high dimensional) observed covariates by applying machine learning to select and control for covariates in a data-driven way. This is not only useful for tackling confounding by controlling for instance for factors jointly affecting the treatment and the outcome, but also for learning effect heterogeneities across subgroups defined upon observable covariates and optimally targeting those groups for which the treatment is most effective.
C26|Wealth and health in South Africa|In this paper, we investigate the impact of wealth on health in South Africa using the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS). We estimate a two-stage probit model with inheritance as an instrumental variable for wealth. We find no significant effect of wealth on health at the individual level, consistent with most of the results found for developed countries. Alternative specifications to the health outcomes (self-reported health versus reported diseases) as well as the introduction of gifts as an additional instrumental variable delivers similar results. In addition, we decompose wealth into liquid and illiquid wealth. Despite the health effect being higher for liquid than for non-liquid wealth, none of these measures involve substantial or significant effects on health.

C26|Unemployed or Disabled? Disability Screening and Labor Market Outcomes of Youths|This paper examines the effect of being granted temporary disability insurance (TDI), as opposed to a non-health related benefit, on later labor market outcomes of youths who are seeking temporary income support from the state. In Norway, there has been a development over time towards a more lenient screening to TDI, and this development has been more pronounced in some municipalities than in others. Using local screening leniency as an instrument for TDI receipt, I find that being granted TDI benefits significantly reduces later labor market attachment of youths whose benefit receipt would differ according to their municipality of residence, and the year of entry to the benefit system.

C26|Améliorer la prise en charge sanitaire et sociale des personnes âgées : impact des plans personnalisés de santé sur les parcours de soins|Assurer une prise en charge sanitaire et sociale adaptée aux besoins des personnes âgées est un enjeu majeur des politiques publiques. Dans le cadre des expérimentations Parcours santé des aînés (Paerpa), lancées en 2014 pour améliorer la prise en charge des personnes âgées en « risque de perte d’autonomie », un outil de coordination, le Plan personnalisé de santé (PPS), a été proposé. Le PPS est un outil innovant qui a pour objectif d’améliorer la coordination et la continuité des prises en charge sanitaires et sociales, et ainsi de prévenir la perte d’autonomie, d'éviter le recours inapproprié à l’hospitalisation et la polymédication. Notre étude vise à évaluer l’impact de la réalisation d’un PPS sur les parcours de soins en observant l’évolution de la consommation de soins et de la qualité de prise en charge des personnes âgées qui en bénéficient. L’évaluation est réalisée à partir des données de consommation inter-régime de l’Assurance maladie appariées aux bases de données hospitalières de 2014 à 2017. Nous développons une analyse en doubles différences après appariement afin de mesurer la différence d’évolution entre les traités et les témoins, avant et après la réalisation du PPS. Afin de s’affranchir du biais de sélection pouvant persister à cause du manque de données sociales et d’état de santé dans les bases de données dont nous disposons, nous introduisons dans l’analyse un instrument qui exploite les différences de diffusion du PPS auprès des médecins généralistes entre les communes des territoires Paerpa. Nos résultats montrent que les personnes âgées qui ont bénéficié du PPS ont des besoins complexes, nécessitant une prise en charge sanitaire et médico-sociale. On observe un impact direct du PPS sur les dépenses d’infirmières à domicile qui augmentent significativement dans la première année suivant le PPS, sans se traduire par une augmentation des dépenses globales en ville, puisqu'il s'accompagne d'une réduction des dépenses de soins de généralistes et de médicaments. En revanche, on ne constate aucun effet significatif du PPS sur les hospitalisations évitables, la polymédication et le recours aux urgences. Au regard de nos résultats et des remontées des informations des territoires pilotes, le PPS semble être un outil mobilisé par les professionnels de santé de premier recours pour enclencher une prise en charge médico-sociale et sociale au domicile de la personne. Mais pour assurer la qualité et la continuité de la prise en charge globale, il serait important de créer des passerelles plus formalisées avec les médecins spécialistes et les acteurs hospitaliers.
C26|New Evidence on Long-Term Effects of Start-Up Subsidies: Matching Estimates and their Robustness|The German start-up subsidy (SUS) program for the unemployed has recently undergone a major make-over, altering its institutional setup, adding an additional layer of selection and leading to ambiguous predictions of the program’s effectiveness. Using propensity score matching (PSM) as our main empirical approach, we provide estimates of long-term effects of the post-reform subsidy on individual employment prospects and labor market earnings up to 40 months after entering the program. Our results suggest large and persistent long-term effects of the subsidy on employment probabilities and net earned income. These effects are larger than what was estimated for the pre-reform program. Extensive sensitivity analyses within the standard PSM framework reveal that the results are robust to different choices regarding the implementation of the weighting procedure and also with respect to deviations from the conditional independence assumption. As a further assessment of the results’ sensitivity, we go beyond the standard selection-on-observables approach and employ an instrumental variable setup using regional variation in the likelihood of receiving treatment. Here, we exploit the fact that the reform increased the discretionary power of local employment agencies in allocating active labor market policy funds, allowing us to obtain a measure of local preferences for SUS as the program of choice. The results based on this approach give rise to similar estimates. Thus, our results indicating that SUS are still an effective active labor market program after the reform do not appear to be driven by “hidden bias”.
C26|Military Intervention via Drone Strikes|We study the 420 US drone strikes in Pakistan from 2006-2016, isolating causal effects on terrorism, anti-US sentiment, and radicalization via an instrumental variable strategy based on wind. Drone strikes are suggested to encourage terrorism in Pakistan, bearing responsibility for 16 percent of all attacks or 2,964 terror deaths. Exploring mechanisms, we distinguish between insiders (members of terrorist organizations) and outsiders (the Pakistani populace). Analyzing data from a leading Pakistani newspaper, anti-US protests, and Google searches, drone strikes appear to increase anti-US sentiment and radicalization: Outsiders seem to sympathize with insiders because of drone strikes.
C26|The effect of education on health: Evidence from the 1997 compulsory schooling reform in Turkey|This paper analyzes the relationship between education and health outcomes using a natural experiment in Turkey. The compulsory schooling increased from 5 to 8 years in 1997. This increase was accompanied by a massive construction of classrooms and recruitment of teachers in a differential rate across regions. As in previous studies, we confirm that the 1997 reform substantially increased education in Turkey. Using the number of new middle school class openings per 1000 children as an intensity measure for the 1997 reform, we find that, on average, one additional middle school class increases the probability of completion of 8 years or more of schooling by about 7.1 percentage points. We use this exogenous increase in the educational attainment to investigate the impact of education on body mass index, obesity, smoking behavior, and self-rated health, as well as the effect of maternal education on the infant's well-being. Using ordinary least squares, we find that there is a statistically significant favorable effect of education on health outcomes and behavior. However, this relationship becomes insignificant when we account for the endogeneity of education and health by instrumenting education with exogenous variations generated by the 1997 reform and the accompanying middle school class openings. The insignificance of the health effect may be due to lack of statistical power in our data, or to the fact that this policy affects only relatively low levels of schooling and the health effects of education need to be examined at higher levels of schooling.
C26|The Effects of Stepwise Minimum Legal Drinking Age Legislation on Mortality: Evidence from Germany|"This study investigates the short-term mortality effects of two age-based restrictions on legal access to alcohol in Germany. We exploit sharp differences in legal access to alcohol at 16 and 18 years by implementing a regression discontinuity design. We find discontinuous increases in deaths at both age cutoffs, which are mainly driven by a ""novice driver effect"", whereas legal access to alcohol plays a marginal role at most. Overall, our results indicate that a stepwise introduction to alcohol has, at most, a minor impact on drunk driving and mortality at age 16 and 18 years. This study thus provides fresh impetus to the ongoing debate on the ""optimal"" MLDA legislation."
C26|Inference with Arbitrary Clustering|Analyses of spatial or network data are now very common. Nevertheless, statistical inference is challenging since unobserved heterogeneity can be correlated across neighboring observational units. We develop an estimator for the variance-covariance matrix (VCV) of OLS and 2SLS that allows for arbitrary dependence of the errors across observations in space or network structure and across time periods. As a proof of concept, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations in a geospatial setting based on U.S. metropolitan areas. Tests based on our estimator of the VCV asymptotically correctly reject the null hypothesis, whereas conventional inference methods, e.g., those without clusters or with clusters based on administrative units, reject the null hypothesis too often. We also provide simulations in a network setting based on the IDEAS structure of coauthorship and real-life data on scientific performance. The Monte Carlo results again show that our estimator yields inference at the correct significance level even in moderately sized samples and that it dominates other commonly used approaches to inference in networks. We provide guidance to the applied researcher with respect to (i) whether or not to include potentially correlated regressors and (ii) the choice of cluster bandwidth. Finally, we provide a companion statistical package (acreg) enabling users to adjust the OLS and 2SLS coefficient's standard errors to account for arbitrary dependence.
C26|Short-term household income mobility before and after the Great Recession: A four-country study|This paper analyses short-term intra-generational income mobility in France, Italy, Spain and the UK by exploiting the longitudinal component of EU-SILC for the periods 2005-2008 and 2012-2015. We investigate whether and to what extent the ability of households to move along the income distribution changed after the 2008 crisis and whether heterogeneities among countries exist. For this purpose, we employ mobility indexes and transition matrices as well as estimation of a 2SLS regression and of a dynamic ordered probit with random effects. Overall, indexes and transition matrices point to a decrease of mobility in the aftermath of the crisis. The econometric analyses suggest both the existence of a convergence process of incomes and state dependence of current and lagged income in both periods. We also observe sluggish income convergence and lower upward mobility in the second period. Among the microeconomic drivers, education and employment status are positive determinants of mobility. Finally, our results confirm cross-country heterogeneity.
C26|Judging Judge Fixed Effects|"We propose a test for the identifying assumptions invoked in designs based on random assignment to one of many ""judges.'' We show that standard identifying assumptions imply that the conditional expectation of the outcome given judge assignment is a continuous function with bounded slope of the judge propensity to treat. The implication leads to a two-part test that generalizes the Sargan-Hansen overidentification test and assesses whether implied treatment effects across the range of judge propensities are possible given the domain of the outcome. We show the asymptotic validity of the testing procedure, demonstrate its finite-sample performance in simulations, and apply the test in an empirical setting examining the effects of pre-trial release on defendant outcomes in Miami. When the assumptions are not satisfied, we propose a weaker average monotonicity assumption under which IV still converges to a proper weighted average of treatment effects."
C26|Identification of Causal Effects with Multiple Instruments: Problems and Some Solutions|Empirical researchers often combine multiple instruments for a single treatment using two stage least squares (2SLS). When treatment effects are heterogeneous, a common justification for including multiple instruments is that the 2SLS estimand can still be interpreted as a positively-weighted average of local average treatment effects (LATEs). This justification requires the well-known monotonicity condition. However, we show that with more than one instrument, this condition can only be satisfied if choice behavior is effectively homogenous. Based on this finding, we consider the use of multiple instruments under a weaker, partial monotonicity condition. This condition is implied by standard choice theory and allows for richer heterogeneity. First, we show that the weaker partial monotonicity condition can still suffice for the 2SLS estimand to be a positively-weighted average of LATEs. We characterize a simple sufficient and necessary condition that empirical researchers can check to ensure positive weights. Second, we develop a general method for using multiple instruments to identify a wide range of causal parameters other than LATEs. The method allows researchers to combine multiple instruments to obtain more informative empirical conclusions than one would obtain by using each instrument separately.
C26|Estimating the effect of treatments allocated by randomized waiting lists|Oversubscribed treatments are often allocated using randomized waiting lists. Applicants are ranked randomly, and treatment offers are made following that ranking until all seats are filled. To estimate causal effects, researchers often compare applicants getting and not getting an offer. We show that those two groups are not statistically comparable. Therefore, the estimator arising from that comparison is inconsistent. We propose a new estimator, and show that it is consistent. Finally, we revisit an application, and we show that using our estimator can lead to sizably different results from those obtained using the commonly used estimator.
C26|Financialization, Corporate Governance and Employee Pay: A Firm Level Analysis|This study explores the link between financialization and employee wages. Using a panel of European banks from Bankscope we test whether banks use leverage strategically in order to refrain wage increases, focusing on the strategic use of banks’ capital structure as a disciplinary mechanism. The results indicate the existence of a negative and significant effect of leverage on average employee wages. In addition, considering that the effects of leverage could depend on individual bank risk, we extend our analysis to distressed banks, using the z-score as a measure to distinguish banks that are more prone to bankruptcy. We also observe that leverage is statistically significant when relating to average wages; however the impact does not differ in magnitude in comparison to non-distressed banks.

C26|The growth effect of trade openness on African countries: evidence from using an Instrumental Variable Panel Smooth Transition Model|This paper assesses the relationship between trade openness and economic growth in Africa by accounting for the heterogeneity of African countries. In addition, the paper contributes to the literature of trade openness and economic growth nexus by applying the instrumental variable panel smooth transition regression (IVPSTR), a methodology that accounts for nonlinearity and endogeneity in the relationship between the two variables. The results of the empirical analysis reveal that the level of investment is a channel through which trade openness affects economic growth in the African continent. In addition, the relationship between trade openness and economic growth varies according to the degree of a country’s development in Africa. For low-income countries, the study finds no significant relationship between openness and growth. Conversely, for middle and upper-income countries, the coefficients of trade indicators are positive and statistically significant. The results indicate that African countries are not homogenous, especially with regard to trade openness and economic growth nexus.
C26|Microeconometric Dynamic Panel Data Methods: Model Specification and Selection Issues|A motivated strategy is presented to find step by step an adequate model specification and a matching set of instrumental variables by applying the programming tools provided by the Stata package Xtabond2. The aim is to implement generalized method of moment techniques such that useful and reasonably accurate inferences are extracted from an observational panel data set on a single microeconometric structural presumably dynamic behavioral relationship. In the suggested specification search three comprehensive heavily interconnected goals are pursued, namely: (i) to include all the relevant appropriately transformed possibly lagged regressors, as well as any interactions between these if it is required to relax the otherwise very strict homogeneity restrictions on the dynamic impacts of the explanatories in standard linear panel data models; (ii) to correctly classify all regressors as either endogenous, predetermined or exogenous, as well as being either effect-stationary or effect-nonstationary, implying which internal variables could represent valid and relatively strong instruments; (iii) to enhance the accuracy of inference in finite samples by omitting irrelevant regressors and by profitably reducing the space spanned by the full set of available internal instruments. For the various tests which trigger the decisions to be made in the sequential selection process the relevant considerations are spelled out to interpret the magnitude of p-values. Also the complexities to establish and interpret the ultimately established dynamic impacts are explained. Finally the developed strategy is applied to a classic data set and is shown to yield new insights.
C26|Immigration and the economic performance of countries|Using a global dataset of over 100 developed and developing countries, we attempt to identify the nexus between immigration and the economic performance of countries, as proxied by export sophistication. To isolate causal effects, we use instruments obtained from a pseudo-gravity model of bilateral immigration in the spirit of Frankel and Rose (2002). Employing an extensive set of institutional, demographic, climate and disease controls, we find that countries with high immigrant concentrations tend to exhibit lower performance.
C26|Alternative Boomerang Kids, Intergenerational Co-residence, and Maternal Labor Supply|This study investigates the boomerang phenomenon among adult children in Thailand. We estimate the effect of having children on co-residence between parents and adult children using Socio-Economic Survey panel data. We find that adult children who have moved out tend to move back in with their parents after having children to save time and money on childcare. The presence of young children increases the likelihood of intergenerational co-residence by over 30%. This study is the first to provide empirical evidence of boomerang kids in an Asian context, which is distinctive compared with Western countries. The relationship between intergenerational co-residence and the maternal labor supply is also examined using the instrumental variable approach based on the cross-sectional Labor Force Survey, which has data covering over 30 years. Our results show that co-residence increases the female labor supply by 21% and also extends women's working hours by 10 hours.
C26|"""Gold Miss"" or ""Earthy Mom""? Evidence from Thailand"|"This paper investigates the impact of Thai women's education on their marriage behavior and fertility. It first uses the panel data set from the Socio-Economic Survey to estimate the effect of education on the marriage market. The result from applying the individual fixed effect estimation indicates that obtaining a university degree decreases the probability of women's marriage, emphasizing the rise of the ""Gold Miss"" phenomenon in Thailand. The cross-sectional data set from the Labor Force Survey examines the effect of education on fertility. By applying both the instrumental variable using the compulsory education reform as an instrument and pseudo-panel approaches to take into account the endogeneity of schooling, the result shows that education causally reduces fertility, which provides a convincing sequential explanation for the dramatic decline in fertility in Thailand."
C26|Testing for information asymmetry in the mortgage servicing market|Our main objective is to test for evidence of information asymmetry in the mortgage servicing market. Does the sale of mortgage servicing rights (MSR) by the initial lender to a second servicing institution unveil any residual asymmetric information? We analyze the originator’s selling choice of MSR using a large sample of U.S. mortgages that were privately securitized during the period of January 2000 to December 2013 (more than 5 million observations). Our econometric methodology is mainly non-parametric and the main test for the presence of information asymmetry is driven by kernel density estimation techniques (Su and Spindler, 2013). We also employ the non-parametric testing procedure of Chiappori and Salanié (2000). For robustness, we present parametric tests to corroborate our results after controlling for observable risk characteristics, for econometric misspecification error, and for endogeneity issues using instrumental variables. Our empirical results provide strong support for the presence of second-stage asymmetric information in the mortgage servicing market.
C26|Inference in partially identiﬁed panel data models with interactive fixed eﬀects|This paper develops methods for statistical inferences in a partially identiﬁed nonparametric panel data model with endogeneity and interactive ﬁxed eﬀects. We consider the case where the number of cross-sectional units (N) is large and the number of time series periods (T).as well as the number of unobserved common factors (R) are ﬁxed. Under some normalization rules, wecan concentrateout thelarge dimen-sional parameter vector of factor loadings and specify a set of conditional moment restriction that are involved with only the ﬁnite dimensional factor parameters along with the inﬁnite dimensional nonpara-metric component. For a conjectured restriction on the parameter, we consider testing the null hypothesis that the restriction is satisﬁed by at least one element in the identiﬁed set and propose a test statistic based on a novel martingale diﬀerence divergence (MDD) measure for the distance between a conditional expectation object and zero. We derive the limiting distribution of the resultant test statistic under the null and show that it is divergent at rate-N under the global alternative based on the U-process theory. To obtain the critical values for our test, we propose a version of multiplier bootstrap and establish its asymptotic validity. Simulations demonstrate the ﬁnite sample properties of our inference procedure. We apply our method to study Engel curves for major nondurable expenditures in China by using a panel dataset from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS).
C26|Further evidence of the relationship between social transfers and income inequality in OECD countries|In this paper, we have revised the estimates of the effects of social transfers on income inequality. We have accounted for reverse causality using an instrumental variable derived via a theoretical model, which identifies the main driver of social transfers from the interaction between the electoral system and the coalition or party winning the election, and have estimated, in the OECD countries, that a 1\% increase in the share of social transfers reduces income inequality by one-half of a percentage point. This result appears to be robust to different components of expenditure, alternative model specifications and falsification tests. Only countries with a high corruption level appear to violate this empirical regularity. Our estimates show that bureaucratic inefficiencies caused by corruption are responsible for the lack of benefit of social transfers on economic inequality.
C26|Troubled in school: does maternal involvement matter for adolescents?|We estimate the causal effect of motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involvement on the amount of trouble an adolescent experiences in school. We use multiple measures of school-trouble and factor analysis to construct a composite and then link this composite with non-cognitive skills. Our measure of motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involvement encompasses discussing school-related matters and providing help with school projects. Using an instrumental variable constructed from a suitably chosen peer group, our main finding is that an increase in maternal involvement leads to a significant decrease in school trouble. We find this result to be robust across a large number of sensitivity tests designed to account for possible selection effects, shocks at the peer group level, and further potential violations of the exclusion restriction. Additionally, we present evidence suggesting that the effect of maternal involvement may operate through its effect on adolescentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ college aspirations, mental health, and the perception of parental warmth.
C26|What Time Use Surveys Can (And Cannot) Tell Us about Labor Supply|It has been widely acknowledged that the measurement of labor supply in the Current Population Survey (CPS) and other conventional microeconomic surveys has nonclassical measurement error, which will bias the estimates of crucial parameters in labor economics, such as labor supply elasticity. Time diary studies, such as the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), only have accurate measurement of hours worked on a single day, hence the weekly hours worked are unobserved. Despite the missing data problem, we provide several consistent estimators of the parameters in weekly labor supply equation using the information in the time use surveys. The consistency of our estimators does not require more conditions beyond those for a usual two stage least square (2SLS) estimator when the true weekly hours worked are observed. We also show that it is impossible to recover the weekly number of hours worked or its distribution function from time use surveys like the ATUS. In our empirical application we find considerable evidence of nonclassical measurement error in the hours worked in the CPS, and illustrate the consequences of using mismeasured weekly hours worked in empirical studies.
C26|Increasing Cigarette Taxes is Unfair to the Poor? Evidence from Argentina|Raising cigarette taxes is an important public policy to reduce the use of tobacco. The appeal of increasing cigarette taxes is obvious. Since smoking is bad for one’s health and for that of others as well, increasing prices, via taxes, will induce people to quit or cut back smoking improving their health. However, increasing cigarette taxes could also have bad consequences: they can be regressive. Increasing taxes could result in poor people paying a higher percentage of their income in taxes than do the rich. How much the increment in taxes reduces consumption and if it’s regressive are empirical questions. This paper investigates those issues for Argentina estimating total demand price elasticity for the whole sample and by income groups and then simulating an increase in cigarette taxes. The main results are, (1) total demand price elasticity estimation is around -0.28 implying that increasing prices by 10 percent, via taxes, induce a reduction of consumption of about 2.8 percent; (2) demand price elasticity estimations by income groups suggest that richer individuals are more price sensitive, in absolute value, than poorer ones with respect to consumption but they are less price sensitive with respect to prevalence; (3) increasing taxes on tobacco consumption is unfair to the poor since their welfare loss, measured by the change in consumer surplus, is 61 percent larger than the loss experienced by the richer individuals in the sample; (4) overall, the main policy recommendation is that the increment in taxes should be complemented with public health policies targeted towards the poor.
C26|Does higher Institutional Quality improve the Appropriateness of Healthcare Provision?|We study the effect of institutional quality on the appropriateness of healthcare provision in Italian hospitals. We focus on cesarean section rates for first-time mothers, which is a common indicator of appropriateness in healthcare and is vulnerable to providers’ opportunistic behaviors. To identify the causal effect of institutional quality we rely on an IV strategy based on historical instruments, exploiting the idea that current differences in institutional quality across regions have been shaped by different cultural and political histories. We find that a standard deviation increase in our indicator of institutional quality leads to a decrease of about 10 percentage points in cesarean section rates, implying an annual saving of about € 50 million. Our results are robust to different measures of institutional quality and samples.
C26|Is the future of work childless? Self-employment and fertility|The growth of self-employment and in particular gig work may explain part of the declining fertility rates observed in many countries. This study examines this question drawing on longitudinal data to compare women’s fertility, proxied by maternity leave uptake, when self-employed or wage workers. It considers the case of Portugal, which allows to focus on structural aspects of work types, as fertility-related social protection there does not discriminate between self-employment and wage work. Results indicate that there are no statistically significant differences in fertility between employees and self-employed women. These findings highlight the importance of social protection for the self-employed, at least as far as their fertility is concerned.
C26|Censored Quantile Instrumental Variable Estimation with Stata|Many applications involve a censored dependent variable and an endogenous independent variable. Chernozhukov et al. (2015) introduced a censored quantile instrumental variable estimator (CQIV) for use in those applications, which has been applied by Kowalski (2016), among others. In this article, we introduce a Stata command, cqiv, that simplifies application of the CQIV estimator in Stata. We summarize the CQIV estimator and algorithm, we describe the use of the cqiv command, and we provide empirical examples.
C26|On Heckits, LATE, and Numerical Equivalence|Structural econometric methods are often criticized for being sensitive to functional form assumptions. We study parametric estimators of the local average treatment effect (LATE) derived from a widely used class of latent threshold crossing models and show they yield LATE estimates algebraically equivalent to the instrumental variables (IV) estimator. Our leading example is Heckman's (1979) two‐step (“Heckit”) control function estimator which, with two‐sided non‐compliance, can be used to compute estimates of a variety of causal parameters. Equivalence with IV is established for a semiparametric family of control function estimators and shown to hold at interior solutions for a class of maximum likelihood estimators. Our results suggest differences between structural and IV estimates often stem from disagreements about the target parameter rather than from functional form assumptions per se. In cases where equivalence fails, reporting structural estimates of LATE alongside IV provides a simple means of assessing the credibility of structural extrapolation exercises.
C26|Shift-Share Designs: Theory and Inference|We study inference in shift-share regression designs, such as when a regional outcome is regressed on a weighted average of observed sectoral shocks, using regional sector shares as weights. We conduct a placebo exercise in which we estimate the effect of a shift-share regressor constructed with randomly generated sectoral shocks on actual labor market outcomes across U.S. Commuting Zones. Tests based on commonly used standard errors with 5% nominal significance level reject the null of no effect in up to 55% of the placebo samples. We use a stylized economic model to show that this overrejection problem arises because regression residuals are correlated across regions with similar sectoral shares, independently of their geographic location. We derive novel inference methods that are valid under arbitrary cross-regional correlation in the regression residuals. We show that our methods yield substantially wider confidence intervals in popular applications of shift-share regression designs.
C26|Quasi-Experimental Shift-Share Research Designs|"Many empirical studies leverage shift-share (or ""Bartik"") instruments that average a set of observed shocks with shock exposure weights. We derive a necessary and sufficient shock-level orthogonality condition for these instruments to identify causal effects. We then show that orthogonality holds when observed shocks are as-good-as-randomly assigned and growing in number, with the average shock exposure sufficiently dispersed. Quasi-experimental shift-share designs may be implemented with new shock-level procedures, which help visualize the identifying variation, correct standard errors, choose appropriate specifications, test identifying assumptions, and optimally combine multiple sets of quasi-random shocks. We illustrate these ideas by revisiting Autor et al. (2013)'s analysis of the labor market effects of Chinese import competition"
C26|Replication and reconciling of the CICE evaluations on employment (2013-2014)|We reproduce the main estimates of the effects of the CICE (Tax Credit for Competitiveness and Employment) on employment presented by the TEPP and LIEPP teams for France Stratégie based on the methodological indications described in their first research reports (september 2016 and march 2017). After the reconstitution of the samples, globally validated by comparisons in descriptive statistics, we reproduce their different empirical strategies. The effects on employment reproduced are consistent with the results presented by TEPP: positive, significant and of the same order of magnitude for the firms most exposed to the CICE (fourth quartile of exposure to the CICE). On the other hand, the effects on employment by socio-professional category do not reproduce the results of TEPP. For LIEPP, the replication of the methodology leads to results similar to those presented in their report on aggregate employment in 2013 and 2014 (no significant and positive effect), and as well as on the breakdown by socio-professional category. We then compare the specifications of the two teams. The differences in results persist on a common sample, and are robust to the linear or non-linear specification of the treatment. However, we observe a particular sensitivity of the results to the presence or absence of past productivity of firms, in level, among the explanatory variables of employment growth. We present two reconciled specifications that lead to consistent results, shedding light on origins of the divergence. We do not conclude on employment effects of the CICE, as the work of the two teams is still ongoing.
C26|Choix du régime de change et croissance économique : Une analyse empirique sur des données de panel africaines<BR>[Exchange Rate Regime Choice and Economic Growth: An Empirical Analysis on African Panel Data]|The story of the choice of exchange rate regimes has not yet come to a consensus. Between early works on the subject (Mundell, 1961; McKinnon, 1963) and the most recent (Frenkel, 2017; Guzman et al., 2017), no superiority of a foreign exchange regime on the others is established ad vitam aeternam. It’s case by case. The purpose of this paper is then twofold. It first tests on panel data concerning 30 African countries the thesis of currency neutrality and attempts to rank, in case of rejection of this thesis, exchange rate regimes according to their economic performances by referring to economic growth rate. Next, it aims to list the internal structural characteristics of the panel countries which, by crossing them with exchange rate regimes, are the most favorable to economic growth. The paper concludes the absence of currency neutrality in case of African countries and an outperformance of intermediate regimes. The latter are more conductive to economic growth in the case of countries experiencing positive terms of trade shocks and benefiting from FDI inflows. On the other hand, the opening of capital account is incompatible with intermediate regimes, and external indebtedness doesn’t favor economic growth regardless of the exchange rate regime adopted. These results remain robust by testing several alternative econometric specifications (long-term estimate on five years’ window data, estimates by controlling regional effects and by adopting finer aggregations of exchange rate regimes).

C26|Workers of the world unite (or not?) The effect of ethnic diversity on the participation in trade unions|This paper advances the hypothesis that workers participate less in trade unions in more ethnically fragmented societies. This hypothesis dates back at least to Marx and Engels who first suggested that increased ethnic and racial antipathies among workers undermine class consciousness and weaken the unity of the working class in the United States. Building on a set of innovative instruments derived from biogeography and more precisely the parasite-stress theory of values and sociality (Fincher and Thornhill, 2008), our analysis seeks to exploit exogenous sources of variations in ethnic diversity and establish a convincing relationship between ethnic diversity and trade union density across countries. In turn, our analysis investigates the above mentioned relationship by using the European Social Survey (ESS) dataset and in particular a sample of migrants of different ancestry residing in ESS countries. Consistent with the prediction of the theory, both layers of the empirical analysis provide evidence of a strong, negative and highly significant relationship between ethnic diversity and the decision of the workers to participate in trade unions. Obtained empirical findings remain highly robust across a number of alternative empirical specifications and estimation techniques.
C26|Aide et Croissance dans les pays de l’Union Economique et Monétaire Ouest Africaine (UEMOA) : retour sur une relation controversée|"The main purpose of this paper is to analyze threshold effects of official development assistance (ODA) on economic growth in WAEMU zone countries. To achieve this, the study is based on OECD and WDI data covering the period 1980-2015 and used Hansen's Panel Threshold Regression (PTR) model to "" bootstrap "" aid threshold above which its effectiveness is effective. The evidence strongly supports the view that the relationship between aid and economic growth is non-linear with a unique threshold which is 12.74% GDP. Above this value, the marginal effect of aid is 0.69 points, "" all things being equal to otherwise "". One of the main contribution of this paper is to show that WAEMU countries need investments that could be covered by the foreign aid. This later one should be considered just as a complementary resource. Thus, WEAMU countries should continue to strengthen their efforts in internal resource mobilization in order to fulfil this need."
C26|Younger and Dissatisfied? Relative Age and Life-satisfaction in Adolescence|This is the first study to investigate whether age gaps between classmates (that is, relative age) affect life-satisfaction gaps in adolescence. To this end, we analyse data from the multi-country Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) survey. We find evidence that relative age negatively impacts adolescents’ life-satisfaction. A twelve-month age gap decreases life-satisfaction, rated on a 0-10 scale, by 0.3 points. This negative effect is consistent across countries. Finally, this negative effect does not decrease with the increase in absolute age.
C26|Returns to schooling in Bangladesh revisited: An instrumental variable quantile regression approach|The paper focuses on estimation of returns to schooling in the Bangladesh context. Earlier articles which tried to quantify the returns were constrained by a number of limitations including measurement techniques that were deployed. The present article revisits the issue and makes an attempt to build on the earlier studies by making use of quantile regression and instrumental variable quantile regression methods. The paper finds that endogeneity problem leads to underestimation of the returns to schooling and the returns tend to vary along the wage distribution, which mean regression models fail to capture. The analysis shows that average returns to schooling for female is higher than that of male. The analysis also shows that returns to schooling tends to be higher as one moves along higher percentiles of wage distribution and this is true for both male and female.
C26|Regime heteroskedasticity in Bitcoin: A comparison of Markov switching models|Markov regime-switching (MRS) models, also known as hidden Markov models (HMM), are used extensively to account for regime heteroskedasticity within the returns of financial assets. However, we believe this paper to be one of the first to apply such methodology to the time series of cryptocurrencies. In light of Molnar and Thies (2018) demonstrating that the price data of Bitcoin contained seven distinct volatility regimes, we will �fit a sample of Bitcoin returns with six m-state MRS estimations, with m between 2 and 7. Our aim is to identify the optimal number of states for modelling the regime heteroskedasticity in the price data of Bitcoin. Goodness-of-�fit will be judged using three information criteria, namely: Bayesian (BIC); Hannan-Quinn (HQ); and Akaike (AIC). We determined that the restricted 5-state model generated the optimal estimation for the sample. In addition, we found evidence of volatility clustering, volatility jumps and asymmetric volatility transitions whilst also inferring the persistence of shocks in the price data of Bitcoin.
C26|Gender Wage Gap in The Agricultural Labor Market of India: An Empirical Analysis|The gender wage gap in the agricultural labor market is observed in all the states of India. This paper will try to identify possible policies which can reduce this gender wise wage discrimination in agricultural labor market. We consider the period between 2010-11 to 2015-16 and 18 major states of India. The possible factors which can create an impact on gender wage gap are the expansion of MGNREGP, Self Help Group, primary education among rural women, expenditure on the social sector as a percentage of Net state domestic products and the cropping intensity. It initially assumes that Cropping Intensity of a state in a specific time is very much dependent on the net irrigated area of that state in that time. Our endogeneity test supports our claim. So, Instrumental variable method is applied in our Fixed Effect panel regression. The result shows that expansion of primary education among women, the number of self-help groups in the state and enhancement of cropping intensity through improving irrigation facility can play a significant role to reduce the male and female wage discrimination in the agricultural labor market in India. But participation of women in MGNREGP and social sector expenditure as a percentage of NSDP fails to create any impact on the gender wage gap.
C26|Labour Supply of Married Women in Thailand: 1985-2016|This study investigates the labour supply behaviour of married Thai women with reference to their own and their spouse's wages. By utilising data of the national Labour Force Survey in Thailand from 1985 to 2016, the wage imputation technique and the instrumental variables approach are applied to correct sample selection and to alleviate endogeneity, common issues that cause bias in estimating female labour supply. By controlling for spousal education and number of children, the main findings indicate an inverse relationship between married women's labour supply and wages, contrary to the results found in most developed countries. The estimated own wage elasticity ranges from -1.70 to -2.40 and cross elasticity ranges from -0.16 to -0.17, indicating that the impact of own wage on labour supplied is much larger than spouse's wage. The results from disaggregation classified according to different socioeconomic backgrounds also show the negative elasticities between own and spouses' wage across all subgroups, except for those with university degrees and higher income.
C26|Regional Transfer Multipliers|A series of discontinuities in the allocation mechanism of federal transfers to municipal governments in Brazil allow us to identify the causal effect of public spending on local labor markets, using a 'fuzzy' Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD). Our estimates imply a cost per job of about 8,000 US dollars per year and a local income multiplier around two. The effect comes mostly from employment in services and is more pronounced among less financially developed municipalities.
C26|Estimating a non-neutral production function: a heterogeneous treatment effect approach|This paper addresses the issue of estimating a production function that allows us to depart from the standard hypothesis of Hicks neutrality while also coping with the endogeneity of a dummy innovation variable. We consider specifications that relax Hicks neutrality, and we derive the testable conditions for common parametric approximations under which Hicks neutrality holds. The model is estimated through instrumental variables methods, allowing for a heterogeneous effect of innovation on the production process. The econometric analysis rejects Hicks neutrality and highlights three main features: i) a capital-saving technology of innovative with respect to non-innovative firms, ii) a locally progressive technical change and iii) fully heterogeneous technologies when comparing innovative to non-innovative firms.
C26|Better off at home? Effects of a nursing home admission on costs, hospitalizations and survival|Aging-in-place policies substitute home care for nursing home admissions (NHA). They appear to be a win-win by keeping public spending in check and being in line with personal preferences, but have hitherto not been evaluated. We study the impact of NHA eligibility using Dutch administrative data and exploiting variation between randomly assigned assessors in their tendency to grant admission. The impact on mortality is zero, but with considerable effect heterogeneity. Moreover, aging-in-place policies come at the cost of increased curative care, especially hospital admissions, and do not reduce total healthcare spending, suggesting they may not be a win-win after all.
C26|Autonomous Demand and the Investment Share|This paper looks at the effect of demand shocks on the investment share of the economy. Using panel data on 20 OECD countries, we show that the rate of growth of autonomous demand (exports, public spending and housing investment) is positively correlated with subsequent values of the share of business investment in GDP. By means of an instrumental-variables strategy, we confirm a positive effect of demand dynamics on the business investment share. We instrument autonomous demand with US demand for imports interacted with exposure to trade with the US, openness to trade of a country’s main export destinations, and military spending. A permanent 1% increase in autonomous demand growth raises the investment share by 1.5 to 1.9 percentage points of GDP in our preferred panel IV specification. Our results provide empirical support for the view that the influence of aggregate demand on capital accumulation can be a major source of hysteresis. Our results are inconsistent with the canonical New Keynesian 3-equations model, the Neo-Kaleckian model with flexible equilibrium utilization and Classical-Marxian growth models. A positive influence of autonomous demand on the investment share is instead compatible with demand-led models in which capacity adjusts to demand in the long-run.

C26|Health shocks and labour market outcomes: evidence from professional football|The negative association between health shocks and labour market outcomes is a well-established finding in the health and labour economics literatures. However, due to lack of data, most of the contributions focus on elderly workers and analyse labour force participation as their main outcome. This paper uses traumatic injuries as a source of exogenous variation in professional football playersâ€™ health to provide estimates of the causal impact of a health shock on two main labour market outcomes: annual net wages and the probability of renegotiating the contract between club and player. We have built a unique longitudinal dataset recording information about wages, injuries and other characteristics of the universe of professional football players in the Italian Serie A from 2009 to 2014. We employ panel fixed effects models combined with an IV strategy, which uses the average number of yellow cards received by the team as an instrument. We find that injuries reduce the net wage in the following season by around 12%. This result is mainly driven by precautionary reasons due to the clubâ€™s concern about depreciation in the playerâ€™s human capital rather than by a direct effect of the shock on the playerâ€™s productivity.
C26|Tracking pupils into adulthood: selective schools and long-term well-being in the 1958 British cohort|We explore the effect of tracking pupils by ability into different secondary schools on adult health, well-being and labour outcomes in England. We address selection bias by balancing individual pre-treatment characteristics via entropy matching, followed by parametric regressions estimated via OLS and IV approaches. Ability tracking does not affect long-term health and well-being, while it marginally raises hourly wages for low-ability pupils, compared to a mixed-ability system. Cognitive and non-cognitive abilities measured prior to secondary school are more significant and positive predictors of adult outcomes. Particularly, non-cognitive skills may have a protective role for adult health for lower cognitive ability children.
C26|Overeducation Wage Penalty among Ph.D. Holders: An Unconditional Quantile Regression Analysis on Italian Data|The wage effect of job-education vertical mismatch (i.e. overeducation) has only recently been investigated in the case of Ph.D. holders. The existing contributions rely on OLS estimates that allow measuring the average effect of being mismatched at the mean of the conditional wages distribution. This paper, instead, observes the heterogeneity of the overeducation penalty along the wage distribution and according to Ph.D. holders' study field and sector of employment (academic/non-academic). We implement a Recentered Influence Function (RIF) to estimate an hourly wage equation and compare PhD holders who are over-educated with those who are not. The results reveal that overeducation hits the wages of those Ph.D. holders who are employed in the academic sector and in non-R&D jobs outside of the academic sector. Instead, no penalty exists among those who carry out R&D outside the Academia. The size of the penalty is higher among those who are in the mid-top of the wage distribution and hold a Social Science and Humanities specialization.
C26|The effect of self-employment on health: Instrumental variables analysis of longitudinal social security data|"The growth of novel flexible work formats raises a number of questions about their effects upon health and the potential public policy implications. However, answering these questions is hampered by data and identification constraints. This is the first paper that draws on comprehensive longitudinal administrative data to examine the impact of self-employment in terms of health. In addition to variation in work status of each individual over time, we also consider variation driven by a number of novel instrumental variables. We also focus on an objective health outcome |hospital admissions| that is not subject to recall or other biases that may affect previous studies. Our findings, based on a representative sample of over 100,000 individuals followed monthly from 2005 to 2011 in Portugal, indicate that self-employment tends to reduce the likelihood of hospital admission by at least half."
C26|Fertility Transitions in Developing Countries: Convergence, Timing, and Causes|This paper studies the dynamics of fertility in 180 countries in the period 1950-2015 and investigates the determinants of the onset of fertility transitions. The application of Phillips and Sul's (2007) test to fertility rates provides evidence of convergence in three groups of countries. This information is used to distinguish the transitioning countries from those not transitioning. The estimation of the year of onset of the fertility transition is followed by an econometric analysis of the causes of this event. Instrumental-variable estimates show that increasing female education and reduced infant mortality are important determinants of fertility decline, while per-capita GDP has probably worked in the opposite direction. The instruments for per-capita income are the trade-weighted world income (Acemoglu et al., 2008) and the oil price shock (Brueckner and Schwandt, 2015). Mortality is instrumented with the predicted mortality (Acemoglu and Johnson, 2007), and mothers' education with the years of schooling of people aged 40-64. These results are confirmed by the application of Lewbel's (2012) methods where identification is based on heteroskedasticity.
C26|Younger and Dissatisfied? Relative Age and Life-satisfaction in Adolescence|This is the first study to investigate whether age gaps between classmates (that is, relative age) affect life-satisfaction gaps in adolescence. To this end, we analyse data from the multi-country Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) survey. We find evidence that relative age negatively impacts adolescents’ life-satisfaction. A twelve-month age gap decreases life-satisfaction, rated on a 0-10 scale, by 0.3 points. This negative effect is consistent across countries. Finally, this negative effect does not decrease with the increase in absolute age.
C26|North-South trade agreements and the quality of institutions: Panel data evidence|Since 1990, not only the number of signed preferential trade agreements (PTAs) has increased, but also their depth. That means, PTAs include comprehensive rules, which go way beyond tariff reductions, such as property rights, competition or investment provisions. This paper argues that especially in North-South agreements there is a diffusion of institutional quality from developed to developing countries. First, a PTA may affect institutions because it can serve as a network for political exchange and second, the regulations and commitments stipulated in it may affect local institutions in the South. I empirically investigate if there are positive effects of being a member in a PTA on the quality of institutions in developing countries by accounting for the number and the depth of PTAs using the Design of Trade Agreements (DESTA) database, established by Dür, Baccini and Elsig (2014). I create a large panel data set covering 32 years to account for endogeneity of several controls. The results support the hypothesis that deep PTAs lead to an improved quality of institutions in the South. The results differ with respect to the type of agreement and region.
C26|Heterogeneity in the price response of residential electricity demand: A dynamic approach for Germany|To provide the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of price policies, this paper contributes to the literature by estimating the heterogeneity in the response of residential electricity demand to price increases across household types. Drawing on household panel data from the German Residential Energy Consumption Survey (GRECS) that span over nine years (2006-2014), we gauge the response of residential electricity demand to price increases on the basis of the dynamic Blundell-Bond estimator to account for potential simultaneity and endogeneity problems, as well as Nickell bias. Estimating short- and long-run price elasticities of -0.44 and -0.66, respectively, our results indicate that price measures may be effective in dampening residential electricity consumption, particularly in the long run. Yet, we also find that responses to price changes are very heterogeneous across household groups, an outcome that has important implications for policy-making. Most notably, we do not find any significant price response for lowincome households.
C26|Does the internet increase the job finding rate? Evidence from a period of internet expansion|We examine the impact of household access to the internet on job finding rates in Germany during a period (2006_2009) in which internet access increased rapidly, and job-seekers in-creased their use of the internet as a search tool. During this period, household access to the internet was almost completely dependent on connection to a particular technology (DSL). We therefore exploit the variation in connection rates across municipalities as an instrument for household access to the internet. OLS estimates which control for differences in individual and local area characteristics suggest a job-finding advantage of about five percentage points. The IV estimates are substantially larger, but much less precisely estimated. However, we cannot reject the hypothesis that, conditional on observables, residential computer access with internt was as good as randomly assigned with respect to the job-finding rate. The hypothesis that residential computer access with internet helped job-seekers find work because of its affect on the job search process is supported by the finding that residential internet access greatly increased the use of the internet as a search method. We find some evidence that computer access reduced the use of traditional job search methods, but this effect is outweighed by the increase in internet-based search methods.
C26|The Effects of a Parenting Program on Maternal Well-Being: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial|This paper evaluates how the Triple P parenting program affects maternal well-being. We analyze data from a randomized controlled trial and a separate sample of mothers from a deprived neighborhood without a control group. For the latter, we generate a control group using SOEP survey data and evaluate the validity of this procedure. Overall, our results show a positive effect of Triple P on maternal well-being – with the largest effects appearing three years after treatment. Thus, we illustrate that maternal well-being is an additional channel through which parenting programs, as examples of early childhood interventions, benefit families.
C26|Inequality and Extremist Voting: Evidence from Germany|This paper studies the impact of economic inequality on political polarization. Using a unique dataset covering different measures of regional income inequality as well as federal and state election outcomes at the county level in Germany, we investigate whether inequality influences the share of votes for right-wing and left-wing extremist parties using instrumental variable estimation. Our results suggest that an increase in income inequality has a sizeable influence on the support for extremist parties. The poorer a county is compared to the national average, the higher is the share of votes both nationalist and leftist parties receive. Our findings thus indicate that the rise in economic inequality may be a threat to political stability.
C26|Do Digital Information Technologies Help Unemployed Job Seekers Find a Job? Evidence from the Broadband Internet Expansion in Germany|This paper studies effects of the introduction of a new digital mass medium on reemployment of unemployed job seekers. We combine data on high-speed (broadband) internet availability at the local level with individual register data on the unemployed in Germany. We address endogeneity by exploiting technological peculiarities in the network that affected the roll-out of high-speed internet. The results show that high-speed internet improves reemployment rates after the first months of the unemployment spell. This is confirmed by complementary analysis with individual survey data suggesting that online job search leads to additional formal job interviews after a few months in unemployment.
C26|Threshold Regression with Endogeneity for Short Panels|This paper considers the estimation of dynamic threshold regression models with fixed effects using short panel data. We examine a two-step method, where the threshold parameter is estimated nonparametrically at the N -rate and the remaining parameters are estimated by GMM at the N -rate. We provide simulation results that illustrate advantages of the new method in comparison with pure GMM estimation. The simulations also highlight the importance of the choice of instruments in GMM estimation.
C26|The Response of European Energy Prices to ECB Monetary Policy|To our knowledge, this paper is the first to discuss the response of European energy commodity prices to unexpected monetary policy surprises from the European Central Bank (ECB). Using the Rigobon (2003) identification through heteroscedasticity method, we find a significant and positive response during the crisis period for Brent and coal. Similar results are obtained by other authors for European financial assets in this period. This result reinforces the idea that during this period, financial assets and some commodities positively responded to conventional and unconventional expansionary monetary policy measures, increasing confidence about the survival of the European monetary union. The remaining European energy commodities (electricity, EUAs, and natural gas prices) seem to be unaffected by monetary policy actions. We think these results are of interest to those economic agents and institutions involved in European energy markets and are especially important for the European Central Bank in order to predict the consequences of its monetary policy on the inflation objective.
C26|Agricultural Commercialization, Fertilizer Use and Non-Farm Employment: What Options for Smallholder Farmers in Nigeria?| Abstract Agricultural commercialization is necessary for increased agricultural intensification and productivity in Nigeria. However, there is paucity of empirical information on the effects of agricultural commercialization on input use, labor demand and engagement in non-farm employment across the country. This study examined the effects of agricultural commercialization at the household level on fertilizer use, demand for hired labor and participation in non-farm employment in Northern Nigeria. Household Commercialization Index (HCI), Two-stage Least Squares (2SLS) and Instrumental Variable (IV) estimations were used to analyze the primary data collected from 270 maize farming households in Kaduna and Kano States. The study revealed that commercialization had the potentials for increasing the demand for fertilizer usage and hired labor among maize farming households. However, it reduced the tendency for households to participate in non-farm employment. Smallholder commercialization of maize should therefore be promoted through adoption of complementary technologies that free labor from on-farm activities.

C26|From Rivers to Roads: Spatial Mismatch and Inequality of Opportunity in Urban Labor Markets of a Megacity|The spatial mismatch between residential locations and jobs can be particularly relevant for low-skilled individuals. In this paper, we first explore such phenomenon from the perspective of the distance of the residence to the geographic concentration of jobs, and locational disadvantages of the urban form itself. Such unequal conditions in the labor market present a great challenge for the spatial sustainability of the multiple equilibria achieved simultaneously at the labor and the housing markets. We estimate the main aspects that influence wage differentials among individuals, focusing on the role of accessibility on labor market outcomes. We suggest the inclusion of geographical characteristics as instruments to deal with endogeneity problems that arise in the estimation of urban price models. Our strategy is based on the inclusion of a specific geographic/historic variable as instrument, namely the river shore access to the first school built by the Jesuits in São Paulo, the city’s founding location. Geography acted as a determinant of the location of the transportation infrastructure in the region, so that the road and rail networks in the city present a strong spatial correlation with pre-urban “waterways”. Nowadays, the vast majority of rivers and creeks are covered with asphalt and cement, and economic agents are practically unaware of their existence.
C26|Quasi-Experimental Shift-Share Research Designs|Many empirical studies leverage shift-share (or “Bartik”) instruments that combine a set of aggregate shocks with measures of shock exposure. We derive a necessary and sufficient shock-level orthogonality condition for these instruments to identify causal effects. We then show that orthogonality holds when observed shocks are as-good-as-randomly assigned and growing in number, with the average shock exposure sufficiently dispersed. We recommend that practitioners implement quasi-experimental shift-share designs with new shock-level regressions, which help visualize identifying shock variation, correct standard errors, choose appropriate specifications, test identifying assumptions, and optimally combine multiple sets of quasi-random shocks. We illustrate these points by revisiting Autor et al. (2013)'s analysis of the labor market effects of Chinese import competition.
C26|Complete Subset Averaging with Many Instruments|We propose a two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator whose first stage is the equal-weight average over a complete subset with $k$ instruments among $K$ available, which we call the $\textit{complete subset averaging (CSA) 2SLS}$. The approximate mean squared error (MSE) is derived as a function of the subset size $k$ by the Nagar (1959) expansion. The CSA-2SLS estimator is obtained by choosing $k$ minimizing the sample counterpart of the approximate MSE. We show that this method achieves asymptotic optimality among the class of estimators with different subset sizes. A feature of equal-weight averaging is that all the instruments are used. To deal with averaging over irrelevant instruments, we generalize the approximate MSE under the presence of a possibly growing set of irrelevant instruments, which suggests to choose a smaller $k$ than otherwise. An extensive simulation experiment shows potentially huge improvement in the bias and the MSE by using the CSA-2SLS when instruments are correlated with each other and there exists large endogeneity. As an empirical illustration, we estimate the logistic demand function in Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) and find the estimated coefficient value is better supported by economic theory than other IV estimators.
C26|Land Use Regulation, the Redevelopment Premium and House Prices|The option to redevelop a residential property can carry a significant positive premium. Although the existing literature has examined how this redevelopment premium is affected by the inherent characteristics of a property, comparatively little research has focussed on how land use regulations (LURs) interact with these characteristics to affect property values. In this paper we study the effect of upzoning (i.e., a relaxation of restrictions on residential density) on property values using a rich dataset of residential sales transactions. To study the effects of this policy change, we embed a difference-in-differences structure within a hedonic pricing function, wherein the upzoning quasi-treatment is interacted with a commonly-used empirical proxy for the opportunity cost of redevelopment - site intensity (i.e., the ratio of improved value to the total value of the property). We find that upzoning signifcantly increased the redevelopment option and inflated the price of under-developed properties. But we also find that upzoning deflated the price of properties that were already intensively developed, suggesting that the increase in the redevelopment option was offset by concurrent effects of upzoning, such as disamenities from increased population density.
C26|Naturalization and labor market performance of immigrants in Germany|Naturalization may be a relevant policy instrument affecting immigrant integration in host‐country labor markets. We study the effect of naturalization on labor market outcomes of immigrants in Germany. We apply recent survey data and exploit a reform of naturalization rules in an instrumental variable estimation. In our sample of recent immigrants, linear regression yields positive correlations between naturalization and beneficial labor market outcomes. Once we account for the endogeneity of naturalization, most coefficients decline in magnitude and lose statistical significance: male immigrants’ labor market outcomes do not benefit significantly from naturalization. Naturalization reduces the risks of unemployment and welfare dependence for female immigrants. For males and females, the propensity to hold a permanent contract increases as a consequence of naturalization. The results are robust to modifications of samples and the instrument.
C26|A Note on Specification Testing in Some Structural Regression Models|There is a useful but not widely known framework for jointly implementing Durbin-Wu-Hausman exogeneity and Sargan-Hansen overidentification tests, as a single artificial regression. This note sets out the framework for linear models and discusses its extension to non-linear models.
C26|Elasticidad del ingreso corporativo gravable en Colombia|En este documento se estima la elasticidad de la utilidad de las empresas con respecto a la tasa efectiva marginal de tributación neta, en un contexto de frecuentes reformas tributarias. Esta medición es relevante, dado el amplio margen de maniobra que tienen las firmas para responder ante cambios en los impuestos, y por la importancia del impuesto de renta corporativo sobre la actividad económica y el balance fiscal. El análisis se realiza para las reformas tributarias implementadas en Colombia, durante el periodo 2008-2014, utilizando Mínimos Cuadrados en dos etapas y la Regresión por Cuantiles Edógena con Datos Panel. Los cálculos de las tasas efectivas marginales de tributación muestran que la carga tributaria que recae sobre las empresas es inferior a la tasa estatutaria definida por la ley, debido a las deducciones establecidas en el estatuto tributario. Por su parte, los resultados de las elasticidades señalan que las respuestas de las firmas dependen de la reforma evaluada y de las características de las empresas. **** In this paper, we estimate the elasticity of profits before taxes with respect to the net-off marginal effective tax rate in a context of frequent tax reforms. This measurement is relevant, given the wide margin of maneuver that firms have to respond to changes in taxes, and the importance of corporate income taxes on economic activity and the fiscal balance. The analysis is carried out for the tax reforms implemented in Colombia, during the period 2008-2014, using Least Squares in two stages and Endogenous Quantile Regression for Panel Data. The marginal effective tax rates used in the estimations shows that the corporate tax burden of firms is lower than the statutory tax rate defined by law, due to tax deductions and tax exemptions established by Law. In turn, the results of the elasticities show that the firms' responses depend on the specific tax reform and on the companies' characteristics.
C26|Bancarization and Violence in Colombia|Income shocks affect violence through the opportunity cost and rapacity effects. Existing studies focus on the impact of transitory shocks, especially commodity price innovations. This paper builds on this literature and studies the causal effect of permanent income shocks on armed conflict in Colombia. Using a rich dataset reporting all guerrilla and other armed groups' attacks by municipality between 2009 and 2014 and information on the provision of banking services, it shows that increasing bancarization leads to reductions in violence. These results have important implications for public policy in countries with a long history of violence. They suggest that promoting financial inclusion is useful for reducing conflict. **** RESUMEN: Los choques de ingreso afectan la violencia a través de los efectos de rapacidad y costo de oportunidad. Los estudios existentes se enfocan en el impacto de choques transitorios, especialmente innovacionesen los precios de los bienes básicos. Este documento se basa en esa literatura y estudia el efecto causal de choques de ingreso permanentes sobre el conflicto armado en Colombia. Usando una base de datos que reporta todos los ataques de la guerrilla y otros grupos armados por municipio entre 2009 y 2014, al igual que información sobre la provisión de servicios bancarios, muestra que aumentos en la bancarización llevan a reducciones en la violencia. Estos resultados tienen implicaciones importantes para la política pública en países con una larga historia de violencia. Sugieren que aumentos en la inclusión financiera sirven para reducir el conflicto.
C26|Payments delay: propagation and punishment|We use a unique dataset of transactions from the real-time gross settlement system TARGET2 to analyze the behavior of banks with respect to the settlement of interbank claims. We focus on the time that passes between a payment’s introduction to the system and its settlement, the so-called payment delay. Delays represent the means by which some participants could free ride on the liquidity of others. These delays are important in that they can propagate other delays, thus prompting concerns that they could cause system gridlock. This paper characterizes the delays in the TARGET2 and analyzes whether delays in incoming transactions could cause delays in outgoing transactions. We distinguish between the potentially mechanical pass-through of delays and the reaction of one bank to its delaying counterparty, and we propose a set of instruments to tackle endogeneity issues. We find evidence that delays do propagate downstream; however, in most cases the effect is rather limited. As for delaying strategies on a payment-by-payment basis, contrary to the theoretical literature, the data show only very weak evidence. This conclusion opens a venue for research how banks may rather follow persistent liquidity management routines.
C26|Advice on using heteroscedasticity based identification|Lewbel (2012) provides a heteroscedasticity based estimator for linear regression models containing an endogenous regressor when no external instruments or other such information is available. The estimator is implemented in the Stata module ivreg2h by Baum and Schaffer (2012). This note gives some advice and instructions to researchers who want to use this estimator.
C26|The Impact of Mass Migration of Syrians on the Turkish Labor Market|We estimate the effects of the arrival of 2.5 million Syrian migrants in Turkey by the end of 2015 on the labor market outcomes of natives, using a difference-in-differences IV methodology. We show that relaxing the common-trend assumption of this methodology -unlike recent papers in the same setting- makes a substantial difference in several key outcomes. Despite the massive size of the migrant influx, no adverse effects on the average wages of men or women or on total employment of men are observed. For women, however, total employment falls -which results mainly from the elimination of part-time jobs. While the migrant influx has adverse effects on competing native workers in the informal sector, it has favorable effects on complementary workers in the formal sector. We estimate about one-to-one replacement in employment for native men in the informal sector, whereas both wage employment and wages of men in the formal sector increase. Our findings, including those on the heterogeneity of effects by age and education, are consistent with the implications of the canonical migration model. In addition, increases in prices in the product market and in capital flow to the treatment regions contribute to the rise in labor demand in the formal sector.
C26|A General Weighted Average Representation of the Ordinary and Two-Stage Least Squares Estimands|It is standard practice in applied work to study the effect of a binary variable (“treatment”) on an outcome of interest using linear models with additive effects. In this paper I study the interpretation of the ordinary and two-stage least squares estimands in such models when treatment effects are in fact heterogeneous. I show that in both cases the coefficient on treatment is identical to a convex combination of two other parameters (different for OLS and 2SLS), which can be interpreted as the average treatment effects on the treated and controls under additional assumptions. Importantly, the OLS and 2SLS weights on these parameters are inversely related to the proportion of each group. The more units get treatment, the less weight is placed on the effect on the treated. What follows, the reliance on these implicit weights can have serious consequences for applied work. I illustrate some of these issues in four empirical applications from different fields of economics. I also develop a weighted least squares correction and simple diagnostic tools that applied researchers can use to avoid potential biases. In an important special case, my diagnostics only require the knowledge of the proportion of treated units.
C26|Testing Over- and Underidentification in Linear Models, with Applications to Dynamic Panel Data and Asset-Pricing Models|This paper develops the links between overidentification tests, underidentification tests, score tests and the Cragg-Donald (1993, 1997) and Kleibergen-Paap (2006) rank tests in linear instrumental variables (IV) models. This general framework shows that standard underidentification tests are (robust) score tests for overidentification in an auxiliary linear model, x_1 = X_2 δ + ε_1, where X = [x_1 X_2] are the endogenous explanatory variables in the original model, estimated by IV estimation methods using the same instruments as for the original model. This simple structure makes it possible to establish valid robust underidentification tests for linear IV models where these have not been proposed or used before, like clustered dynamic panel data models estimated by GMM. The framework also applies to general tests of rank, including the I test of Arellano, Hansen and Sentana (2012), and, outside the IV setting, for tests of rank of parameter matrices estimated by OLS. Invariant rank tests are based on LIML or continuously updated GMM estimators of the first-stage parameters. This insight leads to the proposal of a new two-step invariant asymptotically efficient GMM estimator, and a new iterated GMM estimator that converges to the continuously updated GMM estimator.
C26|Energy Consumption in the French Residential Sector: How Much do Individual Preferences Matter?|The aim of this research is to understand the impact of preference heterogeneity in explaining energy consumption in French homes. Using a discrete-continuous model and the conditional mixed-process estimator (CMP) enable us to address two potential endogeneities in residential energy consumption: energy prices and the choice of home energy characteristics. As a key contribution, we provide evidence that a preference for comfort over saving energy does have significant direct and indirect impacts on energy consumption (through the choice of dwelling), particularly for high-income households. Preferring comfort over economy or one additional degree of heating implies an average energy overconsumption of 10% and 7.8% respectively, up to 18% for high-income households. Our results strengthen the belief that household heterogeneity is an important factor in explaining energy consumption and could have meaningful implications for the design of public policy tools aimed at reducing energy consumption in the residential sector.
C26|Eliciting and Utilizing Willingness to Pay: Evidence from Field Trials in Northern Ghana|We demonstrate the benefits and feasibility of using the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) mechanism to elicit precise, individual-level willingness to pay and thereby enhance the information generated by randomized experiments. With a relatively small sample and minor modifications to a standard field experiment design, we can directly estimate demand, study the effect of prices on usage through screening and psychological (sunk-cost) effects, and compute heterogeneous marginal treatment effects. Applying the mechanism to a field experiment studying clean drinking water technology in northern Ghana, we show that even in an environment with low literacy and numeracy, BDM produces sensible results. We find that although willingness to pay for clean water technology is low relative to the cost, demand is surprisingly inelastic at low prices; prices do not generate significant sunk-cost effects; and treatment effects are heterogeneous with respect to valuation and consistent with outcomes being affected by effort expenditure.
C26|Globalisation and Income Inequality Revisited|We re-examine the globalisation-income inequality nexus. Globalisation is measured by the KOF globalisation index and sub-indicators for trade, financial, political and social global globalisation. Income inequality is measured by Solt’s pre tax/transfer and the post tax/transfer Gini indices. We use data for 140 countries over the period 1970-2014 and deal with the endogeneity of globalisation measures. Our instrumental variable is predicted openness based on a time-varying gravity model. OLS results show that globalisation and income inequality are positively correlated within the full sample of countries and the sample of emerging and developing countries. The positive relationship is mainly driven by export openness, FDIs and social globalisation. The 2SLS results do not show that overall globalisation or any sub-indicator influences income inequality. The effect, however, is positive within the sample of higher developed countries and driven by transition countries from Eastern Europe and China. Within the sample of the most advanced economies, neither OLS nor 2SLS results show any significant positive relationship between globalisation and inequality.
C26|Machine Learning Indices, Political Institutions, and Economic Development|We present a new aggregation method - called SVM algorithm - and use this technique to produce novel measures of democracy (186 countries, 1960-2014). The method takes its name from a machine learning technique for pattern recognition and has three notable features: it makes functional assumptions unnecessary, it accounts for measurement uncertainty, and it creates continuous and dichotomous indices. We use the SVM indices to investigate the effect of democratic institutions on economic development, and find that democracies grow faster than autocracies. Furthermore, we illustrate how the estimation results are affected by conceptual and methodological changes in the measure of democracy. In particular, we show that instrumental variables cannot compensate for measurement errors produced by conventional aggregation methods, and explain why this failure leads to an overestimation of regression coefficients.
C26|Employment Effects of Payroll Tax Subsidies|This paper exploits several reforms of wage subsidies in the framework of the German Minijob program to investigate substitution and complementarity relationships between subsidized and non-subsidized labor demand. We apply an instrumental variables approach and use administrative data on German establishments for the period 1999-2014. Particularly in small establishments (0-9 employees), subsidized Minijob employment comprises large shares of the work force, on average over 40 percent. For these establishments, robust evidence shows that increasing the subsidization of Minijob employment crowds out non-subsidized employment. Our results imply that Minijob employment in 2014 may have eliminated more than 0.5 million unsubsidized employment relationships just in small establishments.
C26|Violencia en la producción de cocaína: laboratorios y grupos armados|El trabajo estudia el efecto que tuvo la destrucción de laboratorios de clorhidrato de cocaína y pasta/base, sobre la violencia municipal entre el 2000 y el 2012 en Colombia. Específicamente se estudia como las estrategias de desmantelamiento de laboratorios realizadas por la Fuerza Pública, afectan una etapa de la cadena de producción de la cocaína, e impactan la fuente de financiación más importante de los grupos armados, generando así dinámicas de violencia en los municipios colombianos. Por medio de una estimación de efectos fijos y variable instrumental, se encuentra que la destrucción de laboratorios conllevó a un aumento en el número de combates entre las guerrillas y los paramilitares.
C26|Are substitute services a barrier to controlling long-term care expenditures?|In many developed countries long-term care expenditures are a major source of concern, which has urged policy makers to cost reductions. However, long-term care financing is highly fragmented in most countries and hence reducing total costs is complicated: spending reductions in one type of care may have spillover effects elsewhere in the system. These spillovers may be substantial, as we show using a reform in the financing of one type of publicly financed home care in the Netherlands, domestic help. We show that this reform not only affected consumption of this care type, but also the consumption of three other types of long-term care that are financed through another public scheme.
C26|Firms' Expectations of New Orders, Employment, Costs and Prices: Evidence from Micro Data|Firms' expectations play a central role in forward-looking macroeconomic models, but little is known empirically about how these are formed or whether they matter. Using a novel panel data set of firms' expectations about new orders, employment, unit costs, prices and wage rates for the United Kingdom, we document a range of stylized facts about the properties of firms' expectations and their relationship with recent pricing decisions. Expected future price and wage growth are influenced by firm-specific and aggregate factors. Price expectations are more correlated with cost and inflation indicators, wage expectations are more correlated with activity indicators. Expectations of new orders are influenced by aggregate conditions, while expected employment and unit costs seem to be influenced more by firm-specific factors. We also provide micro evidence to support the idea that actual price movements are influenced by expected future price movements, although firms' expectations do not seem to be fully rational.
C26|Feeling useless: the effect of unemployment on mental health in the Great Recession|Abstract This article documents a strong connection between unemployment and mental distress using data from the Spanish National Health Survey. We exploit the collapse of the construction sector to identify the causal effect of job losses in different segments of the Spanish labor market. Our results suggest that an increase of the unemployment rate by 10 percentage points due to the breakdown in construction raised reported poor health and mental disorders in the affected population by 3 percentage points, respectively. We argue that the size of this effect responds to the fact that the construction sector was at the center of the economic recession. As a result, workers exposed to the negative labor demand shock faced very low chances of re-entering employment. We show that this led to long unemployment spells, stress, hopelessness, and feelings of uselessness. These effects point towards a potential channel for unemployment hysteresis.
C26|Regional Transfer Multipliers|A series of discontinuities in the allocation mechanism of federal transfers to municipal governments in Brazil allow us to identify the causal effect of public spending on local labor markets, using a â€˜fuzzyâ€™ Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD). Our estimates imply a cost per job of about 8,000 US dollars per year and a local income multiplier around two. The effect comes mostly from employment in the retail, education and services sectors and is more pronounced among smaller municipalities in the North, with lower income and lower bank penetration.
C26|Censored Quantile Instrumental Variable Estimation with Stata|Many applications involve a censored dependent variable and an endogenous independent variable. Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val, and Kowalski (2015) introduced a censored quantile instrumental variable estimator (CQIV) for use in those applications, which has been applied by Kowalski (2016), among others. In this article, we introduce a Stata command, cqiv, that simplifes application of the CQIV estimator in Stata. We summarize the CQIV estimator and algorithm, we describe the use of the cqiv command, and we provide empirical examples.
C26|I will survive. Pricing strategies of financially distressed firms|We consider a standard result of customer market theory: if firms have stable customer relations and face financial frictions, they may keep prices relatively high in times of low demand and vice versa. Indeed, during recessions, when firms have low cash flow and greater difficulty in raising external funds, they may set higher prices on their locked-in shoppers to maintain short-term profits at the expense of future market shares. We extend this theoretical framework so that the countercyclical behaviour of price margins is strengthened by the expected persistence of the downturn and the procyclicality of competitive pressures. We test these predictions for Italian firms participating in the 2014 Wage Dynamics Network Survey. All things being equal, financially constrained firms charge higher markups when faced with low demand; this behaviour is more evident when demand is perceived as being persistent. Our findings suggest that the severity of financial constraints in Italy was one of the causes of the sustained growth of prices in 2010-2013, notwithstanding the considerable slack in the economy.
C26|Time varying cointegration and the UK great ratios|We re-examine the great ratios associated with balanced growth models and ask whether they have remained constant over time. We first use a benchmark DSGE model to explore how plausible smooth variations in structural parameters lead to movements in great ratios that are comparable to those seen in the UK data. We then employ a nonparametric methodology that allows for slowly varying coefficients to estimate trends over time. To formally test for stable relationships in the great ratios, we propose a statistical test based on these nonparametric estimators devised to detect time varying cointegrating relationships. Small sample properties of the test are explored in a small Monte Carlo exercise. Generally, we find no evidence for cointegration when parameters are constant, but strong evidence when allowing for time variation. The implications are that in macroeconometric models allowance should be made for shifting long-run relationships, including DSGE models where smooth variation should be allowed in the deep structural relationships.
C26|Impact of religious participation, social interactions and globalisation on meat consumption: evidence from India|From both health and environmental policy perspectives, it is advisable to ensure that individuals maximise the nutritional gains from eating meat, without having a significantly adverse environmental impact, i.e. sustainable meat consumption pathways are imperative. This is especially true for developing countries, where rising incomes and growing populations have meant that meat consumption has also risen. India is an example of a country where a large share of the population has been vegetarian due to religious and cultural factors, although this is rapidly changing. In this paper, we hypothesise that social interactions and globalisation are two factors that explain this shift in consumption behaviour, especially amongst Hindu households. These hypotheses are based on the theoretical findings of Levy and Razin (2012). The empirical results show that Hindus that are members of religious groups are less likely to eat meat than non-member Hindus, whereas Hindus that are members of non-religious types of groups are more likely to eat meat than non-members. We also find that Hindu households that frequently use sources of media such as newspapers, the radio or television are more likely to consume meat compared to Hindus that do not. This paper provides important policy implications, both in terms of the formulation of Nationally Recommended Diets in developing countries, and in terms of identifying the channel of influence of both social networks and globalisation on social and religious norms, consumption behaviour, and ultimately, on climate change.
C26|From residential energy demand to fuel poverty: income-induced non-linearities in the reactions of households to energy price fluctuations|The residential energy demand is growing steadily and the trend is expected to continue in the near future. At the same time, under the impulse of economic crises and environmental and energy policies, many households have experienced reductions in real income and higher energy prices. In the residential sector, the number of fuel-poor households is thus expected to rise. A better understanding of the determinants of residential energy demand, in particular of the role of income and the sensitivity of households to changes in energy prices, is crucial in the context of recurrent debates on energy efficiency and fuel poverty. We propose a panel threshold regression (PTR) model to empirically test the sensitivity of French households to energy price fluctuations Ð as measured by the elasticity of residential heating energy prices Ð and to analyze the overlap between their income and fuel poverty profiles. The PTR model allows to test for the non-linear effect of income on the reactions of households to fluctuations in energy prices. Thus, it can identify specific regimes differing by their level of estimated price elasticities. Each regime represents an elasticity-homogeneous group of households. The number of these regimes is determined based on an endogenously PTR-fixed income threshold. Thereafter, we analyze the composition of the regimes (i.e. groups) to locate the dominant proportion of fuel-poor households and analyse their monetary poverty characteristics. Results show that, depending on the income level, we can identify two groups of households that react differently to residential energy price fluctuations and that fuel-poor households belong mostly to the group of households with the highest elasticity. By extension, results also show that income poverty does not necessarily mean fuel poverty. In terms of public policy, we suggest focusing on income heterogeneity by considering different groups of households separately when defining energy efficiency measures. We also suggest paying particular attention to targeting fuel-poor households by examining the overlap between fuel and income poverty.
C26|The role of individual preferences to explain the energy performance gap|The aim of this research is to understand the role of socio-economic characteristics and individual preferences to explain the energy performance gap in the residential sector. The gap reflects the difference between theoretical energy consumption of home assessed by engineering models and real energy consumption. Using the ratio of the two consumptions as a measure of the gap, we perform a quantile regression to tease out the effects of preferences on the entire distribution of the energy performance gap spectrum instead of focusing on the conditional average. As a result, this research provides an original contribution: depending on the sense of the gap, our findings suggest that some significant drivers are individual preferences for comfort over economy, explaining until 12% of the gap variability, and poverty. In such a context, some warnings to public authorities are provided regarding the issues of rebound effect and household welfare.
C26|From residential energy demand to fuel poverty: income-induced non-linearities in the reactions of households to energy price fluctuations|The residential energy demand is growing steadily and the trend is expected to continue in the near future. At the same time, under the impulse of economic crises and environmental and energy policies, many households have experienced reductions in real income and higher energy prices. In the residential sector, the number of fuel-poor households is thus expected to rise. A better understanding of the determinants of residential energy demand, in particular of the role of income and the sensitivity of households to changes in energy prices, is crucial in the context of recurrent debates on energy efficiency and fuel poverty. We propose a panel threshold regression (PTR) model to empirically test the sensitivity of French households to energy price fluctuations Ð as measured by the elasticity of residential heating energy prices Ð and to analyze the overlap between their income and fuel poverty profiles. The PTR model allows to test for the non-linear effect of income on the reactions of households to fluctuations in energy prices. Thus, it can identify specific regimes differing by their level of estimated price elasticities. Each regime represents an elasticity-homogeneous group of households. The number of these regimes is determined based on an endogenously PTR-fixed income threshold. Thereafter, we analyze the composition of the regimes (i.e. groups) to locate the dominant proportion of fuel-poor households and analyse their monetary poverty characteristics. Results show that, depending on the income level, we can identify two groups of households that react differently to residential energy price fluctuations and that fuel-poor households belong mostly to the group of households with the highest elasticity. By extension, results also show that income poverty does not necessarily mean fuel poverty. In terms of public policy, we suggest focusing on income heterogeneity by considering different groups of households separately when defining energy efficiency measures. We also suggest paying particular attention to targeting fuel-poor households by examining the overlap between fuel and income poverty.

C26|Instrument-based estimation with binarized treatments: Issues and tests for the exclusion restriction|When estimating local average and marginal treatment effects using instrumental variables (IV), multivalued endogenous treatments are frequently binarized based on a specific threshold in treatment support. However, such binarization introduces a violation of the IV exclusion if (i) the IV affects the multivalued treatment within support areas below and/or above the threshold and (ii) such IV-induced changes in the multivalued treatment affect the outcome. We discuss assumptions that satisfy the IV exclusion restriction with the binarized treatment and permit identifying the average effect of (i) the binarized treatment and (ii) unit-level increases in the original multivalued treatment among specific compliers. We derive testable implications of these assumptions and propose tests, which we apply to the estimation of the returns to (binary) college graduation instrumented by college proximity.
C26|Endogeneity Issues in the Empirical Assessment of the Determinants of Loan Renegotiation|The present text is focused on the evaluation of the influence that determinants of loan contracts’ design may have on loan renegotiation. This general purpose is faced with the possible simultaneity of determination of some such factors (namely the use of collaterals and loan interest rate) and the likelihood of contract renegotiation. Naturally, this simultaneity corresponds to an issue of endogeneity of these factors within econometric models of the conditional probability of renegotiation. If neglected, covariates’ endogeneity causes model misspecification, translating into unreliable empirical assessments of the marginal effects of all renegotiation determinants on the probability of loan redesign. Building on the theory of incomplete contracts, suggesting that the possibility of contract renegotiation is already anticipated at the contracting date, the empirical findings of the paper, based on a dataset provided by a Brazilian bank, provide strong indication that this can indeed be the case. Accordingly, the empirical assessment of the marginal contributions of important variables to the likelihood of renegotiation is revisited, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of renegotiation processes.
C26|Energy Consumption in the French Residential Sector: How Much do Individual Preferences Matter?|The aim of this research is to understand the weight of preference heterogeneity in explaining energy consumption in French homes. Using a discrete-continuous model and the conditional mixed-process estimator (CMP) allows us to tackle two potential endogeneities in residential energy consumption: energy prices and the choice of equipment. As a major contribution, we provide evidence that preferences for comfort over energy savings do have significant direct and indirect impacts on energy consumption, especially for high-income households. Preferring comfort over economy or one additional degree of heating implies an average energy overconsumption of 10% and 7.8% respectively, up to 36% for high-income households. Our results strengthen the belief that household heterogeneity is a substantial factor in explaining energy consumption and could have meaningful implications for the design of public policy tools aimed at reducing energy consumption in the residential sector
C26|Aide et Croissance dans les pays de l’Union Economique et Monétaire Ouest Africaine (UEMOA) : retour sur une relation controversée<BR>[Aid and Growth in West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries : a return back to a controversial relationship]|The main purpose of this paper is to analyze threshold effects of official development assistance (ODA) on economic growth in WAEMU zone countries. To achieve this, the study is based on OECD and WDI data covering the period 1980-2015 and used Hansen’s Panel Threshold Regression (PTR) model to “bootstrap” aid threshold above which its effectiveness is effective. The evidence strongly supports the view that the relationship between aid and economic growth is non-linear with a unique threshold which is 12.74% GDP. Above this value, the marginal effect of aid is 0.69 points, “all things being equal to otherwise”. One of the main contribution of this paper is to show that WAEMU countries need investments that could be covered by the foreign aid. This later one should be considered just as a complementary resource. Thus, WEAMU countries should continue to strengthen their efforts in internal resource mobilization in order to fulfil this need.
C26|The closer the better: does better access to outpatient care prevent hospitalization?|In 2010-2012 new outpatient service locations were established in poor Hungarian microregions. We exploit this quasi-experiment to estimate the extent of substitution between outpatient and inpatient care. Fixed-effects Poisson models on individual-level panel data for years 2008-2015 show that the number of outpatient visits increased by 19% and the number of inpatient stays decreased by 1.6% as a result, driven by a marked reduction of potentially avoidable hospitalization (PAH) (5%). In our dynamic specification, PAH effects occur in the year after the treatment, whereas non-PAH only decreases with a multi-year lag. The instrumental variable estimates suggest that a one euro increase in outpatient care expenditures produces a 0.6 euro decrease in inpatient care expenditures. Our results (1) strengthen the claim that bringing outpatient care closer to a previously underserved population yields considerable health benefits, and (2) suggest that there is a strong substitution element between outpatient and inpatient care.
C26|Instrumental variables based on twin births are by definition not valid|Instrumental variables based on twin births are a well-known and widespread method to find exogenous variation in the number of children when studying the effect on siblings or parents. This paper argues that there are serious problems with all versions of these instruments. Many of these problems have arisen because insufficient care has been given to defining the estimated causal effect. This paper discusses this definition and then applies the potential outcomes framework to reveal that instrumental variables based on twin birth violate the exclusion restriction, the independence assumption and one part of the stable unit treatment value assumption. These violations as well as the characteristics of the populations studied have contributed to hiding any true effect of the number of children. It is time to stop using these instrumental variables and to return to these important questions using other methods.
C26|Migrating natives and foreign immigration: Is there a preference for ethnic residential homogeneity?|"In this paper we investigate the migration behavior of the native population following foreign (refugee) immigration, with a particular focus on examining whether there is support for an ethnically based migration response. If ethnicity is the mechanism driving the change in natives' migration behavior, our maintained hypothesis is that native-born individuals who are ethnically similar to arriving refugees should not change their migration behavior to the same extent as native-born individuals with native-born parents (who are ethnically quite different from refugees). Using rich geo-coded register data from Sweden, spanning over 20 consecutive years, we account for possible endogeneity problems with an improved so- called ""shift-share"" approach; in particular, our strategy combines policy-induced initial immigrant settlements with exogenous contemporaneous immigration as captured by refugee shocks. We find no evidence of neither native flight nor native avoidance when studying the full population. We do, however, find native flight among individuals who are expected to be more mobile, and within this group, we find that all natives, irrespective of their parents' foreign background, react similarly to increased immigration. Our results therefore indicate that preference for ethnically homogeneous neighborhoods may not be the dominant channel inducing flight. The estimates instead indicate that immigration leads to more socio-economically segregated neighborhoods. This conclusion may have implications for the ethnically based tipping Point literature."
C26|Do digital information technologies help unemployed job seekers find a job? Evidence from the broadband internet expansion in Germany|This paper studies effects of the introduction of a new digital mass medium on reemployment of unemployed job seekers. We combine data on high-speed (broadband) internet availability at the local level with individual register data on the unemployed in Germany. We address endogeneity by exploiting technological peculiarities in the network that affected the roll-out of high-speed internet. The results show that high-speed internet improves reemployment rates after the first months of the unemployment spell. This is confirmed by complementary analysis with individual survey data suggesting that online job search leads to additional formal job interviews after a few months in unemployment.
C26|The impact of monetary policy on household borrowing - a high-frequency IV identification|This paper combines identication of monetary policy shocks from high-frequency financial market data with local projections IV to study the effects of monetary policy on household borrowing using Swedish data. The results are uncertain but indicate that the stock of household loans is 1.6 percent lower two years after a 1 percentage point shock to the repo rate. This is a relatively modest effect considering that the stock of household loans on average grew by 7.8 percent per year over this period.
C26|Non-asymptotic inference in instrumental variables estimation| This paper presents a simple method for carrying out inference in a wide variety of possibly nonlinear IV models under weak assumptions. The method is non-asymptotic in the sense that it provides a finite sample bound on the difference between the true and nominal probabilities of rejecting a correct null hypothesis. The method is a non-Studentized version of the Anderson-Rubin test but is motivated and analyzed differently. In contrast to the conventional Anderson-Rubin test, the method proposed here does not require restrictive distributional assumptions, linearity of the estimated model, or simultaneous equations. Nor does it require knowledge of whether the instruments are strong or weak. It does not require testing or estimating the strength of the instruments. The method can be applied to quantile IV models that may be nonlinear and can be used to test a parametric IV model against a nonparametric alternative. The results presented here hold in finite samples, regardless of the strength of the instruments.
C26|Overeducation wage penalty among Ph.D. holders. An unconditional quantile regression analysis on Italian data|The wage effect of overeducation has only recently been investigated in the case of Ph.D. holders. The existing contributions rely on OLS estimates that allow measuring the average effect of being educationally mismatched at the mean of the conditional wage distribution. This paper, instead, observes the heterogeneity of the overeducation penalty along the hourly wage distribution and according to the study field and sector of employment (academic/non-academic) of Ph.D. holders. We estimate a Recentered Influence Function. The results reveal that overeducation hits the wages of those Ph.D. holders who are employed in the academic sector and in non-R&D jobs outside of the academic sector. Instead, no penalty exists among those who carry out R&D outside the Academia. The size of the penalty is higher among those who are in the mid-top of the wage distribution and hold a Social Science and Humanities specialization.
C26|Graded Return-to-Work as a Stepping Stone to Full Work Resumption|There is increasing evidence that graded return-to-work is an effective tool for the rehabilitation of sick-listed workers. Still, little is known on the optimal timing and level of grading in return-to-work trajectories, as well as the allocation of trajectories across worker types. To fill this gap, we analyze whether the effectiveness of graded return-to-work depends on the starting moment of the trajectory and the initial level of graded work resumption. We use administrative data from a Dutch private workplace reintegration provider. In order to correct for the selection bias inherent to the evaluation of activation strategies, we exploit the discretionary room of the case managers in setting up treatment plans. In correspondence with previous literature we find that graded return-to-work reduces sick spells with eighteen weeks within the first two years after reporting sick. However, the probability of work resumption after two years remains unchanged. Work resumption can be achieved faster when graded return-to-work is started earlier or at a higher rate of initial work resumption. These findings however do not hold for individuals who have problems related to mental health.

We address endogeneity by exploiting technological peculiarities that affected the roll-out of high-speed internet.

This is confirmed by complementary analyses with individual survey data suggesting that internet access increases online job search and the number of job interviews after a fewmonths in unemployment.
C26|Health care utilization at retirement: The role of the opportunity cost of time|We investigate the causal impact of retirement on health care utilization using SHARE data for 10 European countries. We show that the number of doctor's visits and the probability of visiting a doctor more than four times a year (our measures of health care utilization) increase after retirement. The increase in health care utilization is found to depend mainly on the years spent in retirement, suggesting that adjustment may take time. We find evidence of heterogeneous effects by gender and across different patterns of time use prior to retirement (i.e., working long hours and combined work and out‐of‐work activities). Overall, the empirical findings suggest that the increase in health care utilization is consistent with the decrease in the opportunity cost of time faced by individuals when they retire.
C26|Does the internet increase the job finding rate? Evidence from a period of internet expansion|We examine the impact of household access to the internet on job finding rates in Germany during a period (2006-2009) in which internet access increased rapidly, and job-seekers increased their use of the internet as a search tool. During this period, household access to the internet was almost completely dependent on connection to a particular technology (DSL). We therefore exploit the variation in connection rates across municipalities as an instrument for household access to the internet. OLS estimates which control for differences in individual and local area characteristics suggest a job-finding advantage of about five percentage points. The IV estimates are substantially larger, but much less precisely estimated. However, we cannot reject the hypothesis that, conditional on observables, residential computer access with internet was as good as randomly assigned with respect to the job-finding rate. The hypothesis that residential internet access helped job-seekers find work because of its effect on the job search process is supported by the finding that residential internet access greatly increased the use of the internet as a search method. We find some evidence that household access to the internet reduced the use of traditional job search methods, but this effect is outweighed by the increase in internet-based search methods.
C26|A General Weighted Average Representation of the Ordinary and Two-Stage Least Squares Estimands|"It is standard practice in applied work to study the effect of a binary variable (""treatment"") on an outcome of interest using linear models with additive effects. In this paper I study the interpretation of the ordinary and two-stage least squares estimands in such models when treatment effects are in fact heterogeneous. I show that in both cases the coefficient on treatment is identical to a convex combination of two other parameters (different for OLS and 2SLS), which can be interpreted as the average treatment effects on the treated and controls under additional assumptions. Importantly, the OLS and 2SLS weights on these parameters are inversely related to the proportion of each group. The more units get treatment, the less weight is placed on the effect on the treated. What follows, the reliance on these implicit weights can have serious consequences for applied work. I illustrate some of these issues in four empirical applications from different fields of economics. I also develop a weighted least squares correction and simple diagnostic tools that applied researchers can use to avoid potential biases. In an important special case, my diagnostics only require the knowledge of the proportion of treated units."
C26|The Effect of Media Coverage on Mass Shootings|Can media coverage of shooters encourage future mass shootings? We explore the link between the day-to-day prime time television news coverage of shootings on ABC World News Tonight and subsequent mass shootings in the US from January 1, 2013 to June 23, 2016. To circumvent latent endogeneity concerns, we employ an instrumental variable strategy: worldwide disaster deaths provide an exogenous variation that systematically crowds out shooting-related coverage. Our findings consistently suggest a positive and statistically significant effect of coverage on the number of subsequent shootings, lasting for 4-10 days. At its mean, news coverage is suggested to cause approximately three mass shootings in the following week, which would explain 55 percent of all mass shootings in our sample. Results are qualitatively consistent when using (i) additional keywords to capture shooting-related news coverage, (ii) alternative definitions of mass shootings, (iii) the number of injured or killed people as the dependent variable, and (iv) an alternative, longer data source for mass shootings from 2006-2016.
C26|An Introduction to Nonparametric Regression for Labor Economists|Abstract In this article we overview nonparametric (spline and kernel) regression methods and illustrate how they may be used in labor economics applications. We focus our attention on issues commonly found in the labor literature such as how to account for endogeneity via instrumental variables in a nonparametric setting. We showcase these methods via data from the Current Population Survey.
C26|Does the Internet Increase the Job Finding Rate? Evidence from a Period of Internet Expansion|We examine the impact of household access to the internet on job finding rates in Germany during a period (2006-2009) in which internet access increased rapidly, and job-seekers increased their use of the internet as a search tool.

C26|The Impact of Mass Migration of Syrians on the Turkish Labor Market|We estimate the effects of the arrival of 2.5 million Syrian migrants in Turkey by the end of 2015 on the labor market outcomes of natives, using a difference-in-differences IV methodology. We show that relaxing the common-trend assumption of this methodology -unlike recent papers in the same setting- makes a substantial difference in several key outcomes. Despite the massive size of the migrant influx, no adverse effects on the average wages of men or women or on total employment of men are observed. For women, however, total employment falls -which results mainly from the elimination of part-time jobs. While the migrant influx has adverse effects on competing native workers in the informal sector, it has favorable effects on complementary workers in the formal sector. We estimate about one-to-one replacement in employment for native men in the informal sector, whereas both wage employment and wages of men in the formal sector increase. Our findings, including those on the heterogeneity of effects by age and education, are consistent with the implications of the canonical migration model. In addition, increases in prices in the product market and in capital flow to the treatment regions contribute to the rise in labor demand in the formal sector.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C26|Demand Models for Differentiated Goods with Complementarity and Substitutability|We develop a class of demand models for differentiated products. The new models facilitate the BLP method (Berry et al., 1995) while numerical inversion of the demand system is not required. They can accommodate rich patterns of substitution and complementarity while being easily estimated with standard regression techniques and allowing very large choice sets. We use the new models to describe markets for differentiated products that exhibit segmentation according to several dimensions and illustrate their application by estimating demand for cereals in Chicago.
C26|The effectiveness of taxing the carbon content of energy consumption|We estimate the long-run effect of a broad-based carbon tax on energy consumption by using a new and unique cross-sectional dataset of effective energy tax rates of OECD countries. Our instrumental variables estimations, which exploit the positive correlation between the tax rates of neighboring countries, indicate a much higher effectiveness for carbon taxation than those from ordinary least square estimations. The validity of our identification strategy is consistent with the theories of strategic policy interaction in the presence of immobile tax bases. Our results show that a one euro increase in energy taxes reduces carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption by 0.73 percent in the long run.
C26|Optimal Estimation with Complete Subsets of Instruments|In this paper we propose a two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator whose first stage is based on the equal-weight average over a complete subset. We derive the approximate mean squared error (MSE) that depends on the size of the complete subset and characterize the proposed estimator based on the approximate MSE. The size of the complete subset is chosen by minimizing the sample counterpart of the approximate MSE. We show that this method achieves the asymptotic optimality. To deal with weak or irrelevant instruments, we generalize the approximate MSE under the presence of a possibly growing set of irrelevant instruments, which provides useful guidance under weak IV environments. The Monte Carlo simulation results show that the proposed estimator outperforms alternative methods when instruments are correlated with each other and there exists high endogeneity. As an empirical illustration, we estimate the logistic demand function in Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995).
C26|Instrument Validity Tests with Causal Trees: With an Application to the Same-sex Instrument|The use of instrumental variables (IVs) to identify causal effects is widespread in empirical economics, but it is fundamentally impossible to proof their validity. However, assumptions sufficient for the identification of local average treatment effects (LATEs) jointly generate necessary conditions in the observed data that allow to refute an IV's validity. Suitable tests exist, but they may not be able to detect even severe violations of IV validity in practice. In this paper, we employ recently developed machine learning tools as data-driven improvements for these tests. Specifically, we use the causal tree (CT) algorithm from Athey and Imbens (2016) to directly search the covariate space for violations of the LATE assumptions. The new approach is applied to the sibling sex composition instrument in census data from China and the United States. We expect that, because of son preferences, the siblings sex instrument is invalid in the Chinese context. However, existing IV validity tests are unable to detect violations, while our CT based procedure does.
C26|Demand for Yogurt in the Trend of Manufacturer Brand and Organic Information| The random coefficients multinomial logit model was used to study the demand for yogurt which is differentiated by manufacturer brands and organic information. For this purpose, we used the scanner-level data set collected by the Information Resource Incorporated at the chain level. General Mills and Danone are the two brands with the highest market shares. In general, demand for yogurt has found to be elastic for all brands. On average, consumers are more price-sensitive to non-organic brands than organic brands. Results revealed some degree of brand loyalty and the switching behavior among yogurt consumers.
C26|The Effect of Teacher Bonuses on Learning Outcomes and the Distribution of Teacher Skill: Evidence from Rural Schools in Peru|Teachers tend to avoid working in places with poor basic services, where transport costs are high and students show low performance. As a result, less advantaged students living in rural areas usually get paired with less qualified teachers. In many developing countries, teachers are offered monetary incentives to work in rural or remote schools. The literature, however, offers very little evidence about their effect on teacher qualifications. Moreover, this is the first study to produce causal evidence about the effect on these incentives on learning outcomes. This paper analyses the effect of unconditional monetary incentives on learning outcomes and the distribution of teacher skill in public rural schools in Peru. Teachers working in a rural school receive, on average, an additional 430 soles each month (around US$ 130 and approximately 30% of the starting salary). Schools are classified as rural based on the population of their community and their distance to the nearest province capital. We use a regression discontinuity design that exploits the exogenous shift in the amount of the bonus that occurs around the population and distance thresholds used to classify a school as rural. We find that the average bonus had a positive effect of around 0.16 standard deviations on reading comprehension and mathematics test scores obtained by second grade students in the 2014 and 2015 national evaluations. One of the mechanisms by which teacher bonuses can have a positive effect on learning is by making rural schools more attractive for talented teachers. We find evidence in favor of this channel. In fact, the bonus caused a shift of 0.38 standard deviations in the average score obtained by rural school teachers in the 2015 recruitment evaluation.
C26|Applications For Businesses That Uses Relational Databases:|The paper presents a database production model designed as a warehouse star that contain dimensions like deposits, raw materials, stocks, products, producer, locations, time and a fact table with foreign keys and measures. This model optimize the activity of a business based on a production activity in the way that it can store large amount of data in a historical way that can be the base for future scenarios with key values changed by the decision maker. The decision maker analyses a large spectrum of reports and choose what indicators to observe and what measures to display and so it’s easy to decide based on large amount of data and trends. Database applications for business improve the efficiency in managing large quantity of data in the sense for storage, updates, queries, interaction with the users and also getting answers through reports. The schema specific to a database is very flexible and permits adding or removing columns and also adding and removing entities. This feature is very useful when the relational database schema is transformed in a data warehouse shaped as a star with dimensions and a fact table. This model permits advanced queries and the usage of rollup and drill down objects specific to the business intelligence tools that offer quick responses to the complex answers. To a production business the choice of a database application designed and implemented as data warehouse star model, bennefits from all the advantage of storage and also a superior and complex tool for building queries.
C26|Pricing decisions under financial frictions: evidence from the wdn survey|I test the predictions from Duca, Montero, Riggi and Zizza (2017), who develop a customermarket model with consumer switching costs and capital-market imperfections in which price-cost markups behave countercyclically, with a subsample of European firms participating in the Wage Dynamics Network 2014 survey. I use a novel empirical approach developed by Aakvik, Heckman and Vytlacil (2005) for estimating discrete choice models with binary endogenous regressors that allows for selection on unobservables. Results show that firms subject to financial constraints had a significantly higher probability of raising markups than in a counterfactual scenario without such constraints. Moreover, the estimated partial effects for the main variables are in overall accordance with the predictions from the theoretical model.
C26|Municipal socialism or municipal capitalism? The performance of local public enterprises in Italy|This paper evaluates the performance of Italian local public enterprises (LPEs) with respect to their private sector counterparts. We address the following questions: i) do LPEs perform worse than (comparable) private firms?; ii) does the performance gap depend on the ownership structure (the share held by the public) or on the market structure (the degree of competition in the sector)?; iii) which are the main determinants of LPEs' performance in terms of productivity? The main findings – which are robust to the possible endogeneity of the ownership structure – are as follows: i) LPEs perform less well than private companies by about 8 percent in terms of TFP; ii) although both ownership structure and market structure matter, our results suggest that the ownership structure is more important; and iii) the performance gap of LPEs with respect to private firms seems to be driven by over-capitalization rather than by over-employment.
C26|Two-stage least squares as minimum distance|SummaryThe two-stage least-squares (2SLS) instrumental-variables (IV) estimator for the parameters in linear models with a single endogenous variable is shown to be identical to an optimal minimum-distance (MD) estimator based on the individual instrument-specific IV estimators. The 2SLS estimator is a linear combination of the individual estimators, with the weights determined by their variances and covariances under conditional homoskedasticity. It is further shown that the Sargan test statistic for overidentifying restrictions is the same as the MD criterion test statistic. This provides an intuitive interpretation of the Sargan test. The equivalence results also apply to the efficient two-step generalized method of moments and robust optimal MD estimators and criterion functions, allowing for general forms of heteroskedasticity. It is further shown how these results extend to the linear overidentified IV model with multiple endogenous variables.
C26|Country Reputation and Trade Policy Preferences - Using the News of the Election of Donald Trump as an Instrument|Using quasi-experimental data, a survey that was held immediately before and after the November 8th, 2016 USA elections, we analyse the impact of reputation on trade policy preference and find that the unexpected election of Donald Trump as 45th president of the USA had a sizeable negative effect on the reputation of the USA in Europe, as measured by the expectations of EU citizens about the future evolution of the USA. But this negative reputational shock seems to have affected in a positive (though not always significant) way the support for future economic cooperation with the USA, as measured by the support of EU citizens for a free trade and investment treaty with the USA. This provides some support for the idea that reputation and formal institutions are substitutes.
C26|Did Protestantism promote economic prosperity via higher human capital?|This paper investigates the Becker-Woessmann (2009) argument that Protestants were more prosperous in nineteenth-century Prussia because they were more literate, a version of the Weber thesis, and shows that it cannot be sustained. The econometric analysis on which Becker and Woessman based their argument is fundamentally flawed, because their instrumental variable does not satisfy the exclusion restriction. When an appropriate instrumental-variable specification is used, the evidence from nineteenth-century Prussia rejects the human-capital version of the Weber thesis put forward by Becker and Woessmann.
C26|Mediated Terrorism: US News and Al-Qaeda Attacks|This paper presents an empirical test for the hypothesis that US news coverage of al-Qaeda causes al-Qaeda attacks. To isolate causality, disaster deaths worldwide provide an instrumental variable crowding out al-Qaeda coverage. Studying daily al-Qaeda coverage by CNN, NBC, CBS, and Fox News, as well as the NYT and the WaPo, results consistently produce a positive and statistically significant effect. At its mean, al-Qaeda coverage is suggested to cause 1.2-2.3 al-Qaeda attacks (equivalent to 5.8-10.9 deaths) in the upcoming week. Results are remarkably consistent across media outlets and it appears unlikely that attacks are simply delayed when coverage is low.
C26|The Consumption Response to Minimum Wages: Evidence from Chinese Households|This paper evaluates the Chinese minimum wage policy for the period 2002-2009 in terms of its impact on low income household consumption. Using a representative household panel, we find support for the permanent income hypothesis, whereby unanticipated and persistent income increases due to minimum wage policy change are fully spent. The impact is driven by households with at least one child. We infer significant positive welfare effects for low income households based on expenditure increases concentrated in health care and education, whereas a negative employment effect of higher minimum wage cannot be confirmed.
C26|El Efecto de la violencia sobre el uso del tiempo: El caso de México|Desde 2008 hasta 2011 se evidenció un aumento pronunciado en los niveles de violencia de México. Este trabajo analiza si se dieron cambios en la asignación del tiempo por esta mayor violencia diferenciando por sexo. Utilizando datos panel, y bajo un enfoque de variables instrumentales y efectos fijos, se identifica el efecto de la violencia sobre la asignación de tiempo en diferentes tareas. Los principales resultados muestran que las mujeres disminuyen su tiempo en actividades laborales y ocio. Los hombres no evidencian una disminución en su tiempo laboral, pero sí aumentan su tiempo en actividades domésticas. Las reacciones de las mujeres pueden retroceder los avances de México por acelerar la inclusión de las mujeres al mercado laboral.
C26|The Consumption Response to Minimum Wages: Evidence from Chinese Households|This paper evaluates the Chinese minimum wage policy for the period 2002-2009 in terms of its impact on low income household consumption. Using a representative household panel, we find support for the permanent income hypothesis, whereby unanticipated and persistent income increases due to minimum wage policy change are fully spent. The impact is driven by households with at least one child. We infer significant positive welfare effects for low income households based on expenditure increases concentrated in health care and education, whereas a negative employment effect of higher minimum wage cannot be confirmed.
C26|Can power-sharing foster peace? Evidence from Northern Ireland|In the absence of power-sharing, minority groups in opposition have powerful incentives to substitute the ballot with the bullet. In contrast, when power is shared among all major groups in society, the relative gains of sticking to electoral politics are larger for minority groups. After making the theoretical argument, we provide in the current paper an empirical analysis of the impact of power-sharing at the local level, making use of fine-grained data from Northern Ireland’s 26 local district councils over the 1973–2001 period. We find that power-sharing has a sizable and robust conflict-reducing impact.
C26|School Performance, Score Inflation and Economic Geography|We show that grading standards for primary school exams in England have triggered an inflation of quality indicators in the national performance tables for almost two decades. The cumulative effects have resulted in significant differences in the quality signaled to parents for otherwise identical schools. These differences are as good as random, with score inflation resulting from discretion in the grading of randomly assigned external markers. We find large housing price gains from the school quality improvements artificially signaled by inflation as well as lower deprivation and more businesses catering to families in local neighborhoods. The design ensures improved external validity for the valuation of school quality with respect to boundary discontinuities and has the potential for replication outside of our specific case study.
C26|Smoothed Estimating Equations For Instrumental Variables Quantile Regression|The moment conditions or estimating equations for instrumental variables quantile regression involves the discontinuous indicator function. We instead use smoothed estimating equations, with bandwidth h. This is known to allow higher-order expansions that justify bootstrap refinements for inference. Computation of the estimator also becomes simpler and more reliable, especially with (more) endogenous regressors. We show that the mean squared error of the vector of estimating equations is minimized for some h > 0, which also reduces the mean squared error of the parameter estimators. The same h also minimizes higher-order type I error for a χ2 test, leading to improved size-adjusted power. Our plug-in bandwidth consistently reproduces all of these properties in simulations.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C26|Research Design Meets Market Design: Using Centralized Assignment for Impact Evaluation| A growing number of school districts use centralized assignment mechanisms to allocate school seats in a manner that reflects student preferences and school priorities. Many of these assignment schemes use lotteries to ration seats when schools are oversubscribed. The resulting random assignment opens the door to credible quasi‐experimental research designs for the evaluation of school effectiveness. Yet the question of how best to separate the lottery‐generated randomization integral to such designs from non‐random preferences and priorities remains open. This paper develops easily‐implemented empirical strategies that fully exploit the random assignment embedded in a wide class of mechanisms, while also revealing why seats are randomized at one school but not another. We use these methods to evaluate charter schools in Denver, one of a growing number of districts that combine charter and traditional public schools in a unified assignment system. The resulting estimates show large achievement gains from charter school attendance. Our approach generates efficiency gains over ad hoc methods, such as those that focus on schools ranked first, while also identifying a more representative average causal effect. We also show how to use centralized assignment mechanisms to identify causal effects in models with multiple school sectors.
C26|Globalisation FinanciÃ¨re, Croissance et effets de seuil : Le Cas des pays en dÃ©veloppement Les moins avancÃ©s|In this article, we examine the impact of financial globalization on long-term economic growth. We test whether effects from different types of financial globalization: investment-globalization, indebtedness-globalization and financial globalization (investment plus indebtedness), are dependent until certain thresholds of macroeconomic stability and GDP per capita growth are attained. Estimates are performed with the two-step GMM system technique for dynamic panel data models for 72 developing countries from 1972 to 2011. Also, we use time-median calculation to capture the threshold effects in our sample. Our main results are the following. Financial globalization has a favorable impact on growth with the presence of minimum threshold effects in terms of macroeconomic stability and GDP per capita growth. A contrario, indebtedness-globalization negatively affects growth with the presence of minimum threshold effects in terms of macroeconomic stability and GDP per capita growth. If these thresholds are attained, they can decrease the negative impact of indebtedness-globalization and ultimately neutralize it. Finally, investment-globalization promotes economic growth with the potential existence of a maximum threshold effect in terms of GDP per capita growth. This maximum threshold corresponds to an inverted-U shape for the influence of investment-globalization on growth.
C26|New firmsâ€™ bankruptcy: does local banking market matter?|This paper investigates the role of local context, with regard to the effect of local financial development and banking concentration, on a new firmâ€™s probability of bankruptcy. Our empirical setting is based on the Logit Multilevel Model that better allows the treatment of data referring to different levels of aggregation (firm and local variables) applied to new firms located in Italian provinces. We find that a higher level of financial development in a province decreases the likelihood of a new firmâ€™s bankruptcy. This result is robust considering a 2SLS regression in which we use instruments for the local financial development and for the concentration of bank branches. In addition, our estimations suggest that the effect of local financial development and bank concentration is shaped by size. Local financial development is particularly significant for small start-ups, which traditionally suffer from great difficulty in accessing credit, whereas local banking concentration reduces the probability of bankruptcy for large, new firms.
C26|Flattening of the New Keynesian Phillips curve: Evidence for an emerging, small open economy|The flattening of the Phillips curve is a vigorously investigated phenomenon in many advanced economies. Still little evidence has been presented for emerging, small open economies facing persistently low inflation. In this paper I address this issue through rigorous estimation of a substantial number of stylized, open-economy hybrid new Keynesian Phillips curves for Poland. I find robust evidence of the flattening of the Phillips curve and the rising impact of external factors for both headline and core inflation. I conclude that during excessive disinflation in Poland the flattening of the Phillips curve can be partly explained by the underutilization of labour, whereas the stronger impact of global factors on core inflation suggests strengthening indirect effects. The changes in the estimated parameters indicate that the macroeconomic cost of bringing inflation back to the desired target has increased. Further identification of the reasons behind the flattening of the Phillips curve in an emerging, small open economy should provide useful insights for monetary policy.
C26|Endogeneity bias modeling using observables|This paper proposes an alternative solution to the endogeneity problem by explicitly modeling the joint interaction of the endogenous variables and the unobserved causes of the dependent variable as a function of additional observables. We derive identification of the parameters, develop an estimator, and establish its consistency and asymptotic normality.
C26|Quantifying the social costs of nuclear energy: Perceived risk of accident at nuclear power plants|The preferences expressed in voting on nuclear reactor licenses and the risk perceptions of citizens provide insights into social costs of nuclear power and decision making in energy policy. We show analytically that these costs consist of disutility caused by unnecessary anxiety - due to misperceived risks relating to existing reactors - and where licenses for new nuclear reactors are not granted, delayed or totally lost energy production. Empirical evidence is derived from Finnish surveys eliciting explicitly the importance of risk perceptions on preferences regarding nuclear power and its environmental and economic impacts. We show that the estimated marginal impact of a high perceived risk of nuclear accident is statistically significant and that such a perception considerably decreases the probability of a person supporting nuclear power. This result holds across a number of robustness checks including an instrumental variable estimation and a model validation by observed voting behavior of the members of Parliament. The public's risk perceptions translate into a significant social cost, and are likely to affect the revenues, costs and financing conditions in the nuclear power sector in the future.
C26|The return to labor market mobility: An evaluation of relocation assistance for the unemployed|In many European countries, labor markets are characterized by high regional disparities in terms of unemployment rates on the one hand and low geographical mobility among the unemployed on the other hand. In order to counteract the geographical mismatch of workers, the German active labor market policy offers a subsidy covering moving costs to incentivize unemployed job seekers to search/accept jobs in distant regions. Based on administrative data, this study provides the first empirical evidence on the impact of this subsidy on participants' prospective labor market outcomes. We use an instrumental variable approach to take endogenous selection based on observed and unobserved characteristics into account when estimating causal treatment effects. We find that unemployed job seekers who participate in the subsidy program and move to a distant region receive higher wages and find more stable jobs compared to non-participants. We show that the positive effects are (to a large extent) the consequence of a better job match due to the increased search radius of participants.
C26|Leasing and profitability: Empirical evidence from the airline industry|In this paper, we empirically measure the impact of aircraft leasing choices on airlines financial performance. We use public data on 73 airlines operating worldwide over the period 1996–2011. In estimating the impact of leasing on profitability, we control for potential endogeneity by applying robust instrumental variables estimation, while introducing a set of individual and macroeconomic factors. Our results are threefold. First, we identify a non-monotonic and concave effect of leasing on an airline’s profit margin, suggesting decreasing marginal returns to leasing in this sector. This is an original finding for the industry. We also derive a confidence interval for the optimal level of leasing. Second, we show that the impact of leasing on an airline’s operating profit is stronger for Low Cost Carriers than for Full Cost Carriers: deviating from the optimal level of leasing might be more harmful for a LCC than for a legacy carrier. Finally, we analyze how an airline’s experience affects the relationship between leasing and profitability.
C26|Electricity supply reliability and households decision to connect to the grid|"The 7th Sustainable Development Goal aims to ""ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all"". Because the cost to increase electrical capacity in Africa alonehas been estimated at $800bn, this article investigates the extent to which electricity reliability could contribute to a reduction in the marginal cost of grid extension by attracting more customers. Using lightning as an instrument for outages severity, the article evaluates the assumption that less uncertainty about electricity availability would lead to a larger number of connected households.The article finds that a one percentage point increase in electricity reliability would yield a 0.67 percentage point increase in connections. Therefore, delivering fully reliable electrical power would allow an electricity company to achieve its targeted growth of customer base 15 months earlier than planned.The effect of reliability is highest for middle-rich households, which are the most reluctant to subscribe in the presence of total, severe or partial outages. A one-percentage-point upgrade in reliability increase the likelihood that these households will be connected by 1.28 percentage points.This article also finds that households are more sensitive to outages in areas where outages are less frequent. In addition, the impact of reliability on households decision to connect could be at least 5% greater than the effect of poverty ; if the frequency of outages is too high, the wealth or poverty effect might vanish and households would respond only to the excessively low reliability.These results confirm the uncertainty assumption, that is, regular and severe outages yield an uninsurable context that deters households from subscribing to the electric service."

C26|Estimating dynamic panel models: backing out the Nickell Bias|We propose a novel estimator for the dynamic panel model, which solves the failure of strict exogeneity by calculating the bias in the first-order conditions as a function of the autoregressive parameter and solving the resulting equation. We show that this estimator performs well as compared with approaches in current use. We also propose a general method for including predetermined variables in fixed-effects panel regressions that appears to perform well.
C26|Real Rates and Consumption Smoothing in a Low Interest Rate Environment: The Case of Japan|We study the dynamics of consumption, the real interest rate, and measures of labor input in Japan over the period from 1985-2014. We identify structural breaks in macroeconomic aggregates during the 1990s and associate them with the zero interest rate policy pursued by the Bank of Japan and the surprise increase in the consumption tax rate in April 1997. Formal estimation using the Generalized Methods of Moments shows that the mid-1990s are characterized by breaks in the structural parameters governing household consumption and labor supply decisions. Specifically, following the tax hike and during the low nominal rate period, Japanese households became less risk averse and exhibited a higher degree of habit formation.
C26|Evaluating local average and quantile treatment effects under endogeneity based on instruments: a review|This paper provides a review of methodological advancements in the evaluation of heterogeneous treatment effect models based on instrumental variable (IV) methods. We focus on models that achieve identification through a monotonicity assumption on the selection equation and analyze local average and quantile treatment effects for the subpopulation of compliers. We start with a comprehensive discussion of the binary treatment and binary instrument case which is relevant for instance in randomized experiments with imperfect compliance. We then review extensions to identification and estimation with covariates, multi-valued and multiple treatments and instruments, outcome attrition and measurement error, and the identification of direct and indirect treatment effects, among others. We also discuss testable implications and possible relaxations of the IV assumptions, approaches to extrapolate from local to global treatment effects, and the relationship to other IV approaches.
C26|Testing the validity of the compulsory schooling law instrument|Based on Huber and Mellace (2015) and Kitagawa (2015), we test the validity of compulsory schooling laws as instrument for endogenous schooling choices in the SHARE data. We do not refute the instrument, but acknowledge that its validity might be violated even if testable implications hold.
C26|The General Nesting Logit (GNL) Model using Aggregate Data|We study the general nesting logit (GNL) model for differentiated products proposed by Fosgerau and de Palma (2016) as a member of the family of generalized entropies built by Fosgerau, Melo, de Palma and Shum (2017), to estimate demand when using aggregate data. We show that the GNL model allows products to be independent, substitutable, or complementary. While Fosgerau and de Palma (2016) show that it can be transformed into a linear regression, we show that this linear regression is very similar to that of Berry (1994) for the nested logit in that it is just a regression of market shares on product characteristics and terms related to its nesting structure. We then use the Dominick's database for estimating the demand for cereals in Chicago in 1991-1992.
C26|The entrepreuneurial context, a factor of Economic Growth in the Europe Union? A GWR Analysis on the EU Regions|Recently the literature has paid more attention to the entrepreneurial environment, to explain the role of entrepreneurship in the economic development. However nowadays very little empirical contributions demonstrate that the entrepreneurial environment really counts (Acs et al., 2014; Szerb et al., 2015; Acs et al., 2017) in promoting quality entrepreneurship. By using the GWR, we explored the spatial heterogeneity of the role of entrepreneurial context to explain differences in levels of regional development. In our study, the entrepreneurial environment is measured by the Regional Entrepreneurship and Development Index (REDI) for the EU regions. The results show that the entrepreneurial environment on the level of regional development suggests some positive or negative impact, depending on the location of the regions.
C26|An introduction to using twin births as instrumental variables for sibship size|Some families who experience a twin birth get one more child than they had intended and planned for. This is the reason why twin births are used to create instrumental variables (IVs) for the number of children in a family. In this chapter I introduce IV techniques in general and the use of twin births for IVs in particular. IVs based on parity-specific twin births can indeed, under certain circumstances, be valid and reliable. In this chapter I discuss what these circumstances are. I rely heavily on the work by Joshua Angrist and coauthors. In contrast to them I argue that it is important to recognize that IVs based on parity-specific twin births have “heterogenous treatment effects”, meaning that it is only for some families that the twin birth leads to an unintended and unplanned birth. Recognizing this highlights a few assumptions that are not always thoroughly acknowledged in previous research. We, for example, need to make assumptions about the possibility of unintended single births and the families experiencing these. It is also the case that including families that have not yet reached (or surpassed) their desired number of children when using IVs based on parity-specific twin births will lead to estimates that are biased towards zero. Most importantly we need to reduce the claims of estimating generalizable, causal effects when using twin birth instrumental variables.
C26|The effect of fertility timing on labor market work duration|We provide a framework for the estimation of the impact of fertility timing on female long-term labor supply, measured as labor market work duration. We show that the genuine treatment is waiting time to birth rather than birth per se. In the application we control for the joint decision of fertility and labor supply by using the ‘same-sex’ instrument in a control function setting. We find that having a third child will in general reduce the labor market work duration. The magnitude of the effect depends to a large extent on the mothers’ age at second birth but also on the waiting time to the third child and the education level.
C26|Identification, Instruments, Omitted Variables, and Rudimentary Models: Fallacies in the ‘Experimental Approach’ to Econometrics|Since identification, instrumental variables and variables exclusion, core concepts in econometrics, are entwined, several questions arise: How is identification related to the existence of IVs? How are identification criteria related to omitted variables? Is omission/inclusion of variables from a model’s equations part of the definition of IVs? Is exogeneity a critical claim to an IV? Is ‘omitted variables’ a meaningful term for a single equation when its ‘environment’ is incompletely described? Which are the borderlines between omitted, observable variables, omitted non-modeled variables, latent variables represented by proxies or measurement error mechanisms? These are among the questions addressed in this paper, partly with reference to the conflict between ‘experimentalists’ and ‘structuralists’, specifically relating to: (i) the contrast between ‘rudimentary models’ and models for ‘limited information inference’, (ii) the distinction between exogeneity of variables and the orthogonality claim for IVs and disturbances or errors, (iii) the role of predetermined variables in selecting IVs, and (iv) the ‘omitted variables’ concept and the role of IVs in ‘handling’ such variables, when considering the ‘origin’ of the omission.
C26|It's never too LATE: A new look at local average treatment effects with or without defiers|In heterogeneous treatment effect models with endogeneity, identification of the LATE typically relies on the availability of an exogenous instrument monotonically related to treatment participation. We demonstrate that a strictly weaker local monotonicity condition identifies the LATEs on compliers and on defiers. We propose simple estimators that are potentially more efficient than 2SLS, even under circumstances where 2SLS is consistent. Additionally, when easing local monotonicity to local stochastic monotonicity, our identification results still apply to subsets of compliers and defiers. Finally, we provide an empirical application, rejoining the endeavor of estimating returns to education using the quarter of birth instrument.
C26|Inequality, crime, and the long run legacy of slavery|This paper investigates the relationship between economic inequality and crime in Colombian municipalities. Following recent scholarly research that suggests that the legacy of slavery is largely manifest in persistent levels of economic inequality, we instrument economic inequality with a census-based measure of the proportion of slaves in each municipality before the abolition of slavery in the 19 century. We also explore the robustness of our estimates to relaxing the exclusion restriction, as the slavery instrument is only plausibly exogenous. We document a strong association between inequality and both violent and property crime rates at the municipal level. Our estimates are robust to including traditional determinants of crime (like population density, the proportion of young males, the average education level, the quality of law enforcement institutions, and the overall economic activity), as well as current ethnic differences and geographic characteristics that may be correlated both with the slave economy and with crime.
C26|The influence function of semiparametric estimators| There are many economic parameters that depend on nonparametric first steps. Examples include games, dynamic discrete choice, average consumer surplus, and treatment effects. Often estimators of these parameters are asymptotically equivalent to a sample average of an object referred to as the influence function. The influence function is useful in formulating regularity conditions for asymptotic normality, for bias reduction, in efficiency comparisons, and for analyzing robustness. We show that the influence function of a semiparametric estimator is the limit of a Gateaux derivative with respect to a smooth deviation as the deviation approaches a point mass. This result generalizes the classic Von Mises (1947) and Hampel (1974) calculation to apply to estimators that depend on smooth nonparametic first steps. We characterize the influence function of M and GMM-estimators.We apply the Gateaux derivative to derive the influence function with a first step nonparametric two stage least squares estimator based on orthogonality conditions. We also use the influence function to analyze high level and primitive regularity conditions for asymptotic normality. We give primitive regularity conditions for linear functionals of series regression that are the weakest known, except for a log term, when the regression function is smooth enough.
C26|Non-asymptotic inference in instrumental variables estimation| This paper presents a simple non-asymptotic method for carrying out inference in IV models. The method is a non-Studentized version of the Anderson-Rubin test but is motivated and analyzed differently. In contrast to the conventional Anderson-Rubin test, the method proposed here does not require restrictive distributional assumptions, linearity of the estimated model, or simultaneous equations. Nor does it require knowledge of whether the instruments are strong or weak. It does not require testing or estimating the strength of the instruments. The method can be applied to quantile IV models that may be nonlinear and can be used to test a parametric IV model against a nonparametric alternative. The results presented here hold in finite samples, regardless of the strength of the instruments.
C26|Exact computation of GMM estimators for instrumental variable quantile regression models|We show that the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation problem in instrumental variable quantile regression (IVQR) models can be equivalently formulated as a mixed‐integer quadratic programming problem. This enables exact computation of the GMM estimators for the IVQR models. We illustrate the usefulness of our algorithm via Monte Carlo experiments and an application to demand for fish.
C26|Trend Inflation and Evolving Inflation Dynamics: A Bayesian GMM Analysis of the Generalized New Keynesian Phillips Curve|Inflation dynamics in the U.S. and Japan are investigated by estimating a “generalized” version of the Galí and Gertler (1999) New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) with Bayesian GMM. This generalized NKPC (GNKPC) differs from the original only in that, in line with the micro evidence, each period some prices remain unchanged even under non-zero trend inflation. Yet the GNKPC has features that are significantly distinct from those of the NKPC. Model selection using quasi-marginal likelihood shows that the GNKPC empirically outperforms the NKPC in both the U.S. and Japan. Moreover, it explains U.S. inflation dynamics better than a constant-trend-inflation variant of the Cogley and Sbordone (2008) GNKPC. According to our selected GNKPC, when trend inflation fell after the Great Inflation of the 1970s in the U.S., the probability of no price change rose. Consequently, the GNKPC’s slope flattened and its inflation- inertia coefficient decreased. As for Japan, when trend inflation turned slightly negative after the late 1990s (until the early 2010s), the fraction of backward-looking price setters increased; therefore, the GNKPC’s inflation-inertia coefficient increased and its slope flattened.
C26|Automatic portmanteau tests with applications to market risk management|In this article, we review some recent advances in testing for serial correlation, provide code for implementation, and illustrate this code’s application to market risk forecast evaluation. We focus on the classic and widely used portman- teau tests and their data-driven versions. These tests are simple to implement for two reasons: First, the researcher does not need to specify the order of the tested autocorrelations, because the test automatically chooses this number. Second, its asymptotic null distribution is chi-squared with one degree of freedom, so there is no need to use a bootstrap procedure to estimate the critical values. We illustrate the wide applicability of this methodology with applications to forecast evaluation for market risk measures such as value-at-risk and expected shortfall.

C26|Identification and Generalized Band Spectrum Estimation of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve|This article proposes a new identification strategy and a new estimation method for the hybrid New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC). Unlike the predominant Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach, which leads to weak identification of the NKPC with U.S. postwar data, our nonparametric method exploits nonlinear variation in inflation dynamics and provides supporting evidence of point-identification. This article shows that identification of the NKPC is characterized by two conditional moment restrictions. This insight leads to a quantitative method to assess identification in the NKPC. For estimation, the article proposes a closed-form Generalized Band Spectrum Estimator (GBSE) that effectively uses information from the conditional moments, accounts for nonlinear variation, and permits a focus on short-run dynamics. Applying the GBSE to U.S postwar data, we find a significant coefficient of marginal cost and that the forward-looking component and the inflation inertia are both equally quantitatively important in explaining the short-run inflation dynamics, substantially reducing sampling uncertainty relative to existing GMM estimates.
C26|Do Vocational High School Graduates Have Better Employment Outcomes than General High School Graduates?|This paper estimates the causal effect of vocational high school (VHS) education on employment likeli-hood relative to general high school (GHS) education in Turkey using census data. To address non-random selection into high school types, we collect construction dates of the VHSs at the town-level and use VHS availability in the town by age 13 as an instrumental variable. The first-stage estimates suggest that the availability of VHS does not affect the overall high school graduation rates, but gener-ates a substitution from GHS to VHS. The OLS estimates yield the result that the individuals with a VHS degree are around 5 percentage points more likely to be employed compared to those with a GHS de-gree. When we use the availability of VHS as an instrumental variable, we still find positive and statisti-cally significant effect of VHS degree on employment likelihood relative to GHS degree. However, once we include town-specific socio-economic variables to control for education, employment, and business activity levels in the town, the IV estimates get much smaller and become statistically insignificant. We conclude that although the VHS construction generates a substitution from GHS to VHS education, this substitution is not transformed into increased employment rates in a statistically significant way. We also argue that location-specific controls improve the reliability of the school construction/proximity instruments.
C26|Bounds with Imperfect Instruments: Leveraging the Implicit Assumption of Intransitivity in Correlations|"Instrumental variables (IV) is an indispensable tool for establishing causal relationships between variables. Recent work has focused on improving bounds for cases when an ideal instrument does not exist. We leverage a principle, ""Intransitivity in Correlations,"" related to an under-utilized property from the statistics literature. From this principle, it is straightforward to obtain new bounds. We argue that these new theoretical bounds become increasingly useful as instruments become increasingly weak or invalid."
C26|Terrorism and the Media: The Effect of US Television Coverage on Al-Qaeda Attacks|Can media coverage of a terrorist organization encourage their execution of further attacks? This paper analyzes the day-to-day news coverage of Al-Qaeda on US television since 9/11 and the group's terrorist strikes. To isolate causality, I use disaster deaths worldwide as an exogenous variation that crowds out Al-Qaeda coverage in an instrumental variable framework. The results suggest a positive and statistically powerful effect of CNN, NBC, CBS, and Fox News coverage on subsequent Al-Qaeda attacks. This result is robust to a battery of alternative estimations, extensions, and placebo regressions. One minute of Al-Qaeda coverage in a 30-minute news segment causes approximately one attack in the upcoming week, equivalent to 4.9 casualties, on average.
C26|The response of parental time investments to the child’s skills and health|Recent empirical research in family economics has shown the importance of parental investments on child's human capital development, but it is still not clear whether parents respond to changes across time in their child's skills and health. Using the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, we measure parental investments by considering the time parents spend with their child doing formative activities. By adopting a child fixed-effect instrumental variable estimation to address endogeneity issues, we find that parents reinforce for differences in their child's socio-emotional skills, compensate for changes in her physical health, and are neutral to variation in her cognitive skills.
C26|School Performance, Score Inflation and Economic Geography| We show that grading standards for primary school exams in England have triggered an inflation of quality indicators in the national performance tables for almost two decades. The cumulative effects have resulted in significant differences in the quality signaled to parents for otherwise identical schools. These differences are as good as random, with score manipulation resulting from discretion in the grading of randonly assigned external markers. We find large housing price gains from the school quality improvements artificially signaled by manipulation as well as lower deprivation and more businesses catering to families in local neighbourhoods. The design ensures improved external validity for the valuation of school quality with respect to boundary discontinuities and has the potential for replication outside of our specific case study.
C26|Agglomeration economies in the formal and informal sectors : a Bayesian spatial approach|This paper examines whether localized clusters of similar industries produce agglomeration economies in the formal and informal sectors. We develop a Bayesian method to estimate a spatial autoregressive model with an endogenous independent variable. We use establishment-level census data that cover both formal registered and informal unregistered establishments in Cambodia. We find that the density of local employment has a significantly positive effect on productivity in the informal sector, but little effect in the formal sector. For manufacturing, a doubling of employment density increases productivity in the informal sector by 9% through local linkages and by 17% through spatial multiplier linkages, leading to a 26% increase in total. A spatial network magnifies the local impact of agglomeration economies in the informal sector.
C26|Robust linear static panel data models using ε-contamination|The paper develops a general Bayesian framework for robust linear static panel data models usingε-contamination. A two-step approach is employed to derive the conditional type-II maximum likelihood (ML-II) posterior distribution of the coefficients and individual effects. The ML-II posterior means are weighted averages of the Bayes estimator under a base prior and the data-dependent empirical Bayes estimator. Two-stage and three stage hierarchy estimators are developed and their finite sample performance is investigated through a series of Monte Carlo experiments. These include standard random effects as well as Mundlak-type, Chamberlain-type and Hausman–Taylor-type models. The simulation results underscore the relatively good performance of the three-stage hierarchy estimator. Within a single theoretical framework, our Bayesian approach encompasses a variety of specifications while conventional methods require separate estimators for each case.
C26|Alternative Graphical Representations of the Confidence Intervals for the Structural Coefficient from Exactly Identified Two-Stage Least Squares|In the case of the just identified model the exact distribution of the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator of the coefficient of the endogenous regressor is a ratio of two normally distributed random variables. Robert Basmann (1960, 1961, 1974) used Fieller’s 1932 result to derive the density function of the estimator. In this paper we employ a novel graphical exposition of Fieller’s subsequent 1954 technique to approximate the confidence interval for the ratio. This approach involves the construction of a constraint shape that provides an insight as to how the characteristics of the reduced form estimates influences the comparison of the Delta and the Fieller confidence intervals. In particular, the degree of endogeneity and the relevance of the instrument can be shown to have a direct influence on these shapes. An example application of this approach is then applied to consider two specifications of an exactly identified model.
C26|Electricity supply reliability and households decision to connect to the grid|"The 7th Sustainable Development Goal aims to ""ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all"". Because the cost to increase electrical capacity in Africa alone has been estimated at $800bn, this article investigates the extent to which electricity reliability could contribute to a reduction in the marginal cost of grid extension by attracting more customers. Using lightning as an instrument for outages severity, the article evaluates the assumption that less uncertainty about electricity availability would lead to a larger number of connected households. The article finds that a one percentage point increase in electricity reliability would yield a 0.67 percentage point increase in connections. Therefore, delivering fully reliable electrical power would allow an electricity company to achieve its targeted growth of customer base 15 months earlier than planned. The effect of reliability is highest for middle-rich households, which are the most reluctant to subscribe in the presence of total, severe or partial outages. A one-percentage-point upgrade in reliability increase the likelihood that these households will be connected by 1.28 percentage points. This article also finds that households are more sensitive to outages in areas where outages are less frequent. In addiction, the impact of reliability on households decision to connect could be at least 5% greater than the effect of poverty; if the frequency of outages is too high, the wealth or poverty effect might vanish and households would respond only to the excessively low reliability. These results confirm the uncertainty assumption, that is, regular and severe outages yield an uninsurable context that deters households from subscribing to the electric service"
C26|Maimonides Rule Redux|We use the discontinuous function of enrollment known as Maimonides Rule as an instrument for class size in large Israeli samples from 2002-2011. As in the 1991 data analyzed by Angrist and Lavy (1999), Maimonides Rule still has a strong first stage. In contrast with the earlier Israeli estimates, however, Maimonides-based instrumental variables estimates using more recent data show no effect of class size on achievement. The new data also reveal substantial enrollment sorting near Maimonides cutoffs, with too many schools having enrollment values that just barely produce an extra class. A modified rule that uses data on students’ birthdays to compute statutory enrollment in the absence of enrollment manipulation also generates a precisely estimated zero. In older data, the original Maimonides Rule is unrelated to socioeconomic characteristics, while in more recent data, the original rule is unrelated to socioeconomic characteristics conditional on a few controls. Enrollment manipulation therefore appears to be innocuous: neither the original negative effects nor the recent data zeros seem likely to be manipulation artifacts.
C26|Mis-classified, Binary, Endogenous Regressors: Identification and Inference|This paper studies identification and inference for the effect of a mis-classified, binary, endogenous regressor when a discrete-valued instrumental variable is available. We begin by showing that the only existing point identification result for this model is incorrect. We go on to derive the sharp identified set under mean independence assumptions for the instrument and measurement error, and that these fail to point identify the effect of interest. This motivates us to consider alternative and slightly stronger assumptions: we show that adding second and third moment independence assumptions suffices to identify the model. We then turn our attention to inference. We show that both our model, and related models from the literature that assume regressor exogeneity, suffer from weak identification when the effect of interest is small. To address this difficulty, we exploit the inequality restrictions that emerge from our derivation of the sharp identified set under mean independence only. These restrictions remain informative irrespective of the strength of identification. Combining these with the moment equalities that emerge from our identification result, we propose a robust inference procedure using tools from the moment inequality literature. Our method performs well in simulations.
C26|Comparing 2SLS vs 2SRI for Binary Outcomes and Binary Exposures|This study uses Monte Carlo simulations to examine the ability of the two-stage least-squares (2SLS) estimator and two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) estimators with varying forms of residuals to estimate the local average and population average treatment effect parameters in models with binary outcome, endogenous binary treatment, and single binary instrument. The rarity of the outcome and the treatment are varied across simulation scenarios. Results show that 2SLS generated consistent estimates of the LATE and biased estimates of the ATE across all scenarios. 2SRI approaches, in general, produce biased estimates of both LATE and ATE under all scenarios. 2SRI using generalized residuals minimizes the bias in ATE estimates. Use of 2SLS and 2SRI is illustrated in an empirical application estimating the effects of long-term care insurance on a variety of binary healthcare utilization outcomes among the near-elderly using the Health and Retirement Study.
C26|Impact Evaluation in Matching Markets with General Tie-Breaking|Many centralized matching schemes incorporate a mix of random lottery and non-lottery tie-breaking. A leading example is the New York City public school district, which uses criteria like test scores and interviews to generate applicant rankings for some schools, combined with lottery tie-breaking at other schools. We develop methods that identify causal effects of assignment in such settings. Our approach generalizes the standard regression discontinuity design to allow for many running variables and treatments, some of which are randomly assigned. We show that lottery variation generates assignment risk at non-lottery programs for applicants away from non-lottery cutoffs, while non-lottery variation randomizes applicants near cutoffs regardless of lottery risk. These methods are applied to evaluate New York City’s school progress assessments, which give schools letter grades as a summary measure of quality. Our estimates reveal that although Grade A schools boost achievement, these gains emerge only for students who attend lottery schools. Attendance at a coveted Grade A screened school, including some of the highest performing in the district, generates no measurable effects. Evaluation methods that fail to take advantage of both lottery and non-lottery variation miss this difference in impact.
C26|The Effect of Age-Specific Sex Ratios on Crime: Instrumental Variable Estimates from India|Using data from 1961 to 2001, we show the impact on crime of two age-specific sex ratios corresponding to pre-marital (ages 10 to 16) and marriageable (ages 20 to 26) age groups in India. To deal with the endogeneity of sex ratios, we use an Instrumental Variable (IV) strategy that exploits district level variation in historical area under wheat-rice cultivation, and time-variation in relative producer prices of wheat-rice. We find that an increase in 10-16 age sex ratio by one female per 1000 males leads to a 1.5
C26|Additive Nonparametric Instrumental Regressions: A Guide to Implementation|We present a review on the implementation of regularization methods for the estimation of additive nonparametric regression models with instrumental variables. We consider various versions of Tikhonov, Landweber-Fridman and Sieve (Petrov-Galerkin) regularization. We review data-driven techniques for the sequential choice of the smoothing and the regularization parameters. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we discuss the finite sample properties of each regularization method for different smoothness properties of the regression function. Finally, we present an application to the estimation of the Engel curve for food in a sample of rural households in Pakistan, where a partially linear specification is described that allows one to embed other exogenous covariates.
C26|Forecasting Chilean inflation with the hybrid new keynesian Phillips curve: globalisation, combination, and accuracy|This article analyses the multi-horizon predictive power of the Hybrid New Keynesian Phillips Curve (HNKPC) covering the period from January 2000 to December 2014, for the Chilean economy. A distinctive feature of this article is the use of a Global Vector Autoregression (GVAR) specification of the HNKPC to enforce an open economy version. Another feature is the use of direct measures of inflation expectations—Consensus Forecasts—differing from a fully-founded rational expectations model. The HNKPC point forecasts are evaluated using the Mean Squared Forecast Error statistic and statistically compared with several benchmarks, including combined forecasts. The results indicate that there is evidence not to reject the hypothesis of the HNKPC for the Chilean economy, and it is also robust to alternative specifications. Outof- sample results are mixed between atheoretical benchmarks and the HNKPC by itself or participating in a combined prediction with the random walk. This combined forecast delivers the most accurate forecasts at horizons comprised within a year; whereas, in the long run is not accurate enough to outperform the statistical models.
C26|The Causal Effect of Retirement on Health Services Utilization: Evidence from Urban Vietnam|Access to medical services is significantly essential for retaining and improving health status for aging population. Whilst retired individuals tend to have more time for the use of health services, there is only inadequate evidence evaluating the causal effect of retirement on health services utilization. To fulfill this gap in the literature especially from developing countries, this paper estimates the causal effect of retirement on the probability and the frequency of doctor visits at public health facilities in urban Vietnam. Employing authorized retirement ages for both men and women in Vietnam as instruments for the probability to be retired, the paper shows that retirement significantly increases some outcomes of outpatient health services for both male and female. In particular, the baseline 2SLS estimates indicate that men who are retired are more likely to have any outpatient medical visit than those who are not retired by about 36.1%. Meanwhile, retirement rises both the likelihood and the frequency of outpatient visits for female by roughly 31% and 1.75 times respectively. However, this paper finds statistically insignificant impacts of retirement on utilization outcomes for inpatient services.
C26|Estimating excess sensitivity and habit persistence in consumption using Greenbook forecast as an instrument|In this paper, we revisit the issue of excess sensitivity of consumption to income and address the weak instrument problem that is well documented in this literature. Using quarterly data for the U.S. economy, we first highlight the weak instrument problem by showing that the use of conventional instruments tends to overestimate the share of rule-of-thumb consumers. To address this weak instrument problem, we propose a new instrument for endogenous disposable income growth in the consumption function, namely, the Greenbook forecast of real disposable income growth. We show that this instrument encompasses the information contained in the conventional set of instruments, and is a superior predictor of income growth. We find that using our proposed instrument ameliorates the weak instrument problem and provides a much smaller estimate for the rule-of-thumb consumers. We also extend our empirical framework to allow for habit persistence and provide an estimate for this important parameter of the consumption function. Finally, we use a time-varying specification of consumption function that allows for endogenous regressors, and document a decline in the share of rule-of-thumb consumers and a rise in the habit- persistence parameter in the U.S. over our sample period. We find that an increase in credit growth and supplementary income benefits are negatively correlated with share of rule-of-thumb consumers, whereas they are positively correlated with habit persistence parameter.
C26|Bank Stability and Competition: Evidence from Albanian Banking Market|This paper analyses the inter-temporal competition – stability nexus after the global financial crises. For this reason, the empirical estimation approach follows a five – step procedure. First, we utilise quarterly macroeconomic and balance sheet and income statement data for 16 banks operating in the Albanian banking sector over the period 2008 – 2015. Second, we calculate a new composite index as a measure of bank stability conditions, which includes a wide set of information rather than focusing only on one aspect of risk. Then, we construct a proxy for bank competition such as the Boone indicator. Empirical estimations are based on the General Method of Moments approach. A set of robustness checks include also the use of other alternative proxy of competition such as the Lerner index and the efficient-adjusted Lerner index, profit elasticity and the Herfindahl index. Empirical results strongly support the “competition – stability” view after the global financial crises - that higher degree of competition boosts further bank stability conditions. Results further indicate that greater concentration has also a negative impact on bank stability. Results imply also that bank stability is positively linked with macroeconomic conditions and capital ratio and inverse with operational efficiency. Finally, we do not find a non-linear relationship between competition and stability.
C26|Did Protestantism Promote Economic Prosperity via Higher Human Capital?|This paper investigates the Becker-Woessmann (2009) argument that Protestants were more prosperous in nineteenth-century Prussia because they were more literate, a version of the Weber thesis, and shows that it cannot be sustained. The econometric analysis on which Becker and Woessman based their argument is fundamentally flawed, because their instrumental variable does not satisfy the exclusion restriction. When an appropriate instrumental-variable specification is used, the evidence from nineteenth-century Prussia rejects the human-capital version of the Weber thesis put forward by Becker and Woessmann.
C26|Monetary Policy Reaction Functions of the TICKs: A Quantile Regression Approach| This study investigates how Taiwan, India, China, and Korea (TICKs) set interest rates in the context of policy reaction functions using a quantile-based approach. Our results indicate the tendency of a milder response to inflation at low interest rates and greater response at higher quantiles of interest rates, where inflation is presumably higher than desired for China and South Korea. While the response to inflation over the quantiles is significant for India, yet the Taylor principle is less likely to hold. For Taiwan, the results imply that another instrument is employed to deal with its official managed floating currency.
C26|Nonparametric estimation in case of endogenous selection|This paper addresses the problem of estimation of a nonparametric regression function from selectively observed data when selection is endogenous. Our approach relies on independence between covariates and selection conditionally on potential outcomes. Endogeneity of regressors is also allowed for. In the exogenous and endogenous case, consistent two-step estimation procedures are proposed and their rates of convergence are derived. Pointwise asymptotic distribution of the estimators is established. In addition, bootstrap uniform confidence bands are obtained. Finite sample properties are illustrated in a Monte Carlo simulation study and an empirical illustration.
C26|Financial Inclusion and Household Consumption: Case of Nigeria|The recent awareness of the important role of finance in economic growth and development has stimulated interests of policy-makers and other stakeholders in expanding households’ financial access for inclusion economic growth and economic development. This paper is a contribution to the scant literature using micro-data to investigate the effects of financial inclusion on economic outcomes of households. Based on the data of Living Standards and Demographic survey of 2010 and 2012, this paper focuses on households’ welfare through consumption in Nigeria. The study employs the panel data approach to analyze the effects of financial inclusion on household consumption, controlling for the endogeneity of the financial inclusion itself, and concludes that access to finance has a positive impact on households’ consumption. This has implication for policy makers and practitioners to use access to finance as a tool for poverty reduction in the Nigeria.
