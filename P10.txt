P10|Equity Finance: Matching Liability to Power|There is widespread concern that the bonus culture for senior managers in limited liability companies is having adverse effects, e.g. on risk-taking, leverage and lower longer-term investment. The moral hazard of limited liability was appreciated in the 19th century, when unlimited or multiple liability, especially for bankers, was widely adopted. Whereas outside, notably retail, investors still need the protection of limited liability, we advocate moving towards a two-tier equity system, primarily for banks, with insiders, senior managers and others with influence over corporate decisions, becoming subject to multiple liability. But the transition costs of doing so suddenly would be great, so our proposal is to start by applying this initially just to Systemically Important Financial Intermediaries.

P10|Market mechanisms in conventional economics and Islamic Economics|This article describes the market as a meeting place between demand and supply for the type of goods or services. In a capitalist economic system, buyers and sellers bargain with each other to determine prices that give freedom to the market and the government must not intervene which can disrupt the market balance. While the socialist economic system has a view by eliminating the role of markets and the government plays an active role in resolving and regulating all economic problems. In Islamic economics, the market is left freely or the government distorts the existence of a market mechanism. Using a comparative approach to the existing economic system in the world, this article concludes that the Islamic economic system combines market freedom and the role of government that emphasizes the principle of maslahah (goodness), which is a condition of market justice that emphasizes the fulfillment of people's needs in achieving welfare (falah).
P10|The Impact of the State on the Quality of an Economic System: A Cross-Country Analysis|The paper discusses the role of the state in shaping an economic system which is, in line with the welfare economics approach, capable of performing socially important functions and achieving socially desirable results. We describe this system through a set of indexes: the IHDI, the World Happiness Index, and the Satisfaction of Life index. The characteris-tics of the state are analyzed using a set of variables which describe both the quantitative (government size, various types of governmental expenditures, and regulatory burden) and qualitative (institutional setup and property rights protection) aspects of its functioning. The study examines the “old” and “new” member states of the European Union, the post-communist countries of Eastern Europe and Asia, and the economies of Latin America. The main conclusion of the research is that the institutional quality of the state seems to be the most important for creation of a socially effective economic system, while the level of state interventionism plays, at most, a secondary and often negligible role. Geographical differentiation is also discovered, as well as the lack of a direct correlation between the characteristics of an economic system and the subjective feeling of well-being. These re-sults may corroborate the neo-institutionalist hypothesis that noneconomic factors, such as historical, institutional, cultural, and even genetic factors, may play an important role in making the economic system capable to perform its tasks; this remains an area for future research.
P10|Determinants of Capital Structure: An Empirical Analysis of Listed Companies in Thailand Stock Exchange SET 100 Index|The main purpose of this study is to investigate some financial indicators that affect the debt ratio in Thailand?s capital market. Two competing theories that explicate the capital structure are old-fashioned pecking order and static trade-off model. From existing literature reviews, we select seven traditional factors: profitability, asset structure, size, liquidity, non-debt tax shields, dividend policy and growth as explanatory variables. While long-term debt and total debt are used as proxies for dependent variables. This study uses secondary data collected from annual financial statements of companies in SET 100 index exclude financial business sector. All firms rank highest market capitalization and top trading liquidity in Thailand Stock Exchange for a period of 10 years during 2009-2018. After examine the data, only 760 samples are qualified under criteria. Two panel multiple regression models are implemented for statistic testing at the significant level 0.05.The results for model 1 (Long term debt) show positive and statistical significant effect of asset structure, size, liquidity and growth. While other three factors comprising profitability, non-debt tax shield and dividend policy indicate negative statistical relationships. The results for model 2 (Total debt) show positive and statistical significant effect of asset structure and growth. Whereas, two factors including profitability and liquidity display negative statistical correlation. The results of the two models are consistent with the Pecking Order theory for profitability and growth. High growth firms have higher need for funds then expect to borrow more. While asset structure is consistent with trade-off theory which hold that there should be a positive relationship between fixed assets and debt since fixed assets can serve as collateral. The explanatory variables which have the highest impact on capital structure choices for long term debt and total debt are non-debt tax shield and profitability respectively. Other independent variables such as product uniqueness, risk and macroeconomic indicators are subject to future research.
P10|A Review of Rent-seekers, Profits, Wages and Inequality, The Top 20%, 2019 by Peter Mihalyi and Ivan Szelenyi|The authors, Péter Mihályi and Iván Szelényi, set themselves the ambitious task of formulating an alternative discourse about inequality in which the extent of inequality per se is not the problem but rather where inequalities stem from? Herein lies their fundamental divergence with Piketty (2014) for whom the excessive growth of “profits” is assumed to be the source of inequalities. The problem with mainstream economics and Piketty is that “profit” and “rent” are lumped together. A critical distinction between the two is warranted to grasp the relationship between inequalities, innovation and economic growth. In line with Kornai’s criticism of Piketty (2016), the authors insist on the source of inequality. Are they engendered by wages and profits earned on competitive markets or are they originated from rents due to imposed restrictions on market competition? In contrast with Piketty, the general assumption of the authors is that higher profits and wages often add to the annual growth or national income. Rents on the other hand lower annual growth. Although some forms of rent may even be useful, excessive rents breeds economic stagnation.
P10|Kapitalismus versus Marktwirtschaft. Karl Marx und Fernand Braudel|Since the beginning of the finance crisis, the notion of capitalism and the adjective capitalistic are more and more employed in public discourse without making an attempt to define it. In contrast, the concept of market economy is less used. We try in this paper to differentiate both concepts by going back to the approaches by Karl Marx (1818-1883) and Fernand Braudel (1902-1985). Marx does not use the term capitalism but only capitalistic production, while Braudel argues on the basis of a wealth of empirical evidence that one has to differentiate between capitalism and market economy, because he sees a contrast between them. For this reason, he has different view of a capitalistic economy as Marx has. JEL classification: B14, B24, P10, P16, P5

P10|The Economics of African American Slavery: The Cliometrics Debate|This working paper explores the significant contributions to the history of African-American slavery made by the application of the tools of cliometrics. As used here “cliometrics” is defined as a method of scientific analysis marked by the explicit use of economic theory and quantitative methods. American slavery of the late antebellum period [1840-1860] was one of the earliest topics that cliometricians focused on and, arguably, the topic upon which they made the largest impact.
P10|Economics of Information Biasing: A Unified Economic Theory That Leads to New Sustainability Concepts|The author believes that his concept “Biased Equilibrium” based on information sharing strategies of individual economic agents brings two scientific paradigms of economics, neoclassical economics and institutional economics together from the origin of general equilibrium to provide holistic view of real world economic and social structures. In this article he goes deep into the concept of dynamics of rational behaviors with respect to diverse self-interests of individual economic agents. Our social or economic institutions can be subjectively modeled as an information biasing chain where individuals are positioned in different abstract coalitions according to interdependence of their payoff functions. The upper layer coalitions virtually control the institutions and they have greater influences on our economy that provokes growth by exhausting energy and other natural resources and causes climate change. His model also provides guidelines for transiting from a growth based economy to a sustainable economy, while solving macro and micro-economic challenges in real time.
P10|Inequality and Instability|Inequality of wealth and income is currently a hotly debated subject not only in the academy but also in society more generally. The protagonists disagree about how inequality should be meeasured. But however they measure it - whether by Gini coefficients, the share of the total distribution earned by a particular group (e.g., the top one per cent), or other ways - they generally agree that inequality has greatly increased in a wode range of countries since the mid-1970s. Agreement does not exist, however, about what causes inequality, what problems result from it, and what might be done to solve them. This paper attempts to answer these questions by reviewing and assessing a diverse literature drawn from economic theory, political science, sociology,philosophy, and economic and financial history.
P10|Comparative Economic Studies and Comparative Economics: Six Decades and Counting|Abstract This paper reviews the history of Comparative Economic Studies and the role that it has played in the development of the field of comparative economics. While we emphasize developments in the past 10 years when we served as co-editors, the development of the journal and of the field of comparative economics is placed in the context of the entire 60-year history of Comparative Economic Studies and of its predecessors.
P10|Ökonomische Expertise und politökonomische Machtstrukturen|Aufbauend auf neueren und älteren Forschungsergebnissen zum Einfluss von ÖkonomInnen auf politische Entscheidungsprozesse und mediale wirtschaftspolitische Debatten wird in diesem Beitrag ein eklatantes politökonomisches Machtungleichgewicht unter einflussreichen ökonomischen ExpertInnen aufgezeigt: Es kann vor allem in Deutschland eine starke Dominanz von neo- bzw. ordoliberalen Interessenskoalitionen bzw. -netzwerken gegenüber alternativen, keynesianischen oder gewerkschaftsnahen Netzwerken konstatiert werden, wohingegen in Österreich durch eine noch stärkere Bedeutung korporatistischer Strukturen dieses Ungleichgewicht zumindest schwächer ausgeprägt ist. Auf Basis dieses Beitrags kann argumentiert werden, dass das politökonomische Machtungleichgewicht in der Ökonomik als einer der Grundpfeiler der Persistenz neoliberaler Wirtschaftspolitiken zugunsten ökonomisch Mächtiger zu verstehen ist.
P10|"Wissen und Nicht-Wissen angesichts ""des Marktes"": Das Konzept von Hayek"|"Das Paper diskutiert den Einfluss von Karl Friedrich August von Hayek auf die Geschichte der ökonomischen Theorie, vor allem durch sein Konzept ""des Marktes"" als Wissenvermittlungs- und Wissensgenerierungsinstanz. Das ist mit einem Konzept des Nicht-Wissens für den Menschen verbunden, der angesichts des ""Überwissens des Marktes"" die Fähigkeit verliert, über das Wirtschaftssystem angemessen reflektieren zu können. Damit ist eine Aufwertung des Wissen von UnternehmerInnen und eine Abwertung des Wissens von WirtschaftswissenschaftlerInnen verbunden - mit Konsequenzen für das Konzept der Politik und auf die Art, wie z.B. über Klimaprobleme diskutiert werden. Im Paper werden diese Konzepte in Bezug auf die Absicht von Hayek diskutiert, langffristig die gesamte Gesellschaft zu verändern."
P10|Retrospectives: Do Productive Recessions Show the Recuperative Powers of Capitalism? Schumpeter's Analysis of the Cleansing Effect|"Schumpeter has often been interpreted as a ""liquidationist,"" someone who is convinced that economic crises are necessary and unavoidable, and thus that government nonintervention is a sound policy in such crises. The first two sections of this paper discuss Schumpeter's views in greater detail and suggest that categorizing him as a ""liquidationist"" is an oversimplification and as an unrepentant ""noninterventionist"" is incorrect. Although Schumpeter was certainly not a strong supporter of public interventions, he did see a role for public expenditure programs in particular circumstances. During periods of recession, Schumpeter believed firmly in what he described as the ""recuperative powers of capitalism."" However, when a depression becomes ""pathological,"" there could be a role for government to intervene. In order to understand the overall picture of Schumpeter's message, we will first try to explain Schumpeter's analysis of recessions, depressions, and the other stages of business cycles. We will also discuss how Schumpeter perceived the recuperative powers of capitalism, a core concept in Schumpeter's analysis that allows him to distinguish between physiological and pathological recessions. In the 1990s, an active line of research examined the possibility that recessions may have a productive character along with their more obvious negative outcomes, because recessions in some way might hasten the process of reallocating economic recourses from slower-growth to faster-growth sectors. Such models were sometimes referred to as ""neo-Schumpeterian,"" but given our analysis of Schumpeter's work, we will question whether this label is appropriate."
P10|Toward understanding 17th century English culture: A structural topic model of Francis Bacon's ideas|We use machine-learning methods to study the features and origins of the ideas of Francis Bacon, a key figure who provided the intellectual roots of a cultural paradigm that spurred modern economic development. Bacon's works are the data in an estimation of a structural topic model, a recently developed methodology for analysis of text corpora. The estimates uncover sixteen topics prominent in Bacon's opus. Two are key elements of the ideas usually associated with Bacon—inductive epistemology and fact-seeking. The utilitarian promise of science and the centralized organization of the scientific quest, embraced by Bacon's followers, were not emphasized by him. Using strategic communication, Bacon facilitated reception of his scientific methodology, targeted influential groups, and finessed powerful opponents. We provide the first quantitative evidence that the genesis of Bacon's epistemology lies in his experience in the common-law. Combining our findings with accepted arguments in the existing literature, we suggest that the effects of common-law culture can help explain the coincidence of early political and economic development in England.
P10|Compulsory Voting, Voter Turnout and Asymmetrical Habit-formation|We examine whether compulsory voting (CV) influences habit-formation in voting asymmetrically across parties. We use a Differences-in-Differences and a Differences-in-Discontinuity approach to investigate the long-term effects of CV on turnout and party vote shares in Austria. The results show that CV increased turnout. When CV was abolished, turnout returned to the pre-compulsory level. We conclude that CV was not habit-forming and may have crowded out intrinsic motivation.
P10|Capitalism and Socialism: Review of Kornai's Dynamism, Rivalry, and the Surplus Economy|Understanding the nature of capitalism has been a central theme of economics. The collapse of the East Bloc and the global financial crisis spurred the reemergence of the political economy as a new frontier and the revival of interest in the nature of capitalism. Kornai's book fills an important intellectual gap in understanding the dynamic nature of capitalism by comparing it with its mirror image, socialism. To further develop the themes contained in the book, serious challenges are posted theoretically and empirically, as well as in subjects, such as hybrid capitalism.
P10|The Motherhood Wage Penalty: A Varieties of Capitalism Approach|This paper aims to relate the issue of the Motherhood Wage Penalty to the institutional framework “Varieties of Capitalism.” Using data from the Luxembourg Income Study, we perform cross-national analyses on the discrepancy in wages between mothers with young children and females without children. The second step of the analysis entails four different measures with relevance to both the institutional framework and our applied gender focus. We find that when nations exhibit features in line with “coordinated market economies,” characterized by relatively stubborn employment protection, smaller degree of general inequality, more concentrated wage bargaining, and higher rate of unionization, mothers are relatively more penalized in monetary terms compared to “liberal market economies.” The results add valuable insight to the limited gender literature within the framework and propose follow-up questions for expanding the efforts of gendering the Varieties of Capitalism.
P10|Evidence on economic versus political institutions as determinants of development|A growing body of evidence suggests that institutions are an important causal determinant of economic development, yet there remains considerable debate over which institutions are most important. In this paper, we employ an identification strategy that allows us to simultaneously examine the potential causal impact of economic and political institutions. The results of different instrumental variable estimators strongly suggest that economic institutions, gauged by the Index of Social Infrastructure and by the Economic Freedom of the World Index, are economically and statistically significant determinants of income per capita. However, political institutions, measured by Constraints on the Executive, exert smaller and less discernible statistical impact on development. These findings are robust to the inclusion of confounding factors that potentially influence development such as geography, ethnolinguistic fractionalization, human capital, as well as robust to a number of alternative sets of covariates, data sources, sample sizes, instrumental variables, and to tests that provide for valid inferences under near exogeneity.
P10|Metamorphosis in Political Economy A new combination of three disparate ideas|Innovation in theory building usually follows the prescription of ‘normal science’ as described by Thomas Kuhn in his account on the history of theoretical physics, see [Kuhn, 1962]. What already had been postulated by Descartes, compare [Descartes, 1637], as a signum of science, namely the systematic advance towards smaller, more specialized, partial problems that are easier to solve, this procedure still prevails in the social sciences till today. Contrary to this piecemeal engineering approach, Joseph Schumpeter made the character mask of the revolutionary entrepreneur to his hero of progress – at least as far as innovation in the production of commodities is concerned, [Schumpeter, 1911]. Of course, history shows that both forms of innovation are alternating: If the slow advance and broadening of a prevailing mainstream gets stuck and the contradictions it produces start to accumulate quickly, then it is time for a revolution – in the material world (compare [Hanappi & Wäckerle, 2016]) as well as in its scientific correlate. It is time for a metamorphosis. In which direction a theoretical innovation in times of metamorphosis shall point clearly has to remain an unanswered question. The best characterization of its general methodological form still seems to be Schumpeter’s dictum. It is a new combination of (existing) elements. The existing elements typically should concern burning problems of the troubled mainstream (compare [Hanappi, 2016]), and the adjective ‘new’ means that they so far are not connected to each other in the stagnating mainstream approach. The global political economy as well as its theoretical reflection in mainstream theory undoubtedly currently is in a state that calls for a revolutionary metamorphosis. This paper therefore sets out to develop a new combination of three seemingly unconnected ideas, which each address a fundamental contradiction. The first idea concerns the contradiction between the rich and the poor parts of the global economy, the second idea concerns the driving force of progress of the human species and its impediments, and the third idea concerns the contradiction between syntax and semantics of the formal representation of the first two contradictions. Contrary to papers in ‘normal science’, which in a conclusion propose a solution for their research question, this paper avoids to pretend a finite horizon of its arguments. As is appropriate for a proposed theoretical innovation it just offers a new open-ended contribution to the rapidly evolving discourse in the middle of metamorphosis.
P10|Wachstumszwänge: Ressourcenverbrauch und Akkumulation als Wettbewerbsverzerrungen|Gibt es „Wachstumszwänge“? Wir definieren den Begriff relativ eng, strukturieren die diskutierten Mechanismen in sechs Gruppen und analysieren sie. Technischer Fortschritt erweist sich mit seiner Kostendynamik und „technologischer Arbeitslosigkeit“ als Hauptursache für das „grow or die“ des Kapitalismus sowie für staatliche Wachstumspolitik. „Bestehen im Wettbewerb“ bedeutet heute im Wesentlichen, teure menschliche Arbeit durch preiswerten Ressourcenverbrauch zu ersetzen. Akkumulation (Reichtum und große Unternehmen) als unwiderstehlicher Anreiz führt „fast zwangsläufig“ zu vergleichbaren gesellschaftlichen Defekten. Damit begründen wir zwei Politikmaßnahmen, nämlich die direkte gesellschaftliche Deckelung von Ressourcenverbrauch und von Vermögen. Diese Maßnahmen sind voll kompatibel mit den normativen Grundlagen und praktischen Erfordernissen von Marktwirtschaft.
P10|Economic systems in developing countries: A macro cluster approach|The literature on economic systems and corresponding empirical studies have largely focused on a classification for developed countries, while other world regions have only partly been included and/or not compared to established OECD prototypes on an income-adjusted basis. In our macro clustering approaches, correct for the income bias in clustering variables. We are therefore able to include a worldwide sample of 115 developed and developing countries, the latter including transition countries. The major result from using income adjusted variables is that developing countries join the liberal OECD prototype economies in the world of inequality. On the other hand, a large part of Asian developing countries as well all transition countries join the coordinated and liberal European market economies in the world of equality. As a robust result, European Nordic and transition countries form a cluster combining high levels of innovation and equality of income differences are phased out. At the same time, as argued by La Porta et al. (2008) and Lange et al. (2006), the distribution of non-transition developing countries between and within these worlds of equality and inequality reveals a clear distinction between British vs. other colonial heritages as one driver of economic systems today.
P10|Economic systems in developing countries: A macro cluster approach|The literature on economic systems and corresponding empirical studies have largely focused on a classification for developed countries, while other world regions have only partly been included and/or not compared to established OECD prototypes on an income-adjusted basis. In our macro clustering approach, we apply Ward as well as Fuzzy C-Means clustering methods and, in contrast with other approaches, correct for the income bias in clustering variables. We are therefore able to include a worldwide sample of 115 developed and developing countries, the latter including transition countries. The major result from using income adjusted variables is that developing countries phase into the OECD divide. On the one hand, most African and Latin American countries join the liberal OECD prototype economies in the world of inequality. On the other hand, a large part of Asian developing countries as well all transition countries join the coordinated and liberal European market economies in the world of equality.

P10|Fear of stagnation? A review on growth imperatives|Worldwide economic growth is fostered, despite its severe conflicts with sustainability and despite the tendency of secular stagnation. To study whether this fostering is 'only' a question of political and individual will or 'unavoidable' to maintain economic stability, we deliver a rather narrow micro level definition of a 'growth imperative'. We divide the many alleged growth imperatives into five categories and review them, thereby reducing several reasonings to few core arguments. We conclude that neither commercial competition, nor profit expectations, nor the monetary system are stand-alone growth imperatives. Instead, when technological innovations (based on resource consumption) are introduced, market forces lead to a systematic necessity to net invest due to the interplay of creative destruction, profit maximization, and the need to limit losses. Unemployment is substantially caused by productivity gains, and the societal and political necessity of high employment explains why states 'must' foster economic growth. This explanation is culturally and normatively parsimonious and empirically substantiated.
P10|Revolutionary Developments in the World Economy|"In the last decades the world changed dramatically. From a global point of view three disruptive processes are on their way which can be called revolutionary: a political, a technological and an economic revolution. This paper aims to give an overview when and how these movements started what the essence of these processes is and with which consequences we will have to deal with in the future. Concerning the political revolution the year 1990 can be characterized as a historical landmark because of two reasons: At first, it finished with orthodox communism as it was practiced primarily in the former Soviet Union. Secondly, this year created a new illusion which is described at its best by Francis Fukuyama in his book ""The End of History"" (1990). The Western form of a liberal representative democracy had overruled communism as its most important counterpart and it promised to stay forever as a political system when combined with a capitalistic market economy. That means in last consequence ""the end of history"". The paper shows how this illusive thinking has been demolished in the last twenty years and in which way a new regime of political thinking, the ""autocratic system"" of political decision making, is gaining relevance worldwide in developed as well as in developing countries. Starting in China and spreading over to other countries in the second half of the last century it now even reached countries in Europe which after 1990 tried to install a liberal representative democracy with great empathy, for instance Russia, Hungary, the Czech Republic and recently also Poland. The paper tries to grasp this process, to find answers why the attractiveness of the democratic ideal is fading away in these days and to show which consequences this political transformation process might have for the global economy. The last two decades of the 20 th century set off a third great wave of technological invention and disruptive innovation, the ""digital revolution"". Radical advances in computing-, information- and communication-technology may deliver a similar mixture of transformation as societies had experienced in the centuries before, getting acquainted to the steam engine, electricity, the telegraph and telephone for instance. The larger part of economists and scientists today sticks to the opinion that this new technological revolution will change fundamentally essential characteristics of the three pillars which constitute a socio-economic system: the financial, the public and the real sector. The paper intends to show how each of these pillars are already affected by the eruptive development of digitalization and how this process may go on in the future with all its social, economic and institutional consequences. If the 1990â€™s are taken as a historical landmark for fundamental changes in the world, one miraculous development has to be stressed as most important: The economic ""catching up"" process of the developing world, especially in those emerging countries called the BRICS group consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. In the last 20 years these nationsâ€™ growth has far outpaced that of the US and the EU, with China already having become the second largest economy in the world. The paper will show how this growth phenomenon already changed fundamentally the structure of the world economy and which consequences can be expected in the future, if a country like China will be successful in combining elements of the political and the technological revolution in its development strategy. This scenario and the economic system standing behind may be called ""state capitalism"" and it is thoroughly in conflict with what is named as ""entrepreneurial capitalism"", concretized at its best in the US and its Silicon Valley. If we go back to Schumpeter, the Silicon Valley example can be pictured as a realistic portrait of what he had in mind in his 1912 book (The Theory of Economic Development). Whereas the Chinese kind of forming the countryâ€™s development process and its innovation culture seems to be more in accordance with the Schumpeter book of 1942 (Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy). The paper will at the end shortly focus on this interesting issue, which might be called a ""Schumpeterian Battle of Systems"", namely ""Entrepreneurial Capitalism"" against ""State Capitalism"". Perhaps, this antagonism might shape the development of the world economy in the coming decades of the 21 st century more than any other event."
P10|Economic freedom in the long run: evidence from OECD countries (1850–2007)|This paper presents historical indices for the main dimensions of economic freedom and an aggregate index for nowadays developed countries -(pre-1994) OECD, for short-. Economic liberty expanded over the last one-and-a-half centuries, reaching two thirds of its maximum possible. Its evolution has been, however, far from linear. After a substantial improvement since mid-nineteenth century, World War I brought a major setback. The post-war recovery up to 1929 was followed by a dramatic decline in the 1930s and significant progress took place during the Golden Age but fell short from the pre-World War I peak. A steady expansion since the early 1980s has resulted in the highest levels of economic liberty of the last two centuries. Each main dimension of economic freedom exhibited a distinctive trend and its contribution to the aggregate index varied over time. Nonetheless, improved property rights provided the main contribution to the long-run advancement of economic liberty.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P10|Wealth and Income Inequalities ← → r > g|Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century posits the return r on capital to be larger than the economic growth rate g as a main driver of inequalities. This article points out the circumstances under which the reverse inference holds. We show that increasing inequality promotes increasing gap r-g, and vice-versa, because capital is a cumulative quantity that claims a finite fraction of the total output in the presence of fractional consumption of the return on capital. However economies do exist for which large inequalities tend to curb r-g, thus proving that r > g does not always lead to an endless inequality spiral.
P10|Interpelaciones desde la condición posmoderna a la disciplina histórica|Nadie escapa a su tiempo y el tiempo todo lo transforma, las condiciones de existencia, los valores y las posturas subjetivas, así como las teóricas a partir de las cuales se vive y se interpreta la realidad. Los cambios de apreciación son desechados por algunos, por disolutos, confusos y faltos de referentes certeros; mientras que otros acogen la novedad por su apertura a otros mundos, vivencias y posibilidades. El debate sobre la posmodernidad no escapa a tal polémica, así como no es posible estar por fuera de la condición posmoderna. A partir de dos pares de conceptos se revisan grandes cambios paradigmáticos en las maneras de vivir, concebir y valorar la historia. De lo estructural a las particularidades y de lo singular a las pluralidades. ****** Nobody escapes to his time and the time change everything, existence conditions, the values and subjective stance, as well as the theoretical from which you live and you interpret reality. The interpretations changes are throw away by some, by dissolute, confused and lacking accurate references; while others welcome the novelty for its openness to other worlds, experiences, and possibilities. The debate on postmodernity does not escape such controversy, just as it is not possible to be outside the postmodern condition. From two pairs of concepts major paradigmatic changes in the ways of living, conceiving and valuing history are reviewed. From the structural to the particularities and from the singular to the pluralities.
P10|Breaking Promises: Hungarian Experience|The article analyzes the role of promises and obligations in economic life, delineates the major types of obligations and shows the devastating consequences of breaking the promises. Various additional circumstances are also considered that have to be accounted for in the balanced judgment of the situations in which the obligations are not met. The examples of breaking promises, logics of such a breaking and the factors precluding it are discussed in the ethical and political contexts as well.
P10|So what is Capital in the Twenty-First Century? Some notes on Piketty’s book Working paper, forthcoming in Capitalism & Society|This study was inspired by Piketty’s excellent and important book. Its title and numerous statements in it arouse in readers expectations of a comprehensive analysis of capitalism. By comparison the author of this paper felt important aspects were lacking. The capitalist system has numerous immanent traits and innate tendencies, of which the paper takes a closer look at three properties. 1. One basic feature is dynamism, innovation, and creative destruction. No picture of capitalism can be full if this basic aspect is ignored. 2. Capitalism inevitably brings about a high degree of inequality; this must be eased by reforms, but cannot be entirely overcome. 3. The basic characteristics of capitalism – private ownership and the dominance of market coordination – give rise to strong incentive mechanisms that encourage but owners and enterprise executives to innovate and to cooperate effectively. One of the main incentives is competition, especially oligopolistic competition. There are strong mutual effects among these three important tendencies. It is impossible to understand well Piketty’s main subject, the distribution of income and wealth, if it is divorced from the other two tendencies. The study ends with its author’s own value judgements on the favourable and harmful, unjust attributes of the capitalist system.
P10|Popular Attitudes toward Markets and Democracy: Russia and United States Compared 25 Years Later|We repeat a survey we did in the waning days of the Soviet Union (Shiller, Boycko and Korobov, AER 1991) comparing attitudes towards free markets between Moscow and New York. Additional survey questions, from Gibson Duch and Tedin (J. Politics 1992) are added to compare attitudes towards democracy. Two comparisons are made: between countries, and through time, to explore the existence of international differences in allegiance to democratic free-market institutions, and the stability of these differences.
P10|Tolerance in the United States: Does economic freedom transform racial, religious, political and sexual attitudes?|Tolerance is a distinguishing feature of Western culture. Still, it varies between and within countries, as well as over time, and irrespective of whether one values it for its own sake or for its beneficial consequences, it becomes important to identify its determinants. In this study, we investigate whether the character of economic policy plays a role, by looking at the effect of changes in economic freedom (i.e., lower government expenditures, lower and more general taxes and more modest regulation) on tolerance in one of the most market-oriented countries, the United States. In comparing U.S. states, we find that an increase in the willingness to let atheists, homosexuals and communists speak, keep books in libraries and teach college students is, overall, positively related to preceding increases in economic freedom, more specifically in the form of more general taxes. We suggest, as one explanation, that a discriminatory tax system, which is susceptible to the influence of special interests and which treats people differently, gives rise to feelings of tension and conflict. In contrast, the positive association for tolerance towards racists only applies to speech and books, not to teaching, which may indicate that when it comes to educating the young, (in)tolerant attitudes towards racists are more fixed.
P10|After the Financial Crisis; Reforms and Reform Options for Finance, Regulation and Institutional Structure|The finance dominated type of capitalism that has developed from the late 1970s and early 1980s on finds its nucleus in the deregulation of the national and international financial system and the switch to a shareholder oriented corporate governance system. Other aspects such as labour market deregulations (including policies to weaken trade unions), the aim of completely free trade around the globe, increasing freedom and power of multinational companies, and privatisation of formerly state functions also belong to the new regime. This finance dominated economic regime seems to be exhausted. The reforms implemented after the subprime crisis and the Great Recession are not sufficient to overcome the deeply rooted problems of the existing system. Reforms to the financial system did not substantially affect the functioning of the shadow banking system and the basic structures of the financial system were not changed. Both, the international financial system as well as the shareholder oriented corporate governance system were largely spared from reforms. Further labour market deregulations are still on the agenda of governments and international institutions. Policies to change income and wealth distribution are not on the political agenda. What is needed is a comprehensive reform agenda which searches for a new relationship between institutions, government policies, and markets.
P10|The Role of the State in Financialised Systems of Provision: Social Compacting, Social Policy, and Privatisation|This paper draws on a series of case studies to consider the Role of the State, using the systems of provision (SoP) approach where the state and market are not considered to be dichotomous entities (as in most orthodox literature). Rather, markets are organised by the state in ways that are continually evolving. Our coverage of this extensive topic has been delimited by focusing on three aspects of the role of the state. The first of these is social compacting which considers the ways in which economic, political and ideological interests relate to the state. This section considers the state’s role in representing different social interests with a declining influence of labour. The second aspect addressed here is the state’s role in social policy and the provision of basic services. The paper shows that this increasingly comes down to providing for the hard to serve while wider concerns of equity and redistribution are neglected. Finally the paper explores the role of the state in connection with privatisation. Using the empirical evidence of the case studies, the paper shows that implementation and outcomes have been diverse across sectors and countries but common strands are emerging. These sectors are far from competitive, and privatisation has created conditions for significant rent extraction in ways that were unintended at the time of privatisation
P10|Thirteen Things You Need to Know about Neoliberalism|This paper examines the theories and practices of neoliberalism drawing upon five case studies of housing and water across Poland, Portugal, South Africa, Turkey and the United Kingdom. This examination ranges across thirteen aspects of (‘things you need to know about’) neoliberalism. They include the argument that neoliberalism is not reducible to a cogent ideology or a change in economic or social policies, nor is it primarily about a shift in the relationship between the state and the market or between workers and capital in general, or finance in particular. Instead, neoliberalism is a stage in the development of capitalism underpinned by financialisation. Neoliberalism is highly diversified in its features, impact and outcomes, reflecting specific combinations of scholarship, ideology, policy and practice. In turn, these are attached to distinctive material cultures giving rise to the (variegated) neoliberalisation of everyday life and, at a further remove, to specific modalities of economic growth, volatility and crisis. Finally, this paper argues that there are alternatives, both within and beyond neoliberalism itself.
P10|Housing and Water in Light of Financialisation and “Financialisation”|This paper addresses the impact of financialisation on the systems of provision (SoPs) drawing on a series of case studies in housing and water – both non-financial sectors. In order to understand this more fully, the paper first considers some of the theoretical constructs connecting money, commodities and finance, exploring the theories of money, the extension of that theory to finance and the specification of the processes attaching finance to the non-financial. The paper shows that both case-study sectors have increasingly been subject to market forms with, for example, land markets in housing and cost recovery practices in water provision. However there are different forms of monetary relations across the case studies. Simply to equate financialisation with commodification would be misleading. The diversity of arrangements across sectors and locations is addressed in the paper by making the distinction between commodification (production for private profits), the commodity form (periodic payments for a good or service in the absence of a profit motive) and commodity calculation (application of a monetary logic without money changing hands). Each of these is associated with different forms of marketization and “market forces” but they are underpinned by different economic and social structures. The paper then goes on to tie these insights to financialisation and contemporary capitalism more generally with reference to the case studies. For housing there is variegation in the extent to which the expansion of finance coincides with expansion of material provision, as shown with for example the different outcomes from expanding lending for house production as opposed to mortgage lending for consumption. In water, there is diversity in the extent and nature of privatisation and this has led to differences in the extent and depth of financial intervention across the case studies. England and Wales lies at one extreme with heavily entrenched financialisation while this is considerably less significant in the case studies with less privatisation. The final section of this paper considers the implication of the different forms of financialisation for economic and social reproduction including gender.
P10|Finance and Sustainability Synthesis Report of WP7|This paper investigates the relationship between finance and environmental sustainability. The first part summarises a few crucial methodological and foundational issues underlying meaning and implications of financialisation, sustainability and their mutual relation. The second part focuses on a particularly significant case study: the unsustainability of the existing energy system based on carbon fuels focusing on the urgency of a rapid transition to a low carbon economy. The third part explores which role financial instruments may play to facilitate the transition towards a low carbon economy. In particular, it investigates the implications for sustainability of the growing trade of energy derivatives. The forth part examines the consequences of the disembedment of money from the socioecological flows of matter and energy. The fifth part investigates the relations between financialisation of built environments and urban sustainability. The final part of the paper draws the main policy implications from the preceding analysis in the light of the growing problems affecting environmental policy in a financialised economy. The main policy conclusion is that, notwithstanding the growing conflict between the ongoing process of financialisation and sustainability, finance has to play a crucial role to implement a process of convergence towards a sustainable path of development.
P10|Does Higher Education Contribute to a Change in Attitudes to Government Price Control in Russia?|Does the educational process itself transform an individual’s world outlook towards pro-market values in transition? Much evidence indicates that education correlates with liberal values. However, it is not clear whether this association is the result of selection into education or whether education itself makes people liberal as education and liberal values both are linked to unobservable characteristics such as cognitive abilities, household traits, and the social environment, implying biased ordinary least squares estimates. We employ unique data from 2 waves of the Russian Longitudinal Measurement Survey (RLMS) which contains individual attitudes towards government price control. To overcome the issue of the mutual correlation of liberal values, education, and predetermined and time stable characteristics (fixed effects), we use regressions in first-differences. A negative link between obtaining higher education and support for government price control is documented. The results are also robust to different indicators of the dependent variable and for different sub-samples. Additionally, based on a cross-section sample, we provide evidence that the psychodynamic channel of educational impact on pro-market attitudes is important: white-collar occupations can be considered as insurance against possible market price shocks. The liberal effect of education shows the importance of research on educational policy in the process of the formation of pro-market attitudes in Russia and in other transition economies.
P10|Government activity and economic growth – one size fits All?|Abstract This study investigates the role of government activity in economic growth, arguing that economic systems are important and that, therefore, one size of government does not fit all countries. Taking a panel of 111 countries over the years from 1971 to 2010, we consider clusters of economic systems as predicted by an extended Varieties of Capitalism (VoC) approach. The empirical growth impact of government activity is positive but u-shaped and depends on both the quality of institutions and the institutional setting. For the polar cases of liberal economies and Scandinavian coordinated market economies, the potential growth impact is quite similar and superior to other clusters of countries. However, the maximum growth effect is realized for above-average levels of government activity in the Scandinavian countries, while this would be detrimental to growth in liberal countries. Hence, high levels of government activity are consistent with growth but only in economic systems consistently rooted in a high level of government activity.

P10|Monopoly Capital and Capitalist Inequality: Marx after Piketty|This paper proposes that one major explanation of growing inequality in the United States (US) is through the use of the concept of economic surplus. The economic surplus is a neo-Marxian term which combines the traditional Marxian tenet of surplus value with other ways that surplus value can be invested in a mature, advanced capitalist economy. A rising economic surplus that is not absorbed through growing consumer spending, luxury spending or government spending results in stagnant wages and growing inequality via higher levels of underemployment and greater monopoly and monopsony power among a decreasing number of huge, powerful corporations. Therefore, the politics surrounding the growth of inequality in the US has to be understood first by understanding over accumulation of the economic surplus by those at the top of the US capitalist class. This research note gives estimates of the rising economic surplus over the last several decades in the US as well as how these correlate with the level of inequality. The growth of the economic surplus gives rise and form to the politics of inequality and austerity. As time goes by, the politics of inequality and austerity in the US will be manifested by greater corporate influence in the political system, greater political polarization, less government effectiveness, and more debates about welfare spending, corporate taxation, taxes on upper income households, and taxes on wealth.

P10|Reading the General Theory as Economic Sociology: A broader interpretation of an economics classic|This paper argues that given certain self-definitions and key defining features of economic sociology, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money can be read and interpreted as a text in economic sociology. Around this core argument, a case is built for a more open interaction and mutual appreciation between economic sociology and heterodox approaches to economics. The paper suggests how broader interpretations of classics of social science (such as the General Theory) may help us better appreciate the shared intellectual lineages and legacies of economics and sociology. It concludes with reflections on the historical development of the relationship between economics and sociology, and some speculation about their future.
P10|On the Possibility of an Enlarged Self-Definition of Economics|This brief note explores the possibility of working towards an enlarged self-definition of economics through economists’ study and appreciation of economic sociology. Common ground between economic sociology and heterodox economics is explored, and some of Richard Sennett’s ideas are used as prompts to raise some pertinent and hopefully interesting questions about economics. In particular, the note revisits the question of whether there is a possibility of changing our understanding of what kind of social scientific work falls within the domain of economics proper once we start critically engaging with work conventionally considered to be outside of that domain. In part, the note is intended to offer undergraduate students in economics – and possibly even those further down the road in their education – food for thought about what constitutes economics.
P10|Do foreign owners favour short-term profit? Evidence from Germany|Comparing domestic- and foreign-owned firms in Germany, this article finds that foreign-owned firms are more likely to focus on short-term profit. This influence is particularly strong if the local managers of the German subsidiary are not sent from the foreign parent company. Moreover, the physical distance between the foreign parent company and its German subsidiary increases the probability of focussing on short-term profit. These findings conform to the hypothesis that foreign owners facing an information disadvantage concerning the local conditions of their subsidiaries are more likely to favour short-term profit. However, we do not identify differences in ‘short-termism’ between investors from Anglo-Saxon and other foreign countries; rather, results point in the direction of more general features of corporate globalisation.
P10|Large-Scale Transition of Economic Systems – Do CEECs Converge Toward Western Prototypes?|Abstract We analyze potential convergence of Central and Eastern European Countries’ (CEECs) economic systems toward western prototypes. The corresponding comparative capitalism literature identified four prototype economic systems among (traditional) OECD countries: Liberal, Continental, Nordic, and Mediterranean. Based on a comprehensive macroeconomic cluster approach, we are able to confirm these prototype country clusters. At the same time, our results indicate that the economic systems of CEECs have still not completely converged toward these prototypes, but complement them by independent Liberal (CEEC LME) and Continental/Nordic (CEEC CME) varieties, showing no signs of convergence toward the inconsistent and underperforming economic system of Mediterranean countries.
P10|The business cycle in the contemporary capitalist economy|This paper provides an introduction to the business cycle. In the capitalist economy there are fluctuations in economic activity which apply to all aspects of socio-economic development. Capitalist economy is growing at a variable rate. These regular changes in economic activity are called cyclical or economic fluctuations. Business cycles as we know them today were first identified and analyzed by Arthur Burns and Wesley Mitchell in their 1946 book, Measuring Business Cycles (Romer, 2008): “Business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate economic activity of nations that organize their work mainly in business enterprises: a cycle consists of expansions occurring at about the same time in many economic activities, followed by similarly general recessions, contractions, and revivals which merge into the expansion phase of the next cycle”(Burns, Mitchell, 1946, s. 5).
P10|The Impossibility of Democratic Socialism: Two Conceptions of Democracy|Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny (1994) have used Public Choice analysis to criticize market socialism. Peter J. Boettke (1995) and Peter T. Leeson and Boettke (2002) have argued that F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom (2007 [1944]) constituted a form of Public Choice analysis as well, in particular presaging an application of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem to democratic socialism. This essay demonstrates that additionally, Hayek's book adumbrated the distinction between liberal or limited democracy and illiberal or totalitarian democracy. This distinction between two conceptions of democracy provides another means of criticizing democratic socialism. The democratic political system and socialist economic system are fundamentally incompatible, making democratic socialism impossible, in the sense that democracy cannot fulfill for socialism what democratic socialists expect from it. Democratic socialism will fail, not because those in power will betray their trust or abuse their power, but because the fundamental institutional constraints of democracy are incompatible with socialist economics.
P10|Interest Groups and the Impossibility of Democratic Socialism: Hayek, Jewkes, and the Arrow Theorem|Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny (1994) have used Public Choice analysis to criticize market socialism. Peter J. Boettke (1995) and Peter T. Leeson and Boettke (2002) have argued that F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom (2007 [1944]) constituted a form of Public Choice analysis as well. Boettke and Leeson say that Hayek adumbrated a form of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. This essay shows that Hayek was joined by John Jewkes in presaging a form of the Arrow theorem. In addition, this essay expands on the analysis by Boettke and Leeson, elucidating the broader implications which the Arrow theorem has for democratic socialism in particular. Democratic socialism is demonstrated to be impossible, in the sense that it cannot successfully accomplish the goals of its advocates. This is because the Arrow theorem implies that democratic political institutions are fundamentally incompatible with socialist economics.
P10|Labor Economics in a Planned Economy: F. A. Hayek and John Jewkes on the Impossibility of Democratic Socialism|Milton Friedman (1962) is associated with the claim that political and economic freedom cannot be distinguished (cf. Lawson and Clark 2010), using the famous example that there can be no freedom of speech where the government owns the printing presses. Less well-known is F. A. Hayek's example, drawn from labor economics, used to illustrate the same principle. Hayek was joined in this by his less well-known colleague, John Jewkes. Hayek and Jewkes argued that without a freely operating price system, central economic planning cannot function without compulsory regimentation of labor. Similarly, no state may simultaneously fix “fair” wages and demand a given pattern of productive output and employment. It is impossible to both achieve income equality and accomplish an economic plan. Hayek's and Jewkes's examples help explain why democratic socialism is impossible, in the sense that it cannot accomplish what its advocates desire.
P10|The Foreign Policy of a Democratic Socialist Regime: From Intervention to Protection to Warfare|Discussions of democratic socialism have focused on whether that system is compatible with domestic civil liberties. Less attention has been paid to its foreign policy implications. Despite the widespread acceptance of the democratic peace hypothesis, democratic socialism would be incompatible with peaceful foreign relations. Economic intervention and economic planning – even democratic – cannot be successful without insulating the domestic economy from foreign competition. This implies economic nationalism and autarky. Moreover, democratic socialism is often justified by the notion that the democratic will of the people should be absolutely sovereign. Such a conception of democracy has no place for constitutional limits on power. Such an unlimited democracy would soon prove illiberal and liable to be captured by a demagogic authoritarian dictator, and this would only exacerbate the deleterious foreign policy consequences of economic nationalism. Democratic socialism is therefore incompatible with the cosmopolitan and humanitarian values of democratic socialists.
P10|The Freedom of the Prices: Hayek's Road to Serfdom Reassessed|Recent debate has centered around the contemporary relevance and even the original validity of F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom. Was it directed against command socialism only or against welfare-state interventionism as well? Should the book even be read anymore? This essay takes a step back from the dichotomy between socialism and interventionism and explores two specific ideas of Hayek's which deserve renewed attention: first, his claim that economic liberty is the fundamental liberty and that political liberty is merely secondary in value. Second, Hayek's conception of the rule-of-law, which has implications for contemporary command-and-control regulation. Furthermore, that Hayek's philosophical conception of the rule-of-law in the Road to Serfdom is related to his economic theory of prices in “The Use of Knowledge in Society.” While Hayek's specific target in the Road to Serfdom was command socialism, his book embodied arguments which are more widely applicable and relevant today.
P10|An Agent Based Macroeconomic Model with Social Classes and Endogenous Crises|Abstract This paper proposes an agent based macroeconomic model in which income distribution and wealth accumulation depend on the role that agents play in productive activities, that is capitalists or workers. In this framework, social class dynamics underlie the endogenous process of firm formation. The focus is on the interplay between the evolution of social structure and macroeconomic dynamics and on how business cycles and crises may endogenously emerge as the result of the interaction between financial and real factors underlying the process of capitalist production.
P10|Piketty and the increasing concentration of wealth: some implications of alternative theories of dis-tribution and growth|Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century has been spectacularly successful and a reason for this might be the fact that the theory that underlies his analysis is mainstream theory, with some adjustments or reservations on specific points, but never on the fundamentals. Thus, while Piketty’s empirical analysis often challenges received views and supports a non-apologetic view of capitalism’s dynamics, the book at the same time speaks a language which is common to mainstream economists around the world. This however is not always conducive to consistency and interpretative accuracy. A different theoretical perspective (and some empirical evi-dence) might lead to questioning some of the book’s central claims.
P10|Risking Capitalism|The growing centrality of risk management in pro-market governance raises important questions regarding how risks are produced, and why? Who and what is included in, and excluded from, risk management, and why? And, what is the relationship between the rise of risk management and neoliberalism? Charting the relationship between risk, contemporary capitalism and its neoliberal modes of governance, Risking Capitalism, addresses these questions by examining - both analytically and empirically - diverse meanings and practices of risk management across a range of scales and themes, ranging from austerity to climate change to housing and debt. The authors investigate the relationship between shifts in contemporary capitalism and the ways in which neoliberal forms of risk management have emerged, been reproduced and normalized, and, transformed historically.
P10|Minskyâ€™s Analysis of Capitalist Development|Beginning in the mid-â€™80s, well after he brought his famous financial instability hypothesis to maturity, Hyman P. Minsky analyzed the evolution of capitalism. This paper proposes a critical reading of this analysis, focusing on the institutional dimension of Minskyâ€™s research. From my point of view, if Minskyâ€™s analysis constitutes more a history of capitalism than a theory of capitalism, this is because of the weak conceptualization of institutions and the absence of a genuine analysis of institutional change. From this perspective, I believe it necessary to clarify and complete Minskyâ€™s institutional analysis. Only by doing so can we take full measure of Minskyâ€™s research on the evolution of capitalism and identify all the repercussions for an analysis of the instability and resilience of the current stage of capitalism.
P10|Can a Natural Economy Operate in Macroeconomy? A Caution for Deviation from Natural Economy|Abstract The fundamental problem issue of this paper is that a fundamental cause of economic crises, such as the dot-com bubble, the Lehman crash, or PIIGS, from which the current capitalist economy is suffering, lies in a large deviation from a natural economy. Any large deviation from the natural economy entails high risk. Akimoto (Int J Econ Sci III(4):1–37, 2014) proved this proposition. This leads to a question of whether a mechanism,in which a natural economy operates to begin with, exists in the macroeconomy. First, we adopt the definition by Pasinetti (Structural change and economic growth; a theoretical essay on the dynamics of the wealth of nation. Cambridge University Press, 1981) from a macroeconomic viewpoint, because it depends on the structure of the production process. However, there is no guarantee that the natural economy defined by Pasinetti (Structural change and economic growth; a theoretical essay on the dynamics of the wealth of nation. Cambridge University Press, 1981) operates in the macroeconomy. If Akimoto’s (Int J Econ Sci III(4):1–37, 2014) analysis is correct, we need to prove that a mechanism through which the natural economy operates does in fact exist in the macroeconomy. We construct a macroeconomic game with capitalists and workers as players. The macroeconomy involves circulating players’ savings to investments via capital markets. This process constructs Kaldor’s fundamental equation. We prove that a Nash equilibrium exists, which carries out a natural economy and balanced economic growth. In addition, the theoretical analysis demonstrates that Kaldor’s fundamental equation, which is Keynesian, becomes an identity, i.e., 1 $$=$$ = 1. This implies that the Keynesian equation brings about a classical result.
P10|Public debt and economic growth – economic systems matter|Abstract Most studies on the relationship between public debt and economic growth implicitly assume homogeneous debt effects across their samples. We –in accordance with recent literature– challenge this view and state that there likely is a great deal of cross-country heterogeneity in that relationship. However, other than scholars assuming that all countries are different, we expect that clusters of countries differ. We identify three country clusters with distinct economic systems: Liberal (Anglo Saxon), Continental (Core EU members) and Nordic (Scandinavian). We argue that different degrees of fiscal uncertainty at comparable levels of public debt between those economic systems constitute a major source of heterogeneity in the debt-growth relationship. Our empirical evidence supports this assumption. Continental countries face more growth reducing public debt effects than especially Liberal countries. There, public debt apparently exerts neutral or even positive growth effects, while for Nordic countries a non-linear relationship is discovered, with negative debt effects kicking in at public debt values of around 60% of GDP.
P10|Agent-based modeling for decision making in economics under uncertainty|Ever since the emergence of economics as a distinct scientific discipline, policy makers have turned to economic models to guide policy interventions. If policy makers seek to enhance growth of an open capitalist economy, they have to take into account, firstly, the uncertainties, inefficiencies, and market failures faced by the agents in the economy, and, secondly, the activities, network structure, and interactions in the innovation and production system. The authors discuss ins-and-outs of developing and using (encompassing and empirically calibrated) agent-based models for (i) abductive theorizing about causes for empirical realities, and (ii) evaluating effects of policy interventions. To ensure that derived policies are suitable to intervene in the real world and not just the stylization of it, they discuss validity and operationalization of agent-based models as well as interpretation of simulation results.

P10|"The Cambridge History of ""Capitalism"""|This review essay of the two-volume Cambridge History of Capitalism (2014), edited by Larry Neal and Jeffrey G. Williamson, is divided into three parts. First, I describe three chapters from the second volume that I recommend for all economists to add depth to their understanding of the world economy today. Robert C. Allen analyzes the world distribution of income; Randall Morck and Bernard Yeung discuss the history of business groups; and Peter Lindert surveys private and public programs to help the poor. In each case, they analyze historical backgrounds that illuminate current issues. Second, I criticize the definition of capitalism used in these volumes as too expansive to be useful. I argue that this definition mars the essays in first volume by stimulating a fruitless search for capitalism in the millennium before the Industrial Revolution. Third, I describe the essays in this reference work starting from the most recent and ending with those about antiquity. (JEL N00, P10)
P10|Economic paradoxism and meson economics|The structure of the paper brings together three major sections, following the general approach to the impact of paradoxes in economic theory. The first section describes a necessary investigation in the synthesized universe of paradoxes, to capitalize on Quine’s paradox taxonomy, and to reveal the importance of really paraconsistent paradoxes, defining, in a relative and innovative manner, economic paradoxism in the sense of excess of creative capitalization of paradoxes in the area of science, as initiated by mathematician and logician Florentin Smarandache. The second section turns into an original exposition of economics theory and the third section reveals the concept of meson economics and the principles of that economy, completed with some final remarks, some of which are conclusive, and some others interrogative, aligned to the paradox of knowledge, in keeping with which human beings are looking for answers, and finally find more and more questions.
P10|Does competition justify inequality?|Are competitive mechanisms perceived as just sources of economic inequality? Perceptions of fairness violations can have severe economic consequences, as they may cause counterproductive behavior such as rulebook slowdowns or quality shading. To analyze fairness perceptions associated with competitive mechanisms, we run laboratory experiments where a single powerful buyer can trade with one of several sellers—an environment that can lead to pronounced inequality among the interacting parties. Once the terms of trade are determined, sellers can engage in counterproductive behavior. We robustly find that low procurement prices, which allocate most of the surplus from trade to the buyer, trigger significantly less counterproductive behavior if the buyer uses a competitive auction to determine the terms of trade than if he uses his price setting power to dictate the same terms directly. Our data demonstrate that competitive mechanisms, in addition to their capability to produce efficient allocations, can reduce conflict and inefficient reactions by increasing justification for economic inequality.
P10|Cien años de acumulación de capital en Argentina: tasa de ganancia, composición del capital y distribución del producto|El presente trabajo analiza la acumulación de capital en Argentina durante el último siglo. A lo largo del mismo se observa un sostenido descenso de la tasa de ganancia, explicado principalmente por el crecimiento de la composición del capital y la tendencia a la sobreacumulación relativa de capital. Se presenta, tanto para la tasa de ganancia como para la composición de valor del capital, un análisis de la evolución de sus principales componentes. En el marco de una tendencia a la sobreacumulación de capital fijo respecto al valor agregado, la participación de las ganancias en el producto muestra una tendencia descendente debido al incremento tendencial del consumo de capital fijo y los impuestos netos y, hasta la última dictadura, de la participación asalariada.

P10|Social Capital Formation, Internet Usage and Economic Growth in Australia: Evidence from Time Series Data|This study estimates the short- and long-run effects of social capital and internet usage on economic growth using annual time series macro-data for Australia for the period of 1985-2013. Dickey-Fuller generalized least squares unit root and Zivot and Andrew structural break tests are conducted to assess the stationarity of all the series. Hansen-Gregory and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds tests confirm a cointegrating relationship among the variables. ARDL estimates indicate a significant long-run positive relationship between economic growth and internet usage. No significant relationship is found between economic growth and social capital in both the short- and the long-run. However, the interaction term of internet usage and social capital has a significant positive association with economic growth both in the short- and long-run. The short-run relationship between economic growth and internet usage is insignificant. A bidirectional causal link exists between internet usage and economic growth and between the interaction variable and economic growth. Unidirectional causality runs from internet usage to the interaction variable. No causal relation is found between social capital and economic growth. The findings are also supported by applications of a different econometric method, namely dynamic ordinary least squares estimation. The positive interaction effect of internet use and social capital on economic growth supports the recently raised view that Australia should take into account social capital formation in its digital divide policy.
P10|A New Theory of Capitalism: Key Moments and General Logic|"A new theory of capitalism is suggested. Its key moments and general logic are presented. This theory is based on the distinction between two market types – the simple commodity market and the capitalist one. Disequilibrium and ""imperfect competition"" are admitted to be a functional norm of capitalism. Respectively, an equilibrium and ""perfect competition"" are admitted to be a functional anomaly; crises are considered as the result of such an anomaly. General principles and concrete measures of crisis-proof policy and crisis-proof behavior are suggested."
P10|From equilibrium to autopoiesis: A Luhmannian reading of Veblenian evolutionary economics|The paper reconstructs the Veblenian critique of the pecuniary economy from the perspective of Niklas Luhmann's theory of autopoietic social systems. Luhmann argued that social systems relieve people from the overwhelming civilizational complexity, but develop autopoietic properties hindering rational solutions to human problems. This argument allows seeing the pecuniary economy as an important complexity-reducing device, which, however, develops excessive autonomy from the embedding societal and ecological environment. For this reason, like other autopoietic systems, the economy has a high chance of becoming societally and ecologically unsustainable. While Veblen criticized the obsession of classical economics with equilibrium and the natural order, Luhmann urged to replace the notion of equilibrium with that of autopoiesis, which focuses attention on the sustainability problem. Accentuating this problem is shown to be the main evolutionary economics implication of Luhmann's work.
P10|Cultural vs. economic legacies of empires: Evidence from the partition of Poland|Poland was divided among three empires—Russia, Austria–Hungary, and Prussia—for over a century until 1918. The partition brought about divergence in culture, institutions, and economic development. We use spatial regression discontinuity to examine, which empire effects are persistent. We find that differences in incomes, industrial production, education, corruption, and trust in government institutions disappeared with time as they were smoothed by economic forces and policy intervention. In contrast, differences in intensity of religious practices and in beliefs in democratic ideals, i.e., democratic capital, persist presumably via inter-generational within-family transmission. Differences in railroad infrastructure built by empires during industrialization persisted to this day. Cultural empire legacies have an effect on the political outcomes in contemporary Poland.
P10|Methodology of institutional analysis and its implication for contemporary framework of Islamic banks|Purpose - – This paper aims to investigate the possibility of a methodological error made by the concerned scholars and academics of Islamic finance & economics to understand and study the modern framework of financial institutions, where they intend to practice Islamic law of contract. This error has led them to expect something which the institutional modern framework of banks, adopted by Islamic banks (for e.g.), wasn’t designed to accomplish, hence the disappointment. Design/methodology/approach - – This study reviews the literature on history of evolution of banking industry and the corresponding ideological and cultural changes in the European society which drove this evolution; this is followed by a conceptual analysis to identify the institutional components inconsistent with ethos of Islamic norms and ethos. Findings - – After review of history and evolution of modern banking framework, in the light of Hollingsworth frame of institutional analysis, it is inferred that the said framework was designed for a secular, liberal and capitalist society to efficiently and effectively enhance freedom and accumulate capital and wealth, without much regard for equitable distribution of wealth and economic justice. These goals are very much in contrast with the normative premise of Islamic Economics, which cannot be efficiently used to achieve the related objective. This indicates that framework of banking was narrowly understood by the concerned scholars and academics, without considering its history of evolution and intended objectives, before adopting for IBs. Practical implications - – The disconnect between the Western institutional framework and ethos of Islam implies that the concerned need to look deeper and holistically while adapting Western institutions, so that necessary alteration is done in advance, if such an adoption is inevitable. Originality/value - – This study introduces a new dimension for the concerned scholars, academics and practitioners to reanalyze the institutional framework adopted from the West, so that necessary adjustments can be worked out to make the said framework compatible with the ethos of Islamic economics.
P10|Finance and Housing Provision in Portugal|In the last forty years, Portugal has experienced an extraordinary quantitative and qualitative transformation in housing provision, reflecting the rapid urbanisation of the country. These transformations were guided by a construction boom fuelled by rising mortgage debt resulting in a significant rise of homeownership. The paper analyses these changes through a Systems of Provision (SoP) approach, examining the interests, actions and interactions between different agents and how these have determined the dynamics and outcomes of the Portuguese housing SoP. It is argued that the financialisation of the Portuguese economy is central to account for the dynamics and specificities of the housing sector. Finance is an integral part of the boom in the second half of the 1990s and of the slow burn crisis since the turn of the millennium. The financialisation of the Portuguese housing SoP has had very mixed impacts both on production and consumption. In the construction sector, asymmetry is visible between small contracting companies and big companies, with the latter taking advantage of the possibilities opened up by eased access to external finance, expanding their activities to new national and international markets. It has also contributed to the amplification of inequalities between those included and excluded from the mortgage markets, as housing loans have been heavily concentrated on the better-off segments of the Portuguese population, which has not experienced a housing bubble like some of their European counterparts, accessing to new homes at affordable prices while at the same time accumulating wealth.
P10|Piketty on Growth and Distribution|In his book Capital in the Twenty-First CenturyThomas Piketty combines two distinct theories to explain the stylized facts of growth and distribution in capitalist economies. The first is an analysis of the concentration of inherited wealth driven by the difference between the rate of return on capital and the rate of growth of national income. The second is essentially the neoclassical growth model with a constant (net) saving rate and an elasticity of substitution between capital and labour greater than one. I argue that for these two theories to be mutually consistent, in a long-run framework in which financial wealth converges in value with non-financial capital, the interdependence between the rates of growth and return at the aggregate level must be recognized. Since in Capital the rates of growth and return are assumed to be independently given, I show that Piketty has built a fundamentally over-determined, inconsistent analysis of growth and distribution. I also show that Piketty’s approach diverges in fundamental ways from classical, neoclassical and post-Keynesian models of growth and distribution, and in particular from the way they deal with the rates of growth and return in balanced conditions.
P10|Did the German model survive the labor market reforms?|"""This paper discusses the specific features of the German model as a specific variety of capitalism that is distinct from the Anglo-Saxon model because it builds more on social security and social partnership. It argues that the German model has experienced increasing pressure due to growth in systemic unemployment since the mid-1970s. The situation worsened as a result of the financial distress experienced after re-unification. Therefore, although painful for some groups of workers, the labor market reforms implemented from 2003 to 2005 were necessary to keep the German model alive. I argue that a certain erosion of the German model resulting from less collective bargaining coverage, labor market segmentation and higher wage inequality has falsely been attributed to the reforms. Rather, these phenomena are caused by long-run trends that were already occurring in the 1990s or even earlier. The German economy successfully passed the stress test of the Great Recession and is exhibiting ongoing employment growth. Basic features of the German model such as long tenures for qualified prime-age workers or the dual training system remain essentially intact. Hence, the German model is not dead, but vitally alive. However, some prudent counter-measures need to be implemented to fight against creeping erosion from segmentation and inequality. These should be taken with a sense of proportion in order to not jeopardize the great employment-related successes of the reform."" (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))"
P10|Varieties Of Capitalism And Government Spending In Developed And Developing Countries|Empirical papers on the size of government suffer from neglecting preferences for government activity as discussed in the literature on varieties of capitalism. Cross-country evidence for a sample of 126 developed and developing countries reveals a global divide. Among developing countries, Asian countries are closer to continental European economies, i.e., they reveal relatively higher levels of spending dependent on the quality of governance. Latin American countries rather tend towards low-spending anglo-saxon economies and spend to stabilize rather than to fight inequality. Considering these preferences, we do not find evidence that open countries spend more in order to buffer macroeconomic risks.
P10|Political Economy of Crony Capitalism: The Prospect and the Bane|The world over, capitalism had encroach the economy of nations turning governments against the people, employers against the workers all in the name of surplus values and profiteering motives. Although capitalism had made economies of nations to boom without much stress due to the fluid faces of its operations, nevertheless, it has more havocs than good. The review of most government policies has shifted to accommodate the growing bane of cronies of capitalism. This research shows the tactics employed by bourgeoisies in colliding with the government. What are the implications of these profiteering motives on the economy? The methodology adopted is the survey analysis of institutional data base. The theoretical framework of deprivation theory coupled with Marxian theory were used to x-tray the prospect and the bane of crony capitalism in the economy of polities.
P10|Economic Strategy for the Peripheral System|"Russian economic system is considered as a peripheral capitalist economy. For this type of economy the concept of ""economic strategy"" does not seem applicable, since the system itself rigidly defines the logic of development. It determines such features of Russia's economy as a large role of export of mineral resources, dependence on external financial markets and on foreign investments as the source of new technologies; government and business interweaving; financial flows configured by rent income extraction through administration and corruption. With lacking civil society, weak institutions and subordinated position within the world economy the system can be transformed only through conscious efforts of authorities. However political regime which evolved in the country - peripheral autocracy - makes only more conspicuous the lack of political will to reform the system. So a scenario of Russia implementing the strategy of breaking through the limitations of the peripheral area of world capitalism is postponed for an indefinite period of time."
P10|"The Historic ""March"" of the Bulgarian Economy in the Space of the Liberal and the State Capitalism"|"The research uses as methodology the cluster analysis of the types of capitalism made in a project funded by the SRA of UNWE ""The clusters of capitalism (typology and dynamics of the capitalist economies)"" defended and published as a monograph. The historic ""march"" of the Bulgarian economy in the space of the liberal and the state capitalism for the period from 1925 to 2005 is studied. Economic, demographic, infrastructure and social indicators of the Bulgarian economy are examined. The comparative analysis of the socio-economic development of Bulgaria and Greece is made."
P10|Capitalism [Capitalismul]|Although Romanian authorities said they aim to establish free market economy, many officials and opinion makers and, unfortunately, quite a few economists do not seem to know very well even now – a quarter of a century since the fall of communism – what this type of economy is and how it works. The analysis of the features of this economic and social system is therefore useful.
P10|Financial Asset Holdings and Political Attitudes: Evidence from Revolutionary England|The English Parliament’s struggle for supremacy against monarchical dictatorship during the Civil War (1642–1648) was crucial for the establishment of representative government, yet its lessons continue to be debated. I exploit novel data on individual MPs drawn from 1,842 biographies to show that the conflict was over overseas interests and other factors over which the executive enjoyed broad constitutional discretion, rather than over domestic property rights. I further exploit the coincidence of individual MPs’ ability to sign legally binding share contracts with novel share offerings by overseas companies to measure the effect of overseas share investment on their political attitudes. I show that overseas shareholding pushed moderates lacking prior mercantile interests to support reform. I interpret the effect of financial assetholding as allowing new investors to exploit emerging economic opportunities overseas, aligning their interests with traders. By consolidating a broad parliamentary majority that favored reform, the introduction of financial assets also broadened support for the institutionalization of parliamentary supremacy over dictatorial rule.

P10|Frederic S. Lee’s Contributions to Heterodox Economics|In this introduction we highlight Frederic Lee’s contributions to heterodox economics in terms of theory and community, which should be acknowledged and, more importantly, carried on by those who are concerned with the advancement of heterodox economics as an alternative critical theory to the status quo.
P10|George Orwell and the Incoherence of Democratic Socialism|George Orwell's famous fictions, Animal Farm and Nineteen-Eighty Four were intended to advocate democratic socialism by portraying undemocratic forms of socialism as totalitarian. For Orwell, democracy was a political institution which would limit the abuse of power. But there are several problems with democratic socialism which ensure its failure. In Orwell's novel A Clergyman's Daughter, Orwell's views of economics and politics are inconsistent and conflicting in a way that ensures democratic socialism will not succeed on Orwell's terms. Democratic socialism in general is criticized according to F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom and John Jewkes's The New Ordeal by Planning, whose arguments differ crucially from those against market socialism by Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny. An economic analysis of the political institutions of democratic socialism shows that democratic socialism must necessarily fail for political (not economic) reasons even if nobody in authority has ill-intentions or abuses their power.
P10|The Impact of Economic Freedom on the Unemployment Rate in O.E.C.D. Nations: An Exploratory Study Accepting the Validity of Okun’s Law - L’impatto della libertà economica sul tasso di disoccupazione nei paesi Ocse: uno studio esplorativo sulla base dell’accettazione della legge di Okun|This exploratory study empirically investigates the hypothesis that the higher the degree of economic freedom in a nation, the lower the unemployment rate in that nation, ceteris paribus. This hypothesis is based on the idea that greater economic freedom leads to greater real GDP growth, which in turn reduces the unemployment rate. As such, it represents a de facto acceptance (in principle) of Okun’s Law. The framework studied consists of a dataset for the member nations of the OECD (except Iceland) during the period 2003 to 2007, which precedes the Great Recession. The model in this exploratory study, which integrates a measure of the tax burden, a long term interest rate, and a measure of political stability, along with a measure of overall economic freedom, provides estimations finding that the unemployment rate is a decreasing function of the overall average level of economic freedom. Robustness testing, which involves narrowing the definition of the economic freedom measure and introducing a variable reflecting regulatory quality, leads to same conclusion, namely, that greater economic freedom reduces the unemployment rate. - Questo studio presenta una verifica empirica sull’ipotesi secondo cui, a parità di condizioni, maggiore è il livello di libertà economica in un paese, minore sarà il tasso di disoccupazione. Tale ipotesi si basa sull’idea che una maggiore libertà economica porti ad una maggior crescita del PIL reale, che a sua volta riduce il tasso di disoccupazione. Ciò rappresenta l’accettazione de facto della legge di Okun. Il modello si basa su un dataset per i paesi Ocse (esclusa l’Islanda) durante il periodo 2003-2007, cioè prima della grande crisi. Questo modello, che si basa su un indice di pressione fiscale, sul tasso di interesse a lungo termine e su un indicatore di stabilità politica, insieme a un indice della apertura economica generale, fornisce stime che evidenziano che il tasso di disoccupazione è una funzione decrescente del livello generale medio della libertà economica. I test di robustezza, che includono una definizione più ristretta di libertà economica e l’introduzione di una variabile che riflette la qualità dei controlli, porta alla stessa conclusione: una maggiore libertà economica riduce la disoccupazione.
P10|Engaging Geopolitical Economy|Two-volumes: This work advances geopolitical economy as a new approach to understanding the evolution of the capitalist world order and its twenty-first century form of multipolarity. It revives and redeploys the idea of uneven and combined development (UCD) as a way of uniting the understanding of domestic and international developments, and the struggles of classes and nations, into a single perspective as critical to this task. Geopolitical economy, as developed in VOLUME 30A, sheds light on the nature of contemporary international tensions as never before. VOLUME 30B then advances geopolitical economy as a new approach to the study of international relations and international political economy. Following upon the theoretical limitations exposed in Volume A, the analytical limitations are explored in this volume.
P10|Unproductive Activity and Endogenous Technological Change in a Marxian Model of Economic Reproduction and Growth|This paper integrates unproductive activity into a Marxist growth model based on Marxâ€™s reproduction schemes. Labor extraction and technological change are related to the production and distribution of surplus and thus are endogenous. Unproductive labor is shown to have potentially contradictory effects. It can squeeze profits and reduce growth or increase work intensity and develop productivity enhancing technological change, which increase profitability and growth. Empirical evidence indicates that both effects occurred in the postwar United States. Marxâ€™s reproduction schemes are also shown to rely on a classical growth dynamic in which the profit and savings rates determine the rate of growth.
P10|Piketty on Capitalism and Inequality|Thomas Pikettyâ€™s Capital in the Twenty-first Century has focused attention on the dramatic rise in economic inequality that has occurred in the United States and Europe over the past four decades. This paper argues that his account of the mechanisms that determine the distribution of income and wealth in a capitalist economy is unconvincing, for it rests on a tautology and on a spurious hypothesis about how the savings rate, the growth rate, and the capital/income ratio are connected.
P10|Hierarchical capitalism in Latin America: Comparative analysis with other economies|Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to compare the three largest economies in Latin America (Brazil, Mexico and Argentina) with other economies that have another type of capitalism, in that way we can extract some effects of the hierarchical capitalism in Latin America Design/methodology/approach – The data were taken from World Economic Outlook (IMF), The Global Innovation Index (INSEAD)and the Democracy Index (The Economist). The selected countries are: Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea, Spain and Croatia. We establish a comparison among countries in the following dimensions: economic growth, innovation and democracy. Findings – The comparison shows that Argentina, Brazil and Mexico have lower level of economic growth, innovation performance and democracy level than South Korea, Spain and Croatia. The variety of capitalism in Latin America (hierarchical) has lower performance than others kinds of capitalism in other regions of the world. Research limitations/implications – We have compared Latin American countries with countries from other regions of the world. However, a comparison may include more countries and results could vary. Originality/value – The results tend to support the idea that hierarchical capitalism has poor results in comparison with other varieties of capitalism.
P10|Piketty misreads Austen and ignores Smith<BR>[Piketty malinterpreta a Jane Austen e ignora a Adam Smith]|El gran éxito editorial de Thomas Piketty, El capital en el siglo XXI, utiliza referencias literarias, y en particular las novelas de Jane Austen, para ilustrar el problema de la desigualdad. Su análisis es insatisfactorio en dos aspectos principales. En primer lugar, presenta una visión distorsionada de los escritos de Austen, quien de hecho reconoció que la sociedad de su tiempo era más dinámica y móvil que lo que sugiere Piketty. En Segundo lugar, Piketty ignora a un pensador tan relevante como Adam Smith, que está presente en las obras de Jane Asten a través de un principio clave de su teoría del comportamiento y del crecimiento económico: los seres humanos no procuran ser iguales, sino mejores.
P10|El cooperativismo en la educación<BR>[The cooperative movement in education]|Este trabajo plantea la hipótesis de que las cooperativas de enseñanza conforman una alternativa sólida para el futuro de los centros de enseñanza españoles. Cierto que ya son una realidad en este momento coyuntural, pero los retos con que se enfrenta el sector de la enseñanza en un futuro próximo y a medio plazo, pueden ser afrontados con mayores posibilidades de ofrecer calidad, eficiencia y, en conjunto, excelencia desde las perspectivas de un planteamiento ideológico, profesional y económico como el que ofrecen lascooperativas de la enseñanza. Para demostrar la hipótesis de trabajo se ha desarrollado, en una primera parte de este artículo, un sucinto repaso a la historia de las cooperativas de enseñanza desde los primeros pasos en los albores del siglo XX hasta nuestros días especialmente los relacionados con su evolución en España. En la segunda parte se han analizado la estructura, características y problemáticas de dichas cooperativas de enseñanza y su proyección dentro de un mundo caracterizado por la globalización, las nuevas tecnologías, la información y el conocimiento que inciden, directamente, en la enseñanza. Todo ello conduce a pronosticar un futuro inmediato en que las cooperativas de enseñanza se impondrán, vistas las premisas de este trabajo, a los centros privados de los que son, ya hoy día, una alternativa que se consolidará en el futuro.
P10|L’accumulation financière dans les pays riches depuis 1970|Le développement accéléré des opérations financières est une des évolutions les plus remarquables au sein des pays riches depuis les années 1970. La crise de 2007-2008 et la longue récession dans laquelle l’économie mondiale est engluée depuis ont brutalement exposé le coût économique et social exorbitant de cette financiarisation. Cette note propose une description des contours de l’accumulation financière dans les principales économies riches (Allemagne, Etats-Unis, France, Japon, Royaume uni). Elle reprend la démarche initiée par Greta Krippner qui définit la financiarisation comme une réorientation de l’accumulation du capital vers les activités financières au détriment des activités productives et commerciales. Pour avérer la financiarisation des économies, nous avons retenus trois types d’indicateurs : le poids du secteur financier, l’importance relative des profits de ce secteur dans les profits globaux et la dynamique des revenus financiers des firmes non-financières par rapports aux profits que génèrent leurs opérations.
P10|Financial accumulation in the rich countries since 1970|The accelerated development of financial operations has been one of the most striking evolutions observed in the rich countries since the 1970s. The crisis of 2007-2008 and the long recession in which the global economy has been stuck since then have dramatically exposed the high economic and social cost of this financialization. This note describes the profile of financial accumulation in the main rich economies (Germany, United States, France, Japan and the United Kingdom). It follows the approach initiated by Greta Krippner, who defined financialization in terms of the reorientation of capital accumulation towards financial activities, to the detriment of trade and commodity production. To demonstrate the financialization of these economies, we have chosen three types of indicators: the weight of the financial sector, the relative importance of the profits of this sector as a share of total profits and the dynamics of the financial revenues of non-financial firms in relation to the profits generated by their operations.
P10|Growth and the Smart State|As countries develop, the main driver of economic growth shifts from imitation to innovation. These two sources of growth require different policies and institutions. In particular, in this article we argue that the transition from an imitation-based to an innovation-based economy calls the old welfare state model into question. It is not so much the size of the state that is at stake but rather its governance. What we need to foster economic growth in developed economies is not a reduced state but a strategic state, which acts as a catalyst using selective and properly governed support to the market-driven innovation process. This idea of a strategic state that targets its investments to maximize growth in the face of hard budget constraints departs both from the Keynesian view of a state sustaining growth through demand-driven policies and from the neoliberal view of a minimal state confined to its regalian functions.
P10|A Stochastic Model of Wealth Accumulation with Class Division|In this paper we propose a stochastic model in which wealth accumulation depends on the role that agents play in the society: capitalists or workers. A random mechanism of class selection shapes the social structure of the economy based on wealth distribution dynamics. As a result, the society may evolve towards an unequal outcome with few rich and many poor individuals, even starting from perfect equality. We study the dynamic properties of the model by means of computer simulations. A maximum likelihood estimation procedure is applied to analyse the Pareto or power law tail of wealth distribution. We also provide a scenario analysis to explore the system's behaviour under alternative parameter settings.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P10|La transnacionalización en la economía colombiana|Esta investigación analiza el fenómeno de la transnacionalización en el marco de la lógica neoliberal y su accionar en Colombia a través de las políticas de apertura de la década de 1990. Para ello, se hace un estudio del fenómeno de la transnacionalización en la economía mundial y sus incidencias en el desenvolvimiento económico de América Latina, para contextualizar así, el caso colombiano. Luego, se analiza en Colombia el comportamiento de la Inversión Extranjera Directa (IED), como variable explicativa de la transnacionalización, para identificar la posible relación entre ésta y algunas variables macroeconómicas y sectoriales. Se encuentra una fuerte incidencia de la IED sobre el sector de recursos naturales y servicios, y un efecto poco significativo en el sector industrial. Por tanto, se considera que, si se diseñan políticas que articulen los intereses del Estados y las transnacionales, se puede propender el impulso de la industria nacional, el cuidado del medio ambiente, la calidad del empleo y el desarrollo productivo del país.
P10|Tasa de beneficio y distribución del ingreso en la economía española (1964-2012)|Resumen: El presente trabajo analiza la relación existente entre la crisis actual, la tendencia de la tasa de ganancia y la distribución del ingreso en el caso de la economía española. Para nuestro propósito, se realizará una revisión teórica de las contribuciones de Marx sobre las causas y los efectos de una caída de la tasa de ganancia. Asimismo, se aplica la ecuación kaleckiana de la tasa de beneficio para estimar la tendencia de ésta en la economía española, con el objeto de realizar un estudio empírico para dilucidar sobre la relación entre la distribución del ingreso y la tasa de beneficio en el caso español.
P10|How Darwinian should an economy be?|"This paper studies aggregate dynamics in a cobweb model where learning takes place through a selection mecanism, by which more successful firms are replicated at a higher rate. The structure of the model allows to characterize analytically the aggregate dynamics, and to compute the effect on welfare of alternative levels of selectivity. A central aspect is that greater selectivity, while bringing the distribution of firm types closer to the optimal one at a given date, tends to make the economy less stable at the aggregate level.As in Nelson and Winter (1982), firms differ in their labor/capital ratio.They do not choose it optimally, rather it is a characteristic of a .rm. The distribution of firms evolves over time in a way that favors the most profitable firm types. Selection may be inadequate because firms are being selected on the basis of incorrect market signals. Selection itself may reinforce such mispricing, thus generating instability.I compare economies that differ in the volatility and persistence of their productivity shocks, as well as the elasticity of labor supply. The key findings are as follows.First, a trade-o¤ arises since greater selection allows to better track shocks and limits mutational drift in firm types; on the other hand, selection may strengthen cobweb oscillatory dynamics.Second, there seems to be a value in maintaining a diverse ""ecology of firms"", in order to cope with future shocks.These observations explain the key results. Optimal selectivity is larger, the less ""cobweb unstable"" the economy, i.e. the more elastic the labor supply.Second, optimal selectivity is larger, the more persistent the aggregate productivity shocks. Finally, optimal selectivity is larger, the lower the variance of productivity innovations.The model can be extended to allow for firm entry and trend productivity growth, and a selection process with memory. Empirical evidence suggests that, in accordance to the model, countries with less regulated product markets exhibit lower aggregate inertia."
P10|Fiscal Decentralization in China: A Literature Review|Understanding the logic of fiscal decentralization is pivotal to the next steps of fiscal reform. The first step is a retrospection of the literature and evidence accumulated in the field. As a typical transition economy with rapid and extensive devolution reforms, China is the ideal context to examine the causes, processes, and effects of fiscal decentralization, which will attract numerous academic endeavors, both domestic and abroad. However, the literature has not been fully reviewed and the evidence on fiscal decentralization remains mixed and inconclusive. This paper is a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in the area of fiscal decentralization in China over the past decades. The processes, characteristics, and measurements of fiscal decentralization are firstly reviewed and the antecedents and consequences of fiscal decentralization are then synthesized. The knowledge gap and avenues for future research are finally discussed with the ultimate goal of making knowledge about fiscal decentralization in China contributive, accumulative, and sustainable.
P10|Varianten von Marktwirtschaften: Lehren für Russland<BR>[Varieties of Market Economies: Lessons for Russia]|The ordo-liberal inspired Social Market Economy that emerged from west German economists and lawyers of the second half of the 1940s has perhaps attracted more attention in the international academic debate. Than prior to the financial crisis that became obvious to a wider public in 2008. Prior to this even the approach of ‘German neo-liberalism’ (i.e. ordo-liberalism) was neglected by many mainstream economists outside of Germany. Unexpectedly, Ge3rmany coped with turbulent economic times since 2008 much better than many spectators particularly in the Anglo-Saxon economies that support ‘free market’-principles more than the German establishment have anticipated. Simultaneously, these latter economies have lost much of their former appeal as a result of their decreased dynamism and problems to cope with the current problems in recent years. The renaissance of German ordoliberal concepts during both the financial crisis and the crisis in the euro area leads to the question whether the principles of the Social Market Economy can also serve as a guide for reforms in Russia. According to the author, an appropriate implementation of these principles would lead to lastingly superior prospects of prosperity in Russia.
P10|Assessing negative freedom: economic liberty in the long run|"""This paper presents historical indices for the main dimensions of economic freedom and an aggregate index for nowadays developed countries -(pre-1994) OECD, for short-. Economic liberty expanded over the last one-and-a-half centuries, reaching two thirds of its maximum possible. Its evolution has been, however, far from linear. After a substantial improvement since mid-nineteenth century, World War I brought a major setback. The post-war recovery up to 1929 was followed by a dramatic decline in the 1930s and significant progress took place during the Golden Age but fell short from the pre-World War I peak. A steady expansion since the early 1980s has resulted in the highest levels of economic liberty of the last two centuries. Each main dimension of economic freedom exhibited a distinctive trend and its contribution to the aggregate index varied over time. Nonetheless, improved property rights provided the main contribution to the long-run advancement of economic liberty."""
P10|Should the Modernization Hypothesis Survive Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, and Yared? Some More Evidence|An important dimension of the “modernization hypothesis” is the claim that there is a long-run positive relation between socio-economic development and political democracy. This research strand of the modernization hypothesis, however, has been challenged in a series of papers by Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, James Robinson, and Pierre Yared. Employing econometric specifications that condition on lagged democracy, income, education, time effects, and a proxy for the level of capitalist institutions, and applying the System Generalized Method of Moments estimator to a sample that spans recent decades, we find, in congruence with the modernization hypothesis, that income and education predict democracy.
P10|Capitalism and the Rule of Love|This essay was originally published in 1953 in the Southern Economic Journal. Clarence Philbrook (1909–1978) proclaims as his point of departure “the rule of love,” “universal love,” and asks the central question of comparative institutions: Does undermining the liberal system of free enterprise, by pervasive government intervention—the awe-filling trend of his era—really better serve the rule of love? He contends that interventionism and extensive government serve the rule of love less well than capitalism does: “capitalism does less violence to the rule of love than would any other system so far conceived.” For that position he mounts a case that is noteworthy in many respects, but especially for the great emphasis he puts on system “signals”—a term he uses 17 times—“signals to tell individuals what they are to contribute toward the performance of some social function.” It had been only recently, in 1945, that contemplating system performance in terms of its “communication” had gotten started, by Friedrich Hayek. Here Philbrook boldly asks us to think in terms of pieces of communication, signals, in assessing how well institutional systems serve the rule of love.
P10|Financial, economic and social systems: French Regulation School, Social Structures of Accumulation and Post-Keynesian approaches compared|This paper surveys some of the important literatures on financial, economic and social systems with an eye towards explaining the tendencies towards 'financialisation'. We focus on important strands of this literature: the French Regulation School, the US-based Social Structures of Accumulation approach, the contributions by several Post-Keynesian authors, with a focus on the long-run views contained in Hyman Minsky's work, in particular. In our comparative assessment of these approaches, we adopt the following four steps procedure: First, we sketch the basic structure of the approaches in order to single out how each of them views the interaction between social institutions and the economy and the related dynamics regarding the development of the institutional structure and the associated stages or regimes of economic development. Second, we describe how these approaches view the structural breaks or the regime shifts in the long-run development of modern capitalism, which has triggered or at least has contributed to the emergence of a type of capitalism dominated by finance (financialisation). Third, we outline how these different approaches view the main characteristics and features of financialisation. Fourth, we deal with the respective views on the consequences of financialisation for long-run economic and social development including the crisis of this stage of development.

P10|Culture and Institutions: Economic Development in the Regions of Europe|Does culture have a causal effect on economic development? The data on European regions suggest that it does. Culture is measured by indicators of individual values and beliefs, such as trust and respect for others, and confidence in individual selfdetermination. To isolate the exogenous variation in culture, I rely on two historical variables used as instruments: the literacy rate at the end of the XIXth century, and the political institutions in place over the past several centuries. The political and social history of Europe provides a rich source of variation in these two variables at a regional level. The exogenous component of culture due to history is strongly correlated with current regional economic development, after controlling for contemporaneous education, urbanization rates around 1850 and national effects. Moreover, the data do not reject the over-identifying assumption that the two historical variables used as instruments only influence regional development through culture. The indicators of culture used in this paper are also strongly correlated with economic development and with available measures of institutions in a cross-country setting.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P10|The Role of Institutions in Growth and Development|In this paper authors argue that the main determinants of differences in prosperity across countries are differences in economic institutions. To solve the problem of development will entail reforming these institutions. Unfortunately, this is difficult because economic institutions are collective choices that are the outcome of a political process. The economic institutions of a society depend on the nature of political institutions and the distribution of political power in society. As yet, authors only have a highly preliminary understanding of the factors that lead a society into a political equilibrium which supports good economic institutions. However, it is clear that it is the political nature of an institutional equilibrium that makes it very difficult to reform economic institutions. The authors illustrate this with a series of pitfalls of institutional reforms. The author's analysis reveals challenges for those who would wish to solve the problem of development and poverty. That such challenges exist is hardly surprising and believe that the main reason for such challenges is the forces authors have outlined in this paper. Better development policy will only come when authors recognize this and understand these forces better. Nevertheless, some countries do undergo political transitions, reform their institutions, and move onto more successful paths of economic development.

P10|Kleine und mittlere Unternehmen, staatliche Rahmenbedingungen und Schaffung zusätzlicher Jobs|Dieser Artikel hebt die Wichtigkeit der kleinen und mittleren ostdeutschen Untenehmen für die Arbeitsmarkentwicklung und das wirtschaftliche Wachstum hervor. Gerade in diesen Unternehmen bestehe noch ein großes Potential für neue Arbeitsplätze. Aber gerade hier wird eine positive Entwicklung durch staatliche Vorgaben und Regulierungen häufig gebremst oder verhindert. Es wird ebenfalls ein internationaler Vergleich angestellt, um die Folgen von Regulierungen zu erforschen und abschließend auf die Ansätze zur Verringerungen der administrativen Lasten in der EU eingegangen.
