R29|Defining and measuring energy poverty in Poland|The EU Member States are obliged to assess the scale of energy poverty in their respective national contexts. We propose a new definition of energy poverty in Poland, with different levels of specificity corresponding to the needs of different levels of administration. We also propose a set of five indicators for measuring energy poverty based on data from the Polish Household Budget Survey. Two expenditure-based indicators identify energy-poor households: a modified version of the Low Income High Cost indicator and an indicator based on actual energy expenditures. Three self-reported indicators related to financial capability, the physical condition of the dwelling, and the subjective level of thermal comfort are used to measure the severity of energy poverty. We find that all five indicators show that the older the dwelling is, the higher the risk of energy poverty is. Moreover, while the expenditure-based measures show that households living in detached houses have higher energy poverty rates than households living in multifamily buildings, the thermal comfort indicator shows the opposite relationship. Households living in dwellings without central heating are at a higher risk of energy poverty, according to all self-reported indicators.
R29|Measuring energy poverty in Poland with the Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index|Energy poverty is a complex problem that is generally caused by having a low income, having high energy costs, and/or living in a home with low energy efficiency. Various indicators capture these factors, but there is no consensus among researchers on which is the best one, or on how to combine them. Thus, poverty mapping and policy planning would benefit from having access to a unitary index of poverty. We have created a multidimensional energy poverty index using the methodology proposed by Alkire and Foster (2008). The index accounts for five dimensions of energy deprivation: two objective indicators of “low income, high costs” and “high share of energy expenditure in income”, as well as three subjective indicators of “inability to keep the home adequately warm”, “presence of leaks, damp, or rot” and “difficulties paying utility bills”. We define households as poor if at least two forms of deprivation are present. We apply our index to Poland using Household Budget Survey data. We find that in 2017, 10% of households in Poland suffered from multidimensional energy poverty, and that about half of these households were also income-poor. Households living in buildings built before 1946, households living in rural areas, and households that were dependent on retirement and disability pensions or on unearned sources of income were at especially high risk of energy poverty.
R29|Family Decision Making for Educational Expenditure, New Evidence from Survey Data for Nigeria|This study examines the determinants of educational expenditures by households in Nigeria. Data from the Nigerian General Household Survey, Panel 2012/2013, Wave 2 was used and a double-hurdle model was employed for the analysis. The results suggest household income, the age, education, gender of the household heads and urban versus rural residence have a significant impact on the decision to spend on education. Such expenditures are income elastic overall, but are very different in magnitude for low income compared to higher income families. It is found that the income elasticity of education expenditures are approximately four times greater for households in the bottom two-thirds of the income distribution than for those on the top one-third of the income distribution.
R29|Consumer Engagement in Energy Markets: The Role of Information and Knowledge|External information (e.g., monetary and opportunity costs, retailer messaging), internal information (e.g., consumer knowledge, information processing), and the interaction between different forms of information can affect consumer engagement in markets. We employ an analytical framework which embraces both economic and psychological motives behind consumer behavior to investigate the motives and obstacles associated with household behavior in energy markets, using data from over 18,000 randomly selected responses drawn from three annual surveys of British households commissioned by the UK energy regulator. Three forms of household engagement – switching to a new electricity and/or gas supplier, changing electricity or/and gas tariffs, and changing payment methods of energy bills – are explored using a multiple-discrete choice framework. We find that internal information pathways have robust and strong effects on switching suppliers and tariffs. Concretely, a lack of belief in tariff differences discourages participation in energy markets. By contrast, professed knowledge of household energy spending and familiarity with energy tariffs drives consumer engagement. External information – supplier messages and Internet information may enhance each other in promoting market participation, conditional on message source and participation form. We also find that engagement by incumbent retailers (such as through consumer messages) can be effective in discouraging households from switching suppliers.

R29|Social tenants’ health: evaluating the effectiveness of landlord interventions|Objectives: To test whether a social landlord can improve health outcomes for older tenants and reduce their NHS usage by simple interventions. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: Social housing in five London Boroughs. Participants: 547 individuals over 50 years of age. Intervention: Baseline and two follow-up assessments of individual’s health and use of medical services undertaken by health professionals. In the treated groups, individuals were given health care and support at two different levels. 25 individuals had to be removed from the trial because early assessments revealed critical and untreated health issues. Main outcome measures: Self-reported health and wellbeing ratings and NHS usage. Conclusions: Even simple interventions to a targeted group (older and poorer people), can produce significant reductions in NHS usage. Significant reductions were found for 1) planned hospital usage; 2) nights in hospital; and 3) for emergency GP usage. Well-being scores improved in the most strongly treated group but these were not statistically significant. Perhaps the single most important finding was that the early health evaluations revealed that 4.5% of the total sample – not in the most deprived section of the population – had such severe health problems that significant and immediate intervention was required

R29|The Puzzle Of Job Search And Housing Tenure: A Reconciliation Of Theory And Empirical Evidence|Oswald's thesis posits that workers who own their own home should have longer unemployment spells due to restricted mobility, but repeatedly the reverse is found. We contribute to shed light on this puzzle in two key ways. First, we show that the thesis holds when stated in terms of search intensity instead of unemployment. In a job search model with moving costs we show that unemployed homeowners search less than renters. We confirm this result empirically using UK LFS data. Second, we provide evidence that homeowners select search methods associated with shorter unemployment spells, suggesting that they search more effciently.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R29|Neighborhood effects on secondary school performance of Latino and African American youth: Evidence from a natural experiment in Denver|We quantify the relationships between measures of neighborhood context and school performance (repeating a grade, grade point average and dropping out before a diploma is earned) for low-income Latino and African American adolescents ages 12–18. We employ administrative and survey data from a natural experiment involving the Denver Housing Authority's public housing program to minimize geographic selection bias and provide wide variation in neighborhood contexts. We use characteristics of the neighborhood initially offered by DHA to waiting list applicants as identifying instruments for the neighborhood context experienced as an adolescent. Cox proportional hazard models (OLS in the case of grades) demonstrate that neighborhoods having less social vulnerability, higher occupational prestige and lower percentages of African American residents robustly predict superior secondary educational performance in one or more dimensions, though magnitudes are typically contingent on ethnicity.
R29|Understanding the rural and urban household saving rise in China|This paper analyzes the different factors that drive saving rate rises of both rural and urban households in China. Using data from the Chinese Household Income Project 1995 and 2002, I first show that the whole saving rate distribution shifts up for both rural and urban households. The shift, however, differs between rural and urban households and is heterogeneous across the distribution: while rural saving increased the most at lower percentiles, urban saving experienced a larger shift at higher percentiles. Moreover, decomposition in the saving distribution shows that most of the increase in the rural saving rate is due to rising income. In contrast, only a small portion of the increase in the urban saving rate can be explained by changes in household characteristics including income. The rising urban saving rates are instead explained by changes in quantile regression coefficients over time, especially at the top of the saving distribution.
R29|Adding fuel to fire? Social spillovers and spatial disparities in the adoption of LPG in India|The Indian population is still heavily reliant on solid biomass as a cooking fuel, especially in the rural areas, despite its negative health implications. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is a clean alternative, but its higher cost implies that its use is often limited to the richer, urban areas of the country. This paper investigates whether social spillovers might play a role in a household’s decision to use LPG, how these effects vary across different subpopulations, and whether they exacerbate or ameliorate existing spatial disparities in LPG use. Using data from the National Sample Survey (NSS) and the India Human Development Survey (IHDS), this paper provides multiples strands of evidence, which when analysed in conjunction, suggest the presence of positive social spillovers. Hence, households are more likely to adopt LPG if other households residing in the same village or urban block do so. We find divergence in the strength of this effect between rural and urban households, with more persistent spillovers amongst rural households. We also find that spillovers are stronger in states that have previously had low rates of adoption, supporting the idea of an S-shaped pattern of technological adoption. Spillovers are also found to be stronger for households that are members of associations or social networks such as caste associations. Our results provide evidence on convergence in LPG use rates across subgroups of the Indian population, and have strong implications for policymakers who could leverage lessons from social learning to encourage consumers to switch to cleaner sources of energy in developing countries.
R29|Location, location, location. What accounts for regional variation of fuel poverty in Poland?|The aim of this paper is to explain the regional variation of fuel poverty in Poland. The significant spatial variation of fuel poverty stems from differences in the buildings’ characteristics, income and household composition as well as the diverse advancement of urbanisation processes. The variance analysis permit the conclusion that all these factors influence both energy affordability (LIHC) and thermal comfort (subjective) dimension of fuel poverty. Energy affordability depends mainly on household’s income, whereas lack of thermal comfort is mainly due to low energy efficiency of a building. Even after factoring out the influence of these three factors there still remains a significant unexplained regional variation of lack of thermal comfort. We show that this unexplained variation is linked with the regional disparities of prices and outdoor temperatures.
R29|Forecasting extreme seasonal tourism demand|When we face an extreme seasonal demand such that off-season monthly demands go down almost to zero, it is important to forecast the high-season demand only. In forecasting tourism demand for a place like a cold-water island, we meet such an extreme seasonality. However, in such places, tourism is one of the most important industries, and to forecast tourism demand in the high season is important. Rishiri Island in Japan is a typical example. We construct some forecasting models and evaluate their forecasting performance using several criteria. Forecasts from the SARIMA model with full-season data and without a trend term perform best in postsample evaluation. This shows that off-season data also provide useful information for forecasting the high-season tourism demand.
R29|Ökonomische Effekte grüner Infrastruktur als Teil eines Grünflächenfaktors. Ein Leitfaden|Urbane grüne Infrastruktur beschreibt natürliche und naturnahe Grünräume in der Stadt. Diese wirken sich auf das Ökosystem, das menschliche Wohlbefinden sowie auch auf (Immobilien)Märkte aus. Um diese Auswirkungen stadtplanerisch zu steuern, ist ein mögliches Instrument ein „Grünflächenfaktor“. Wir schlagen einen Grünflächenfaktor auf Bauplatzebene vor, der sich als gewichtete Summe gärtnerisch gestalteter Flächen berechnet. Die Gewichte entsprechen den ökologischen Funktionen und Auswirkungen auf die Lebensqualität des Menschen. Auch der Kapitalisierung dieser Grünräume in Immobilienpreisen wird in dem Index Rechnung getragen. Dieser Leitfaden beschreibt die Überlegungen, die hinter der Integration ökonomischer Einflüsse in den Grünflächenfaktor stehen. Auch werden im Text unterschiedliche Politikinstrumente diskutiert.
R29|Does spatial proximity to small towns matter for rural livelihoods? A propensity score matching analysis in Ethiopia|Abstract The spatial dimension of rural–urban linkage has become a new subject of debate in regional development. In most empirical research the focus has usually been on the role of small urban centers in rural development. However, the effects of different particulars of the linkage such as spatial proximity to small towns on income of the hinterlands’ people have been less explored. The central purpose of this paper is, hence, assessing the effect of spatial proximity to small towns on income of the people living in the surrounding rural hinterlands. It also provides a bird’s-eye view of the livelihood strategies used by rural households in using town services. A propensity score matching technique is employed to estimate the effects. It is apparent in the results of the study that, controlling for other confounding factors, spatial proximity to small towns has a significantly positive effect on the income of the people living in the surrounding hinterlands. This notion indirectly leads the households living in the farthest hinterlands to adopt a new coping mechanism, i.e. enhancing their social proximity in a way that compensates the opportunity lost as a result of physical distance.
R29|Study of Customer Satisfaction with Living Conditions in New Apartment Buildings|The article aims to analyze the Lithuanian housing market and to look into the satisfaction of people with living conditions in new apartment buildings on this market. The article presents the concept of customer satisfaction in construction and the criteria that define the quality of dwellings; the benefits, consequences, merits and demerits of the assessment of customer satisfaction are also named. A survey of customer satisfaction helped to evaluate the quality of dwellings according to their technical and functional parameters, as well as the degree of cooperation between customers and contractors/builders. The customer satisfaction index (CSI) and the degree of loyalty were calculated, and then a customer satisfaction matrix was built up.
R29|Health begins with people: An RCT study to test the effects of a housing provider's health interventions|Recent research has been increasingly showing that it is not the houses or the neighbourhoods in which people live that make them sick or poor: rather it is their personal characteristics. Still this does not mean that interventions aimed at occupants of social housing may not be effective in improving health. The structure of social housing provision in Britain means that there are many large social landlords. Landlords have particular access to their tenants and this paper presents the results of an Randomised Control Trial designed to evaluate the impacts of simple health interventions on the health of poorer residents over 50 living in 5 inner London boroughs. The study was carried out between February 2013- May 2015. Participants were randomly divided into three groups: a control group (n= 186), a group receiving additional signposting to health services (n= 172); and a group receiving intensive support from a dedicated health and wellbeing support worker (n= 174). The intervention period was 18 months. The main outcomes measured were self-reported health and wellbeing ratings and NHS usage. Randomisation was computer-generated and participants and assessors were blinded to the allocation. Perhaps the single most important finding was that the initial base line health evaluation revealed 25 (4.5%) of the total sample as having such severe health problems that significant and immediate intervention was required. This set of people was taken out of the trail and directed to treatment. In purely scientific terms this is unfortunate since it means that all intervention effects are likely underestimated since these were people whose health was critical. On the other hand it shows that the simplest possible intervention to a targeted group (older and poorer people), just an individual health status assessment, can produce significant health improvements. For the 95% staying in the trial significant effects were found for planned hospital usage, with the intensive intervention group's usage reducing by 39% in comparison to control group's increase of 11% (p= 0.004). Significant effects were also found for nights in hospital where the signposting intervention's usage decreased (35%) significantly in comparison to the control group's increased usage (13%) (p= 0.022). The intensive intervention group's usage in fact reduced more (62%) but variance was high (20.198), affecting significance. Substantive effects were identified for emergency GP usage, where group 3 reduced their usage by 15%, a substantive difference (p= 0.055) to group 2's 181% increase. *The study was initiated and funded by Family Mosaic
R29|Why Do More British Consumers Not Switch Energy Suppliers? The Role of Individual Attitudes|Consumers’ activities play an important role in determining the extent to which any market may become competitive. Although energy prices and switching tariffs and suppliers become very salient politically over 2013-14 in the UK and the number and share of small suppliers increased dramatically over that period, relatively fewer customers switched suppliers in UK electricity and gas markets despite the potential for financial gains, suggesting that non-price factors may affect switching decisions. Using a unique nation-wide British survey, we investigate the determinants of consumers’ switching behavior in electricity and gas markets, by emphasizing the effects of individual attitudes towards energy issues as well as perception of switching cost and benefit. We find that the complexity of household energy tariffs, consumers’ lack of attention to issue of energy prices, expectation on the costs of switching process and lack of switching experience discourage switching. Political allegiance also appears to play a role as Labour Party voters are more likely to switch. Few demographic factors are found to affect the likelihood of switching. Higher education qualifications are related to increased activity in energy markets. Households paying by direct debit are more likely to switch than those paying by other ways. Financial hardship a household suffers does not matter for switching decisions, suggesting there is no clear relationship between switching and income. We conclude that policies which emphasize simplification of energy tariffs, increasing convenience of switching, improving consumers’ concerns about energy issues, improving consumers’ confidence to exercise switch are likely to increase consumer activity.

R29|Teachers’ salaries and human capital, and their effects on academic performance: an institution-level analysis of Los Angeles County high schools|This study re-examines the relationships between school performance (at the high school level) on standardized exams and both teacher pay/salaries and teacher quality, where the latter is measured by teachers’ human capital. To undertake this analysis, we employ Academic Performance Index (API) data from high schools in Los Angeles County (CA) to measure school performance. Heteroscedasticity-consistent OLS results indicate that both teacher pay and teacher quality exercise positive impacts upon school performance. Indeed, an increase from lowest to highest (i.e., over the entire range) of teacher pay and teacher quality, ceteris paribus, generates high school performance increases of approximately three and six percentage points, respectively.

R29|Smart and sustainable cities in the European Union. An ex ante assessment of environmental, social, and cultural domains|The aim of the paper is to define a set of smartness and sustainability indicators applicable to European cities and to assess their outcome in an ex-ante perspective with regard to the implementation of Europe 2020 strategy. Following the DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, State, Impact, Response) model we select a bundle of indicators for three relevant sustainability domains (environmental, social, cultural), which are proper of the smart city definition. Then we define groups of homogeneous cities for each domain by using a two-step cluster analysis. Results show the existence of heterogeneous groups of cities that are likely to become smart in the cultural domain, side by side to groups of more developed urban areas that have acquired a substantial advantage in the environmental and social dimensions.
R29|Ubiquitous digital technologies and spatial structure: a preliminary analysis|This paper sheds light on the potential effect that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) might generate on cities and spatial structure. The extensive theoretical discussion and speculation on how cities and geography might be affected by digital technologies, which took place before the actual adoption of such technologies, have not been coupled by in depth empirical analysis to verify early predictions. The few examples of such studies, which approached such research questions both analytically and empirically, were insightful, but their results were to a certain extend contradictory. Most importantly, these studies took place before digital technologies such as the Internet had matured. Nowadays, these technologies have been adopted widely and we are thus in a better position to approach empirically such a research question and quantify the relation between ICTs and spatial structure. The preliminary empirical analysis presented in this paper suggests significant causal effects that ICT penetration generates on spatial structure. Internet and mobile phone penetration in non-EU/NAFTA countries have led to more spatially dispersed population and more uniform city size distribution. However, such effects are not present in non-EU/NAFTA countries, a phenomenon which might be related to the maturity of urban systems and advanced state of technological adoption in those countries. The proposed methodology, which relies on extensive econometric investigations with a number of models includes 2SLS regressions with instrumented variables, resulted to estimations which are robust against potential endogeneity problems.
R29|Vorausberechnung regionaler Altersarmut: Zunahme in Ballungsräumen und in Ostdeutschland|Until recently, old-age poverty in Germany has been no central subject in the socio-political discussion. By this discussion, only the social help to elderly people is taken into account. Besides, only half of the old-age poverty is monitored and does not consider that the housing subsidy (rent subsidies) is another financial support for the old people. If both social benefits are added up, the quantity of the poor old people doubles. Only the consideration of social help to elderly people and housing subsidy proves the true magnitude of the old-age poverty in Germany. On an average four percent of the old people need one of both social benefits. There are, however, greater regional differences. A new method has been developed to provide a forecast about old-age poverty in future which also makes regional investigations possible. The initial year of the forecast is in 2011, between 2011 and 2021 the old-age poverty rises strongly and the regional differences have strongly grown. Altersarmut wird in der sozialpolitischen Diskussion in Deutschland vor allem mit Blick auf die Grundsicherung im Alter diskutiert, zumindest darauf fokussiert ist Altersarmut bisher kein zentrales Thema. Mit der Grundsicherung wird allerdings nur die Hälfte der Altersarmut gesehen. Vergessen wird das Wohngeld, eine weitere finanzielle Unterstützung für Ältere. Wird auch dieses berücksichtigt, verdoppelt sich die Quote der von Einkommensarmut betroffenen Älteren. Ost- und Westdeutschland liegen dabei mit jeweils etwa vier Prozent gleichauf. Es gibt aber durchaus größere regionale Unterschiede. Eine Abschätzung der Altersarmut nach Regionen ausgehend von 2011 für das Jahr 2021 auf der Grundlage eines regionalen Prognosemodells zeigt, dass sich die Altersarmut sehr zuungunsten Ostdeutschlands verändern wird. Ballungsräume, die Stadtstaaten sowie einzelne ostdeutsche Landkreise werden in Zukunft die höchsten Armutsquoten aufweisen.
R29|Social housing, neighborhood quality and student performance|Children who grow up in deprived neighborhoods underperform at school and later in life but whether there is a causal link remains contested. This study estimates the short-term effect of very deprived neighborhoods, characterized by a high density of social housing, on the educational attainment of fourteen years old students in England. To identify the causal impact, this study exploits the timing of moving into these neighborhoods. I argue that the timing can be taken as exogenous because of long waiting lists for social housing in high-demand areas. Using this approach, I find no evidence for negative short-term effects on teenage test scores.
R29|The Amenity Value of English Nature: A Hedonic Price Approach|Using a hedonic property price approach, we estimate the amenity value associated with proximity to habitats, designated areas, domestic gardens and other natural amenities in England. There is a long tradition of studies looking at the effect of environmental amenities and disamenities on property prices. But, to our knowledge, this is the first nationwide study of the value of proximity to a large number of natural amenities in England. We analysed 1 million housing transactions over 1996–2008 and considered a large number of environmental characteristics. Results reveal that the effects of many of these environmental variables are highly statistically significant, and are quite large in economic magnitude. Gardens, green space and areas of water within the census ward all attract a considerable positive price premium. There is also a strong positive effect from freshwater and flood plain locations, broadleaved woodland, coniferous woodland and enclosed farmland. Increasing distance to natural amenities such as rivers, National Parks and National Trust sites is unambiguously associated with a fall in house prices. Our preferred regression specifications control for unobserved labour market and other geographical factors using Travel to Work Area fixed effects, and the estimates are fairly insensitive to changes in specification and sample. This provides some reassurance that the hedonic price results provide a useful representation of the values attached to proximity to environmental amenities in England. Overall, we conclude that the housing market in England reveals substantial amenity value attached to a number of habitats, designations, private gardens and local environmental amenities.

We focus on single-family homes and condominiums in Duval County, the largest county in the Northeast Florida real estate market. Contrary to most research findings to date, we have strong evidence to suggest that homebuyers will fare better if they associate with small brokerage firms to represent their interests in the purchase transaction. Contrary to the previously published research, we found that firms associated with a national franchise garnered lower final sales prices.

Une vérification empirique à travers une enquête dans le milieu rural marocain<BR>[Remittances, Poverty and Income Inequality: What relations in rural Morocco?]|For several decades the fight against poverty has become a major policy concern for national governments and international institutions. In this paper, we examine the effect of remittances on poverty and inequality by using an original database of migrants in Morocco. The survey data were collected in the region of Souss-Massa-Draa. We estimate the migrant home earnings under the assumptions of absence of migration and remittances before comparing it to the household income when the migrant leave their native countries. We find that remittances can reduce the number of poor and vulnerable household. Our findings also suggest that these remittances inflows have increased income inequality when compared with the no-migration counterfactual situation.

The results of this study confirm that the inequality and polarization exist in Democratic Republic of Congo, what inspires that the social tension risk and the inequality are found in the two zones (urban and rural) but it is highest in urban zones that rural.
R29|Mortgage-related Financial Difficulties: Evidence from Australian Micro-level Data|We investigate the factors associated with the incidence of mortgage-related financial difficulties in Australia. We use two complementary micro-level datasets: loan-level data on residential mortgages from two Australian banks, which we use to analyse the factors associated with entering 90+ day housing loan arrears; and household-level data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, which we use to explore the factors associated with households missing mortgage payments. The loan-level analysis indicates that the probability of entering arrears increases with the loan-to-valuation ratio (LVR) at origination, and is particularly high for loans with an LVR above 90 per cent. In contrast, the probability of entering arrears is lower for loans that are repaid relatively quickly. Additionally, the probability of entering arrears varies across different loan types; for example, low-documentation loans are more likely to enter arrears, even after controlling for whether the borrower was self-employed. The likelihood of entering arrears increases with the contract interest rate, which is consistent with lenders setting higher interest rates for riskier borrowers. The household-level analysis suggests that the probability of missing a mortgage payment is particularly high for households with relatively high debt-servicing ratios. Households that have previously missed a payment are also much more likely to miss subsequent payments than households with unblemished payment histories.

In this sense, we tried to reveal social, economic, and environmental effects of the global warming and the awareness related to these effects. In this study, the effects of global warming and awareness issues are discussed in the concept of global warming. Economic, social, and environmental effects of global warming are established, a questionnaire was applied to investigate global warming awareness within the framework of these effects. Five-point Likert scale was used in the questionnaire performed to 1454 participants. The analysis was carried out using the logistic regression model the questionnaire was performed in urban living areas within TR83 Region (Samsun, Amasya, Çorum and Tokat).
R29|The Housing Markets in Spain and Portugal: Evidence of Persistence|This paper analyses house prices in Spain and Portugal over the last twenty years. In recent decades, housing prices have increased dramatically in the two countries; However, in 2007 the US subprime mortgage crisis broke out, which had worldwide influences, including Spain and Portugal. The purpose of this research is to study the time series persistence and the potential presence of breaks in these two countries. From this viewpoint, it is interesting to see how housing policy makers design reforms to adjust the real estate market, an issue of real concern for both citizens and institutions.
R29|The importance of succession on business growth: A case study of family farms in Switzerland and Norway|This paper develops the hypothesis that the level of growth or decline of small family farms is strongly connected to the farms’ succession process. Around the process of intra-family succession, both disinvestment in cases of farm abandonment or conversion to part-time farming and investment activities in case of transfer to the next generation reach the highest levels. This hypothesis is confirmed for four different growth indicators using Swiss and Norwegian farm data for the period 2004 to 2009. Management strategy is another significant factor explaining business development, whereas growth and shrinking processes are accelerated by a high degree of specialization.

R29|Values, beliefs and economic behaviors: a regional approach|The main goal of this paper is to identify relationships between value orientations, beliefs and economic behavior of agents, on one side, and differences between levels of economic development, on the other. Empirical analysis is based on a sample of Portuguese municipalities and correspondent parishes, organized in groups set by an urban versus rural typology and according to levels of development as measured by GDP per capita. Different value orientations, beliefs and behaviors were identified according to mostly either supply-side or demand-side, as well as predominantly State versus Private Sector orientations. Four clusters were thereby considered, which we generically named as corresponding to 'stabilization', 'economic nationalism', 'entrepreneurship' and 'consumerism'. These clusters are related to spatial dimensions considered. Parishes named 'rural', 'rural-urban' and 'urban' have shown (albeit in a small degree) a prevailing orientation to the State, whereas 'developing' parishes lean to private sector. Rural parishes are markedly consumerist, whereas in those said 'rural-urban' supply-side orientation prevails. Both 'urban' and 'developing' (correspondent to zones going through big recent changes) occupy, in this context, an intermediate position. JEL Codes are: R29; Z13 Keywords: Values, beliefs, economic behaviors, Portuguese regions.
R29|Deriving Optimal Portfolios for Hedging Housing Risk|Households that contemplate moving to different cities or trading up/down in the future are exposed to substantial housing risk. In order to mitigate this risk, we derive optimal portfolios using CME housing futures. Housing investment risk is hedged by selling housing futures amounting to the full value of the home. Housing consumption risk is hedged by buying housing futures in each city where the household might move. The size of the hedges depends on the probability of moving, on home values, and on labor income in each region. The hedging demands offset each other when the household intends to live in the same home indefinitely. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2013
R29|Housing and labor decisions of households|In this paper, we analyze the relationship between the demand for housing and the family employment. To do so, we develop an economic model and use a sample of Spanish households to analyze the housing tenure choice (ownership or rental of the house) and the demand for housing in relation to family labor decisions. We have gone beyond previous studies by incorporating the discrete decisions of tenure choice and the participation of women in the labor market, proving that these decisions are interrelated and broadening the scope of our findings and conclusions. We obtained an important description of the effect of economic factors on housing and labor decisions and demonstrated that a change in a family’s employment decisions affects housing decisions and vice versa. In addition, we determined to what extent housing and labor decisions are affected by changes in the wife’s educational level and changes in family composition. Our findings show that the labor decisions have more sensitivity than housing decisions to these changes. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013

The programs are the most significant of China’s Key Priority Forestry Programs, namely the Sloping Land Conversion Program (the SLCP), the Natural Forest Protection Program (the NFPP), and the Desertification Combating Program around Beijing and Tianjin (the DCBT). Cluster effects with county and environment factors have been estimated by using year dummy variables. Fixed model with cluster effects has been used. In addition to estimating the total impacts of the programs, individually and in combination, we disaggregate the effects by income source, stage of policy implementation, and duration of participation. We find minimal effects on total incomes from the programs overall, which are quiet different with other research empirical results, .but the more detailed results show that the initial stages of the programs, and the early years of participation had negative or neutral effects on land-based incomes, while in more recent years, impacts have improved, and in some cases become positive.
R29|An Evaluation of Financial Inclusion through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme|The government of India had initiated bank payments of wages under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (MGNREGP). This initiative is undoubtedly a big financial inclusion drive particularly among the rural poor of India. This paper has tried to evaluate this financial inclusion drive through MGNREGP in Mandir Bazar block of South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal on the basis of field survey. The picture came out from field research is very encouraging. It is established that a large section of rural poor now have a bank account which they can operate individually without taking much assistance from local panchayat officials or bank officials or any middleman. It is also identified that the women job card holders of the households are deprived to become literate about banking services. This initiative of the government also encourages few participating households to initiate some savings of their wage income.
R29|Collective institutions towards habitability: roles, strategies and forms of governance|The goal of this paper is to apply the theory of commons to residential contexts and verify if and how collective institutions can be used to produce habitability, i.e. a set of particular socio-environmental conditions conducive to inhabiting a particular area. While most literature on the study of the commons has a specific focus on the management of natural resources, this paper argues that collective institutions can work also in urban contexts. This paper focuses on the issue of housing. Although this topic is rarely discussed in the literature on the commons, some authors have clearly shown the role of selforganising communities in producing habitability since the 1970s. The theme of habitability will be discussed from two different perspectives: the first part of the paper will present the historical evolution of two very old collective institutions in north-central Italy responsible for managing common lands. These rural institutions have faced major socio-economic changes and have developed adaptive strategies to survive until today. The second part of the paper will discuss new forms of collective institutions (such as co-ops, trusts, charities, etc.) that use very similar institutional arrangements compared to the previous examples, but for the purpose of governing housing estates.
R29|How much international variation in child height can sanitation explain?|"Physical height is an important economic variable reflecting health and human capital. Puzzlingly, however, differences in average height across developing countries are not well explained by differences in wealth. In particular, children in India are shorter, on average, than children in Africa who are poorer, on average, a paradox called ""the Asian enigma"" which has received much attention from economists. This paper provides the first documentation of a quantitatively important gradient between child height and sanitation that can statistically explain a large fraction of international height differences. This association between sanitation and human capital is robustly stable, even after accounting for other heterogeneity, such as in GDP. I apply three complementary empirical strategies to identify the association between sanitation and child height: country-level regressions across 140 country-years in 65 developing countries; within-country analysis of differences over time within Indian districts; and econometric decomposition of the India-Africa height difference in child-level data. Open defecation, which is exceptionally widespread in India, can account for much or all of the excess stunting in India."
R29|Impact of education and health on poverty reduction: Monetary and non-monetary evidence from Fiji|Fiji signed the United Nations 2015 target of halving extreme poverty from its 1990 level, but like many developing countries it is facing challenges in meeting this goal. This paper presents the economic modelling using Fiji's Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2002/03 dataset to examine the economic and social factors crucial for poverty reduction. Two hypotheses are tested: first, we estimate the monetary effects of education at the aggregate and disaggregated returns to education (primary, secondary, tertiary levels) and by income quartiles, and second, test the non-monetary education and health factors as channels of impact promulgated as effects against poverty prevalence. The monetary results indicate that all income quartile households (i.e. lowest to highest) benefit from additional skills obtained through formal education. While those at the lowest income quartile in particular benefit the most from formal education, however it cannot sustainably prevent people with only primary education from falling into poverty. The results for non-monetary models show that education has a positive and significant influence on the tendency of the people to engage in health prevention activities and in acquiring good housing facilities.
R29|Should we design extended or straightforward questions for small stock when records are unavailable?|Data from two closely related questions in a survey on rabbits is analyzed in order to determine whether results from these two groups of questions would yield similar results about numbers of rabbits kept by a household. One question seeks a straightforward answer about numbers of rabbits kept while the other group of questions breaks the question into several questions seeking numbers of rabbits disaggregated by sex and age. This is prompted by the fact that record keeping is not a very common undertaking in a small holder agricultural setting in Kenya and that in their absence, farmers may not recall precisely how many rabbits they own unless a headcount is performed. A paired sample t test is implemented to detect any significant under-reporting of rabbit numbers based on numbers from the straightforward question which we hypothesize would yield numbers far less than what is on the farm. The results show that such under-reporting is not serious enough. The conclusion is that between the two question modes implemented in the survey, the straightforward question is suitable as it is time saving when the survey data required does not include numbers disaggregated by sex or age of rabbits.
R29|How much international variation in child height can sanitation explain?|Physical height is an important economic variable reflecting health and human capital. Puzzingly, however, differences in average height across developing countries are not well explained by differences in wealth. In particular, children in India are shorter, on average, than children in Africa who are poorer, on average, a paradox which is often called the Asian enigma. The primary contribution of this paper is to document that cross-country variation in sanitation statistically explains a large and important fraction of international height differences. Over a billion people worldwide and more than half of Indian households defecate openly without using a toilet or latrine, introducing germs into the environment that cause disease and stunt children's growth. I apply three complementary empirical strategies to Demographic and Health Survey data to identify the fraction due to sanitation: country-level regressions using collapsed DHS surveys; within-country analysis of differences between India's first and second DHS surveys; and econometric decomposition of the India-Africa height difference in child-level data. Open defecation, which is exceptionally widespread in India, accounts for much of the excess stunting in India.
R29|The new model of consumption of television content ?the user gains the advantage over the television provider (Nowy model konsumpcji tresci telewizyjnych ?uzytkownik zdobywa przewaga nad oferentem telewizji)|The primary purpose of the article that discusses trends in the consumption of e-books is to present the Polish market for these products. Considering that the market has started to develop only recently, it is very important that the consumption trends be analysed from the perspective of producers, intermediaries and consumers. Another aim of the analysis is to provide some indications as to how the Polish market may develop in the future.
R29|Economic Residential Segregation and Educational Achievements: Evidence from Chile|Using a database from Chile, we have tested empirically the effects of economic residential segregation on educational achievements. Our hypothesis is based on literatureâ€™s findings about segregationâ€™s negative impact on individualsâ€™ well being. We found that segregation has negative impacts. This result would have interesting policy implications and goes in the opposite directions of those investigationsâ€™ findings, which indicate that segregation has just negligible effects. Keywords: Segregation, Education, Selection Bias JEL codes: R20, R29
R29|Simultaneous Use of Formal Credit, Informal Loans and Dissaving: Exploring the Financial Behavior of Households in Argentina|In order to promote public policies aimed at enhancing financial inclusion, the Central Bank of Argentina makes periodic efforts to study, measure and analyze the processes of access and use of financial services by households in Argentina. The main objective of this paper is to use the information gathered by INDEC´s Permanent Household Survey to explore the use of credit (from both formal and informal financial providers) and dissaving to understand the determinants of household financial behavior. Using multivariate probit models, we document the effects of different demographic and socio-economic variables on the estimated probability of adopting certain financial behaviors. These models can also be a statistically appropriate way to analyze the simultaneous determination of different observed actions in households´ financial management. Thus, controlling for a set of exogenous variables while adding explanatory variables as endogenous regressors, we show that the inclusion of the latter is both statistically relevant and useful in identifying the existence of substitutability between some financial behaviors and of complementarity among others.
R29|Unequal Britain: How Real Are Regional Disparities?|Average earnings vary widely across the regions of Britain, a fact that has prompted many decades of policies aimed at reducing regional disparities. But as Henry Overman and Steve Gibbons demonstrate, such variation reveals little, especially if we ignore regional differences in the cost of living and availability of local amenities.
R29|Who Borrows and Who May Not Repay?|In this paper we use Household Budget Survey data to analyze the evolution of the household credit market in the Czech Republic over the period 2000â€“2008. While the share of households that borrow remained stable and below 40%, the amount of debt outstanding increased. We estimate a series of models of the determinants of borrowing. We next merge our data with the Statistics on Income and Living Conditions in 2005â€“2008, which contain direct information on repayment behavior, in order to test the validity of the standard debt burden measure as a predictor of default. We propose an alternative indicator â€“ the adjusted debt burden (ADB), defined as the ratio of loan repayments to discretionary income, constructed as net income minus the living minimum (the minimum cost of living for a given household composition as set by the Czech Statistical Office), which turns out to be a superior predictor of default risk. Limited by the data, we use a fairly broad concept of default, namely, the inability to make loan repayments on time. Based on the distribution of default risk across the levels of the adjusted debt burden, we suggest that a 30% ADB threshold should be used as the definition of overindebtedness, with an average default risk of 17%. Finally, we show that overindebtedness and local economic shocks are closely related, suggesting that default risk should be always considered in the context of regional economic conditions.
R29|Motives for Transfers from Parents to Children: Tests with First-Time Homeowners’ Data|There are good theoretical reasons why transfers from parents are likely to be important around the time of the first home purchase. Transactions costs associated with trading houses make people with increasing income paths prefer to buy a house that is more expensive than what matches their current income. This together with a down-payment constraint make some first-time house owners borrow to the limit and run down liquid assets at purchase thereby making them vulnerable to adverse income shocks. Intergenerational transfers can alleviate these constraints. Moreover, previous papers have suggested that transfers from parents to children are significant exactly around the time where children buy their first home. Using a panel data set issued from Danish administrative registers with information about wealth of a sample of first-time homeowners and their parents, we document that child and parent resources, house value as well as financial resources are correlated. We then go on to test if there are direct parental transfers targeted to the purchase of the house, and in case of an unemployment spell during the years after the purchase where children typically hold little liquid assets. We also test whether children consider parental wealth as part of their own precautionary savings. We do not find strong evidence of any of these hypotheses.
R29|Housing Subsidies and Work Incentives|Low-income housing assistance is part of the welfare state of all developed countries. The rest of the welfare state may cause work disincentives. In theory, housing assistance may also do so, but those disincentives may be blunted by its in-kind character and the way it is rationed. Rationing and selection make the estimation difficult; the most rigorous evidence from the United States suggests a loss of 10 to 20 cents in earnings per dollar of assistance. Less rigorous evidence from Australia suggests negative impacts in public housing but not housing benefit, while in Scandinavia researchers have as yet found no long-term duration of dependency.
R29|Diversification strategies in small farms in Italy| Using the data gathered by the Business Survey on Agriculture survey on a stratified random sample of Italian farm businesses below 4 European economic size units as a case study, this paper explores the diffusion of diversification strategies among small farms. The analysis has shown that more than a half of small farms is adopting some form of diversification. Small farms are more strongly involved in pluriactivity, while their involvement in broadening and deepening strategies appears only marginal. This latter result is partly due to the underevaluation of diversification caused by the lack of detailed statistical information about diversified activities used by farms, and, partly, due to the structural characteristics of small farms. Smaller farms are usually characterized by a lack of capital; as a consequence they can often redeploy only their labour off the farm. The characteristics associated with the targeted group of farms show that small farms using broadening strategies present much better economic results than conventional small farms. More specifically, farms using broadening strategies appear to be the winning ones in terms of net farm income per family working unit.

Se encuentra que aunque las fases de contraccio?n del ciclo afectan negativamente a todos los hogares, los ma?s vulnerables son aquellos que tienen un menor nivel de riqueza, mayor nu?mero de miembros, y jefes de hogar con niveles educativos medios. Tambie?n, en e?pocas de auge, los hogares ma?s pobres son ma?s vulnerables. En cuanto a las reacciones ante una cai?da de ingresos, es ma?s probable que los hogares utilicen mecanismos que reduzcan su nivel de consumo o aumenten su oferta laboral que mecanismos de suavizamiento del consumo, como el desahorro y el endeudamiento. Se encuentra que, con pocas excepciones, las respuestas de los hogares se ven afectadas por las caracteri?sticas de los hogares pero no por la fase del ciclo en la que se presenta el choque.
R29|The effects of mobility on neighbourhood social ties|This research examines the strength of people's ties with close neighbours and the sensitivity thereof to changes in residential mobility, access to modes of public and private transport, and changes in the availability of modern communications technologies using the German Socio-economic Panel Study (SOEP). All forms of mobility have increased over time and are negatively associated with visiting neighbours. With further increases in mobility, close neighbours may become less relevant. Nevertheless, presently the incidence of visits with neighbours is sizeable; in contrast to the frequent assertion in the literature that the neighbourhood is of no importance.
R29|Socio-Economic Characteristics of the Tall and not so Tall Women of India|New studies are increasingly appearing based on historical data across the world that better socio-economic status is associated with taller men and women. This study based on a recent Indian data analyses the variations in height among adult women. The main findings show that regional level differences in mean heights are prominent and contiguous regions show similar mean heights after controlling for socio-economic differences. Women from weaker socio-economic groups are shorter and so are women in rural areas though the rural-urban gap disappears after controlling for socio-economic variations. Women who have had at least one child during teenage have lower average heights but this difference is not statistically significant once differences in education are accounted for.
R29|Performance of heat pumps charged with R170/R290 mixture|In this study, thermodynamic performance of R170/R290 mixture is measured on a heat pump bench tester in an attempt to substitute R22. The bench tester is equipped with a commercial hermetic rotary compressor providing a nominal capacity of 3.5Â kW. All tests are conducted under the summer cooling and winter heating conditions of 7/45Â Â°C and -7/41Â Â°C in the evaporator and condenser, respectively. During the tests, the composition in R170/R290 mixture is varied from 0% to 10% with an interval of 2%. Test results show that the coefficient of performance (COP) and capacity of R290 are up to 15.4% higher and 7.5% lower, respectively than those of R22 for two conditions. For R170/R290 mixture, the COP decreases and the capacity increases with an increase in the composition of R170. The mixture of R170/R290 mixture at 4%/96% composition shows the similar capacity and COP as those of R22. For the mixture, the compressor discharge temperature is 17-28Â Â°C lower than that of R22. For R170/R290 mixture, there is no problem with mineral oil since the mixture is composed of hydrocarbons. The amount of charge is reduced up to 58% as compared to R22. Overall, R170/R290 mixture is a good long term [`]drop-in' candidate from the view point of energy efficiency and greenhouse warming to replace R22 in residential air-conditioners and heat pumps.
R29|Happiness, Ideology and Crime in Argentine Cities|This paper uses self-reported data on victimization, subjective well being and ideology for a panel of individuals living in six Argentine cities. While no relationship is found between happiness and victimization experiences, a correlation is documented, however, between victimization experience and changes in ideological positions. Specifically, individuals who are the victims of crime are subsequently more likely than non-victims to state that inequality is high in Argentina and that the appropriate measure to reduce crime is to become less punitive (demanding lower penalties for the same crime).
