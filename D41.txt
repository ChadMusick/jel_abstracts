D41|Capacity Mechanisms and the Technology Mix in Competitive Electricity Markets|Capacity mechanisms are increasingly used in electricity market design around the world yet their role remains hotly debated. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark model of a capacity mechanism in a competitive electricity market with many different generation technologies. We consider two policy instruments, a wholesale price cap and a capacity payment, and show which combinations of these instruments induce socially-optimal investment by the market. Changing the price cap or capacity payment affects investment only in peak generation plant, with no equilibrium impact on baseload or mid-merit plant. We obtain a rationale for a capacity mechanism based on the internalization of a system-cost externality – even where the price cap is set at the value of lost load. In extensions, we show how increasing renewables penetration enhances the need for a capacity mechanism, and outline an optimal design of a strategic reserve with a discriminatory capacity payment.
D41|Does competition increase pass-through?|How does market power affect the rate of pass-through from marginal cost to the market price? A standard intuition is that more competition makes prices more “cost-reflective” and thus raises cost pass-through. This paper shows that this intuition is sensitive to the common assumption in the literature that firms’ marginal costs are constant. If firms have even modestly increasing marginal costs, more intense competition actually reduces pass through. These results apply to the “normal” case where pass-through is less than 100%. They have implications for competition policy and environmental regulation.
D41|Availability of high-quality liquid assets and monetary policy operations: an analysis for the euro area|This paper provides an overview of supply and demand factors influencing the availability of euro-denominated debt instruments that qualify as high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in the euro area. The paper estimates the supply of HQLA issued by the public and private sectors as well as the aggregated impact of Eurosystem monetary policy operations on the amount and composition of HQLA held by banks and other economic agents. An assessment of the main demand factors is also presented. Finally, the paper provides some insights into the interaction with and implications for the Eurosystem monetary policy implementation framework in the longer run.

D41|Welfare effects of certification under latent adverse selection|"Asymmetric information is a classic example of market failure that undermines the efficiency associated with perfectly competitive market outcomes: the ""lemons"" market. Credible certification, that substantiates unobservable characteristics of products that consumers value, is often considered a potential solution to such market failure. This paper examines welfare effects of certification in markets in which there is asymmetric information, but without an adverse selection problem. We analyze the market equilibrium when the certification technology becomes available and contrast this with the equilibrium without certification. We find that despite an improvement in allocative efficiency, overall welfare may decrease due to the possibility of certification when such certification is either costly or inaccurate. In fact, most of these results are not derived from the direct welfare cost of certification, but rather from certification's effect on the market(s)."
D41|Production Externalities and Investment Caps: a Welfare Analysis under Uncertainty|In markets where production has adverse externalities, policy makers may wish to increase welfare by imposing a cap on market entries. In this paper, we examine the implications that the cap has on the firms’ investment equilibrium policy and on social welfare in the presence of market uncertainty. In contrast with previous literature, we explicitly model the present externality and then let the social planner choose the cap level maximizing welfare. We find that: i) if the consideration of the option value triggers investment at price above the social marginal cost of production, then it is optimal to have no cap at all; ii) otherwise, the cap should be set on the current market quantity and a ban on further market entries should be announced.
D41|Product Differentiation and Demand Elasticity|This paper argues that product differentiation is compatible with perfect competition under free entry and exit and small firm size relative to size of market. Despite Chamberlin’s view, monopolistic competitors are price takers, even though each firm’s product has no perfect substitute. There is a difference between perfect competition with product homogeneity and perfect competition with differentiated products, however. Advertising can pay off with differentiated products because products have separate identities—and price depends on quality—even though firms are price takers for any given quality. A differentiated oligopoly may resemble monopolistic competition a la Chamberlin in some ways.
D41|An Equilibrium Model of the Market for Bitcoin Mining|We propose a model which uses the Bitcoin/US dollar exchange rate to predict the computing power of the Bitcoin network. We show that free entry places an upper-bound on mining revenues and we devise a structural framework to measure its value. Calibrating the model’s parameters allows us to accurately forecast the evolution of the network computing power over time. We establish the accuracy of the model through out-of-sample tests and investigation of the entry rule.
D41|How EU Markets Became More Competitive Than US Markets: A Study of Institutional Drift|Many European markets today appear more competitive than their American counterparts. We document this surprising reversal of history and propose an explanation. Our model of political support predicts that a supranational regulator enforces free markets beyond the preferences of any individual country. We find that European institutions are indeed more independent and enforce competition more strongly than any individual country ever did. Countries with ex-ante weaker institutions benefit more from the delegation of competition policy to the EU level. Our model also explains why political and lobbying expenditures have increased more in America than in Europe.
D41|Intermittent electric generation technologies and smart meters: substitutes or complements|We model a simplified electric market with producers using either conventional or intermittent electric generators and consumers equipped with either smart or traditional meters. We calculate the investment in intermittent technologies and smart meters in a social optimum. We find that the optimal penetration of smart meters is increasing in the volatility of the electric spot price. As a consequence, intermittent capacities and smart-meters are complement, only if the correlation existing between intermittent energy and demand is negative or if the capacity of intermittent generators is large enough. Otherwise, larger intermittent capacities actually help to decrease the volatility of the electric spot price, making smart-meters less useful. We also give a numeral application, calibrated to represent the French electric market in 2016 and policy objective for 2030. We show in particular that a general adoption of smart meters would be optimal only if the cost of installing and operating smart meters was unrealistically low.
D41|How EU Markets Became More Competitive Than US Markets: A Study of Institutional Drift|Until the 1990's, US markets were more competitive than European markets. Today, European markets have lower concentration, lower excess profits and lower regulatory barriers to entry. We document this surprising outcome and propose an explanation using a model of political support. Politicians care about consumer welfare but also enjoy retaining control over industrial policy. We show that politicians from different countries who set up a common regulator will make it more independent and more pro-competition than the national ones it replaces. Our comparative analysis of antitrust policy reveals strong support for this and other predictions of the model.
D41|Long Run Trends and Fluctuations In Cotton Prices|One revelation from the 2008 Global Financial Crisis was the fragility of models and assumptions based on samples too short to include periods of high volatility, and this study attempts to remedy that short-coming for USDA’s development of long run cotton price projections. Real cotton prices have fallen significantly since 1900, but statistical verification of the presence of a long-run downward trend has proven elusive. Cotton price volatility has varied widely over the last 226 years, largely correlated with macroeconomic instability. Cotton’s period of greatest instability—during the U.S. Civil War—was primarily driven by cotton-specific trade and production disruptions, but since the Civil War, cotton volatility has largely coincided with broader commodity price volatility. One of cotton’s most volatility\e episodes since 18th century occurred over 2009-12, and was in part a consequence of nearly unprecedented macroeconomic instability and, in part due to factors specific to cotton markets. Looking ahead, cotton price volatility over 2018-27 is likely to be greater than the volatility experienced during 2016-17, when volatility was unusually low, likely reduced by China’s large sales from its National Reserve.
D41|Experimental evidence on tax salience and tax incidence|Although a basic theoretical principle in public economics assumes that individuals optimize fully with respect to the introduction of a tax, a growing body of research is proving that several heuristics are in place when people take decisions. We re‐examine the well known liability side equivalence principle in the light of the concept of salience. While these two topics have been extensively investigated in isolation, this paper innovates on the previous literature in that it focuses on their joint effects. Is tax incidence dependent on whether the subjects face a salient rather than a nonsalient tax? Does the salience of a tax exert a different effect depending on who is legally committed to bear the tax burden? We address these questions through a laboratory experiment in which one unit of a fictitious good is being traded through a double‐auction market institution. Based on a panel data analysis, our contribution shows that point of collection matters and determines the economic incidence of tax. Additionally, we find that the joint effect of salience and statutory incidence does not alter the informative efficiency, but has a positive effect on buyers’ allocational efficiency when the tax is levied on sellers.
D41|Price opinion data in subsidized economies: Empirical evidence from Iraq|Distortions resulting from consumption subsidies or rationing systems often lead welfare analysts to use market price opinions, where household budget survey respondents are asked to provide their opinions of equivalent market prices of subsidized or rationed goods, to value consumption of the rationed goods. This is because prices paid by households for rationed goods do not represent the true marginal utility from consumption of these goods. This is the case in household budget surveys undertaken in Iraq, for example, where rationed food items received through the Public Distribution System are valued at market prices using price opinion data rather than at official prices facing households. Despite the fact that most Living Standards Measurement Surveys conducted in countries that maintain consumption subsidies collect market price opinions, little evidence exists to support the notion that respondent opinions on market prices adequately approximate shadow prices of subsidized or rationed commodities. This paper explores the adequacy of market price opinions of subsidized food commodities using data from Iraq. The evidence presented here suggests that price opinions of subsidized food commodities are influenced by the importance of the subsidy in the household economy - a reflection of household welfare levels and preferences. This leads to the conclusion that price opinion data for subsidized goods distorts the estimated transfer value of the PDS food subsidy and biases welfare analysis, particularly affecting the ability to monitor trends over time.
D41|The existence of the Miyazaki-Wilson-Spence equilibrium with continuous type distributions|We prove the existence of an equilibrium in competitive markets with adverse selection in the sense of Miyazaki (1977), Wilson (1977), and Spence (1978) when the distribution of unobservable risk types is continuous. Our proof leverages the finite-type proof in Spence (1978) and a limiting argument akin to Hellwig (2007)'s study of optimal taxation.
D41|Contingent contracts in banking: Insurance or risk magnification?|We examine whether the economy can be insured against banking crises with deposit and loan contracts contingent on macroeconomic shocks. We study banking competition and show that the private sector insures the banking system through such contracts, and banking crises are avoided, provided that failed banks are not bailed out. When risks are large, banks may shift part of them to depositors. In contrast, when banks are bailed out by the next generation, depositors receive non-contingent contracts with high interest rates, while entrepreneurs obtain loan contracts that demand high repayment in good times and low repayment in bad times. As a result, the present generation overinvests, and banks generate large macroeconomic risks for future generations, even if the underlying productivity risk is small or zero. We conclude that a joint policy package of orderly default procedures and contingent contracts is a promising way to reduce the threat of a fragile banking system.
D41|Transparency aversion and insurance market equilibria|Telemonitoring devices can be used to screen consumers' characteristics and mitigate information asymmetries that lead to adverse selection in insurance markets. However, some consumers value their privacy and dislike sharing private information with insurers. In the second-best efficient Wilson-Miyazaki-Spence framework, we allow for consumers to reveal their risk type for an individual subjective cost and show analytically how this affects insurance market equilibria as well as utilitarian social welfare. Our analysis shows that the choice of information disclosure with respect to revelation of their risk type can substitute deductibles for consumers whose transparency aversion is sufficiently low. This can lead to a Pareto improvement of social welfare and a Pareto efficient market allocation. However, if all consumers are offered cross-subsidizing contracts, the introduction of a transparency contract decreases or even eliminates cross-subsidies. Given the prior existence of a WMS equilibrium, utility is shifted from individuals who do not reveal their private information to those who choose to reveal. Our analysis provides a theoretical foundation for the discussion on consumer protection in the context of digitalization. It shows that new technologies bring new ways to challenge crosssubsidization in insurance markets and stresses the negative externalities that digitalization has on consumers who are not willing to take part in this development.
D41|Efficiency and dependency in a network of linked permit markets|We model a network of linked permit markets to examine efficiency and dependencies between the markets in a competitive equilibrium. Links enable the participants of one emissions trading system to use the permits of another system. To improve the cost-efficiency of the international policy architecture, the Paris climate agreement set out a framework for linking local policies. International trade in permits reduces costs by merging markets, but in a large network it is generally not obvious which markets end up linked in the equilibrium. Also, indirect links might allow foreign regulators to undermine domestic policy outcomes. We apply graph theory to study dependencies between markets and to determine how the network is partitioned into separate market areas. Our main theorem characterizes the dependency structure of the equilibrium in an exogenous trading network. We show that markets merge when they are connected by a particular pattern of links. The results help to identify potential sources of both cost reductions and foreign interference, and to secure the efficiency of climate change policies.

D41|Cournot, Bertrand or Chamberlin: Toward a reconciliation|The purpose of this paper is to provide a comparison of three types of competition in a differentiated industry: Cournot, Bertrand, and monopolistic competition. This is accomplished in an economy involving one sector and a population of consumers endowed with separable preferences and a given number of labor units. When firms are free to enter the market, monopolistically competitive firms charge lower prices than oligopolistic firms, while the mass of varieties provided by the market is smaller under the former than the latter. If the economy is sufficiently large, Cournot, Bertrand and Chamberlin solutions converge toward the same market outcome, which may be a competitive or a monopolistically competitive equilibrium, depending on the nature of preferences<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D41|Behavioral Heterogeneity: Pareto Distributions of Homothetic Preference Scales and Aggregate Expenditures Income Elasticities|"We evaluate the income elasticity of the aggregate budget share spent on a sub-group of commodities, in a competitive framework, by a continuum of agents having the same income, but heterogeneous behavior described by an ""homothetic preferences scaling factor"" having a bounded Pareto distribution in the population. If individual budget share increases globally significantly in the limit from low to large incomes, aggregate budget share is locally increasing with medium range incomes when the logarithm of the heterogeneity factor has an increasing (exponential) density with a large support. Aggregate income elasticity converges to that exponential density parameter when its support becomes infinitely large. Symmetric results hold in the decreasing case. Applications are made to market expenditures, wealth effects on portfolio choice with many risky assets, concave expenditures, that are compatible with standard (expected) utility maximization or other ""behavioral"" decision making processes."
D41|Multiproduct trading with a common agent under complete information: Existence and characterization of Nash equilibrium|This paper focuses on oligopolistic markets in which indivisible goods are sold by multiproduct firms to a continuum of homogeneous buyers, with measure normalized to one, who have preferences over bundles of products. By analyzing a kind of extended contract schedule (mixed bundling prices), the paper shows that pure strategy efficient equilibria always exist in such settings. While inefficient equilibria may exist, this can be ruled out by refining the equilibrium correspondence using the concept of subgame perfect Strong equilibrium. In addition, the paper shows that each principal's set of equilibrium contracts of minimum cardinality may contain at least three offers. When the social surplus function is monotone and unit costs are constant, only two offers are required at the equilibrium outcome.
D41|Renewable energy sources in Italy: Sectorial intensity and effects on earnings|The literature on renewable energy sources (RES) does not provide a shared methodology to measure the sectorial intensity of production linked to RES. Furthermore, empirical evidence on the relationship between RES sectorial intensity and workers’ earnings is scant. The aim of this paper is to fill in these literature gaps providing, on the one hand, an original microdata-based methodology to measure the RES sectorial intensity, and, on the other hand, estimating, through panel data techniques, the relationship between RES sectorial intensity and earnings for a representative sample of Italian workers in the period 2002–2009. Focusing on the case of Italy in the first decade of the 21th century is very relevant given that in that period Italy promoted one of the most generous renewable support schemes worldwide. The main findings are the following: i) the RES sectorial intensity in Italy largely increased in 2008–2009; ii) on average, the RES sectorial intensity does not affect earnings levels; iii) remarkably, a clear skill-premium effect emerges when the RES sectorial intensity increases.
D41|Screening and Adverse Selection in Frictional Markets|We incorporate a search-theoretic model of imperfect competition into a standard model of asymmetric information with unrestricted contracts. We characterize the unique equilibrium and use our characterization to explore the interaction between adverse selection, screening, and imperfect competition. We show that the relationship between an agent’s type, the quantity he trades, and the price he pays is jointly determined by the severity of adverse selection and the concentration of market power. Therefore, quantifying the effects of adverse selection requires controlling for market structure. We also show that increasing competition and reducing informational asymmetries can decrease welfare.

D41|Insight into the Hungarian Automotive Industry in International Comparison|The paper examines the features of the Hungarian automotive industry1 in international comparison, in the form of a descriptive analysis. The comparison focuses primarily on the automotive industry of the Visegrád region, Germany and Austria, as well as on processes in the EU. The analysis reviews the academic background of the sector, and then provides an insight into the history of the automotive industry of the Visegrád region, focusing on the socialist past of the automotive industry and the consequences thereof. In the last part of the analysis, we compare contemporary Hungarian industry trends with the features of it in the Visegrád countries and Europe, based on the statistics of Eurostat, by company size and ownership structure, as well as on the corporate income tax return database of the Hungarian tax authority (NAV). The main conclusion of the paper is that the automotive industry shows outstanding productivity within the Hungarian national economy, but on the other hand, the SMEs of the sector are less productive than large enterprises and this difference is the highest in Hungary within the region. In order to change the situation, large foreign enterprises should outsource their higher value added activity in the region and raise wages accordingly, and on the other hand, it would be necessary to strengthen and advance Hungarianowned SMEs within the value chain.
D41|The role of intellectual capital in building a competitive advantage by enterprises from the transport, shipping and logistics industry (TSL)|The modern economy is characterized by use changes. They appear very quickly and unexpectedly. This is a situation which impedes the functioning of companies and it is a challenge for the people managing them. They have to meet new challenges and adapt to changing competitive conditions, which are associated with the processes of globalization and knowledge-based economy. Therefore, the aim of this article is to define the role of intellectual capital in companies with TSL branch in building competitive advantage. In addition, the author attempts to assess the facts of intellectual capital management in the surveyed enterprises and it will identify the barriers that accompany this process. Founded research objectives will be realized an analysis of available sources of theoretical and conducted by the author, in 2016 (100 companies with TSL from Baltic Sea Region). The study was prepared as a general survey, which describes the company and individual interviews conducted with representatives of the boards of companies and their managers (for a total of 400 people). After analyzing all the material you see the role of intellectual capital in building a competitive advantage in the surveyed entities. Especially in activities related to the improvement of the quality of services / products and the efficiency of employees. It also turned out that business owners know how important it is for them the capital and they also know the barrier implementation of this concept - the main are: the capital is not their property.
D41|Perfect Public Offering: A Process to Provide Complete Ownership & Direction of Businesses to the Entire Public|A process for a business to exclusively and completely sell its shares to a 501(c)3 charity to transfer full ownership & direction of the business to the entire public. Nonprofit universities are charities well positioned to completely own & operate businesses: to produce and allocate their goods and services to society efficiently, effectively and in harmony with the best interests of the entire public, especially when employees of acquired businesses become faculty of the university; When work becomes education in motion; When operating costs of the university and the acquired businesses are subsidized by the goods, services, amenities, and processes of the university and the businesses it acquires; And when socioeconomic order is naturally regulated via the infrastructures of universities. The social and economic efficiency and effectiveness of businesses completely owned and operated by nonprofit universities induce logic and peer-pressures which encourage global assimilation. The mechanism relies on an iterated prisoner’s dilemma scenario established amongst all businesses, created by global externalities produced from the localized interactions of an initial group of businesses being completely acquired by a nonprofit university, which uses an internet platform to localize their social and economic information and activities to help concentrate public understanding, trust and support to itself and the businesses, which initially join to benefit being first within their industry to be acquired. [1] The result, efficiently and effectively produces and allocates goods, services, knowledge, resources, jobs, and opportunities amongst society; Establishes Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs; And naturally resolves many socioeconomic issues.
D41|Explaining Electricity Forward Premiums - Evidence for the Weather Uncertainty Effect|With the increasing share of volatile renewable energies, weather prediction becomes more important to electricity markets. The weather-driven uncertainty of renewable forecast errors could have price increasing impacts. This research sets up an analytic model to show that the day-ahead optimal bidding under uncertain renewable production is below the expected production and thus price increasing. In a second step, the price increasing effect on forward premiums by specific weather types and their renewable production uncertainty is proved via empirical methods. Weather types are identified in which renewable production is harder to predict. The findings connect weather dependent renewable forecast uncertainty to forward premiums and support the consideration of weather types in price forecasting models.
D41|Economic Analysis of Price Premiums in the Presence of Non-convexities - Evidence from German Electricity Markets|Analyzing price data from sequential German electricity markets, namely the day-ahead and intraday auction, a puzzling but apparently systematic pattern of price premiums can be identified. The price premiums are highly correlated with the underlying demand profile. As there is evidence that widespread models for electricity forward premiums are not applicable to the market dynamics under analysis, a theoretical model is developed within this article which reveals that non-convexities in only a subset of sequential markets with differing product granularity may cause systematic price premiums at equilibrium. These price premiums may be bidirectional and reflect a value for additional short-term power supply system flexibility.
D41|The Provision of Collective Goods Through a Social Division of Labour|This paper develops a general equilibrium framework in which collective goods are provided by specialised professionals as part of an endogenously emerging social division of labour. It merges an economy with collective goods with the model of a private-goods market economy with an endogenously emerging social division of labour. Our approach is founded on the notion of a consumer-producer who endogenously select a profession, thereby inducing an endogenous social division of labour. Natural applications are the presence of non-tradables in production, the effects of education on productive abilities, and the market system itself as an implementation of the price mechanism. For an appropriately generalised notion of valuation equilibrium, we prove the two fundamental theorems of welfare economics under very general conditions, notably allowing for incomplete, non-monotonic, and non-transitive preferences. We also incorporate Adam Smith's principle of increasing returns to specialisation and investigate its effects on equilibrium prices.
D41|Determinants of Net Entry and Exit in Agriculture Sector: A Case Study of US for 1990-2002|This empirical investigate focuses on determinants of Net Entry and Exit in US agriculture sector for 1990-2002. We find that net entry is positively related to Labor Factor Productivity in agriculture (LFP) and Aggregate Agricultural Output (AAO), and negatively related to GDP Per Capita (GDP). The latter supports the assertion that net entry is inversely related to GDP--a counter-cyclical activity. Variables? coefficients are: +3.24 (LFP), +4.48 (AAO) and -0.60 (GDP). Whereas, P value for LFP approximates ?highly significant? level (0.0019), AAO?s is less significant (0.0814) and GDP?s is insignificant (0.0264). We also considered the effects of the cost of capital and cost of borrowing in the Net Entry model. We omitted them as they showed negligible and insignificant effects. Since determinants of net entry depend on combined factors that influence both entry and exit, it is plausible that they differ for exit. Thereby, we consider a separate model for Exit. The independent variables for this model encompass: Farm Household Income (FHY), number of large establishments with 1,000 or more employees (LARGE) and GDP per capita. We show that Exit rates in our data are negatively related to both Farm Household Income and GDP, with respective coefficient of - 0.07 and -1.12. Whereas LARGE has a coefficient of + 0.46; hence accounts for 46% of establishments? exits in our sample, with high statistical significance (P= 0.0019). The P value for FHY (0.266) shows statistical weakness. For GDP per capita, P=0.006, approximates the ?significant? level. Accordingly, the establishment size is the most influential variable in the model. Overall our regressions capture most variations in their Dependent Variables. R2 for Net Entry estimation is 0.87 (F=16.03) and 0.78 (F=10.71) for the Exit Model. The residual values are quite low in both estimations. This research shows that presence of large firms within the agriculture sector in US leads to higher establishments? exit rates?an endogenous hinder to competition, ceteris paribus. As in any empirical exercise, our results could be affected by omitted variables and data aggregation biases. Repeated validation of this empirical exercise that would stand to alternative specifications would affirm the endogeneity of potential threat to competition in a sector that supports the model of Perfect Competition. CR4s for six major US agriculture sectors range 55%-93%, all above 45%, necessary for a competitive structure. With our investigative modeling and regression results, we question the stylized facts of the theory of Perfect Competition.
D41|Competition, firm size and returns to skills: Evidence from currency shocks and market liberalisations|The authors investigate the impact of exogenous product market competition shocks on returns to skills in Italy using a new longitudinal dataset on individual working histories. This impact is identified using three exogenous shocks affecting competition: the unforeseen devaluation of the Lira in 1992, its return to a fixed exchange regime in 1996 and the market liberalisation in the utility and transport sectors in the late 1990s-early 2000s. This paper extends the analysis of Guadalupe (2007) by investigating how firm heterogeneity and shocks of different types and signs affect the impact of competition on skill premia. The authors find that opposite shocks have opposite effects: an increase (resp. decrease) in international competition increases (resp. decreases) returns to skills. Moreover, international shocks have greater effects on medium-sized firms, while domestic liberalisation shocks have greater effects on large incumbents previously sheltered from any entry threat.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D41|Designing a strategyproof spot market mechanism with many traders: twenty-two steps to Walrasian equilibrium|Abstract To prove their Walrasian equilibrium existence theorem, Arrow and Debreu (Econometrica 22(3):265–290, 1954) devised an abstract economy that Shapley and Shubik (J Polit Econ 85:937–968, 1977) criticized as a market game because, especially with untrustworthy traders, it fails to determine a credible outcome away from equilibrium. All this earlier work also postulated a Walrasian auctioneer with complete information about traders’ preferences and endowments. To ensure credible outcomes, even in disequilibrium, warehousing is introduced into a multistage market game. To achieve Walrasian outcomes in a large economy with incomplete information, even about traders’ endowments, a strategyproof demand revelation mechanism is considered and then extended to include warehousing.
D41|Existence of equilibria in exhaustible resource markets with economies of scale and inventories|Abstract The paper proves the existence of equilibrium in non-renewable resource markets when extraction costs are non-convex and resource storage is possible. Inventories flatten the consumption path and eliminate price jumps at the end of the extraction period, so that market equilibrium becomes possible. We distinguish between two types of solutions, one with immediate and one with delayed buildup of inventories. For both cases, we do not only characterize potential optimal paths but also show that equilibria actually exist under fairly general conditions. It is found that optimum resource extraction involves increasing quantities over a period of time. What is generally interpreted as an indicator of increasing resource abundance is thus perfectly compatible with constant resource stocks.
D41|Financial Implications of Seasonal Variability in Demand for Tourism Services (A Draft)| Using Jensen’s inequality (and its mathematical generalization), this contribution shows how increased seasonal (periodic) variability of demand for tourism services can increase the annual profit of a tourism enterprise and the producers’ surplus of a corresponding competitive segment of the tourism industry experiencing this increased variability. It identifies conditions which result in these effects being magnified and takes account of the fact that a tourism business’ supply of services is often subject to capacity utilization constraints. A novel feature is that allowance is made for the possibility that variations in the market demand for tourism services may alter the prices of factors of production.

A novel feature is that allowance is made for the possibility that variations in the market demand for tourism services may alter the prices of factors of production. Examples of seasonal variability in the prices for tourism services are provided. Furthermore, the importance of this contribution is related to the available scholarly literature about the financial consequences of seasonal variability in the demand for tourism services.
D41|Banking Competition and Financial Stability: Evidence from CIS Countries|The study provides empirical analysis of the cross-country relationship between a direct measure of competitive conduct of banking system and financial system in CIS countries during the period from 2001 to 2013. We determine the level of banking competition by using Panzar and Rosse H-statistic. Estimation results from Logit probability analysis reveal that the level of competition does not significantly affect the probability of banking crisis in such countries. However, a number of macroeconomic and institutional factors have a significant influence in financial stability. According to empirical results, higher inflation increases the probability of a banking crisis. On the other hand, credit growth decreases the probability of banking crisis in the investigated countries. These results are robust to the methodology when the interaction of concentration and h-statistic is used. The institutional factors have significant influence on preventing banking crises. Specifically, improvement in government effectiveness decreases the probability of banking crisis.
D41|Does Competition Solve the Hold-up Problem?|" type=""main"" xml:id=""ecca12170-abs-0001""> In an environment in which heterogeneous buyers and sellers undertake ex ante investments, the presence of market competition for matches provides incentives for investment but may leave inefficiencies, namely hold-up and coordination problems. This paper shows, using an explicitly non-cooperative model, that when matching is assortative and investments precede market competition, buyers' investments are constrained efficient while sellers marginally underinvest with respect to what would be constrained efficient. However, the overall extent of this inefficiency may be large. Multiple equilibria may arise; one equilibrium is characterized by efficient matches, but there can be additional equilibria with coordination failures."
D41|PROFIT ORIENTED BUSINESSES vs SERVICES PROVIDING BUSINESSES|The tourism sector is a major component of the economy, as a sector as well as an entrance factor towards all the other economic activities. This study is organized in an empirical form, together with a review of specialized literature, through the studying of the possible correlations between the tourism sector's performance and the importance of forming an organization culture within this sector. To answer the paper's purpose, the following research techniques have been used: content analysis of the research carried out, as well statistical methods for the analysis of data and the interpretation of results. The study's results indicate that, despite the field's importance being uncontestable, the specialized literature in our country, at least, does not dedicate any paper towards the research of tourism enterprises' organizational culture. There are some references to the hospitality industry, meaning hotels and public nutrition, but a study on the organization culture of travel agencies has not yet been carried out. It has come to the conclusion that the emancipation of consumers can stimulate competition, increase efficiency, as well as rethinking the strategies of tourism-sector firms.
D41|La competencia y la eficiencia en la banca colombiana|"""El libro presenta, en primer lugar, un marco teórico y una revisión exhaustiva de la literatura internacional y colombiana acerca de la relación entre concentración y competencia en la banca, así como de los trabajos empíricos que comparan la eficiencia del sector en Colombia con la de otros países. En segundo lugar, Fedesarrollo hace sus propios ejercicios descriptivos y econométricos para aportar al estudio de la dinámica de la competencia, y de los logros y retos de la eficiencia en la prestación de los servicios financieros en Colombia. Del análisis teórico, destacamos la controversia con el paradigma EstructuraConducta- Desempeño el cual defiende la tesis de que la concentración en un mercado se traduce en una menor eficiencia y una reducción del bienestar social. La escuela de Chicago controvierte esa tesis mostrando que la concentración puede ser el resultado de la eficiencia y que se requiere un análisis de la conducta y las estrategias de las entidades grandes y/o conglomerados, y establecer si usan su poder de mercado en contra de los competidores y los consumidores. De forma complementaria, hay que señalar que el sector financiero, debido a la especificidad de sus funciones, tiene barreras a la entrada que le son connaturales. En este informe se evalúa si la industria bancaria en Colombia ha mantenido un nivel razonable de competencia con mejoras en su eficiencia y si ha diversificado los servicios bancarios ofrecidos a los usuarios, además de avanzar en su cobertura poblacional (inclusión financiera). Se analiza el período 1995-2014, el cual incluye un evento de crisis financiera, 1998-2001, y otros dos de expansión de la banca, principalmente privada, que cubren de 1996 a 1997 y de 2002 a 2014, sub-períodos en los que la cartera crece a tasas anuales que superan las del PIB, excepto para 2009, año en que la crisis financiera internacional golpeó con fuerza a la economía colombiana."""
D41|Impact of network payment schemes on transmission expansion planning with variable renewable generation|A large number of studies have dealt with the Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) problem. However, few investigations have focused on analyzing the impacts of network payment schemes on network configuration and the benefits/losses distribution among the participants in electricity markets. In this paper, we propose a multi-annual transmission expansion planning model considering four different network payment schemes to finance the construction of new transmission lines, seeking to reduce the total system costs. Wind and solar power generation are included in the model taking into account their variability. The proposed models are reformulated as Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems. We use seven performance metrics related with congestion, nodal prices and generator benefits, among others, to evaluate the effect of each payment scheme. A realistic case study based on the main power system in Chile is analyzed to illustrate the proposed models. It is shown that integrating line cost-recovering equations into the TEP model may result into a more realistic and less congested power network. Also, total system cost is highly related with transmission tariff discrimination. In that way, tariffs with high location dependence perform better in the case studied, the Chilean power system.
D41|Monotone strategyproofness|We propose a way to compare the extent of preference misrepresentation between two strategies. We define a preference revelation mechanism to be monotone strategyproof if declaring a “more truthful” preference ordering dominates (with respect to the true preferences) declaring a “less truthful” preference ordering. Our main result states that a mechanism is strategyproof if, and only if, it is monotone strategyproof. This result holds for any deterministic social choice function on any domain; for probabilistic social choice functions it holds under a mild assumption on the domain.
D41|Over-the-counter markets vs. double auctions: A comparative experimental study|We study an electronic over-the-counter (OTC) market, in which each agent looks for the best counterpart through bilateral negotiations. We compare its performance with the standard electronic double-auction (DA) market, in which traders post their quotes publicly. We show that the lack of information in the OTC market induces an efficiency loss, characterized by an average closing price below the competitive price and by a traded quantity below the competitive quantity. We further test the robustness of these findings when exogenous shocks modify the competitive equilibrium. Among other things, we show that supply shocks increasing the competitive quantity improve OTC’s efficiency.
D41|Precautionary Storage in Electricity Markets|As renewable energy depends on meteorological shocks and is non-controllable, the overall energy production becomes riskier with the rising renewable share. Although this has led to a renewed interest in storage technologies, not much consideration has been given to energy storage due to precautionary motives. In our study, we look at to what extent a convex marginal utility (prudence) and a convex marginal cost (frugality) can spur precautionary energy storage. We set up a simple theoretical model of energy consumption and production with intermittent renewable sources, dispatchable systems, and energy storage. First, we characterize the optimum and demonstrate how prudence and frugality can lead to higher levels of energy storage. By applying our findings to perfectly competitive markets, we further show that prudence and frugality increase the market energy price through higher demand for energy storage and decrease price volatility. Our analysis can have implications for inventory decisions in various other industries where firms face capacity constraints and are exposed to production risks.
D41|The Causes of Household Bankruptcy: The Interaction of Income Shocks and Balance Sheets|We examine how household balance sheets and income statements interact to affect bankruptcy decisions following an exogenous income shock. For identification, we exploit government payments in one but not any other Canadian province that varied exogenously based on family size. Receiving a larger income shock from the payment (relative to household income) reduces the count of bankruptcies, with fewer remaining filers having higher net balance sheet benefits of bankruptcy (unsecured debt discharged minus liquidated assets forgone). Receiving an income shock thus causes households that would receive lower net balance sheet benefits under bankruptcy law to select out of bankruptcy.
D41|Market Power and Collusion on Interconnection Phone Market in Tunisia : What Lessons from International Experiences|"We try in this paper to characterize the state of mobile phone market in Tunisia. Our study is based on a survey of foreign experience (Europe) in detecting collusive behavior and a comparison of the critical threshold of collusion between operators in developing countries like Tunisia. The market power is estimated based on the work of Parker Roller (1997) and the assumption of ""Balanced Calling Pattern"". We use then the model of Friedman (1971) to compare the critical threshold of collusion. We show that the “conduct parameter” measuring the intensity of competition is not null during the period 1993-2011. Results show also that collusion is easier on the Tunisian market that on the Algerian, Jordanian, or Moroccan one."

Although this has led to a renewed interest in storage technologies, not much consideration has been given to energy storage due to precautionary motives. In our study, we look at to what extent a convex marginal utility (prudence) and a convex marginal cost (frugality) can spur precautionary energy storage. We set up a simple theoretical model of energy consumption and production with intermittent renewable sources, dispatchable thermal systems, and energy storage. First, we characterize the optimum and demonstrate how prudence and frugality can lead to higher levels of energy storage. By applying our findings to perfectly competitive markets, we further show that prudence and frugality increase the market energy price through higher demand for energy storage and decrease price volatility. The results present important lessons about the direct and indirect impacts precautionary motives can have on electricity prices and energy generation decisions.
D41|The sectorial intensity of production of renewable energy sources in Italy:measurement and effects on earnings|The literature on renewable energy sources (RES) does not provide a shared methodology to measure the sectorial intensity of production linked to RES. Furthermore, empirical evidence on the relationship between RES intensity of production and workersâ€™ earnings is scant. The aim of this paper is to fill in these literature gaps providing, on the one hand, an original microdata-based methodology to measure the RES sectorial intensity of production, and, on the other hand, estimating, through panel data techniques, the relationship between RES sectorial intensity of production and earnings for a representative sample of Italian workers in the period 2002-2009. Focusing on the case of Italy in the first decade of the 21th century is very relevant given that in that period Italy promoted one of the most generous renewable support schemes worldwide. Our main findings are the following: i) the RES sectorial intensity of production in Italy largely increased in 2008-2009; ii) on average, the RES sectorial intensity of production does not affect earnings levels; iii) remarkably, a clear skill-premium effect emerges when the RES sectorial intensity of production increases.
D41|Pseudo-Scientific Economic Policies Of Moldova Association To The Eu: Methodology, Problems, Solutions|Economic policies and decisions on EU association starting with the begginig of 90’s were pseudoscientific, contradictory, incoherent because those policies have not based themselves on modern and current economic theories elaborated and promoted by the EU. Actuality. The topic is actual from the perspective of the factors’ analysis which were conducting to delay the association process of Moldova to the EU. At the same time, those were increasing instability, disequilibrium in the national economy and raise of social vulnerability and constraint levels which ultimately increased the gap between the national and EU economic development levels. During the period of 2000-2015, the socio-economic policy of the Republic of Moldova is described more as small and fragmented steps on conceiving economic and financial instruments for the integration into the EU which were reflected in the Neighbourhood Partnership and Association Agreement with the EU. These processes conducted for the state incapacity to define its own objectives and social-economic priorities for the association as well as legitimated a continuous stage of transition to the market economy. The scope of the present article is to propose a real change of the development and social-economic association policies for achieving final objective on integration to EU. The proposals would consist in emphasizing and implementation of the EU economic principles reflected in the neoclassic synthesis and neo-conservative theories; the elaboration and implementation of a new Strategy on economic supervision, coordination and anticipation of the economic disequilibrium; achieve economic stability for diminishing the negative effects of the global and regional crisis on national economy and adaptation of the development policies to the national socio-economic conditions. The methods used for the elaboration and achieving the expected results of the study were analysis and synthesis of the reliable data on economic processes’ trends as well as macroeconomic prognoses for designing a set of development scenarios. Results were reflected in elaboration of a system of actions which includes EU as a monitoring mechanism for preventing and anticipating the disequilibrium that may occur during the association process. Stimulation of consumption, of the research and technological progress and targeting foreign investments in the innovation development priorities are some of other actions that are recommended in the article
D41|Technological Progress and Sectoral Shares|This paper studies the effect of differences in the rate of technological progress between sectors on their relative sizes. There are two sectors: a stagnant sector, where productivity does not change over time, and a progressive sector, where costs decrease over time. We consider a conjectural variation approach which encompasses perfect competition, oligopoly and monopoly. The evolution of the relative shares of the stagnant and progressive sectors over time depends on the type of competition, cost levels and the price elasticity of demand. The relationship with the cost disease literature is discussed.
D41|Product Design in Selection Markets|"In selection markets, where the cost of serving consumers is heterogeneous and noncontractible, nonprice product features allow a firm to sort profitable from unprofitable consumers. An example of this ""sorting by quality"" is the use of down payments to dissuade borrowers who are unlikely to repay. We study a model in which consumers have multidimensional types and a firm offers a single product of endogenous quality, as in Spence (1975). These two ingredients generate a novel sorting incentive in a firm’s first-order condition for quality, which is a simple ratio. The denominator is marginal consumer surplus, a measure of market power. The numerator is the covariance, among marginal consumers, between marginal willingness to pay for quality and cost to the firm. We provide conditions under which this term is signed and contrast the sorting incentives of a profit-maximizer and a social planner. We then use this characterization to quantify the importance of sorting empirically in subprime auto lending, analytically sign its impact in a model of add-on pricing, and calibrate optimal competition policy in health insurance markets.

D41|Promoting Competition Rules in Romania, 2010 - 2014 Period|The paper “Promoting Competition Rules in Romania, 2010-2014 Period” presents the activities carried out by the Competition Council in our country with the purpose of strengthening cooperation relationships with other institutions, as well as activities carried out with the purpose of enhancing the all stakeholders’ confidence in the benefits provided by competition, during the analysed period. The promotion of the competition culture is represented by activities performed by the competition authority by mechanisms that are not directly related to the effective application of the law, especially those related to strengthening cooperation relationships with other institutions and those performed with the purpose of enhancing all stakeholders’ confidence in the benefits provided by competition (ministries and state institutions, economic agents, magistrates, business associations and trade unions, non-governmental organizations, consumers, etc.).

D41|Banking Competition and Financial Stability: Evidence from CIS|The study provides empirical analysis of the cross-country relationship between a direct measure of competitive conduct of banking system and financial system in CIS countries during the period from 2001 to 2013. We determine the level of banking competition by using Panzar and Rosse H-statistic. Estimation results from Logit probability analysis reveal that the level of competition does not significantly affect the probability of banking crisis in such countries. However, a number of macroeconomic and institutional factors have a significant influence in financial stability. According to empirical results, higher inflation increases the probability of a banking crisis. On the other hand, credit growth decreases the probability of banking crisis in the investigated countries. These results are robust to the methodology when the interaction of concentration and h-statistic is used. The institutional factors have significant influence on preventing banking crises. Specifically, improvement in government effectiveness decreases the probability of banking crisis.
D41|Estimation of Interrelation between Corruption and Competition<BR>[Оценка Взаимного Влияния Коррупции И Конкуренции]|The article is devoted to the quantitative assessment of interrelation between corruption and competition. The authors summarize the results of theoretical and empirical studies of the relationships, as well as conducting their own assessment based on international data. The results show that the relation in the two-way one. On the one hand, increasing intensity of competition leads corruption behavior to become more prevalent. On the other hand, corruption oppresses competition, thus causing additional negative effects on social welfare. The last effect, however, is pronounced for countries with low and moderate bureaucratic barriers. If the barriers are high, the effect becomes opposite: corruption may support competition. Thus, reduction and facilitation of bureaucratic procedures is an important measure of the state policy aimed to reduce corruption and promote competition. The study revealed no statistically significant impact of income per capita on intensity of competition and the level of corruption in the country. The hypothesis that increase in freedom of mass media restrains corruption is also rejected. Thus there is no reason to consider this tool as an effective measure of anti-corruption policies. An important factor influencing both variables, is the development of institutions (property rights protection, the efficiency of the judicial system and law enforcement agencies). This result is consistent with the results of theoretical and empirical studies of other authors and emphasizes the importance of developing institutions to achieve both the goal of reducing the level of corruption and the development of competition in the domestic market.
D41|Edgeworth’s conjecture and the number of agents and commodities|Abstract We answer the question asked by Robert Aumann as to whether core equivalence depends on there being “many more agents than commodities.” We show that for a large class of commodity spaces, which might be infinite-dimensional and even non-separable, core equivalence is indeed equivalent to the presence of “many more agents than commodities” when allocations are Bochner integrable. By contrast, we show that in a classical model of an atomless economy with an infinite-dimensional commodity space, the model where the commodity space is $$L_\infty (\mu )$$ L ∞ ( μ ) with the Mackey topology and allocations are Gelfand integrable, core equivalence holds in full generality, even when there are “many more commodities than agents.” The assumptions we make on economies are much weaker than what is commonly used in core equivalence results for infinite-dimensional commodity spaces and reduce to Aumann’s original assumptions when there are finitely many commodities.
D41|Price versus quality competition: in search for Schumpeterian evolution mechanisms|Abstract The paper extends the research program of modeling the Schumpeterian vision of innovative development in the Arrow-Debreu theory of general equilibrium. The core of this set-up is based on modeling the two fundamental forms of economic life distinguished by Schumpeter, namely the circular flow and economic development by specific extensions of the production system being part of the Debreu private ownership economy, so that the analysis includes static as well as dynamic forms. In this context the paper aims at studying the mechanisms of Schumpeterian evolution in the conceptual apparatus of the Hurwicz’s theory of economic mechanisms. To this purpose two kinds of mechanisms of Schumpeterian innovative evolution are studied. First, price mechanisms which include prices as an element of the message space, and second, qualitative mechanisms which, in addition, guarantee that the position of a group of agents will get better off with respect to the given criterion.
D41|The Cost of Antitrust Law to Malaysia’s Financial Services Sector|Judging by only economic incentives, Malaysian financial institutions (particularly banks) should completely ignore the Competition Act. The data show that Malaysian banks probably benefit from anticompetitive behaviour. Political and family connections likely facilitate such behaviour. Given that the Malaysian Competition Commission will likely lack the resources to investigate and sanction anti-competitive behaviour in Malaysia’s banking industry – the banks’ best response to the Act probably consists of ignoring it. Maximum fines of 10 million ringgit and revenue-tied penalties of only 10% of worldwide revenue mean that banks still have strong incentives to engage in anticompetitive behaviour and to pay any low fine that might be levied. The best compliance programme for banks in Malaysia likely consists of actions that avoid detection rather than detecting and preventing anticompetitive behaviour. Private rights of action are unlikely to provide any stronger economic incentives for Malaysian banks to adopt strong antitrust compliance programmes and internal audit programmes. By staying the course, Malaysian banks can continue to earn about 15 billion ringgits (approximately US$4.6 billion in anticompetitive rents).
D41|Structural change in agriculture under capacity constraints: An equilibrium approach|This paper analyses the impact of a tradable production quota on firm entry and exit in the agricultural industry. We develop a dynamic stochastic equilibrium framework considering that a release of production capacity by exiting firms affects the investment options for entrants. Firms' investment and exit decisions depend on future output and quota prices, which in turn will be affected by the evolution of industry structures themselves. Contrary to many static models we find that introducing a quota system may foster structural change. A tradable quota increases the liquidation value and makes inefficient firms cease production despite higher output prices.
D41|Overconfident Consumers in the Marketplace|The term overconfidence is used broadly in the psychology literature, referring to both overoptimism and overprecision. Overoptimistic individuals overestimate their own abilities or prospects. In contrast, overprecise individuals place overly narrow confidence intervals around forecasts, thereby underestimating uncertainty. These biases can lead consumers to misforecast their future product usage, or to overestimate their abilities to navigate contract terms. In consequence, consumer overconfidence causes consumers to systematically misweight different dimensions of product quality and price. Poor choices based on biased estimates of a product's expected costs or benefits are the result. For instance, overoptimism about self-control is a leading explanation for why individuals overpay for gym memberships that they underutilize. Similarly, overprecision is a leading explanation for why individuals systematically choose the wrong calling plans, racking up large overage charges for exceeding usage allowances in the process. Beyond these market effects of overconfidence, this paper addresses three additional questions: What will firms do to exploit consumer overconfidence? What are the equilibrium welfare consequences of consumer overconfidence for consumers, firms, and society? And what are the implications of consumer overconfidence for public policy?
D41|Behavioral Consumers in Industrial Organization|This paper succinctly overviews three primary branches of the industrial organization literature with behavioral consumers. The literature is organized according to whether consumers: (1) have non-standard preferences, (2) are overconfident or otherwise biased such that they systematically misweight different dimensions of price and other product attributes, or (3) fail to choose the best price due to suboptimal search, confusion comparing prices, or excessive inertia. The importance of consumer heterogeneity and equilibrium effects are also highlighted along with recent empirical work.
D41|Cost- and Price Dynamics of Solar PV Modules|This paper develops a model framework and a corresponding empirical inference procedure for estimating long-run marginal cost in industries where production costs decline over time. In the context of the solar photovoltaic module industry, we rely on firm-level financial accounting data to estimate the long-run marginal cost of PV modules for the years 2008 -2013. During those years, the industry experienced both sharp price declines and significant expansions of manufacturing capacity. By comparing the trajectory of average sales prices with the long-run marginal cost estimates, we are in a position to quantify the extent to which actual price declines were attributable to excess capacity as opposed to reductions in production costs. While we find a significant effect attributable to excess capacity for some quarters in our sample period, the dynamics of this industry also points to a rate of cost reductions that is even faster than the 80% learning curve which has described the trajectory of average sales prices over the past three decades.

D41|Microeconomia in incertezza: un quadro di riferimento per l’analisi dei rischi d’impresa [MICROECONOMICS UNDER UNCERTAINTY: A FRAMEWORK FOR THE ANALYSIS OF BUSINESS RISKS]|The introduction of risk in the microeconomic theory has some important effects on the behavior of the competitive firms: the level of optimal production under condition of risk is lower than under certainty; the optimal mix of productive input shifts to ones with less uncertainty; vertical integration, diversification and hedging are as many responses for optimal management of risks. The conclusions of the microeconomics under uncertainty depend also from the way the risk is modeled: additive risk is easier to handle than multiplicative risk, and conclusions from that are closer to microeconomics under certainty.
D41|Role of reinvestment in a competitive market|In the present work we study asymptotic dynamics of a multi-dimensional piecewise smooth map which models an oligopoly market where competitors use adaptive scheme for reaction choice. Each competitor also defines the moment for renewing the capital equipment depending on how intensively the latter is used. Namely, the larger output is produced, the quicker the capital exhausts. It is shown then that the asymptotic dynamics of the map is rather sensitive to initial conditions, which leads to coexistence of different metric attractors. We also investigate stability of trajectories representing Cournot equilibria, which in this case are not fixed but periodic points. In particular, it is shown that several such Cournot equilibria, belonging to different invariant manifolds, may coexist some of them being locally asymptotically stable and some being unstable.
D41|Electricity market-clearing prices and investment incentives: The role of pricing rules|Pricing rules in wholesale electricity markets are usually classified around two major groups, namely linear (aka non-discriminatory) and non-linear (aka discriminatory). As well known, the major difference lies on the way non-convexities are considered in the computation of market prices.
D41|Competitiveness assessment of Iran's restructured electricity market|Iran's electricity market was restructured mostly to enhance its production efficiency. Nonetheless, the experience of liberalized electricity markets indicates that market establishment would be insufficient to produce competitive results. To determine whether the restructured market is moving toward competition, this paper assesses production efficiency in Iran's electricity market during high demand periods in 2006 as the first year of the restructured market's performance, and in 2012 as the last year with available data. We compared counterfactual benchmark outcomes to the actual dispatches to determine the production efficiency. Moreover, Iran's power market is a discriminatory, day-ahead auction; therefore, we considered the market design in the competitive benchmark. We found that the production was inefficient in both 2006 and 2012. More importantly, the production in the market is becoming increasingly inefficient over time due to exercising market power and distortion of the market's production by strategic firms. Not only were strategic firms distorting the market's production, but they were also learning to exercise more non-competitive behavior because these firms distorted the production in 2012 eight times more than they did in 2006.
D41|A static deterministic linear peak-load pricing model for the electricity industry: Application to the Peruvian case|This article presents a static deterministic linear peak-load pricing model which finds the optimal mix of generation technologies for a given duration curve. The main contribution of the article is the idea of discretizing the duration curve. Since any real duration curve can be approximated by a discretized one, the optimal capacity mix for real world situation can be derived using a linear programming software. Then, for the model with the discretized duration curve, we derive the centralized optimal solution. Also, we show that applying marginal cost pricing allows for the recovery of all generation costs when the mix of technologies is optimal. Finally, we present an application of the proposed model to the Peruvian case; we comment and compare the results with the real capacity mix of the system for the years 2008–2013.

D41|Payoffs in exact TU economies|We prove that a single-valued solution of perfectly competitive TU economies underlying nonatomic exact market games is uniquely determined as the Mertens [23] value by four plausible value-related axioms. Since the Mertens value is always a core element, this result provides an axiomatization of the Mertens value as a core-selection. Previous works in this direction assumed the economies to be either differentiable (e.g., Dubey and Neyman [11]) or of uniform finite-type (e.g., Haimanko [16]). Our work does not assume that, thus it contributes to the axiomatic study of payoffs in perfectly competitive economies (or values of their derived market games) in general. In fact, this is the first contribution in this direction.
D41|Formal and Real Power in General Equilibrium|We integrate individual power in groups into general equilibrium models with endogenous group formation. We distinguish between formal power (the say in group decisions) and real power (utility gain from being in groups). Their values will be determined as part of the equilibrium. We find that higher formal power does not necessarily translate into higher equilibrium utility or higher real power. One reason is that induced price changes may offset the groupmember’s increased influence. A second reason is that the group may dissolve when a group member gains too much influence, because other members can exercise the option to leave. We also show that maximal real power can be compatible with Pareto efficiency. We further identify circumstances when changes of formal power in one group do not impact on other groups. Finally, we establish existence of competitive equilibria, including equilibria where some individual enjoys real power.
D41|Asymmetric cartel formation under trade liberalization: Heterogeneous ﬁrms with capacity constraints|In a context of trade liberalization , this paper is interested in studying the impact of a decline in trade costs on cartel formation between foreign and domestic ﬁrms. In a model that endogenizes the cartel formation be- tween heterogeneous ﬁrms in their capacities and their marginal costs, the paper investigates how the decrease in trade tariﬀs aﬀects the formation of such a cartel. Contrary to previous works in this area, the paper does not study how trade liberalization aﬀects cartel stability, however it is in- terested in testing whether the cartel becomes more or less inclusive after this openness. The model predicts that the price prevailing on the mar- ket following trade liberalization depends on capacity distribution of the foreign ﬁrms. If they are large enough, price may increase after openness.
D41|Integrating Intermittent Renewable Wind Generation - A Stochastic Multi-Market Electricity Model for the European Electricity Market|In northern Europe, wind energy has become a dominate renewable energy source, due to natural conditions and national support schemes. However, the uncertainty about wind generation affects existing network infrastructure and power production planning of generators, which cannot be fully diminished by wind forecasts. In this paper we develop a stochastic electricity market model to analyze the impact of uncertain wind generation on the different electricity markets as well as network congestion management. Stochastic programming techniques are used to incorporate uncertain wind generation. The technical characteristics of transporting electrical energy as well as power plants are explicitly taken into account. The consecutive clearing of the electricity markets is incorporated by a rolling planning procedure reflecting the market regime of European markets. The model is applied to the German electricity system covering one week. Two different approaches of considering uncertain wind generation are analyzed and compared to a deterministic approach. The results reveal that the flexibility of generation dispatch is increased either by using more flexible generation technologies or by operating rather inflexible technologies under part-load conditions.

D41|Reallocation Effects of Antimonopoly Policy|"The article argues that application of antimonopoly remedies can reallocate costs and benefits between market participants. Efforts of competition authorities to implement ""price cap"" indicators on concentrated markets do not always lead to reallocation of recourses to more efficient market participants and value added. A static choice of indicator can set up new adaptational risks. Also macroeconomic instability and shifts of distribution channels bring more uncertainty for business. The paper shows how much application of different price indicators for internal markets of export-oriented goods may cost to suppliers and consumers."
D41|Premuneration Values and Investments in Matching Markets|"We examine markets in which agents make investments and then match into pairs, creating surpluses that depend on their investments and that can be split between the matched agents. In general, each of the matched agents would â€ own"" part of the surplus in the absence of interagent transfers. Most of the work in the large bargaining-and matching literature ignores this initial ownership of the surplus. We show that when investments are not observable to potential partners, initial ownership affects the efficiency of equilibrium investments and affects the agents' payoffs. In particular, it is possible that reallocating initial ownership could increase welfare on both sides of the match.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"

The article uses the method of secondary analysis based on data taken from a survey by the Flash Eurobarometr 342 “SME: towards energy efficiency and environmental markets” and “Report on the state of the sector’s small and medium-sized enterprises in Poland in 2012 - 2013” conducted by the Polish Agency for Enterprise Development. The analysis of the research material allowed to assess the level of involvement of the European and Polish SME sector in issues related to realization pro-environment’s operations. The analysis indicates what solutions are the most popular ones, what are the obstacles in the implementation of eco-innovation and what motivates to be eko. It let to enunciate conclusions what does the green market in the UE and in the Poland look like in the context of small and medium-sized enterprises’ competitiveness.
D41|An empirical analysis of competition in the Indian Banking Sector in dynamic panel framework|Competition has been regarded as a positive phenomenon for banks; it is perceived that competition makes banks more efficient, stimulates financial innovation and open up new markets For empirical assessment of the nature of competitive conditions amongst scheduled Indian commercial banks over a period of 15 years, we use the ‘Panzar-Rosser educed form revenue model’ to compute the so-called H statistic by estimating the factor price elasticities. In this study alternative estimation techniques have been used for comparing the dynamic H-statistic with static H-statistic. The static H-statistic was found to have a downward bias. However, dynamic as well as static H-statistic, both pointed to the presence of monopolistic competition. The hypotheses of perfect collusion as well as of perfect competition can be rejected using dynamic as well as fixed panel-econometric model estimations using micro data of banks’ balance sheets and profit & loss accounts for the years 2000-2014. The division of the entire period into two sub-samples, i.e. before and after 2007 revealed a decrease in competition levels across the two periods. Although, empirical analysis supported the assertion that the nature of competition among the Indian Banks is monopolistic.But it showed a decrease in the level of competitionmay be due to consolidation exercises of top few large banks with smaller banks and also because of the shift from traditional financial business to off-balance sheet activities, which might have lead to the convergence of competitive levels in the second sub-sample period, i.e. after 2007.The second sub-period also corresponds to the global financial crisis of 2008, a possible reason for the lower H-statistic values. The low persistence of profit values (in the sub-periods) should be associated with higher competition, It is also found that the values of competitive conduct (H-statistic), does not coincide with the classical concentration approach (CR5, CR10), for the Indian Banking Industry. The unit cost of funds, capital, and labour were found to be positive and statistically significant. The unit cost of funds was the highest contributor to the overall H statistic. The control variables, such as size and risk were found to be positively affecting the revenue. The findings arrived in this study; highlight the possible links between Indian banking sector competitiveness, profitability, intermediation and regulatory scenario.
D41|Job Loss in the Great Recession and its Aftermath: U.S. Evidence from the Displaced Workers Survey|The Great Recession from December 2007 to June 2009 is associated with a dramatic weakening of the labor market from which, by some measures, it has not completely recovered. I use data from the Displaced Workers Survey(DWS) from 1984-2014 to investigate the incidence and consequences of job loss from 1981-2013. In particular, the 2010, 2012, and 2014 DWSs provide a window through which to examine the experience of job losers in the Great Recession and its aftermath and to compare their experience to that of earlier job losers. These data show a record high rate of job loss in the Great Recession, with almost one in six workers reporting having lost a job in the 2007-2009 period, that has not yet returned to pre-recession levels. The employment consequences of job loss are also very serious during this period with very low rates of reemployment and diff culty finding full-time employment. The reduction in weekly earnings for those job losers during the 2007-2013 period who were able to find new employment are not unusually large by historical standards.

D41|Introduzione|The article summarises the most recent developments since the publication of the previous issue. It discusses the possible role and scope of Keynesian policies, suggesting specific remedies to Italy’s current crisis. It then shortly reviews the articles published in this issue of the Journal, with special emphasis on Becattini’s analysis of industrial districts, in relation to the recent major earthquake that damaged several Italian Regions.
D41|Introduzione|The three articles included in this issue of the journal (along with the usual book reviews and received books sections) are heterogeneous with regards both to the topics and methods. They once again show how wide and differentiated the post-crisis economic debate is.

D41|Effects Of Perceived Service Quality Corporate Reputation: A Comparative Research At Hospitals In Konya|As the competition between the organizations increases, the organizations are no longer able to create differentiation in product and service that they are trying to find new ways to create difference. Abstract values become more important than material sources, in this context intangible values are much more important than anything, and the most important of these are ?Corporate Reputation? and ?Service Quality?.In particular, corporate reputation is important to be addressed in health service sector. As the main point in this service is human health, how the customers perceive reputation and service quality becomes important. The frequency and content demanded from health sector is affected by the management and staff quality of organization, whether the service is reliable or not, the effectiveness of the communication in the environment and social responsibility consciousness towards society.In the light of this information, our aim is to determine whether there is a difference between the effects of corporate reputation in perceived service quality at hospitals and the perceived service quality by the customers through comparing public and private hospitals.
D41|Does a Platform Monopolist Want Competition?|We consider a software vendor first selling a monopoly platform and then an application running on this platform. He may face competition by an entrant in the applications market. The platform monopolist can benefit from competition for three reasons. First, his profits from the platform increase. Second, competition serves as a credible commitment to lower prices for applications. Third, higher expected product variety may lead to higher demand for his application. Results carry over to non-software platforms and, partially, to upstream and downstream firms. The model also explains why Microsoft Office is priced significantly higher than Microsoftâ€™s operating system.
D41|Competition In Economic And Legal Theory|Competition is a main feature of the free market, the content of which enriched the community evolvement. Various known forms of the type according to the market which is manifested. The increasing complexity of economic and social life requiring multiple measures regulations of various types of market competition.
D41|Sequential coordination, higher-order belief dynamics and the E-stability principle|This paper explores convergence in higher-order beliefs – otherwise called eductive stability – when coordination is sequential, that is, when each agent of a given type fixes his own actions after observing the ones of earlier types in a given order. The presence of sequential types enhances expectational coordination in the case of strategic substitutability, but not in the case of strategic complementarity. In particular, eductive stability can be obtained for any degree of substitutability, provided the number of sequential types is large enough. Therefore, sequential coordination opens up to the possibility that eductive convergence occurs at the same conditions of adaptive convergence, in accordance to the E-stability principle.
D41|The Price of Stability: The balance sheet policy of the Banque de France and the Gold Standard (1880-1914)|"Under the classical gold standard (1880-1914), the Bank of France maintained a stable discount rate while the Bank of England changed its rate very frequently. Why did the policies of these central banks, the two pillars of the gold standard, differ so much? How did the Bank of France manage to keep a stable rate and continuously violate the ""rules of the game""? This paper tackles these questions and shows that the domestic asset portfolio of the Bank of France played a crucial role in smoothing international shocks and in maintaining the stability of the discount rate. This policy provides a striking example of a central bank that uses its balance sheet to block the interest rate channel and protect the domestic economy from international constraints (Mundell's trilemma)."
D41|Experimenting with Behavior Based Pricing|Many purchases of differentiated goods are repeated, giving sellers the opportunity to engage in price discrimination based upon the shopper’s previous behavior by either offering loyalty discounts to repeat buyers or introductory rates to new customers. Recent theoretical work suggests that loyalty discounts are likely to be implemented when customer preferences are not stationary and sellers can pre-commit to prices for repeat buyers, but otherwise repeat buyers can be expected to pay the same or more than new buyers. This paper reports the results of a series of controlled laboratory experiments designed to empirically test the impact of these factors on pricing strategies, seller profit and total cost to consumers. Absent price pre-commitments, sellers in the lab engage in poaching when it is optimal to do so, but the ability to pre-commit leads to prices being relatively more favorable to loyal customers. Customer poaching increases seller profit and increases total consumer costs in the case of stable consumer preferences without price pre-commitment.
D41|Evaluación de mecanismos de estabilización y promoción de exportaciones de leche|Para hacer realidad su potencial exportador lechero, el país debe crear los mecanismos financieros y de apoyo que soporten las transformaciones productivas y comerciales que ello demanda. El presente estudio tiene como objetivo la evaluación de algunos mecanismos de estabilización y promoción de las exportaciones colombianas de leche. El estudio encuentra que los Fondos propuestos son mecanismos idóneos para apalancar las exportaciones. Para ello es necesario que el precio de referencia (PCE) esté asociado a las cotizaciones internacionales, que la producción nacional crezca en más del 15 por ciento y que el Gobierno Nacional dé su apoyo inicial a los Fondos.
D41|Does a leverage ratio requirement increase bank stability?|Basel III has introduced a non-risk-weighted leverage ratio requirement (LRR) which complements the internal ratings based (IRB) capital requirements. It provides a backstop against model risk which arises if some loans get incorrectly rated and become toxic. We study the effects of the LRR on lending strategies and its implications for banks’ stability. We show that the LRR might induce banks with low-risk lending strategies to diversify their portfolios into high-risk loans until the LRR is no longer the binding capital constraint on them. If the LRR is lower than the average bank’s IRB requirement, the aggregate capital costs of banks do not increase. However, because the diversification makes banks’ portfolios more alike the banking sector as a whole may become more exposed to model risk in each loan category. This may undermine banking sector stability. On balance, our calibrated model motivates a significantly higher LRR than the current one.
D41|99 Cent: Price points in e-commerce|Setting prices ending in nines is a common feature of many markets for consumer products. This prevalence has been explained either by a specific image of such price points or by the exploitation of rational inattention on the part of the consumers who want to economize on the cost of information processing. We use data from an Austrian price comparison site and find a remarkable prevalence of such price setting. Prices ending with nine are also sticky: price-setters change them with a significantly lower probability; rivals underbid these prices more seldom if they represent the cheapest price on the market, and we observe higher price jumps by price leaders for these price points. Finally, we explore the impact of these price points on the consumers’ demand.
D41|Experimenting with purchase history based price discrimination|Many purchases of differentiated goods are repeated, giving sellers the opportunity to engage in price discrimination based upon the shopper's previous behavior by either offering loyalty discounts to repeat buyers or introductory rates to new customers. Recent theoretical work suggests that loyalty discounts can be profitable to sellers when customer preferences are not stationary and sellers can pre-commit to prices for repeat buyers, but otherwise returning customers can be expected to pay the same or more than new buyers. This paper reports behavior in controlled laboratory experiments designed to empirically test the impact of these factors on pricing strategies. The results generally support the comparative static predictions of the theoretical model. When customer preferences are fixed over time, sellers attempt to lure customers from their rival. Price pre-commitment for repeat shoppers when buyer preferences vary over time resulted in modest loyalty pricing, but the discounts are not as prevalent as predicted as sellers rarely price below cost. Behaviorally, price pre-commitment to loyal customers is found to reduce prices overall.
D41|Harmful competition in insurance markets|There is a general presumption that competition is a good thing. In this paper we show that competition in the insurance markets can be bad and that adverse selection is in general worse under competition than under monopoly. The reason is that monopoly can exploit its market power to relax incentive constraints by cross-subsidization between different risk types. Cream-skimming behavior, on the contrary, prevents competitive firms from using implicit transfers. In effect monopoly is shown to provide better coverage to those buying insurance but at the cost of limiting participation to insurance. Performing simulation for different distributions of risk, we find that monopoly in general performs (much) better than competition in terms of the realization of the gains from trade across all traders in equilibrium.
D41|Competitive rational expectations equilibria without apology|Consider a financial market with N risk-averse asymmetrically informed traders. When N grows at the same rate as noise trading, prices in competitive and in strategic rational expectations equilibrium converge to each other at a rate of 1/N. Equilibria in the two scenarios are close when noise trading volume per informed trader is large in relation to risk-bearing capacity. Both equilibria converge to the competitive equilibrium of a limit continuum economy as the market becomes large at a slower rate of 1/N. The results extend to endogenous information acquisition and the connections with the Grossman–Stiglitz paradox are highlighted.
D41|Market signaling with grades|We consider a signaling model in which receivers observe both the sender's costly signal as well as a stochastic grade that is correlated with the sender's type. In equilibrium, the sender resolves the trade-off between using the costly signal versus relying on the noisy grade to distinguish himself. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition—loosely, that the grade is sufficiently informative relative to the dispersion of (marginal) signaling costs across types—under which the presence of grades substantively alters the equilibrium predictions. Specifically, separating equilibria do not survive stability-based refinements. Instead, the prediction depends on the prior distribution over the sender's type. For example, with two types it involves full pooling when the distribution places sufficient weight on the high type and partial pooling otherwise. Finally, the equilibrium converges to the complete-information outcome as the distribution tends to a degenerate one—resolving a long-standing paradox within the signaling literature.
D41|Do more competitive banks have less market power? The evidence from Central and Eastern Europe|Studies that have explored the competitive behaviour of banks frequently arrive at divergent conclusions because they use different measures of competition. This study first discusses these various measures of competition and their divergence from a theoretical perspective and then employs them to measure the competitiveness of Central and Eastern European banks and to investigate whether more competitive banks really have less market power. We find that these banks increase their market power when there is low banking concentration and do not necessarily become less competitive. Moreover, a more concentrated banking market does not enhance the market power of banks and does not make them less competitive, and more competitive banks do not necessarily have less market power. This latter outcome ensues because revenue and production reactions to cost evolution are either positively related – or completely unrelated – to the competitive behaviour of banks.
D41|On capturing foreign oil rents|A common assumption in the literature on tariff and exhaustible resources is that no stocks of the resource are available within the importing country's borders and therefore the importing country is not itself a producer. Reality is in fact quite different: there are many instances of countries that are simultaneously importers and producers of an exhaustible energy resource. This paper makes use of a spatial trade model that departs from this restriction and examines the rent-extracting tariff in a more general framework where the importing country is allowed to have access to a stock of the resource of its own and to determine simultaneously the optimal tariff and the rate of depletion of its own stock. Allowing the importing country to hold some resource deposits reduces the available rent to foreign producers and, in essence, reinforces the ability of the importer to capture the foreign rent. In effect, the optimal tariff is shown to be a decreasing function of the initial resource stock in the importing country. Interestingly, the paper identifies the spatial distribution of consumers as the primary reason of time-inconsistency.
D41|Monopolistic competition under uncertainty|Inspired by advances in general equilibrium modelling with monopolistic competition were-consider the problem of the choice of firms under uncertainty, explore it in the framework of general equilibrium modelling, and develop a theory of monopolistic competition under demand uncertainty. We distinguish between two cases of uncertainty. In the first case the uncertainty disappears by the moment of trade and the output but not the prices are chosen under uncertainty. Then the uncertainty is established not to affect the equilibrium. The trade under uncertainty, considered in the second case, causes market imperfetions. The supply is bigger (smaller) than the expected demand when the goods are good (bad) substitutes. In contrast to previous study, we show that uncertainty affects basically the prices and demand, but not the output.
D41|Competitividad y Especialización en el Bajío Mexicano: ¿Acaso una región homogénea?|In this paper we estimate the competitiveness of the Región Bajío. The overall assessment is that Bajío lacks competitiveness, lagging in both labor productivity and wage levels (a proxy of human capital). However, there are heterogeneous competitive conditions. Only three of the cities and localities reach a favorable level of competitiveness: Querétaro, Guadalajara and Irapuato; although only Querétaro maintains the level of advantages both in productivity and wages, and this is also the case for tradables and non-tradables activities in this locality. The other 18 metropolitan zones (ZM) and municipalities of the Bajío show very low levels of competitiveness. By grouping the localities in terms of systemic competitiveness, we found that one cluster is notably more systemically competitive than the others. These are half a dozen cities that have developed relatively high and spread competitive conditions. The rest show a limited systemic integration, these including to Salamanca, San José Iturbide, Irapuato, Apaseo el Grande, Ocotlán and Fresnillo. Likewise, other small municipalities present little competitive activity; these maybe mostly characterized as typical monoproducers that have not created significant spillovers.
D41|Economic theory and social classes|The marginalist economic theory believes that the effectiveness of the collective action exerted by a social class as a whole conflicts with the hypothesis of competition (perfect competition). A question of method is at the root of this view: the marginalist theory only takes into consideration the individual maximizing behaviour of workers, capitalists and entrepreneurs. In this way it excludes from the analysis the study of social links, which, as a matter of fact, are the conditions for collective action. In the classical approach, economic relations are instead affected by the institutions and social conventions that characterize each particular historical moment. As a consequence, the classical notion of competition (free competition) does not exclude a role for the social links that can justify collective action and, at the same time, make it effective. This characteristic of the classical approach is particularly considerable as concerns the theory of income distribution. A re-proposal of the classical theory of wages which takes into consideration the development and complexity of the institutions that, these days, condition the conflict for the distribution of income, cannot actually disregard the role of collective action.
D41|How do exogenous shocks cause bankruptcy? Balance sheet and income statement channels|We are the first to examine whether exogenous shocks cause personal bankruptcy through the balance sheet channel and/or the income statement channel. For identification, we examine the effect of exogenous, politically motivated government payments on 200,000 Canadian bankruptcy filings. We find support for the balance sheet channel, in that receipt of the exogenous cash increases the net balance sheet benefits of bankruptcy (unsecured debt discharged minus liquidated assets forgone) required by filers. We also find limited support for the income statement channel, in that exogenous payments reduce bankruptcy filings from individuals whose current expenses exceed their current income.
D41|Market Power and Collusion on Interconnection Phone Market in Tunisia : What Lessons from International Experiences|"We try in this paper to characterize the state of mobile phone market in Tunisia. Our study is based on a survey of foreign experience (Europe) in detecting collusive behavior and a comparison of the critical threshold of collusion between operators in developing countries like Tunisia. The market power is estimated based on the work of Parker Roller (1997) and the assumption of ""Balanced Calling Pattern"". We use then the model of Friedman (1971) to compare the critical threshold of collusion. We show that the ""conduct parameter"" measuring the intensity of competition is not null during the period 1993-2011. Results show also that collusion is easier on the Tunisian market that on the Algerian, Jordanian, or Moroccan one."
D41|The optimal short-term management of flexible nuclear plants in a competitive electricity system as a case of competition with reservoir|In many countries, the electricity systems are quitting the vertically integrated monopoly organization for an operation framed by competitive markets. It therefore questions how flexible nuclear plants capable of load-following should be operated in an open market framework. A number of technico-economical features of the operation of flexible nuclear plants drive our modelling complex which makes difficult to determine the optimal management of the nuclear production within our model. In order to examine the existence of an equilibrium and calculate it, we focus on a short-term (monthly) management horizon of the fuel of nuclear reactors. The marginal cost of nuclear production being (significantly) lower than that of thermal production induces a discontinuity of producer's short-term profit. The problem of discontinuity makes the resolution of the optimal short-term production problem extremely complicated and even leads to a lack of solutions. That is why it is necessary to study an approximate problem (continuous problem) that constitutes a “regularization” of our economical problem (discontinuous problem). Its resolution provides us with an equilibrium which proves the existence of an optimal production trajectory
D41|The inter-temporal optimization of the operation of the nuclear fuel reservoir in a liberalized electricity market dominated by the nuclear generation|We look at the optimal inter-temporal management of the fuel reservoir of nuclear units in a liberalized electricity market. We use the assumption that nuclear fuel works as a “reservoir” of energy due to the periodical shutdown of nuclear units to reload their fuel. In the medium-term, how a producer sets the nuclear fuel of the reservoir to respond to the variations of seasonal demand in order to maximize its production value on a multi-annual basis? The dynamic nature of the nuclear fuel reservoir highlighted the discontinuity of the price which complicates the resolution of the optimal inter-temporal production problem and even leads to a lack of solutions. Theoretically, at the optimum, nuclear is used to serve baseload and thermal follows demand's variations. Numerically, both nuclear and thermal units operate in load-following mode. Solutions characterized by a constant nuclear production do not exist which shows that the significant share of nuclear in the energy mix does not permit to produce at a constant rate unless further investments in thermal capacity are done. Inter-temporal optimization shows the role of nuclear for ensuring the equilibrium between supply and demand

D41|Estándares internacionales y educación contable|Desde la década del 90 se han formulado por parte de agencias internacionales y entidades gremiales mundiales asociadas a la profesión de la contaduría pública, propuestas tendientes a la confección de estándares que pauten esta profesión. Pese a que estas propuestas, promovidas, en particular, por la Federación Internacional de Contadores (IFAC), han sido objeto de controversia, su incorporación enla formación de los contadores se ha venido haciendo paulatinay parcialmente, a través de la legislación interna.La contrastación de las propuestas conocidas revela que el trasfondo de estas, es moldear unos contornos de la educación y profesión contable, acorde con las pretensiones homogeneizantesde la globalización financiera, de la que resultaría un contador con una visión reduccionista e instrumental, portador de unas competencias orientadas hacia las demandas del mercado.
D41|Un Modelo de Educación Superior y Deserción Universitaria: Evidencia de la Pontificia Universidad Javeriana-Bogotá|Este trabajo forma parte del Proyecto de Investigación, del Departamento de Economía de la Pontificia Universidad Javeriana - Bogotá (PUJ-B), sobre deserción en los programas de pregrado de esta universidad. Inicialmente se desarrolla un modelo micro-fundamentado que busca explicar los determinantes de la deserción universitaria modelando explícitamente la interacción entre los tres agentes principales del sector de la educación superior: universidades, hogares y estudiantes. El modelo teórico muestra que la deserción universitaria ocurre en estudiantes que tienen un nivel bajo de habilidad innata que los lleva óptimamente a no esforzarse, así como en estudiantes que tienen expectativa de no poder graduarse independientemente de su habilidad innata. Los hallazgos del modelo teórico se evalúan a través de la aplicación empírica de un modelo econométrico de probabilidad (probit) sobre la información recolectada a partir de una encuesta elaborada por los autores y aplicada a una muestra representativa de 473 estudiantes de la población de neo-javerianos de la cohorte del 2006. Se encuentra que el perfil de un desertor está asociado con alguna de las siguientes características: dificultades en matemáticas y expresión oral por baja competencia previa al ingreso a la universidad, pérdida de asignaturas en la universidad, factores disciplinarios con impacto negativo en desempeño, falta de motivación, bajo nivel de esfuerzo durante su permanencia en la universidad y finalmente, la existencia de problemas de índole económico y familiar. ****************************** ABSTRACT This work is part of the Research Project, Department of Economics, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana - Bogotá (PUJ- B), on attrition in undergraduate programs of the university. Initially, a micro - based model that seeks to explain the determinants of university dropout, explicitly modeling the interaction between the three main players in the sector of higher education is developed: Universities, households and students. The theoretical model shows that the college dropout occurs in students who have a low level of innate ability that makes no effort optimally, as well as students who do not expect to graduate regardless of their innate ability. The findings of the theoretical model are evaluated through the application of an econometric empirical probability model (probit) on data collected from a survey conducted by the authors and applied to a representative sample of 473 students from the population of Neo - Javerianos cohort 2006. It is found that the profile of a defector is associated with any of the following: difficulties in math and speaking low competition for pre- college entrance, failure of academic courses in the university, disciplinary factors with negative impact on performance, lack of motivation, low effort while in college and finally, the existence of problems of economic and family reasons .
D41|Análisis económico de la normativa de libre competencia en Colombia|La política de competencia y la expedición de la normatividad sobre la misma en Colombia han sido desarrolladas por los gobiernos atendiendo a las coyunturas políticas y económicas de cada momento. Igualmente, dicha evolución normativa se ha visto fuertemente influenciada por desarrollos internacionales en la materia, de manera especial por la forma en que se han concebido y desarrollado las políticas de competencia en Estados Unidos de América y la Unión Europea. Este Cuaderno de Fedesarrollo analiza la normatividad colombiana sobre competencia de manera integral, tanto nacional como internacionalmente, y los efectos económicos de la misma en la actividad económica del país, ya sea a través de la promoción de la eficiencia de los mercados por el buen desempeño de los agentes económicos o de la protección de los intereses de los consumidores. Este trabajo recibió el apoyo de Fedesarrollo a través del concurso anual del Fondo Germán Botero de los Ríos correspondientes al año 2011 y constituye un valioso aporte para la discusión de la política de competencia en Colombia
D41|Perfect competition according to Enrico Barone|The Italian economist Enrico Barone (1859- 1924) is best known for his contributions to marginal productivity theory and the socialist planning debate. This paper analyzes Barone’s contributions to the theory of perfect competition which are largely ignored in the secondary literature. It includes his methodology; the definition, conditions and outcomes of perfect competition; the institutional context of perfect competition; and the adjustment process. It also includes some of Barone’s graphs that illustrate the working of perfect competition. The paper demonstrates that Barone deserves a place in the history of the theory of perfect competition.
D41|The Optimal Price of Default|With assets taken to be pools, rational expectations on their delivery rates are, as default is permissible in an economy and its penalty prescribed in terms of utility, indispensable to the existence of equilibrium. And the resulting equilibrium relies heavily on the prevailing penalty level. We propose, in this paper, a path-following algorithm for calculating the level of penalty that leads to a Pareto efficient equilibriumâ€”Pareto efficient among the set of equilibria of the economies with distinct penalty levels. This algorithm brings off those rational expectations by identifying their upper and lower bounds iteratively until the discrepancies between them are admissible.
D41|Assurance maladie en Suisse : l'assurance supplémentaire nuit-elle à la concurrence sur l'assurance de base ?|Many countries have introduced competition in health insurance markets. Managed competition settings have been implemented in order to avoid risk selection problems. In Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Israel citizens can choose between different providers for basic coverage. In this article, we focus on the specific case of Switzerland which implemented managed competition in basic health insurance markets in 1996. We study to what extent consumer choice for one's basic health plan may interact with the decision to subscribe to supplementary insurance. The organization of social health insurance in France is currently very different from the Swiss system. However the question of regulating complementary health care insurance markets in France may be discussed in the middle/long run using the Swiss model. In Switzerland, competition in basic health insurance markets has not been effective so far. There is no evidence of premium convergence within cantons. Consumers have been reluctant to switch to less expensive funds. We investigate one possible barrier to switching behavior, namely the influence of supplementary insurance. We show that low switching rates are the result of the existence of two health insurance markets which are regulated differently: the basic health insurance market where risk selection is prohibited and the supplementary health insurance market where risk selection practices are allowed. We show that holding a supplementary contract reduces the probability of switching basic insurance provider for those with poor self-assessed health but has no effect on the switching behavior of enrollees in good/very good health. The efficient management of competition in the basic insurance market may suffer from a lack of adequate regulation in the supplementary market.
D41|Switching costs in competitive health insurance markets|In this paper we investigate the possible presence of switching costs when consumers are offered the opportunity to change their basic health insurance provider. We focus on the specific case of Switzerland which implemented a pure form of competition in basic health insurance markets. We identify several barriers to switching, namely choice overload, status quo bias, the possession of supplementary contracts for enrollees in bad health, firm's pricing strategies based on providing low price supplementary products, poor regulation of reserves and the limitations of the previous risk-equalization mechanism which left room for risk selection practices.
D41|Determinants of Banking Competition in Morocco and Evaluation of the Structural Reforms|The empirical results of this paper indicate that the degree of competition in the banking system is determined by several macroeconomic aggregates that describe the relevance of the policies implemented in financial Morocco. Thus, the result shows that there is a positive relationship between the index of competition and concentration there by verifies our theoretical perception. On another note, economic growth is negatively correlated with the competition, which unfortunately indicates that when there are sustained economic growth banks does not behave concurrently and try to retain their market share stimulated by a high concentration sector. This is also dependent on conditions in the credit market, which indicates that when the demand is constant, banks tend to have fewer competing behaviors. In addition, the development of positive market impact of competition which is consistent with liberal theory. Thus, the use of financial market intensifies competition between banks to produce services being able to attract more customers to compensate for those who chose the stock market. Finally, in the implementation of monetary policy, the indicator of interbank interest rate has a positive impact on competition.
D41|Bank capital and the optimal capital structure of an economy|In this paper, we provide an economy-wide perspective on equity and debt across banks and industrial firms when both are faced with incentive problems and equity is scarce. Increasing bank equity may mitigate the bank-level moral hazard but exacerbates the firm-level moral hazard due to the reduction of firm equity. Competition among banks tends to result in an inefficiently low level of equity. In this case, imposing capital requirements on banks leads to a socially optimal capital structure for the economy in the sense of maximizing aggregate output. Such capital regulation is second-best and must balance three costs: excessive risk-taking by banks, credit restrictions that banks impose on firms with low equity, and credit restrictions due to high loan-interest rates. We discuss the implications of these findings for capital requirements, competition policy and banking crises.
D41|If you build it, he will come: Anticipative power transmission planning|Like in the film Field of Dreams, the sentence “if you build it, he will come” also applies in power systems. In this sense, if a transmission planner suggests building some lines in anticipation of generation capacity investments, then it can induce generation companies to invest in a more socially efficient manner. In this paper, we solve for the optimal way of doing this anticipative power transmission planning. Inspired in the proactive transmission planning model proposed by Sauma and Oren (2006) we formulate a mixed integer linear programming optimization model that integrates transmission planning, generation investment, and market operation decisions and propose a methodology to solve for the optimal transmission expansion. Contrary to the proactive methodology proposed by Sauma and Oren (2006), our model solves the optimal transmission expansion problem anticipating both generation investment and market clearing. We use the marginalist theory with production cost functions inversely related to the installed capacity in a perfectly competitive electricity market and we find all possible generation expansion pure Nash equilibria. We illustrate our results using 3-node and 4-node examples.
D41|Does banking competition alleviate or worsen credit constraints faced by small- and medium-sized enterprises? Evidence from China|Banking competition may enhance or hinder the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises. Using a survey on the financing of such enterprises in China, combined with detailed bank branch information, we investigate how concentration in local banking market affects the availability of credit. We find that lower market concentration alleviates financing constraints. The widespread presence of joint-stock banks has a larger effect on alleviating these constraints, than the presence of city commercial banks, while the presence of state-owned banks has a smaller effect.
D41|A human relations paradox|We present a variant of a general equilibrium model with group formation to study how changes of non-consumptive benefits from group formation impact on the well-being of group members. We identify a human relations paradox: Positive externalities increase, but none of the group members gains in equilibrium. Moreover, a member who experiences an increase of positive emotional benefits in a group may become worse off in equilibrium.
D41|Redistribution and market efficiency: An experimental study|We study the interaction between competitive markets and income redistribution that reallocates unequal pre-tax market incomes away from the rich to the poor majority. In one setup, participants earn their income by trading in a double auction (DA) with exogenous zero or full redistribution. In another setup, after trading, they vote on redistributive tax policies in a majoritarian election with two competing candidates. This results in virtually full redistribution, even when participants have the opportunity to influence taxes by transferring money to the candidates. We find that the high redistribution reduces trading efficiency, but not as much as predicted if market participants trade randomly. This is because, rather than capitulating to the much lower trading incentives, many participants respond to redistribution by asking and bidding more conservatively in the DA, and in this way help to prevent further efficiency losses.
D41|Firms, shareholders, and financial markets|We study the influence of the financial market on the decisions of firms in the real market. To that end, we present a model in which the shareholders’ portfolio selection of assets and the decisions of the publicly traded firms are integrated through the market process. Financial access alters the objective function of the firms, and the market interaction of shareholders substantially influences firms’ behavior in the real sector. After characterizing the unique equilibrium, we show that the financial sector integrates the preferences of all shareholders into the decisions for production and ownership structure. The participation from investors in the financial market also limits the firms’ ability to manipulate real prices, i.e., there is a loss of market power in the real sector. Note that, while the loss of market power changes expected profits, it is not detrimental to shareholders since the expected return of equity share depends on the variance (and not the mean) of profits. Indeed, any change in expected profits is absorbed by the financial price. We also show that financial access increases production, thereby altering the distribution of profits. In particular, financial access induces firms to take on more risk. Finally, financial access makes the relationship between risk-aversion and risk-taking ambiguous. For example, it is possible that an increase in risk-aversion leads to more risk-taking, i.e., the variance of real profits increases.
D41|The Optimal Share of Variable Renewables: How the Variability of Wind and Solar Power affects their Welfare-optimal Deployment|This paper estimates the welfare-optimal market share of wind and solar power, explicitly taking into account their output variability. We present a theoretical valuation framework that consistently accounts for the impact of fluctuations over time, forecast errors, and the location of generators in the power grid on the marginal value of electricity from renewables. Then the optimal share of wind and solar power in Northwestern Europe's generation mix is estimated from a calibrated numerical model. We find the optimal long-term wind share to be 20%, three times more than today; however, we also find significant parameter uncertainty. Variability significantly impacts results: if winds were constant, the optimal share would be 60%. In addition, the effect of technological change, price shocks, and policies on the optimal share is assessed. We present and explain several surprising findings, including a negative impact of CO2 prices on optimal wind deployment.
D41|Switching costs in competitive health insurance markets|In this paper we investigate the possible presence of switching costs when consumers are offered the opportunity to change their basic health insurance provider. We focus on the specific case of Switzerland which implemented a pure form of competition in basic health insurance markets. We identify several barriers to switching, namely choice overload, status quo bias, the possession of supplementary contracts for enrollees in bad health, firm’s pricing strategies based on providing low price supplementary products, poor regulation of reserves and the limitations of the previous risk-equalization mechanism which left room for risk selection practices.
D41|The Rejective Core of an Economy with Profit-Making Firms|"In this paper, we consider an economy with producers and introduce a kind of ""money"" into the economy in order to incorporate producers' behaviors of profit maximization. We define a modified concept of ""rejective core"" which depends on both consumers' and producers' criterions, and prove the identity of the rejective core and the competitive equilibrium. Namely, the purpose of this paper is to characterize the competitive equilibrium in Arrow-Debreu type economies by applying the concept of ""rejective core""."

D41|Bank Recapitalization And Market Concentration In Ghanaâ€™S Banking Industry: A Herfindahl-Hirschman Index Analysis|Using Concentration Ratio and Herfindahl-Hirschman Index techniques, the paper investigates the concentration levels of the banking industry in Ghana and forecasts the future concentration levels of the industry should consolidations triggered by the new bank recapitalization policy occur in the industry. The study finds that the HHI indices provide evidence for the contention that for the past eight years the banking industry in Ghana has been highly competitive with no signs of concentration. Evidence also exists to underpin the conclusion that any consolidation of four banks or less stimulated by the new bank recapitalization policy will not upset the existing market concentration. However, consolidation of five or more banks will culminate in high concentration which will be inimical to the interest of customers. The paper, therefore, recommends that, all things being equal, policy makers should permit consolidation of four or less banks if that is the only way the banks will meet the new bank recapitalization requirement.
D41|Approximations in power transmission planning: implications for the cost and performance of renewable portfolio standards|Renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) are popular market-based mechanisms for promoting development of renewable power generation. However, they are usually implemented without considering the capabilities and cost of transmission infrastructure. We use single- and multi-stage planning approaches to find cost-effective transmission and generation investments to meet single and multi-year RPS goals, respectively. Using a six-node network and assuming a linearized DC power flow, we examine how the lumpy nature of network reinforcements and Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law can affect the performance of RPSs. First, we show how simplified planning approaches that ignore transmission constraints, transmission lumpiness, or Kirchhoff’s voltage law yield distorted estimates of the type and location of infrastructure, as well as inaccurate compliance costs to meet the renewable goals. Second, we illustrate how lumpy transmission investments and Kirchhoff’s voltage law result in compliance costs that are nonconvex with respect to the RPS targets, in the sense that the marginal costs of meeting the RPS may decrease rather than increase as the target is raised. Thus, the value of renewable energy certificates (RECs) also depends on the network topology, as does the amount of noncompliance with the RPS, if noncompliance is penalized but not prohibited. Finally, we use a multi-stage planning model to determine the optimal generation and transmission infrastructure for RPS designs that set multiyear goals. We find that the optimal infrastructure to meet RPS policies that are enforced year-by-year differ from the optimal infrastructure if banking and borrowing is allowed in the REC market.

D41|"Monopolistic Competition vs Oligopoly in the ""Large Economy"": How Much Is Difference?"|The paper studies a market of horizontally differentiated good under increasing return to scale and exogenous number of firms. Three concepts of equilibria are compared: Cournot, Bertrand and monopolistic competition. Under fairly general assumptions on consumer's preferences, it is shown that Lerner index is the highest in Cournot case, monopolistic competition provides the lowest one and Bertrand equilibrium takes intermediate position. When the number of firms N increases, both oligopolistic equilibria converge to monopolistic competitive equilibrium with rate 1/ N . Thus the study generalizes the similar results on markets of homogeneous goods.

D41|Preventing Banking Crises--with Private Insurance?| In this article, we review the functioning of private insurance against banking crises and identify its potential. The essential idea is that banks are recapitalized by private investors when negative events would otherwise cause a write-down of capital--or even bank insolvency. There are two modes of private insurance: pure insurance contracts and contingent debt contracts. In the former, funding of banks and insurance are separated, whereas in the latter, debt holders provide insurance. We summarize the main insights regarding the potential and limits of private insurance. We also discuss how such crisis insurance could be strengthened through complementary regulatory measures. Finally, we outline the overall pecking order of buffers and insurance for banking systems. (JEL codes: D41, E4, G2) Copyright The Author 2013.

D41|A Price Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration| This article presents a perfectly competitive model of firm boundary decisions and study their interplay with product demand, technology, and welfare. Integration is privately costly but is effective at coordinating production decisions; nonintegration is less costly but coordinates relatively poorly. Output price influences the choice of ownership structure: integration increases with the price level. At the same time, ownership affects output, because integration is more productive than nonintegration. For a generic set of demand functions, equilibrium delivers heterogeneity of ownership and performance among ex ante identical enterprises. The price mechanism transmutes demand shifts into industry-wide reorganizations and generates external effects from technological shocks: productivity changes in some firms may induce ownership changes in others. If the enterprise managers have full title to its revenues, market equilibrium ownership structures are second-best efficient. When managers have less than full revenue claims, equilibrium can be inefficient, with too little integration. JEL Codes: D21, D23, D41, L11, L14, L22. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.
D41|Coercion, Conflict, and Commodities|Why do armed groups sometimes coerce and sometimes not? Civilian suffering due to coercion in conflicts is larger; yet, anecdotal evidence suggests that armed groups often choose not to coerce. To explain the observed variation in coercive practices, I combine a two-sector specific-factos trade model with a model of violence. Armed tgroups operating in the resourc esector and allocate military reosurces between conflict and coercion, which captures more land and labour respectively. The model shows that coercion depends, not only on economic factors, but also the military landscape and the interactin between the two. First, coercion is higher if labour scare or extraction labour-intensive. Second, coercion is high if one group is dominant, relative to the others. Third, the impact of the prcie of the commodity depends on the distribution of military strength: coercion increases with price if one group is dominant, but this effect is reversed if military power is highly decentralised. The first result is consistent with historical accounts of the re-emergence of serfdom in 16th century Russia, and the prevalence of slavery in West Africa. The second result explains why coercion decreased in the Kivu privinces after 2002: the Rwandan Army, by far the most powerful group, evacuated. The third result explains why the rubber boom in late 19th lead to a highly coercive regime in the Congo Free State, but less so in Amazonia. The Congo Free State had a monopoly, but conflict between Spanish and Portuguese colonies escalated during the boom, reducing their coercive power. It further explains why, during the protracted Civil War in Sierra Leone, coercion was common in the rice plantations, but not the diamond mines. The number of battles were higher in the diamond-rich areas, but level of civilian victimisation less. With land the valueable factor of productions, violence was allocated to conflict, not coercion.
D41|A Competitive Model of (Super)Stars|Following Rosen &lsqb;1981&rsqb;, superstar effects (earnings convex in quality and a few firms reaping a large share of market earnings) occur with imperfect substitution between sellers, low (and possibly declining) marginal cost of output, and marginal cost falling as quality increases. However, markets without such characteristics have superstar effects, and the main result from the superstar model — small quality differences result in large earnings differences — may not hold. A competitive model can yield superstar effects when a few firms have quality significantly higher than others and cost increases in output, provided cost does not increase too rapidly in quality.
D41|Assessing competition policy on economic development|Implementation of competition policies is one of the most recommended strategies to developing countries as a tool for achieving economic development. Using a panel dataset of over 100 countries and 7 years (from 2005-2011), I estimate the effect of competition on economic development, and also determine which of the comprehensive policy factors are the most relevant for increasing competition. A fixed effects instrumental variable approach is used. I find that competition intensity positively impacts economic development. The estimate is highly significant when effectiveness of antimonopoly policy and squared years of experience handling competition law are used as instruments for competition intensity. Political stability is shown to be a determinant for higher achievement in development. Macroeconomic environment and financial market development are also significant factors that contribute to higher economic development. Less developed countries should work intensively to improve their institutional quality and implement pro-competitive policies that are not only related to competition laws.
D41|Edgeworth equilibria: separable and non-separable commodity spaces|Consider a pure exchange differential information economy with an atomless measure space of agents and a Banach lattice as the commodity space. If the commodity space is separable, then it is shown that the private core coincides with the set of Walrasian expectations allocations. In the case of non-separable commodity space, a similar result is also established if the space of agents is decomposed into countably many different types.
D41|Stimulace hospodářství z pohledu rakouské školy<BR>[Stimulation of Economy According to the Austrian School]|The aim of the article is to explore how the results of the U. S. subprime mortgage crisis influenced economic policy of governments in highly developed countries. It analyses consequences of a state intervention especially for government budgets and a rise of government debts. Then the article discusses the point of view of the Austrian school. Austrian economists argue a state is not an economic subject and its fiscal policy is very dangerous for effective allocation of the available resources of production´s factors. They advocate a society with a small government and liberal economic policy. The author believes that Austrian approach to economic problems is more realistic and more pertinent than the approach of those, who demand more government intervention.
D41|A Price Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration under Two-Sided Productivity Heterogeneity|Organizational design (firm boundaries) is an important aspect of a firm's internal structure and is affected by market conditions. Our main focus in this paper is on firm boundaries - firms' integration decisions - and how these decisions interact with product market competition, in a setting where firms in the market are heterogeneous with respect to their productivity. Existing research in the organizational industrial organization (OIO) literature has highlighted a price effect, which affects firms' integration incentives. We identify a second effect (revenue share effect) which works in the opposite direction from the price effect. The revenue share effect arises,very naturally, to ensure a stable equilibrium, when heterogeneous firms match endogenously in the market, and has profound implications for organizational design. We show that integration decisions can be non-monotonic with respect to firm productivity. Moreover, depending on the market distribution of firm productivities, a higher market price can induce more or fewer firms to integrate. In the latter case, the industry supply curve can be backward-bending. Market equilibria can be ownership inefficient, with 'too much' or 'too little' integration. These results are in contrast to existing literature and generate new empirical and policy implications.
D41|Competing Paradigms of Competition|This study aims at the empirical investigation of the different conceptualizations of competition with the data available for Turkish manufacturing from 1980 to 2001. The analysis specifically takes into account the classical/Marxian view of competition, which rigorously recognizes the dynamic and turbulent nature of capitalist competition and is based on the concept of â€œregulating capital.â€ Time series analysis is conducted in order to test for the persistence of profit rate differentials among 3-digit classification of the manufacturing industries. The analysis, by differentiating between the intra- and inter-industry competition, addresses the classical/Marxian emphasis on the inter-industry trends of equalization. For this purpose, industry-based data instead of firm-based data are used. Lastly, the incremental rate of profit as the return to regulating capital is taken as the basis for establishing what is actually equalized in the course of competitive process. The analysis is conducted both for the average and incremental rates of return for a comparative view. The results show that while the average rate of profit shows significant persistence in most of the industries, the incremental rate does not. These results are in accordance with the classical/Marxian long-run center of gravity dynamics.JEL Classifications: B12, B51, D41, D49, L10, L60
D41|Price dynamics in an exchange economy|The pure exchange model is the foundation of the neoclassical theory of value, yet equilibrium predictions and price adjustment dynamics for this model remained untested prior to the experiment reported in this paper. With the exchange economy replicated several times, prices and allocations in most experiment sessions adjust toward the competitive equilibrium in continuous double auction trading, though adjustment is much slower than in previous commodity flow (or perishable good) double auction market experiments. Price adjustment is evaluated by comparing its extent within each market replication (or trading period) to its extent across trading periods. More price adjustment occurs within trading periods than across trading periods, so price adjustment data are evaluated with the disequilibrium Hahn process model (Hahn and Negishi in Econometrica 30:463–469, 1962 ) of within-period trades. This paper introduces a stochastic version the Hahn process model and demonstrates that a linear approximation to this stochastic model yields an autoregressive process with a near unit root when the adjustment rate is low. In effect, the autoregressive price adjustment model studied extensively by time series econometricians over the past 30 years can be viewed as a reduced form of a stochastic disequilibrium exchange economy price adjustment model. Estimation of the model demonstrates that price adjustment in the exchange economy experiment is considerably slower than in economies without income effects, which suggests that the price discovery process may be a significant factor in the slow adjustment documented by applied econometricians.

D41|Border collision bifurcations in boom and bust cycles|Boom and bust cycles are widely documented in the literature on industry dynamics. Rigidities and delays in capacity adjustment in combination with bounded rational behavior have been identified as central driving forces. We construct a model that features only these two elements and we show that this is indeed sufficient to reproduce some stylized facts of a boom and bust cycle. The bifurcation diagrams summarizing the dynamic behavior reveal complex cycles and in particular also abrupt changes in the nature of these cycles. We apply new insights from the mathematical theory of piecewise smooth dynamic systems—in particular, results from the theory of border collision bifurcations—and show that the very existence of borders such as capacity constraints or nonnegativity constraints may lie behind abrupt changes in the dynamic behavior of economic variables.

D41|Pricing and investments in matching markets|Different markets are cleared by different types of prices—seller-specific prices that are uniform across buyers in some markets, and personalized prices tailored to the buyer in others. We examine a setting in which buyers and sellers make investments before matching in a competitive market. We introduce the notion of premuneration values—the values to the transacting agents prior to any transfers— created by a buyer-seller match. Personalized price equilibrium outcomes are independent of premuneration values and exhibit inefficiencies only in the event of “coordination failures,” while uniform-price equilibria depend on premuneration values and in general feature inefficient investments even without coordination failures. There is thus a trade-off between the costs of personalizing prices and the inefficient investments under uniform prices. We characterize the premuneration values under which uniform-price equilibria similarly exhibit inefficiencies only in the event of coordination failures.

D41|The analytics of search with posted prices|This paper investigates the characteristics of the optimal posted price in the standard sequential search paradigm. Much of the intuition gleaned from the extensive sequential search literature in which the seller adopts a reservation price does not carry over to the posted price setting. For example, an increase in buyer valuations can lead to a reduction in the optimal posted price. We do, however, provide sufficient conditions on the hazard rate function h which ensure that an increase in demand induces an increase in the optimal posted price. As exhibited herein, the analysis of the posted price model depends critically upon analytical properties of h. Amongst the issues treated are the elasticity of demand, finite horizon, sale of multiple units, and competitive equilibrium.
D41|Behavioral Heterogeneity in Large Economies|Grandmont\'s ([14]) notion of behavioral heterogeneity is reformulated in a non parametric set-up such that the space of budget share functions admits a ``uniform\'\' probability distribution. If the population is distributed according to this measure, the aggregate budget share function is constant with respect to changes in prices and income. This exact insensitivity of the market budget share function is known to imply uniqueness and global stability of any competitive equilibrium. Here, it is not explained by any insensitivity property at the micro-economic level, but rather by a perfect \'balancing effect\'. Eventually, it is proved that the insensitivity property holds approximately for a finite population sufficiently close to, but distinct from, the perfectly heterogenous one.
D41|Lost but Not Forgotten: Attrition and Follow-up in the Indonesia Family Life Survey|"Data from three waves of the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) are used to examine follow-up and attrition in the context of a large scale panel survey conducted in a low-income setting. Household-level attrition between the baseline and first follow-up four years later is less than 6 percent; the cumulative attrition between the baseline and second follow-up after a five-year hiatus is 5 percent. Attrition is low in the IFLS because movers are followed: around 12 percent of households that were interviewed in the first follow-up had moved from their location at baseline. About half of those households were ""local movers."" The other half, many of whom had moved to a new province, were interviewed during a second sweep through the study areas (""second tracking""). Regression analyses indicate that in terms of household-level characteristics at baseline, households interviewed during second tracking are very similar to those not interviewed in the follow-up surveys. Local movers are more similar to the households found in the baseline location in the follow-ups. The results suggest that the information content of households interviewed during second tracking is probably high. The cost of following those respondents is relatively modest in the IFLS. Although the analytical value of reinterviewing movers will vary depending on the specifics of the research, we conclude that, in general, tracking movers is a worthwhile investment in longitudinal household surveys conducted in settings where communication infrastructure is limited."
D41|On Core-Walras (Non-) Equivalence for Economies with a Large Commodity Space|Addressing a question raised by Tourky and Yannelis (1998), we show that given any non-separable Banach space as commodity space and giben any atomless measure space of agents, there is an economy fulfilling the usual standard assumptions but having a core allocation not supportable as a Walrasion equilibrium, and in fact, having no Walrasian equilibria at all. We shall also consider the framework of economies with weakly compact consuption sets as developed by Khan and Yannelis (1991). We prove that in this setting the core of an economy with a measure space of traders is non-empty, regardless of wheter or not the commodity space is separable. On the other hand, we show that when the commodity space contains weakly compact subsets that are non-separable, than, again, there are atomless economies for which core-Walras equivalence fails. Thus, in particular, for very large commodity spaces the notion of the core seems to be more robust than that of a Walrasian equilibrium.
D41|Capacity Choices and Price Competition in Experimental Markets|We report on experimental duopoly markets with heterogeneous goods. In these markets, sellers first choose capacities and then prices. While capacities remain fixed for either five or ten periods, prices have to be chosen in every period. The experiments starts with two sets of exogenously predetermined capacities. Independently of the distribution of capacities is, a unique pure-strategy in prices is subgame perfect. In equilibrium, capacities should correspond to the Cournot prediction. Given capacities, price-setting behavior is in general consistent with the theory. Average capacities converge above the Cournot level. Capacities converge at the industry level but are somewhat dispersed. Sellers rarely manage to cooperate.

D41|Quadratic Concavity and Determinacy of Equilibrium| One of the central features of classical models of competitive markets is the generic determinacy of competitive equilibria. For smooth economies with a finite number of commodities and a finite number of consumers, almost all initial endowments admit only a finite number of competitive equilibria, and these equilibria vary (locally) smoothly with endowments; thus equilibrium comparative statics are locally determinate. This paper establishes parallel results for economies with finitely many consumers and infinitely many commodities. The most important new condition we introduce, quadratic concavity, rules out preferences in which goods are perfect substitutes globally, locally, or asymptotically. Our framework is sufficiently general to encompass many of the models that have proved important in the study of continuous-time trading in financial markets, trading over an infinite time horizon, and trading of finely differentiated commodities.

D41|Existence of stationary equilibrium in the markets for new and used durable goods|We prove the existence of stationary equilibrium in the primary and secondhand markets for an indivisible consumer durable in a general model with stochastic degradation and endogenous scrappage decisions. Unlike Rust (1985), we introduce transaction costs in the model as a motivation for consumer holdings of durables across multiple quality levels. In addition, we allow for multiple types of durables (e.g., Porsche and BMW). Since we use a fixed point theorem in making the existence argument, we do not need to invoke the single-crossing property on consumer tastes.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

In this paper we seek to verify to what extent the short-term variability of the HICPs can be explained by regular infra-year movements which we then attempt to estimate. We find evidence that seasonal movements characterise most price series, though some differences arise across countries and sub-indices. The seasonal adjustment of these indices raises a number of important questions of aggregation.

D41|Nord Pool: A Power Market Without Market Power|Regulatory reform in the Nordic electricity-supply markets has resulted in a single integrated Nordic electricity market. This paper performs an econometric study of market power in the spot market of Nord Pool, the joint Nordic power exchange. I use a dynamic extension of the Bresnahan-Lau model, and weekly data for the period from 1996 through April 1999. To my knowledge, this is the first study of power markets that is not able to reject the hypothesis of perfect competition. The most likely reason for this absence of market power is the low ownership concentration in generation in the integrated Nordic electricity market.
D41|Bargaining, coalitions and competition|We study a Gale-like matching model in a large exchange economy, in which trade takes place through non-cooperative bargaining in coalitions of finite size. Under essentially the same conditions of core equivalence, we show that the strategic equilibrium outcomes of our model coincide with the Walrasian allocations of the economy. Our method of proof makes use of the theory of the core. With respect to previous work, our positive implementation result applies to a substantially larger class of economies: the model relaxes differentiability and convexity of preferences, and also admits an arbitrary number of divisible and indivisible goods.

D41|A párhuzamos versenyelmélet koncepciója és néhány hazai tanulsága<BR>[The concept of parallel competition theory and some lessons from it for Hungary]|A párhuzamos versenyelmélet koncepciójának kiindulópontja: egyes látszólagos ellentétek együttes érvényesítése jelentős versenyelőnyt ad a vállalatok számára. Ilyen ellentét a kisebb költségigény és a tőkeigényes nagyobb hatásfok; az egyszerre globális és lokális alkalmazkodás; az egyre mélyebbre ásó specialisták és a tudásukat integráló munkacsoportok; az egységes termelési rendszerbe illeszkedő nagyvállalatok, valamint a kis- és a közép vállalatok; a mind nagyobb felelősséget hordozó vállalati funkciók stabilitása és határaik légiesítése; a sorozat- és tömeggyártás egyéni igényeket is kielégítő technológiája; végül az informatika teret és időt összezsugorító, de egyúttal ki is tágító hatása. A tanulmányok mindezek ismertetése után bemutat néhány módszert, amelyekkel megvalósíthatók ezek a versenyelőnyök. Végül levonja a párhuzamos versenyelőnyök megközelítésének jelentősebb tanulságait a különböző típusú magyar vállalatok szempontjából.
D41|Bidding in an Electricity Pay-as-Bid Auction|One of the main elements of the recent reform of electricity trading in the United Kingdom is the change from a uniform price auction in the wholesale market to discriminatory pricing. We analyze this change under two polar market structures (perfectly competitive and monopolistic supply), with demand uncertainty. We find that under perfect competition there is a trade-off between efficiency and consumer surplus between the two auction rules. We also establish that a move from uniform to discriminatory pricing under monopoly conditions has a negative impact on profits and output (weakly), a positive impact on consumer surplus, and ambiguous implications for welfare and average prices.

D41|Foundations of a revisited concept of perfect competition|Eléments pour un concept rénove de la concurrence parfait. L’article fait une analyse générale des principales conditions traditionnelles de la concurrence parfait, rapportée aussi à la réalité économique contemporaine que aux modèles de la concurrence imparfaite. Lorsque certain de cette conditions ne sont pas exclusifs ou indispensables pour la “perfection” de la concurrence, ils est possible et justifié d’offre une nouvelle “définition” – plus pratique – de la concurrence parfait. Une concurrence effective et efficace, réelle et ne plussiez pas prépondérante théorique. Une concurrence caractérisé par un nombre relatif élevé des participants (mais pas infinie), accès égal aux informations (et ne pas une information parfait et absolu), la répartition des ressources exclusivement par l’action des lois économique, la liberté d’entrer sur marché et des échanges
