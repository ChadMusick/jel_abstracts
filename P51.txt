P51|The fundamental causes of economic growth: a comparative analysis of the total factor productivity growth of European agriculture, 1950-2005|In recent decades, the debate on economic growth has largely focused the role-played by institutions, geography, trade, and culture. In line with this concern, this study analyses the underlying causes of agricultural productivity growth in Europe in the second half of the twentieth century. To achieve this objective, a calculation of the Total Factor Productivity growth in European agriculture is made and an econometric model is proposed to determine the importance of these fundamental causes. Our study highlights that inclusive institutions, policies to support agriculture that do not discourage innovation, qualified human capital and a full openness to international trade are key factors for favouring growth of productivity in agriculture.
P51|Wirtschaftspolitik-Fehlorientierung des Westens nach 1989: Bankenkrise, Globalisierungs-Ordnungsdefizit und Desintegrationsdruck|Der Zerfall der sozialistischen Wirtschaftssysteme vollzog sich Ende der 1980er Jahre in den Ländern Osteuropas und der Sowjetunion, wobei osteuropäische EU-Länder einen ökonomischen Aufholprozess begonnen haben. 1991 hat aber der Westen teilweise keine vernünftigen Konsequenzen aus der beginnenden Systemtransformation gezogen und eine Phase geringer politischer Selbstdisziplin bei manchen westlichen Regierungen bzw. eine Expansion des Populismus - erklärbar unter Bezug auf Harry-Johnson-Ansätze und Identity Economics - begonnen. Die Transatlantische Bankenkrise ergab sich aus überzogener Bankenderegulierung in den USA und UK, die faktisch auch die Länder der Eurozone zur Bankenderegulierung brachte und sich absehbar wiederholen könnte; auch als Folge des BREXIT. Bei der Digitalisierung fehlt ein Ordnungsrahmen. Dessen Fehlen hat zu einer Art digitalem Sozialismus geführt – mit negativen Konsequenzen für Effizienz in der Marktwirtschaft und für die Demokratie. Mit dem Populismus in UK, dem strukturellen US-Populismus – inklusive Anti-Multilateralismus - und dem Anti-Liberalismus in Teilen der EU(27) steht der Westen vor einer Abstiegs- und die EU vor einer politischen Spannungsphase; eine sinnvolle Reformagenda wäre eine Stabilisierungschance für die EU, wird aber teilweise blockiert, während zugleich verfrühte Vergemeinschaftung, etwa bei Einlagensicherung, droht. Der US-Sachverständigenrat unter Trump sieht die USA wohlfahrtsmäßig vor Nordeuropa, was eine Fehlsicht ist.
P51|Undoing Gender with Institutions. Lessons from the German Division and Reuniﬁcation|Using the 41-year division of Germany as a natural experiment, we show that the GDR’s gender-equal institutions created a culture that has undone the male breadwinner norm and its consequences. Since reuniﬁcation, East Germany still differs from West Germany not only by a higher female contribution to household income, but also because East German women can earn more than their husbands without having to increase their number of housework hours, put their marriage at risk or withdraw from the labor market. By contrast, the norm of higher male income, and its consequences, are still prevalent in West Germany.
P51|The relationship between trust, cognitive skills, and democracy - Evidence from 30 countries around the world|Based on highly comparable data from the OECD PIAAC Programme, this note analyzes the relationship between generalized trust and cognitive skills among 30 countries around the world. The results show that the strength and direction of the relationship is not a universal characteristic but varies substantially among countries worldwide. A detailed descriptive analysis of this variation provides evidence that the relationship strengthens with the level of democracy in a country. In a second step, German separation and reunification is used as external variation in the level of democracy in the German PIAAC subsample. The results support the evidence from the cross-country analysis. Thus, the institutional framework in a country not only shapes an individual's level of trust but also amplifies the relationship between individual characteristics such as cognitive skills and generalized trust.
P51|Welfare models and demand-led growth regimes before and after the financial and economic crisis|Recently, several interesting attempts have been made at connecting comparative political economy (CPE) approaches, as the Varieties of Capitalism (VoC) theory, with post-Keynesian (PK) research on different demand-led growth regimes in modern capitalism, and for the period of finance-dominated capitalism since the early 1980s in particular. However, we find several problems in the way Kaleckian and PK approaches are interpreted and integrated in modern CPE approaches. Therefore, we first clarify several ambiguities and misunderstandings of PK demand-led growth regimes and their empirical indicators in the recent CPE literature, and, following the recent PK literature, we provide a theoretically consistent and empirically applicable classification of demand and growth regimes under the conditions of finance-dominate capitalism. Second, instead of using the traditional VoC dual classification, we link and confront the PK demand and growth regimes with the recent evolution of Esping-Andersen's (1990) taxonomy which considers five welfare models. Third, we examine the relationships between demand-led growth regimes and welfare models, both before and after the 2007-9 global crisis. For this purpose, we share the qualitative taxonomy suggested by Hay and Wincott (2012), and additionally we quantitatively assess the degree of welfare of each country and its evolution by means of a 'principal component analysis' (PCA), which allows us to synthesize four socio-economic indicators in a multidimensional measure of welfare.
P51|Does Society Influence the Gender Gap in Risk Attitudes? Evidence from East and West Germany|Previous international research has shown that women are more risk averse than men. This gives rise to the question whether the gender gap in risk attitudes is shaped by the social environment. We address this question by examining risk attitudes among East and West Germans. Originated from different family policies during Germany’s separation, East Germans have more equal gender roles than West Germans. Thus, if the gender gap reflects socially constructed norms, it should be smaller among East Germans. Using data of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), our empirical analysis confirms this prediction. Specifically with respect to career and financial matters, the gender gap in risk tolerance is smaller among East Germans. We find no evidence that the East German gender gap has converged to the higher West German level after reunification. By contrast, the West German gap has narrowed over time.
P51|Undoing Gender with Institutions. Lessons from the German Division and Reunification|"Social scientists have provided empirical evidence that ""gender trumps money"", meaning that gender norms can be more powerful than economic rationality in shaping daily arrangements between spouses. In particular, when they deviate from the ""male breadwinner"" norm, women react by ""doing gender"", i.e. overplaying their feminine role by increasing the number of housework hours that they accomplish. The risk of divorce also increases when a woman earns more than her husband. This paper shows that, however powerful, these norms are cultural and can be trumped by institutions. We use the 41-year division of Germany as a natural experiment and look at differences between East and West Lander in terms of gender behavior after the German reunification. As most countries of the socialist bloc, the former GDR had designed institutions that were much more gender equalizing than their counterpart in the former FRG. We show that these institutions have created a culture that keeps inuencing behavior up to the current period. In particular, East Germany differs from West Germany in the sense that a woman can earn more than her husband without ""doing gender"" and without putting her marriage at risk."
P51|Types of Institutions and Well-Being of Self-Employed and Paid Employees in Europe|This paper analyzes the role of different types of institutions, such as entre- preneurship-facilitating entry conditions, labor market regulations, quality of government, and perception of corruption for individual well-being among self-employed and paid employed individuals. Well-being is operationalized by job and life satisfaction of individuals in 32 European countries measured by data from EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). We find that institutions never affected both occupational groups in opposite ways. Our findings indicate that labor market institutions do not play an im- portant role well-being. The results suggest that fostering an entrepreneurial society in Europe is a welfare enhancing strategy that benefits both, the self- employed and paid employees.

P51|Market mechanisms in conventional economics and Islamic Economics|This article describes the market as a meeting place between demand and supply for the type of goods or services. In a capitalist economic system, buyers and sellers bargain with each other to determine prices that give freedom to the market and the government must not intervene which can disrupt the market balance. While the socialist economic system has a view by eliminating the role of markets and the government plays an active role in resolving and regulating all economic problems. In Islamic economics, the market is left freely or the government distorts the existence of a market mechanism. Using a comparative approach to the existing economic system in the world, this article concludes that the Islamic economic system combines market freedom and the role of government that emphasizes the principle of maslahah (goodness), which is a condition of market justice that emphasizes the fulfillment of people's needs in achieving welfare (falah).
P51|Kritik atas Sistem Bunga Perbankan Konvensional dan Solusi Moneter Islam|The purpose of this study is to review some of the criticisms of the Bank's interest system. Issues related to whether bank interest including usury or not usury has been debated and is still being discussed to date by Islamic economists. But now there has been criticism from Western or Conventional Economists of the negative impact of the Bank's interest in the economy. The method used is a qualitative method using descriptive analysis and literature review. From these experiences, the Islamic Monetary System which is free from interest can be a solution to realize prosperity and guarantee economic injustice. this system is expected not only to increase the money in circulation but how to be able to improve the performance of the real sector in accordance with Islamic sharia. Because basically in the Islamic monetary system, it is not only aimed at material welfare but aims at moral well-being. There are at least five values of Islamic economic instruments that can be integrated into the economic system, namely zakat, waqf, social security, the justice system in resolving economic disputes and sharia financial institutions.
P51|Do economic freedom and board structure matter for bank stability and bank performance?|This paper investigates the effects of economic freedom, regulations and bank governance on bank performance and risk-taking in 18 European countries for the period 2004–2016. To this end, we use the Fraser economic freedom index and its sub-components namely credit, labor and business market regulation. Our results reveal that economic freedom increases bank performance and contributes to financial stability and soundness. Moreover, we show that liberal credit, labor and business regulation improves the profitability of banks and reduces risk-taking. Regarding the bank governance variables, we find that a large board increases the probability of default whilst the results are mixed for bank performance. Also, we show that experienced directors are associated with less risk-taking and better bank performance. The impact of female directors is positive on bank performance. Regarding the risk-taking of banks, we find that, in a liberal environment, women lead to less credit risk. Finally, the compensation of directors increases bank performance and reduces risk-taking. Our findings change depending on the time period and the location.

P51|Proprietà e controllo delle grandi imprese: un’interpretazione del resistibile declino italiano|Il capitalismo italiano si presenta nel dopoguerra con un ampio settore di grandi imprese pubbliche che garantiscono una separazione estrema fra proprietà e controllo e altrimenti con imprese, anche di grande dimensione, solo a conduzione familiare. Diversamente da altri paesi capitalistici, è assente nel settore privato del capitalismo italiano una modalità organizzativa che consenta di gestire le imprese a persone capaci ma prive della ricchezza necessaria per controllarle. Le privatizzazioni, fatte senza una adeguata riforma del governo societario delle grandi imprese private, hanno paradossalmente confermato l’importanza delle imprese pubbliche per il contesto italiano. Il capitalismo privato italiano non solo non riesce a generare un numero soddisfacente di grandi imprese , ma finisce con il gestire peggio dello Stato le imprese pubbliche che vengono privatizzate. Al contrario, le imprese trasformate in società per azioni, di cui lo Stato ha mantenuto direttamente o indirettamente il controllo, sono ora meno gravate da obiettivi politici impropri e riescono a tornare al loro iniziale obiettivo di separare proprietà e controllo, favorendo così l’affermarsi di organizzazioni di grande dimensione. Il declino italiano è dovuto a una struttura di imprese troppo piccole, a regole che non incentivano il passaggio a grandi imprese manageriali, alla convinzione che la piccola dimensione fosse il futuro della cosiddetta economia della conoscenza e alla incapacità di comprendere che le privatizzazioni avrebbero aggravato questi problemi dimensionali. In assenza di lavori qualificati offerti da grandi imprese, molti giovani italiani sono stati costretti a emigrare. Il resistibile declino italiano può solo essere fermato con politiche che tengano conto delle lezioni che ci ha fornito la nostra storia più recente.
P51|Monetary policy transmission to Russia & Eastern Europe|In this paper, we argue that the ECB's unconventional monetary policy announcements have generated significant spillover effects in Russia and Eastern Europe. The hypothesis is tested using OLS estimations of event-based regressions on monetary policy event dummies and seven financial variables in eleven East European countries including Russia. Overall, the empirical results associate the ECB's unconventional policy announcements with the appreciation of East European currencies, rising stock market indices as well as falling long-term government bond yields and lower sovereign CDS spreads in Eastern Europe and Russia. Notably, bilateral integration with the eurozone is a key determinant of the strength of spillovers, with spillovers strongest in non-euro EU countries and weakest in non-EU East European countries. Interestingly, we find differentiated strength of spillovers to Russia compared to other non-EU East European countries, which we attribute to its fixed exchange rate regime. Lastly, we test for the presence of the portfolio rebalancing and confidence transmission channels.
P51|A new societal contract|"This paper argues that the traditional societal contract that underlies the market economy has run its course and needs to be replaced by a new contract, based on a new conception of the ""empowering economy."" Whereas different societal contracts are relevant to different societies, there must be some features that all societal contracts will have in common, in order to address some basic human needs that every thriving society must satisfy and to promote popular approval for multilateral agreements to address multilateral problems. The paper proposes a new societal contract that promotes three building blocks of economic policies: (1) automatic stabilizers that reduce inequalities of economic power, (2) policies that focus not just on material prosperity, but also on personal and social empowerment and (3) policies that develop the human capabilities of cooperation and innovation."
P51|Militant Constitutionalism – A Promising Concept to Make Constitutional Backsliding less likely?|Constitutional democracy is in decline and many would-be autocrats try to elude constitutional constraints or even to exploit constitutions in their favor. We make a number of proposals for designing constitutions that are more resilient against such attempts. A first look at the empirical evidence, however, is sobering. There is little evidence that many appealing constitutional rules are able to increase constitutional resilience.
P51|The influence of political characteristics on the relationship between family control and firm performance: A meta-analytical approach|This multilevel meta-analytic study, based on 176 studies from 36 countries, examines the impact of political characteristics on the performance of family firms when comparing them to non-family firms (k=311, N=1,598,964). Our findings support the expectation that family firm characteristics are positively related to firm performance. We trace the variance between the studies to differences in certain political characteristics of the firms' countries of origin: government stability, regime stability, regime type and special periods of factionalism. In terms of government and regime stability, we find positive moderating effects on the focal relationship. We further show that periods of factionalism even reverse the superior performance of family firms. While the focal relationship becomes stronger in democracies, the relationship turns negative when looking at anocracies and becomes stronger and positive again considering autocracies. Finally, we reveal that government stability partly mediates the influence of the regime type. Therefore, government stability is a crucial condition for family firms to prosper in any political environment. Our study has several implications for the interplay between family firms and politics: First, the comparative advantage of family firms depends on specific political characteristics. Second, the ability of institutions to provide stability is more important for family firms than the actual institutional setting itself. Third, the impact of a political environment on economic success differs between family firms and nonfamily firms and therefore depends on the structure of the given economy.
P51|Alcoholic Drinks and Public Interest in case of Noe-liberalism and Islam|Francis Fukuyama has explained that searching a meaningful pattern in the past events of mankind will always show the clash of ideologies, in which each idea attempted to establish itself as the universal faith for organizing the society and institutions according to its specific blueprint. The triumph of liberalism over Marxism and Fascism, established the superiority of liberalism which brought history to an end-point of mankind ideological evolution and the universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human civilization. Have we in fact arrived at the end-point of mankind ideological evolution? Should we believe that neoliberalism is capable to provide greatest interest to the greatest number. Muslims believes that Islam already provided the best and everlasting ideology for the welfare of humanity. Islam is based on the logic of intervention in the socioeconomic affairs of mankind, while neoliberalist believes on non-intervention. On the basis of alcoholic drinks, this paper on one hand highlighted the relationship between public interest in case of neoliberalism and Islam, while on the other hand it also highlighted the internal contradiction. Results indicate that besides contradiction, neoliberalism is attributable to the greatest harm to the greatest number while in the dogma of Islam there is greatest benefits to the greatest number.
P51|Labor income taxation in open economies: current trends and options for reforms|We analyze both the theoretical framework of labor taxation in the open economy and important current reforms of labor taxation in countries worldwide including the introduction of “social VAT”. The current tax theory considers the reforms of labor income taxation related to the shifting of taxation from more mobile tax bases to the less mobile ones, taking into consideration the reduction of tax rates with simultaneous broadening of the tax base. Such a reform is intended to reduce the distortion effects of taxation, and, as a consequence, to reduce the tax burden on labor. The empirical section includes analysis of indicators of labor income taxation in OECD countries. We calculated the progressivity index of overall tax wedge and its components – personal income tax, employer’s and employee’s social security contributions. The results enabled cross-country comparisons: we found that in a most OECD members both employees’ and employers’ social security contributions systems are regressive or flat, while personal income tax systems are progressive in all countries except Hungary with flat tax schedule. Moreover, in OECD countries with highest GDP per capita the employees bear average labor tax burden with simultaneously low employers’ social security contributions rates.
P51|Alcoholic Drinks and Public Interest in case of Noe-liberalism and Islam|Fukuyama described the triumph of neoliberalism over hereditary monarchism, Marxism and Fascism, as the end-point of mankind ideological evolution and the universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human civilization. Muslims believes that Islam already provided the best and everlasting ideology for the welfare of humanity. The logic of Islam is based on the intervention in the socioeconomic affairs of mankind, while neoliberalist believes on non-intervention. Using the methodology of library research, this study investigated whether neoliberalism or Islam serves the greatest interest of the greatest numbers by taking the case of alcoholic drinks. Results indicate that besides the internal contradiction, neoliberalism is attributable to the greatest harm to the greatest number while in the dogma of Islam there is all-time greatest benefits to the greatest number.
P51|Relasi negara dan pasar bebas dalam mewujudkan keadilan ekonomi: Analisis sejarah keuangan publik Islam<BR>[State and free markets relation in realizing economic justice: Analysis of History of Islamic Public Finance]|The state becomes a political entity that is responsible for the collective affairs of the community so that it plays an important role in creating economic justice and prospering the community through instruments of development. However, the role of the government in carrying out development depends on public finance which in fact has problems in terms of management and implementation. In the perspective of Islamic economics, public finance is a top priority managed from the side of the sources of income and expenditure used in implementing pro-poor development so as to create prosperity for the community.
P51|Does studying in Hong Kong affect the ideological preferences of Chinese mainland undergraduates?|This paper investigates the ideological preferences of Chinese undergraduate students in relation to where they attend university. 101 survey responses are collected, and propensity score matching is used to filter the raw data. Regression results of ideological preferences on different dimensions using the ordinary least squares method reveal suggestive evidence that studying in Hong Kong will significantly liberalise the ideological preferences of Chinese mainland students in the political, economic, and cultural dimensions.
P51|Testing|School systems regularly use student assessments for accountability purposes. But, as highlighted by our conceptual model, different configurations of assessment usage generate performance-conducive incentives of different strengths for different stakeholders in different school environments. We build a dataset of over 2 million students in 59 countries observed over 6 waves in the international PISA student achievement test 2000-2015. Our empirical model exploits the country panel dimension to investigate reforms in assessment systems over time, where identification comes from taking out country and year fixed effects along with a rich set of student, school, and country measures. We find that the expansion of standardized external comparisons, both school-based and student-based, is associated with improvements in student achievement. The effect of school-based comparison is stronger in countries with initially low performance. Similarly, standardized monitoring without external comparison has a positive effect in initially poorly performing countries. By contrast, the introduction of solely internal testing and internal teacher monitoring including inspectorates does not affect student achievement. Our findings point out the pitfalls of overly broad generalizations from specific country testing systems.
P51|La diversité des capitalismes financiers, le cas des Fusions-Acquisition en France|Les opérations de fusions acquisitions sont des moments particuliers sur le marché du capital car elles finalisent un arrangement marchand : le capital d’une PME ou la filiale d’un groupe qui n’existait pas en tant qu’objet échangeable librement sur un marché, se trouve doter de qualités marchandes, d’une valeur financière et fait l’objet d’un achat. Observer ces opérations permet de comprendre comment le capital d’une entreprise devient un objet financier. Pour aborder empiriquement le secteur des fusions-acquisitions, nous avons travaillé sur la base CARFI qui a recensé 363 opérations de FUSAC en 2010 en France. Nous avons complété cette base en ajoutant le niveau des organisations financières. Nous avons mené une ACM qui nous a permis de distinguer trois régimes financiers : le capitalisme bancaire impliquant les banques européennes, le capitalisme financier lié à la présence de banques d’investissement américaines et le capitalisme financier d’entreprise associé à des conseillers indépendants.
P51|Finance, Intangibles and the privatization of knowledge|The paper examines different types of financial organization in a framework of incomplete law, under which the rights and the duties of the individuals are not completely specified. It focuses on the relationship between finance and specificity arguing that, while financial structure influences the degree of specificity of the assets, the degree of specificity of the assets influences the financial structure of firm. Because of these two-way relation, multiple possible equilibria exist and their selection is influenced by the nature the underlying assets. For this reason, the spectacular increase of intangibles is likely to have increased the role of equity finance relatively to traditional forms of banking, which are usually guaranteed by assets that, unlike most intangibles, have thick markets and fairly stable market values. The excessive financialization of the global economy mirrors the abnormal growth of intangibles and, in particular, of the assets related to the privatization of knowledge. International regulations should also tackle the negative effects of overenclosing the knowledge commons.
P51|Distributive Impacts of Social Protection Systems in OECD Countries: Public-Private Mix and Hidden Welfare States|Modern welfare states provide social protection benefits not only directly through the public sector but also through the private sector in conjunction with governmental engagement, e.g., by mandating employment-based provisions and giving tax breaks for voluntary transactions. Countries with sufficient social support provided largely via the private sector are called hidden welfare states. Integrating such private social expenditures, this paper estimates the overall distributive impacts of social protection systems in OECD countries, using the SOCX data base. Taking into account measurement biases in income inequality indices and reverse causality stemming from policy formation decisions, it found that the overall distributive impact decreases as the provision of social support relies more on the private sector and has no statistical difference from zero in some hidden welfare states.
P51|Proxy wars|Proxy wars are a key pattern of political conflict and interstate competition. Rather than resorting to direct conflicts, which are costly and entail a higher level of uncertainty, governments may opt for proxy wars, which may last longer, but are less costly and render them more immune to exogenous shocks. We start with the modeling of a direct war with two players where a static equilibrium may be neither realizable nor sustainable in the long run. Then, we offer a model of proxy war where the proposed equilibria are realizable, but not always sustainable in the long run. The consolidation level of the double principal-agent relationship predicts the continuation of conflict and thus the emergence of peace.
P51|A rural health supplement to the hookworm intervention in the American South|This project re-investigates the hookworm eradication efforts of the Rockefeller Foundation's Sanitary Commission (RSC) in the American South during the Progressive Era. The RSC worked to eradicate hookworm across 11 southern states between 1911 and 1915, efforts that have been linked to dramatic short- and long-term increases in human capital and labor productivity. Although useful from an identification standpoint, these single-shot interventions, in the absence of cooperative efforts to improve underlying conditions, have a mixed record of long-term effectiveness across public health research. The efficacy of deworming campaigns in particular has come under extensive scrutiny. The experience of the American South had stood as example of how a single-shot hookworm eradication program has improved outcomes; however, the robustness of this result has also recently come into question. A replication of the Bleakley (2007) seminal work investigating hookworm eradication finds faults with the robustness and interpretations of the results (Roodman 2017), and an investigation into the activities of the RSC has determined them unevenly distributed across hookworm-affected areas (Elman et. al 2013). Perhaps not coincidentally, the RSC's hookworm eradication program was not the only public health intervention that occurred in the rural South during the Progressive Era. Rural public health centers spread throughout the American South during this period, partially backed by the Rockefeller Foundation. Given the use of difference-in-difference methods using decennial census data, and the participation of the Rockefeller Foundation in the funding of these rural health centers, this is a potentially critical omission in the evaluation of the RSC efforts. In this project, we investigate the connection between these rural health centers and the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm eradication efforts, consider whether their presence explains effects attributed thereto, and examine their importance as a follow-up program to the initial hookworm intervention.
P51|Diversity & empire: Baltic Germans & comparative development|In this paper, we explore the long-run effects of cultural and imperial legacies in the Baltic region. Drawing evidence from the 1897 population census in the Russian Empire, we find that localities with a higher share of German historical population are inclined to be more developed in contemporary Latvia and Estonia. Furthermore, based on the Life-In-Transition Survey (LiTS), we use robust regression discontinuity and identify persistent differential patterns of socioeconomic and political preferences across the borders of the former imperial territories of Estland, Livonia (Swedish Livonia), Letgallia (Polish Livonia) and Courland. Hence, we argue for the persistence of legacies as drivers of divergent development paths in the regions of Latvia and Estonia.
P51|Circle of Fortune: The Long Term Impact of Western Customs Institutions in China|This paper studies the persistent impact of good institutions on economic development in China. By exploiting a British-driven institutional switch in part of China's customs stations in 1902, I find that counties that were more affected by the British customs institutions are also better developed today. Moreover, I show that the institutional switch was exogenous to the pre-colonial development, and I provide different estimation models to reveal a robust and causal relationship between good institutions and economic development.
P51|Institutional complementarities between labour laws and innovation|We analyse how institutional complementarities between employee representation laws and dismissal restrictions influence aggregate innovation outcomes. We argue that greater employee voice, due to improved employee representation legislations, may spur innovative effort by employees only when shareholders cannot renegotiate ex-ante agreements with workers over revenue sharing, by threatening dismissal. We perform a panel regression analysis, exploiting country-sector panel data over the 1977-2005 period, and find that stronger employee representation laws in the presence of stricter firing restrictions are in fact associated with higher patenting activity. Consistently with our theoretical argument, the magnitude of this empirical relationship is seen to be relatively larger in those sectors where the human capital contribution to production is higher. Implications for the analysis of economic institutions and for legal policy-making are proposed.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P51|Populismo y democracia antiliberal: La experiencia Argentina como paradigma|Este capítulo empieza con una definición de los elementos de consenso en la ciencia política sobre el populismo, la idea del “pueblo” versus un “otro”. Se agregan dos dimensiones bastante comunes en la caracterización del populismo, la de estilos de liderazgo personalistas y la de desprecio de instituciones tales como los sistemas de frenos y contrapesos. La segunda sección relaciona populismo con el concepto de democracia antiliberal, lo que nos lleva a establecer una contraposición entre populismo y democracia liberal. La tercera sección hace hincapié en la especial importancia del caso argentino en el desarrollo del concepto de populismo en la ciencia política. La cuarta sección analiza la dimensión más contestada de populismo en ciencia policía, la de su ideología. Esto lleva a una diferencia entre la idea de populismo en ciencia política con la idea en economía de populismo como políticas macroeconómicas insostenibles o inconsistentes. En la conclusión se pone el caso argentino dentro del contexto global actual.
P51|The Adaptive Liar: An Interactionist Approach of Multiple Dishonesty Domains|An extant debate in the morality literature centers on whether honesty is a stable and generalizable trait or whether honest behavior in one situation is independent from honest behavior in another situation. However, a third possibility is that tendencies toward dishonesty vary according to life domain. We conducted a cross-cultural study with participants in five countries (China, Colombia, Germany, Portugal, and the United States) to test whether dishonest tendencies vary according to domain. We hypothesized that countries vary in dishonesty according to domain, and that individuals’ tendencies toward dishonesty cluster by domain. Our survey asked participants to report the likelihood of engaging in dishonest behaviors across eight domains of life. The data support both our hypotheses. Our results thus corroborate that dishonesty is driven by the interplay of both individual differences and the circumstances surrounding deception.
P51|The third demographic dividend: measuring the “demographic tax” in the Arab Countries in Transition|This paper proposes a new approach to quantify the demographic dividend and shows evidence of a demographic tax in the Arab countries in Transition (ACT). Our question is whether a shift in the age structure (a larger share of working-age population) is translated into less (more) efficient labor supply and demand and whether these in turn reduce (increase) per-capita GDP. We propose estimates based on stochastic frontier analysis and quantile regressions. We find several interesting results. First, we document the existence of a dividend gap for the ACT with unchanging inefficiency scores over time between 56% and 79% in Yemen, 35% on average in Egypt, between 4% and 23% in Tunisia, between 7% and 30% in Libya, between 6% and 21% in Jordan. Morocco in the only country showing a demographic dividend with an average 30% inefficiency score that decreases over time. Secondly, the variables that are sources of these inefficiencies are the gender gap (with a significant influence of female labor market participation), insufficient secured jobs (this variable carry a positive sign with GDP per-capita and has the largest size among of the coefficients in the regression), own-account employment (which can be considered as a proxy of the importance of the informal sector) and a low public spending in health.
P51|Distrust and Political Turnover|We present findings that document one way in which a society's culture can affect political outcomes. Examining an annual panel of democratic countries over six decades, we show that severe economic downturns are more likely to cause political turnover in countries that have lower levels of generalized trust. The relationship is only found among democracies and for regular leader turnover, which suggests that the underlying mechanism works through leader accountability and the electoral process. Moreover, we find that the effects of trust on turnover are greatest during years with regularly-scheduled elections, and within democracies with a parliamentary system, a fully free media, and greater stability. The estimates suggest that generalized trust affects political institutions by influencing the extent to which citizens attribute economic downturns to the mistakes of politicians.
P51|The Value of a Statistical Life in a Dictatorship: Evidence from Stalin|We examine the value of a statistical life (VSL) in inter-war Soviet Union. Our approach requires to address the preferences of Stalin. We model these on the basis of the policy of statistical repression, which was an integral part of the Great Terror. We use regional variation in the victims generated by this policy to structurally estimate the value that Stalin would have been willing to accept for a reduction in citizens' fatality risk. Our estimate of this value is $43,151, roughly 6% of the VSL estimate in 1940's US and 29% of the VSL estimate in modern India.

By exploiting a British-driven institutional switch in part of China's customs stations in 1902, I find that counties that were more affected by the British customs institutions are also better developed today. Moreover, I show that the institutional switch was exogenous to the pre-colonial development, and I provide different estima- tion models to reveal a robust and causal relationship between good institutions and economic development.

P51|The Grand Experiment of Communism: Discovering the Trade-Off between Equality and Efficiency|This paper examines how the interplay between economic incentives and social preferences transmitted by ideology plays a role in the rise and fall of communism. We introduce inequality-averse and inefficiency-averse agents and model their conflict in ideology, triggered by envy. The socioeconomic dynamics generate a pendulum-like switch from markets to a centrally planned economy abolishing private ownership, and back to restoring market incentives. The grand experiment of communism is thus characterized as leading to the discovery of a trade-off between equality and efficiency. The model also derives conditions under which the two systems converge and become stable.
P51|From Karl Menger to Charles Menger? How Austrian economics (hardly) spread in France|The father of the “Austrian” Marginalist revolution and founder of the so-called “Austrian School of economics”, Carl Menger, had a mixed reception during different periods of development of French economics. Somewhat welcomed in the early days, he was rather forgotten later on. Even his major works were not published in translation until recently. What is the reason for such a situation? Criticisms of classical political economy have to be understood in their French context. In comparison to other countries, this paper details the case of France, besides showing how later Austrians, such as Friedrich Hayek, found a limited audience. This comparative study of economic ideas in France must start with the reception of the views of the founder and the role and impact of adopting/adapting or rejecting his views by French scholars. What place did they find in French academia? From Carl Menger to a “Frenchified” Charles Menger, how was Austrian economic thought disseminated in France? This essay starts by recalling the Belle-Époque and an astonishing letter by Charles Rist for the Jubiläum of Menger, in which he deplored the lack of translation of the latter’s works. The Austrian School in France is then discussed as pure economics replaces political economy in the Interwar period, with the 1938 Paris Congress of “liberal thinkers,” as the Vienna Circle became known, also comparing issues in philosophy. The paper considers how Austrian theories of “pure science” were received in Paris from the Vienna of the 1900s, at a time of ”Crossroads,” to the present day, through the Postwar and Cold War, until a revival since the 1990s and a rethinking of economic ideas after 2008.
P51|International Presence of the Japanese Study of Russian and East European Economies|In this article, I examine the oversea activities of Japanese researchers in the field of Russian and East European economic studies based on objective data and offer several suggestions for improving their presence in the international academic community. The presence of Japanese scholars of Russian and East European economies as measured by the number of relevant articles published in international journals is still marginal at best, despite their high participation rates in academic conferences abroad. This may partly be due to the fact that many Japanese researchers are not effectively utilizing available international resources. Furthermore, although many of the works produced by Japanese experts have important implications in the research field, only a handful of them are submitted to international journals. In this and many other respects, there is still much room for enhancing the international status of the Japanese study of Russian and East European economies.
P51|Wage Inequality and Structural Change|Abstract Income inequality in the context of large structural change has received a lot of attention in the literature, but most studies relied on household post-transfer inequality measures. This study utilizes a novel and fairly comprehensive collection of micro data sets from between 1980’s and 2010 for both advanced market economies and economies undergoing transition from central planning to market based system. We show that wage inequality was initially lower in transition economies and immediately upon the change of the economic system surpassed the levels observed in advanced economies. We find a very weak link between structural change and wages in both advanced and post-transition economies, despite the predictions from skill-biased technological change literature. The decomposition of changes in wage inequality into a part attributable to changes in characteristics (mainly education) and a part attributable to changes in rewards does not yield any leading factors.
P51|Testing|School systems regularly use student assessments for accountability purposes. But, as highlighted by our conceptual model, different configurations of assessment usage generate performance-conducive incentives of different strengths for different stakeholders in different school environments. We build a dataset of over 2 million students in 59 countries observed over 6 waves in the international PISA student achievement test 2000-2015. Our empirical model exploits the country panel dimension to investigate reforms in assessment systems over time, where identification comes from taking out country and year fixed effects along with a rich set of student, school, and country measures. We find that the expansion of standardized external comparisons, both school-based and student-based, is associated with improvements in student achievement. The effect of school-based comparison is stronger in countries with initially low performance. Similarly, standardized monitoring without external comparison has a positive effect in initially poorly performing countries. By contrast, the introduction of solely internal testing and internal teacher monitoring including inspectorates does not affect student achievement. Our findings point out the pitfalls of overly broad generalizations from specific country testing systems.
P51|Self-Employment and Well-Being Across Institutional Contexts|This paper investigates whether the relationship between a person's occupational sta- tus and well-being differs across countries with varying institutional contexts. We find that the relationship between job- and life satisfaction of self-employed people as well as of paid employees varies considerably across countries. Our results indicate that entrepreneurship-friendly institutions in a country are conducive to the well-being of self-employed. Remarkably, the quality of entrepreneurial institutions also increases the levels of well-being of paid employees, but the effect is more pronounced for the self-employed.
P51|Distrust and Political Turnover|We present findings that document one way in which a society's culture can affect political outcomes. Examining an annual panel of democratic countries over six decades, we show that severe economic downturns are more likely to cause political turnover in countries that have lower levels of generalized trust. The relationship is only found among democracies and for regular leader turnover, which suggests that the underlying mechanism works through leader accountability and the electoral process. Moreover, we find that the effects of trust on turnover are greatest during years with regularly-scheduled elections, and within democracies with a parliamentary system, a fully free media, and greater stability. The estimates suggest that generalized trust affects political institutions by influencing the extent to which citizens attribute economic downturns to the mistakes of politicians.
P51|A Theory of Equality Before the Law|We propose a model of the emergence of equality before the law. A society can support “effort” (“cooperation”, “pro-social behavior”) using the “carrot” of future cooperation or the “stick” of coercive punishment. Community enforcement relies only on the carrot and involves low coercion, low inequality, and low effort. A society in which the elite control the means of violence supplements the carrot with the stick, and involves high coercion, high inequality, and high effort. In this regime, elites are privileged: they are not subject to the same coercive punishments as non-elites. We show that it may be optimal—even from the viewpoint of the elite—to establish equality before the law, where all agents are subject to the same coercive punishments. The central mechanism is that equality before the law increases elites’ effort, which in turn encourages even higher effort from non-elites. Equality before the law combines high coercion and low inequality—in our baseline model, elites exert the same level of effort as non-elites. Factors that make the emergence of equality before the law more likely include limits on the extent of coercion, greater marginal returns to effort, increases in the size of the elite group, greater political power for non-elites, and under some additional conditions, lower economic inequality.

P51|Are “happy” firms all alike? A comparative analysis of Italian and German manufacturing systems|Recent works in the socio-economic and comparative political economy literature suggest the emergence of a predominant neoliberal model of capitalism, which is gradually being adopted by most advanced countries. A similar trend is present in the management literature where competitive advantages are increasingly being associated with a predominant strategic paradigm (integrated global engagement) leaning on the complementarities among R&D, human capital and entry into foreign markets, regardless of the country and industry a firm belongs to. While both views imply a growing tendency towards institutional and strategic homologation, other studies show only a partial convergence in institutional settings and highlight the presence of considerable heterogeneity in managerial conducts. In this paper we explore these contrasting interpretations by comparing the characteristics of manufacturing firms in Italy and Germany. The analysis suggests that (a) independently of the country of origin, globally engaged firms are relatively similar in characteristics that are usually positively correlated with economic performance such as size, age and innovation, but remain highly differentiated in terms of institutions-related variables; b) firms that have not adopted a strategy of global engagement are markedly heterogeneous in terms of both structural characteristics and institutions-related variables. In other words, global engagement is associated with a lower degree of the differentiation between Italian and German firms, but the variety of institutional settings continues to affect the evolution of businesses. Policy implications are discussed.
P51|Potterian Economics|Recent studies in psychology and neuroscience find that fictional works exert strong influence on readers and shape their opinions and worldviews. We study the Potterian economy, which we compare to economic models, to assess how Harry Potter books affect economic literacy. We find that some principles of Potterian economics are consistent with economistsâ€™ models. Many others, however, are distorted and contain numerous inaccuracies, which contradict professional economistsâ€™ views and insights, and contribute to the general publicâ€™s biases, ignorance, and lack of understanding of economics.
P51|Causes and Effects of Private Property Rights Security|Private property rights security is currently seen as central to explaining cross-country differences in economic development. Variation in private property rights security itself is perceived to be best explained by differences in the degree to which the political system is able to constrain the despotic power of state executives. I reassess the existing evidence for these two hypotheses and find that: (1) higher levels and significant changes in private property rights security and constraints on the executive are not correlated with higher levels of income and (changes in) growth rates; (2) the commonly used instrument for constraints on the executive and private property rights security - the natural log of European settler mortality - is invalid because it is associated with current levels of income besides its effect through private property rights security and constraints on the executive; and (3) the regularly cited Korean case is in fact evidence against these hypotheses. I provide explanations for these findings and call for a rethinking of which type of institutions and policies are decisive for growth.
P51|Should Immigrants Culturally Assimilate or Preserve Their Own Culture? Individual Beliefs and the Longevity of National Identity|We develop and empirically test a theory concerning individual beliefs about whether immigrants should culturally assimilate into the host society or preserve their own cultural norms. We argue that when national identity is a source of intrinsic utility, the longevity of national identity influences a national identity’s perceived resilience to an ostensible immigrant threat and, thus, affects individuals’ beliefs about the need for immigrants’ cultural assimilation. Empirical evidence based on data from countries of wider Europe supports our theory. An expert survey-based measure of the longevity of national identity, first, exhibits a robustly negative effect on the strength of individual preferences in favor of immigrants’ cultural assimilation and, second, is an important contextual moderating variable that shapes the effect of individual-level characteristics on their beliefs. Thus, individual beliefs about the necessity of immigrants’ cultural assimilation versus accommodation of cultural diversity reflect a historically-rooted sense of national identity.
P51|The Paradox of Power: Understanding Fiscal Capacity in Imperial China and Absolutist Regimes|Tax extraction in Qing China was low relative to Western Europe. It is not obvious why: China was much more absolutist and had stronger rights over property and people. Why did the Chinese not convert their absolute power into revenue? We propose a model, supported by historical evidence, which suggests that i) the center could not ask its tax collecting agents to levy high taxes because it would incentivize agents to overtax the peasantry; ii) the center could not pay agents high wages in return for high taxes because the center had no mechanism to commit to refrain from confiscating the agent’s resources in times of crisis. A solution to this problem was to offer agents a low wage and ask for low taxes while allowing agents to take extra, unmonitored taxes from the peasantry. This solution only worked because of China’s weak administrative capacity due its size and poor monitoring technology. This analysis suggests that low investment in administrative capacity can be an optimal solution for an absolutist ruler since it substitutes for a credible commitment to refrain from confiscation. Our study carries implications for state capacity beyond Imperial China.

P51|The relation between typologies of executive and technological performances of nations|The general determinants of socioeconomic and technological performance are of profound interest in social and political sciences to understand the historical developmental paths of nations. The vast literature has suggested several approaches to explain the differences of technological performances among nations, such as the varieties of capitalism’s theory of innovation argues that a dissimilar behaviour of political institutions is a principal driver of differences in national innovative behaviour. However, in the varieties of capitalism and other frameworks, the notion of state power and the relation between typologies of executive, technological and socioeconomic performances of countries are generally absent. The present study confronts these problem and endeavours of analyzing the nexus (relation) between leadership-oriented executives, technological and socioeconomic performances of nations. Results show that high levels of technological performance of nations seem to be associated to executive with parliamentary monarchy and monarchy (leadership-oriented government), whereas nations with mixed executive tend to have lower performances. A possible reason of these results is that, in general, some typologies of executive leadership-oriented (e.g., Monarchy) support the political stability of countries with subsequent fruitful socioeconomic developmental paths over the long run. In short, the study here shows the vital role of the structure of government in national systems of innovation and in particular how leadershiporiented executives can support socioeconomic performances of countries. Overall, then, the structure of executives might be one of contributing factors to explain dissimilar patterns of technological innovation and economic growth of nations over time.
P51|Disruptive technologies and competitive advantage of firms in dynamic markets|A fundamental problem in the field of management of technology is how firms develop and sustain disruptive technologies for competitive advantage in markets. The vast literature has analyzed several characteristics of disruptive innovations. However, the determinants are hardly known. The study here seems to show, in a market with high intensity of R&D investments (anticancer drugs), that the emergence of disruptive technologies can be driven by the coevolution of consequential problems and their solution in R&D labs of firms. In general, incumbent and entrant firms have a strong incentive to find innovative solutions to unsolved, consequential and new problems in order to achieve and sustain the prospect of a (temporary) profit monopoly and competitive advantage in markets with technological dynamisms. Overall, then this study shows one of the general sources of disruptive technologies that seems to support industrial and corporate change in a Schumpeterian world of innovation-based competition.
P51|Corporate innovation and economic freedom: Cross-country comparisons|This paper studies the impact of a country's integrated economic freedom on corporations undertaking innovative activities. Using 5809 firms from 29 countries filed and granted U.S. patents over the 1984–2006 period, we find strong and robust evidence of a positive relationship between corporate innovation and the cross-country differences in economic freedom. This finding suggests that firms domiciled in a country with a sound regulatory system, limited government, regulation efficiency, and open markets facilitate corporations undertaking innovative activities. Specifically, we find that the positive relationship is more pronounced through the channel of labor freedom. This is consistent with the notion that more economic freedom enhances innovation competence in the global market.
P51|Industry Evolution in Varieties of Capitalism: a Comparison of the Danish and US Wind Turbine Industries|In this study, we combine Klepper's framework on the evolution of industries with the Varieties of Capitalism approach to argue that industry evolution is mediated by institutional differences. We expect that new industries will evolve with a stronger connection to established industries in coordinated marked economies than in liberal market economies. Our assumptions are supported by the survival analysis of US and Danish wind turbine manufacturers from 1974 to 2014.

P51|Financialization and industrial policies in Japan and Korea: Evolving institutional complementarities and loss of state capabilities|The purpose of this article is to analyze the revival of industrial policies from the late 2000s in Japan and Korea and their limitations. Our approach has two major characteristics. First, we adopt the perspective of historical institutionalism to focus on the relation between IPs and financial systems and study their evolution over the last 40 years. Second, by mobilizing the concepts of institutional complementarities and hierarchy, we discuss the limits of this revival in a context of liberalized financial systems, to which government entities in charge of industrial policies have contributed. Our major result is that, in the context of financialization, past complementarities of the developmental state have weakened and contradictions have arisen. It resulted in a restructuration of state capabilities to design and implement industrial policies, and to its inability to subordinate finance to its goals, despite the discourses and ambitions of governments. However, and this is our second result, comparison between Japan and Korea also allows us to identify some significant differences in the initial institutional arrangements and in the process of institutional change, which are analyzed as sources of greater state capabilities in Korea than in Japan in the current period.
P51|The Impact of Regime Type on Food Consumption in Low Income Countries|Competing studies use food consumption to measure the impact of political regime on the welfare of the poor. Democracies may outperform autocracies by using growth to hide redistribution, improving caloric consumption and currying favor. Alternatively, autocracies may have greater incentives to lower food prices to quell urban unrest. We test these competing theories using a more detailed, continuous, nuanced measure of food consumption quality ï¿½ cereal equivalent values. We find evidence to support the second hypothesis, that autocracies outperform democracies at low incomes. For higher incomes, democracies perform significantly better. Segregated by growth, autocracies again outperform democracies at low incomes.

P51|How Religiosity Shapes Investor Behavior: Sukuk Issuances During Ramadan|We use an original identification strategy to isolate a potential religious bias in traders’ behavior. We first analyze the stock market reaction to sukuk issuance and then isolate the religious component of the trades by comparing the stock market reaction to sukuk and bond issuance during the holy month of Ramadan. We use the event study methodology to measure abnormal returns for a sample of 2,140 issuances by 133 issuers in Malaysia over the period 2000-2013. We find that sukuk issuance during Ramadan is valued more positively than bond issuance by stock market investors. We observe that the type of securities previously issued by the firm influences the stock market reaction, in the sense that the positive reaction to sukuk issuance during Ramadan rewards firms which only issue sukuk. Our findings support the view that religiosity influences the behavior of investors, suggesting that religiosity should be taken into account in the analysis of financial markets.
P51|Efficient Implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy Goals: Is Social Equality Achievable Reality or Myth Perhaps?|Economic crisis hit all the European Union Member States hard, the impact of crisis varied considerably. The low growth performance in the EU has increased concerns regarding an increasing wage dispersion, income inequality at large, and social exclusion in line with poverty. Inequality should be seen as a cornerstone of both sustainable and inclusive growth under the Europe 2020 Strategy. Social inequality in the EU is a very real problem which hampers sustainable economic growth. The purpose of this study is to introduce evaluation of social development convergence and divergence trend between EU28 Member States in the context of the Europe 2020 Strategy. The study gives an outline of the issues of labour market and income disparities and poverty. Policy-makers must be clear about what social objectives they are aiming to achieve, therefore special attention is paid to headline national goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy. The main tasks of this study is to assess social dimension and inequalities problems in the EU27 by applying Data Envelopment Analysis method, resp. time-series dynamic efficiency analysis in the form of output-oriented Malmquist Productivity Index. This study contain changes of key social equality indicators related to the Europe 2020 Strategy and compares objectives and general outlines of period 2010-2015, as well as its impact on national economics and living conditions. Results contain elements of typology premises of the EU28 and point to a large diversity in inequality patterns, as author observe both increases and decreases in inequality at the EU level. Recent changes in social inequality have been associated with the business cycle, particularly with the accessibility of the labour market and, of course, with income inequality. Additionally the development challenges are discussed for improvement of the socioeconomic well-being of the EU27 and to avoid social disparities.
P51|Sales Range and Innovation Activity in the Industry System of Poland|In the literature, there is a discussion on the importance of the spatial distans to the user in the context innovation activity. Although, most of this kind of studies concentrate on exporting enterprises and compare them to domestic ones. Exporting activity is very important for catching-up countries, because of technology transfer in its background. The aim of this paper is to determine whether the innovative activity in Poland’s industrial system is a consequence of close interactions (local and regional), or perhaps conditioned by the imperative of functioning on the national and international market? Main hypothesis was to claim that on the current development level of Poland, the relationship between the range of sales and innovation activities are different from those in the more developed countries. Empirical studies was created in 2006-2012 as a result of the systematic collection of questionnaires filled by industry enterprises in Poland from all regions (5209 correct fulfilled questionnaires). Methodical analysis was based on the theory of probability - probit modeling, because dependent variables were binary (0 or 1). Local and regional environment is not conducive to stimulating innovation activity, but national spatial is a sufficient space, but high intensity observed only when the company has been working on the international market. It means, that the industry maturity level in Poland is good enough for creating a domestic innovation environment. This kind of an aggregation level should be stimulating by the government innovation policy.
P51|Manajemen pengeluaran publik di Indonesia: Tinjauan ekonomi Islam pada APBN 2017<BR>[Public expenditure management in Indonesia: Islamic economic review on state budget 2017]|This paper discusses the management of public expenditures in Indonesia in State Budget 2017. The data collected from fiscal policy documents, especially about government spending plans in 2017, and then be reviewed by policy analysis, the theory of public expenditures, and the theory of public goods, and compared with the theory of public expenditure in Islamic economics. Public expenditure management in Indonesia has implemented a distribution system that divided public expenditure for central government expenditures, transfers to the regions, and the village fund. In terms of fiscal policy, public expenditure priorities to support the achievement of sustainable economic growth, job creation, poverty reduction, and the reduction of gaps in the welfare of the whole community. In Islamic economics, public expenditure is used to meet the needs of the community based on the principles of general interest (al-maslahat al-'ammah) derived from the shari'a. Public expenditure on Indonesia's government as an effective tool to divert economic resources and increase the income of society as a whole, and focused on the embodiment of the people's welfare.
P51|Germany and Greece: A mapping of their great divide and its EU implications|The economic constitutions of Germany and Greece have resulted in the postwar period in two economies that are based on two vastly different philosophies. Germany has built a highly competitive, outward looking economy based essentially on the principles of the so-called “Social Market Economy”, whereas Greece has set up a “state-managed economy” by drawing on the principles of central planning and administrative controls. This divide is equally stark, if assessed on the basis of the performance of the two economies. For, as it is known by now, Germany has become once again the powerhouse of Europe while Greece has gone bankrupt. As to the implications of this great divide for the future of the EU, its identification and mapping helps understand why convergence criteria on the basis of economic performance and living standards should be abandoned in favor of criteria based on the widening and deepening of the four European freedoms. A multi-speed Euroland enmeshed in these freedoms is going to be more democratic, more cohesive and a much happier union for the European citizens to call homeland.
P51|The African origins of Euro-American development: Pins on an empirical roadmap|Despite their obvious ideological bends, economic studies of the interactions between Africa and “developed” Europe and America (Euro-America) have been decidedly lopsided. Existing studies conceive the effects of the interactions to be unidirectional, with Africa always on the receiving end in both good and bad ways. The conception is incorrect; it lacks the appreciation that the effects are interactive, mutual, dynamic, and simultaneous. Thus, I argue that contrary to the extant literature, the development of Euro-America has origins in Africa through the mechanism of mercantile, slave, and free trade. For example, the growth of colonial Britain depended on foreign trade with the Americas – exports of manufactured goods and imports of raw materials. In turn, American raw materials were produced by African slave labor. When slavery ended African raw materials began to flow to Euro-America in greater amounts than before, replacing slave labor. The result was a smooth transition from a slave-labor-based economy to a modern economy in Euro-America, and a stunted economy in Africa. The objective of this paper is to sketch how one might go about illustrating such effects in a simple quantitative way. In other words, it puts some pins to suggest a roadmap for empirical studies. To do so, first I review very briefly the history of African and Euro-American interactions. Second, I attempt to establish the channels of interactions. Third, I construct a simple model for measuring Africa’s effects on Euro-American development as a system of three seemingly unrelated equations, which can be estimated individually and/or simultaneously. Fourth, I indicate the challenges and methods for generating the data required to implement the model empirically. While this version of the paper is unaccompanied by its empirical counterpart, it is nonetheless clear that at least some of the origins of Euro-American development are African.
P51|Толерантность, Сотрудничество И Экономический Рост<BR>[Tolerance, collaboration and economic growth]|"Institutional (in particular, political) pluralism is a fundamental feature of modern developed societies. Its cultural basis is the tolerance of citizens. The paper proposes to distinguish between legal, evaluative and interactive tolerance. This distinction makes it possible to explain the contradictory results obtained with econometric studies of tolerance and its links with the economic growth. Legal tolerance is the basis of competitive pluralism, and interactive one is the prerequisite for the formation of consensus pluralism, based on the collaboration of various social forces. Struggle for resources, intra- and intercountry inequality, ""history wars"" and prejudices prevent the strengthening of tolerance. Attention is drawn to the ""paradox of political correctness"": dogmatic tolerance generates intolerant behavior. It is noted that interactive tolerance in developing countries is significantly correlated with technological progress and the level of well-being. The existence of this relationship, which is realized through the collaboration mechanisms, gives the ground for supposition that, despite the contradictory dynamics of the tolerance level in the past 25 years, tolerance will be strengthening in the long run."
P51|Unemployment, Neets And The Social Role Of Education In Europe|Education is maybe the most important engine for economic and social development and cultural empowerment, and also the most beneficial investment that a government can make. In this paper we present a short overview on the socio-educational situation of the young people in Europe. If we refer to the social situation, the role of education becomes an undeniable one, regarding the support of the learners from a socio-economic point of view. Starting from the premise that education represents the society’s health, the education must be considered as the most important factor regarding the situation of the unemployed people from different age groups. Knowing that the higher the level of education of individuals, the more appropriate and probable are the individuals’ commitments during work. This leads to the hypothesis of a socio-economic climate, beneficial growth and further economic development. Moreover, we investigate several employment indicators, such as the unemployment rate at the European level, from the age groups of 15-24, on the period 2013-2015. We particularly investigate data in the base of some indicators, part of the training process in countries such as Poland, Estonia, Hungary and Bulgaria.
P51|Wyłaniające się modele kapitalizmu w Polsce i krajach Europy Środkowo-Wschodniej na tle Europy Zachodniej<BR>[Emerging models of capitalism in Poland and CEE countries in comparison to Western European countries]|This article presents the results of the study which aims to enrich the empirical picture and to better understand the nature of capitalism emerging in Poland and other new EU member states from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE11). Our main research goal is to assess the degree of similarity of Poland and other CEE11 countries toward each of the four models of capitalism in Western Europe distinguished by Bruno Amable. Each of these models is represented by an “ideal-typical” western European country. At the average level for the whole analyzed group, the CEE11 countries show the greatest similarity to the Mediterranean model of capitalism, represented by Spain/Italy. At the same time, these countries also exhibit quite high institutional proximity to the continental model of capitalism, represented by Germany.
P51|Colonial Origins and Comparative Development: Institutions Matter|A large literature is present on how colonial origins through the channels of Institutions and human capital explain the income variation between countries. In most cases, it is argued that colonial European settlement outside of Europe has shaped the type of institutions present today that explain the gap between income levels of countries. Others criticize this claim on the basis that firstly, geography plays a prominent role in income variation and secondly, the studies in favor of the primacy of the role of institutions suffer from measurement error and bias. In this study, we analyze the role colonial origins and geography play in comparative income levels of countries today. In this study, we present a theoretical analysis for what determines growth in the long run and how colonial origins come into play and then make an empirical study using OLS and IV techniques, while utilizing recent data and different proxies, into the claims that colonial origins and/or geography play the prominent role. We also investigate whether the institutions primacy studies suffer from measurement error. Our findings point out that while geography may play a small role, majority of the income variation is associated with institutions and colonial origins.
P51|Islamic Finance at Crossroads|After more than 40 years of practice, the Islamic finance industry is riddled with products that have a camouflage of Islamic form, but lack Shari'ah validity of purpose. The increasing tendency to mimic conventional finance, had the industry converging to its conventional counterpart. It is therefore seriously threatened with increasing cynicism and popular decline in interest. The paper looks into the essence of Reba prohibition from an economic perspective, using a concise classification of transactions, and how popular monetary theory looks on a positive rate of interest with disfavor. It evaluates Shari'ah scholars approach to the validation of contracts as well as the attitude of monetary authorities towards the Shari'ah content of Islamic finance transactions. It reviews the macroeconomic advantages of Islamic finance within an Islamic macroeconomic environment. Then it tries to explain why managers of Islamic banking and finance institutions, IBFI, mimic conventional products despite such advantages. The paper surveys the literature that measures the extent of conversion as well as provides an alternative explanation. The study finds that IBFI violate the true paradigm of Islamic finance, because its advantages are all external and impossible to internalize. It lists several pieces of empirical evidence on increasing convergence. The paper concludes by drawing a plan composed of regulatory actions, research agenda as well as a series of dialogues with stakeholders.
P51|Financialisation: Dimensions and determinants. A cross-country study|The financialisation literature has grown over the past two decades. While there is a generally accepted definition, effectively financialisation has been used to describe very different phenomena. This paper proposes a multi-faceted notion of financialisation by distinguishing between financialisation of non-financial companies, households and the financial sector and using activity as well as vulnerability measures of financialisation. We identify seven financialisation hypotheses in the literature and empirically investigate them in a cross-country analysis for 17 OECD countries for the 1997-2007 period. We find that different financialisation measures are only weakly correlated, which suggests the existence of distinct financialisation processes. There is strong evidence across all sectors that financialisation is closely linked to asset price inflation and correlated with a debt-driven demand regime. Financial deregulation encourages financialisation, especially in the financial and household sector. By contrast, there is limited evidence that market-based financial systems tend to be more financialised, meaning financialisation can occur with large banks. Foreign financial inflows do not seem to be a main driver. We do not find indication that a secular investment slowdown precedes financialisation. Overall, our findings suggest that financialisation should be understood as variegated process, playing out differently across economic sectors in different countries.
P51|Моделирование показателя стагнирующей экономики. Indicator simulation of a stagnating economy|На протяжении последних десятилетий экономики развитых стран периодически подвергаются кризисам и стагнациям. На развитие стагнации влияет не только застой в сфере промышленного производства, но и проблемы в сфере трудовых ресурсов и при создании человеческого капитала. Основными инструментами преодоления стагнации является государственная финансовая и нормативно-правовая поддержка. Цель работы – получение системы дифференциальных уравнений, которая описывает изменение скорости обновления возобновляемых факторов производства и производительности экономики при вхождении в кризисы и в состоянии стагнации. Анализ поведения факторов производства производится с использованием векторного анализа. Получено неравенство, удовлетворение которого дает условия выхода экономики из стагнации. Полученное векторное неравенство показывает, что для выхода экономики из стагнации очень важна скорость реакции на потребности в инвестировании возобновляемых факторов производства. Производственные факторы тесно взаимосвязаны, поэтому преодоление явлений стагнации в одном из факторов не дает гарантии роста всей экономики. In recent decades the economies of developed countries were periodically exposed to crises and stagnation. Not only the depression of industrial production affects the development of stagnation, but also the problems in the labor force as well as the issues with creation of human capital. State’s financial and regulatory support are the main tools to overcome stagnation. The aim of this work is to obtain a system of differential equations that describes the change of the update rate of renewable factors of production and productivity in the economy at the approach to the state of stagnation. The papers studies the behavior of factors of production using vector analysis. The author obtained the inequality, which gives the conditions of overcoming the economic stagnation. This inequality shows that the rate of response to the need for investment has more impact on overcoming stagnation than the volume of investments. Production factors are closely interrelated; therefore, overcoming the phenomenon of stagnation in one of the factors does not guarantee the growth of the entire economy.
P51|The Firm as a Common. The Case of the Accumulation and Use of Capital Resources in Co-operative Enterprises|Contemporary literature dealing with the governance of the exploitation of common-pool natural resources was initiated by Elinor Ostrom in 1990, and has been growing fast ever since. On the contrary, within the same research stream, the study of the presence and economic role of common resources in entrepreneurial-organizational is, to date, under-researched. This work endeavours some attempt to fill this gap. Firstly, by spelling out a new-institutionalist framework for the analysis of the accumulation and governance of common capital resources within organizational boundaries. Secondly, by considering co-operative enterprises as the organizational form that, on the basis of historical record, and of behavioural and institutional characteristics, demonstrated to be most compatible with a substantial role for common and non-divided asset-ownership and with its governance thereof. The economic forces influencing the optimal level of self-financed common capital resources in co-operatives are enquired. Also their governance is brought under the spotlight, evidencing: (i) the constraints that need to be fulfilled, and the potential benefits arising out of their presence; (ii) the compatibility and mutual adaptability between democratic governance in co-operatives and the governance of non-divided assets.
P51|Financial mechanism to invest in knowledge from natural resource revenues: Experiences from Bolivia, Chile, Colombia and Peru|In resource-rich emerging countries, management of revenues from natural resources (NR) plays a critical role in transforming their economies. In this paper, a conceptual framework is constructed for an institution to promote the economic diversification through investing in knowledge, based on the literature from management of natural resources, industrial policy and public management. Existing financial mechanisms in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia and Peru, where NR revenues are invested in knowledge to enhance productivity (natural resources for knowledge, or NR4K funds), are examined applying the framework. The analysis identified that NR4K in these countries currently fall short of achieving their intended purpose of transitioning their economies toward increased diversification. These require complementary public policies to enhance capabilities, coordinate between stakeholders and initiate experimental investments.
P51|Ancestry, Diversity & Finance: Evidence from Transition Economies|In this paper, we analyze the growth effects of historical and biological ancestry, diversity and financial development in transition economies. We show that the common indicators of ethnolinguistic fractionalization, state history and genetic distance yield significant results and to some extent transform the impact of finance on growth in East-Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. Deep ethnolinguistic cleavages produce insignificant results, whereas at intermediate and lower levels of aggregation diversity is likely to significantly improve the effect of finance on growth. Similarly to finer ethnolinguistic cleavages, genetic distance from the United States also favorably increases the relevance of financial development for growth. However, state history as a proxy for long-run ancestral exposure to institutions, political organization and centralization reinforces the negative growth effect of financial development. We argue that financial development is inclined to resolve problems arising from coordination failures and absence of trust in diverse societies by easing liquidity constraints and offering incentives for entrepreneurship to minority groups. In contrast, long state history is likely to generate extractive institutions that facilitate the provision of soft budget constraints. Genetic distance from the United States induces higher reliance on continental rather than Anglo-Saxon financing practices, and therefore increases dependence on banks rather than bonds or equity for external liquidity purposes.
P51|The Nordic Model of Economic Development and Welfare: Recent Developments and Future Prospects|Abstract The stylised evidence from the Welfare State Sustainability (WSS) ratios points to a decrease in the future sustainability of public welfare spending in the Nordic countries.
P51|Wages and employment by skill level in Southern and Eastern Europe during the crisis|Occupations and sectors are the two fundamental dimensions of structural change. From the evolution of the high/low-skill employment levels and wage ratio, we can understand which sectors have been undertaking a process of technical change. By using Eu-Silc database we investigate four “Southern Europe” countries (Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal), three “Eastern Europe” countries (Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria), UK and Austria. Our analysis shows that the crisis seems to have radically changed the behavior of economies and sectors. It emerges that Poland behaves in a similar way to Austria (with a growing role of technology and Skill Biased Technical Change), while in Hungary the economic system seems to be restructuring as Iberian countries.
P51|Economic systems in developing countries: A macro cluster approach|The literature on economic systems and corresponding empirical studies have largely focused on a classification for developed countries, while other world regions have only partly been included and/or not compared to established OECD prototypes on an income-adjusted basis. In our macro clustering approaches, correct for the income bias in clustering variables. We are therefore able to include a worldwide sample of 115 developed and developing countries, the latter including transition countries. The major result from using income adjusted variables is that developing countries join the liberal OECD prototype economies in the world of inequality. On the other hand, a large part of Asian developing countries as well all transition countries join the coordinated and liberal European market economies in the world of equality. As a robust result, European Nordic and transition countries form a cluster combining high levels of innovation and equality of income differences are phased out. At the same time, as argued by La Porta et al. (2008) and Lange et al. (2006), the distribution of non-transition developing countries between and within these worlds of equality and inequality reveals a clear distinction between British vs. other colonial heritages as one driver of economic systems today.
P51|Judicial Independence in the EU – A Puzzle|Based on data from the EU Justice Scoreboard, we identify a puzzle: National levels of judicial independence (as perceived by the citizens of EU member states) are negatively associated with the presence of formal legislation usually considered as conducive to judicial independence. We try to resolve this puzzle based on political economy explanations and specificities of legal systems, but to no avail. We then ask whether cultural traits can help to put together the puzzle. And indeed, countries with high levels of generalized trust (and to a lesser extent individualistic countries) exhibit increased levels of de facto judicial independence and, at the same time, reduced levels of de jure judicial independence. The combination of these two effects can explain why judicial reforms that should be conducive to an independent judiciary may seem to have adverse consequences. We conclude that cultural traits are of fundamental importance for the quality of formal institutions, even in societies as highly developed as the EU member states.
P51|Economic systems in developing countries: A macro cluster approach|The literature on economic systems and corresponding empirical studies have largely focused on a classification for developed countries, while other world regions have only partly been included and/or not compared to established OECD prototypes on an income-adjusted basis. In our macro clustering approach, we apply Ward as well as Fuzzy C-Means clustering methods and, in contrast with other approaches, correct for the income bias in clustering variables. We are therefore able to include a worldwide sample of 115 developed and developing countries, the latter including transition countries. The major result from using income adjusted variables is that developing countries phase into the OECD divide. On the one hand, most African and Latin American countries join the liberal OECD prototype economies in the world of inequality. On the other hand, a large part of Asian developing countries as well all transition countries join the coordinated and liberal European market economies in the world of equality. As a robust result, European Nordic and transition countries form a cluster combining high levels of innovation and equality if income differences are phased out. At the same time, as argued by La Porta et al. (2008) and Lange et al. (2006), the distribution of non-transition developing countries between and within these worlds of equality and inequality reveals a clear distinction between British vs. other colonial heritages as one driver of economic systems today.
P51|Understanding the Course of Social Reality|This book offers a comparison between our earthly society and the society of a hypothetical twin planet with the aim to understand and deal with some of the main problems of our global society, as well as to advance interaction with some extra-terrestrial society no less advanced than ours that sooner or later will be discovered. The underlying premise of the book is that the contemporary world finds itself in what may well be the most confused age of human history. Growing technological changes and innovation make it difficult to understand the course of social reality, while the intensification of the relations between different regions of the Earth and the power achieved by financial capital on a world scale amplify the dimensions and visibility of disequilibria and iniquities, and sharpen frustration and sentiments of insecurity. Social thought, as it has developed at the service of a quasi-stationary world, lacks the ability to understand and govern the tumultuous economic and social processes in progress. The most efficacious way to meet this fleeting social reality is to scientifically highlight basic institutions and values and their steady changes caused by the accumulation of creative and choice processes. In doing so, long-run trends can be explored in order to understand and manage the disequilibrating-reequilibrating motion characterizing the life of dynamic societies. This book shows the ‘necessity’ of institutional and ethical transformations utilizing a utopian flavour.
P51|The White Man’s Burden: On the Effect of African Resistance to European Domination|Are there contemporary development effects of African resistance to European domination? This question is the primary issue addressed by this inquiry. We establish that African resistance has had adverse effects on post-colonial African development and discuss possible channels of such causality. This relationship is robust to alternative model and to controlling for the outliers.
P51|Post-Communist Transition as a Path Break: Comparing Legal Institutional Effects on Economic Growth between Path-Breaking and Path-Drifting Institutional Reforms|This article explains the peculiarities of institutional effects on growth rates in post-communist countries. By proposing a certain dependence of the institution-growth nexus on the mode of institutional grafting, the distinction between drift-phase and path-breaking institutional change is introduced. Theoretical juxtapositions show that transition countries’ institutions built through path-breaking institutional reforms differ from those that emerge evolutionarily in the drift phase in a twofold manner in their relationship to growth. Growth rates of their economies are less likely to depend on the quality of legal institutions and are more likely to be a function of the maturity of political institutions. In addition, legal institutional change in the post-communist world is a product of the quality of the political environment to a greater extent than their drift-phase alternatives. These propositions are tested empirically based on a sample of 87 countries derived from the POLITY IV Project's website.

Human beings have the potential to realize the political level of moral conscience to make ends meet, but man as a creature of religion must have a balance between religious morality and economy morality. With economic ethics are supported by religious morality, the welfare system can be realized systemically if the state, communities, and individuals can realize the six-dimensional: the religion that is adhered to, good governance, justice, national security, the prosperity of society, and the vision of the nation.

P51|The Determinants of Structural Transformation in Asia: A Review of the Literature|Structural transformation—the movement of workers from low-productivity to high-productivity activities—is an essential ingredient of inclusive growth. This paper reviews the evidence on why the pace of structural transformation has differed widely across countries in Asia, with a specific focus on the People’s Republic of China, India, and Thailand. It argues that both government failures relating to the functioning of labor, land, and product markets; and market failures relating to coordination of investment, credit market imperfections, and human capital formation have been the primary causes of the slow pace of structural transformation in several Asian countries. The paper suggests that a specific focus is needed to reform policies that impede the functioning of labor, land, and product markets as well as on strengthening industrial and education policies to address specific market failures around investment coordination and human capital formation.
P51|Debt or Wage-led Growth : the European Integration|This study aims to outline the importance of increasing real wages in European Union member countries. Since the 1970s, the European Union’s original member countries (European Union-15) have pursued a neoliberal strategy, favoring exportled growth. This strategy was supposed to increase the European Union’s international competitiveness by reducing labor costs and encouraging investment as profits garnered a greater share of national income. Since the 1990s, the European Union’s newer members, primarily Central Eastern European countries, have pursued debt-led growth as European Union membership opened financial markets to foreign capital. Both strategies adopted wage moderation and both have been associated with weaker and more volatile growth alongside rising unemployment. We argue that the European Union should adopt a Keynesian demand-led growth model and raise real wages to generate higher effective demand, which is crucial for achieving growth in economies operating below full employment.
P51|Research Trends on Zakāh in Western Literature|This study explores research trends in Western literature about Zakāh, which is considered to be an equivalent, to a certain degree, to a charity in the Christian tradition. The study is based on a sample of considerable studies in English and French, collected over a period of eighty one years (1934-2015). The preliminary results highlight three important implications. These are: (1) the multiplicity and the diversity of the conceptualization of Zakāh beyond the purely moral, juristic, discursive and literalistic approaches which seem to be dominating research trends in the Arab-Muslim world; (2) the predominance of theoretical studies over applied ones. (3) Zakāh as a valuable resource is perceived; according to some treatises as an instrument of power from the geo-economics view-point.
P51|Régimes de qualité de l’emploi et diversité des pays émergents|Les pays émergents et leurs leaders, les BRICS, peuvent aujourd’hui être revisités à la lumière d’une approche institutionnaliste plus propice à la prise en compte de leur diversité. En se concentrant sur la configuration de leur rapport salarial, ce papier propose de questionner la catégorie formée par ces pays en étudiant la variété des régimes de qualité de l’emploi qu’ils présentent. Deux résultats intéressants ressortent de cette étude proposant une Analyse en Composantes Principales (ACP) suivie d’une Classification Mixte (CM) à partir de deux grandes dimensions institutionnelles décomposées en quatorze indicateurs. (1) Les pays émergents se dispersent pour établir quatre régimes de qualité de l’emploi spécifiques, illustrant ainsi leur hétérogénéité et la fragilité de leur catégorie. (2) L’éclatement des BRICS, loin de composer un régime cohérent et indépendant, peut être expliqué par une combinaison de facteurs socio-économiques et institutionnels propre à chacun de ces leaders de l’émergence.
P51|Collective bargaining systems and macroeconomic and microeconomic flexibility: the quest for appropriate institutional forms in advanced economies|Abstract This paper addresses the design of the machinery of collective bargaining from the perspective of microeconomic and macroeconomic flexibility. In the former context, somewhat greater attention is given over to enterprise flexibility than external adjustment. In the latter context, close attention is also paid to changes in collective bargaining along the dimensions of bargaining coverage, structure, and coordination. Support is adduced for the German, contemporary Scandinavian, and British models. The role of trust in securing micro and macro flexibility also receives attention, suggesting that the polder or Dutch model might also be expected to populate the firmament of fit-for-purpose collective bargaining arrangements. JEL Classification: Microeconomics/Institutions (D02), Institutions and the Macroeconomy (E02), Employment/Unemployment/Wages (E24), Income Distribution (E25), Macroeconomic Policy Objectives (E61), Labor Economics Policies (JO8) Trades Unions (J51), Collective Bargaining (J52), Labor-Management Relations (J53), Public Policy (J58), Comparative Analysis of Economic Systems (P51)
P51|What Rules in the â€˜Deepâ€™ Determinants of Comparative Development?|During the previous two decades or so empirical literature on comparative development of na- tions has turned to investigation of â€™deepâ€™ determinants of differences in income levels, such as institutions, trade, geography and human capital. In this paper I revisit this debate and make the following contributions. First, when run in one common framework, the previous results are generally not robust to the choice of measures of institutional quality as well as their respective instruments, and might be misspecified. Institutional measures of objective constraints should be strictly preferred. Second, a careful model selection across all the instruments for all the deep determinants reveals a clear pattern of instrumentation. Most notably this indicates that settler mortality proposed by Acemoglu et al. (2001) is not a dominant instrument for institu- tional quality for which legal or linguistical instruments should be preferred. Consequently I provide evidence that the theory of colonial origins is not institutional in its nature and rather supports human capital prevalence hypothesis. Third, human capital and geography come out as â€™winnersâ€™ exerting separate direct effects on income levels with openness having indirect complementary effects either via institutions or natural resource exports.
P51|Large-Scale Transition of Economic Systems – Do CEECs Converge Toward Western Prototypes?|Abstract We analyze potential convergence of Central and Eastern European Countries’ (CEECs) economic systems toward western prototypes. The corresponding comparative capitalism literature identified four prototype economic systems among (traditional) OECD countries: Liberal, Continental, Nordic, and Mediterranean. Based on a comprehensive macroeconomic cluster approach, we are able to confirm these prototype country clusters. At the same time, our results indicate that the economic systems of CEECs have still not completely converged toward these prototypes, but complement them by independent Liberal (CEEC LME) and Continental/Nordic (CEEC CME) varieties, showing no signs of convergence toward the inconsistent and underperforming economic system of Mediterranean countries.
P51|Public debt and economic growth – economic systems matter|Abstract Most studies on the relationship between public debt and economic growth implicitly assume homogeneous debt effects across their samples. We –in accordance with recent literature– challenge this view and state that there likely is a great deal of cross-country heterogeneity in that relationship. However, other than scholars assuming that all countries are different, we expect that clusters of countries differ. We identify three country clusters with distinct economic systems: Liberal (Anglo Saxon), Continental (Core EU members) and Nordic (Scandinavian). We argue that different degrees of fiscal uncertainty at comparable levels of public debt between those economic systems constitute a major source of heterogeneity in the debt-growth relationship. Our empirical evidence supports this assumption. Continental countries face more growth reducing public debt effects than especially Liberal countries. There, public debt apparently exerts neutral or even positive growth effects, while for Nordic countries a non-linear relationship is discovered, with negative debt effects kicking in at public debt values of around 60% of GDP.
P51|Foreign agents? Natural resources & the political economy of civil society|Resource-rich dictatorships are more inclined to repress civil society than others. In this paper, we identify a tradeoff between political rents from natural resources and the organizational density of civil society. This organizational density determines the extent to which citizens can threaten the dictator with a revolution. We find that, in the occurrence of a negative oil price shock, regime change becomes likely, whereas a positive oil shock increases the extractive capacity of the dictator. When a negative oil price shock occurs, the persecution of failed revolutionaries can prevent revolution if the probability of revolutionary success is already low ex-ante. Historical and contemporary illustrations are drawn from Iran, the Soviet Union/Russia and Egypt.
P51|Soft budget constraints, European Central Banking and the financial crisis|During the European financial crisis, the European Central Bank implemented a series of unconventional monetary policy measures. We argue that these unconventional monetary policy measures created soft budget constraints for the Eurozone countries by lowering their bond yield spreads. This hypothesis is tested using pooled OLS estimations and two different datasets: monetary policy event dummies and the purchase volumes of the Securities Markets Programme (SMP). We find significantly negative effects on bond yield spreads for both datasets, leading us to accept the hypothesis. The results are confirmed by robustness checks that directly estimate the effect of unconventional monetary policy on central government debt.
P51|Financialization and the crises of capitalism|Since the 1980s, the financial sector and its role have increased significantly. This development is often referred to as financialization. Authors working in the heterodox tradition have raised the question whether the changing role of finance manifests a new era in the history of capitalism. The present article first provides some general discussion on the term financialization and presents some stylized facts which highlight the rise of finance. Then, it proceeds by briefly reviewing the main arguments in the Marxian framework that proposedly lead to crisis. Next, two schools of thought in the Marxian tradition are reviewed which consider financialization as the latest stage of capitalism. They highlight the contradictions imposed by financialization that disrupt the growth process and also stress the fragilities imposed by the new growth regime. The two approaches introduced here are the Social Structure of Accumulation Theory and Monthly Review School. The subsequent part proceeds with the Post-Keynesian theory, first introducing potential destabilizing factors before discussing financialization and the finance-led growth regime. The last section provides a comparative summary. While the basic narrative in all approaches considered here is quite similar, major differences stem from the relationship between neoliberalism and financialization and, moreover, from the question of whether financialization can be considered cause or effect.
P51|Will a government find it financially easier to neutralize a looming protest if more groups are involved?|Abstract We study a policy response to an increase in post-merger social stress. If a merger of groups of people is viewed as a revision of their social space, then the merger alters people’s comparators and increases social stress: the social stress of a merged population is greater than the sum of the levels of social stress of the constituent populations when apart. We use social stress as a proxy measure for looming social protest. As a response to the post-merger increase in social stress, we consider a policy aimed at reversing the negative effect of the merger by bringing the social stress of the merged population back to the sum of the pre-merger levels of social stress of the constituent populations when apart. We present, in the form of an algorithm, a cost-effective policy response which is publicly financed and does not reduce the incomes of the members of the merged population. We then compare the financial cost of implementing such a policy when the merger involves more or fewer groups. We show that the cost may fall as the number of merging groups rises.
P51|The White Man’s Burden: On the Effect of African Resistance to European Domination|Are there contemporary development effects of African resistance to European domination? This question is the primary issue addressed by this inquiry. We establish that African resistance has had adverse effects on post-colonial African development and discuss possible channels of such causality. This relationship is robust to alternative model and to controlling for the outliers.
P51|Employee Representation Legislations and Innovation|We analyse how countries' innovation outcomes are affected by national legislations of worker participation to corporate governance. We develop a model of employee representation laws (ERL) and innovation in the presence of incomplete labour contracts and predict heterogeneous ERL effects across different systems of dismissal regulation. We then perform a panel regression analysis, exploiting 2-digit panel data for 21 manufacturing sectors of USA, UK, India, France and Germany, over the 1977-2005 period. We find that ERL effects on aggregate innovation output are positive, statistically significant and higher in magnitude where national labour laws impose significant ring costs to the firm with respect to institutional settings in which ring costs are low or absent. These results are robust to possible technology selection dynamics, endogeneity and institutional changes in the legal system of patent protection. We also estimate ERL effects on innovation conditional on ring costs at an industry level and show that the impact of ERL is relatively larger in those sectors where the human capital contribution to production is higher. Our results have relevant implications for the optimal design of employee representation legislations.
P51|The Arab and Post-Communist Transitions: Similarities, Differences, and Common Lessons|At the onset of the mass protests in 2010–2011, many politicians and experts suggested that Arab countries could learn from the experiences of the post-communist transition of the early 1990s. However, the geopolitical, historical, and socio-economic context of the Arab transition was different in many respects from that of the former Soviet bloc countries 20 years earlier. These differences became even more obvious five years later, in early 2016, when most Arab transition attempts ended either in a new wave of authoritarianism, or protracted bloody conflicts. Nonetheless, there are some common lessons to be learnt from the history of both transitions. They concern interrelations between the political and economic transition, the role of institutional checks and balances and the rule of law, the speed of reforms, the dangers of ethnic and sectarian conflicts, and the role of external support.
P51|Highlighting The Economic And Financial Losses In Ecosystems, With Special Reference To The Forest Ecosystems Of The Bargau Mountains|At the moment, the disruptions (mainly negative ones) in the social &economic systems have fewer short-term solutions, and the medium and longterm ones disregard the greater sustainable development at micro, meso and macrolevels. The economic and financial losses registered in such eco-systems, affected by disruptions of their stability and integrity, lead, in most cases, to major climate changes, especially at regional level and in the local zones, with unexpected, diverse and sometimes irreversible implications for the ecological environment. A quantifiable value for such losses, which are both quantitative and qualitative, in a specific case (the losses in terms of Norway spruce, Picea abies, forests affected by biotic and abiotic factors in the Bargau Mountains) may provide new approach methods. This is the view which interests us: the economic and financial losses may be quantifiable in terms of effects of the disruptions caused, a ‘snowball’ effect, with larger damages (losses) in the adjacent zones or downstream of the Bargau Mountains (a situation that can be generalised). Forest ecosystems are affected quantitatively by several destabilizing factors, in particular due to the action of wind and snow and the quality of the wounds caused by the large game, by way of a decrease in the wood (bears, deer). Three of the four ecosystems are located in the Management Units (working circle)II Iliuta from the Tihuta-Colibita RA Forest District, in the sub-divisions: 75 C and 662 B, for which research has been conducted on the 60 year-oldecosystem, and 363 D, where the ecosystem is 120 years old.
P51|In Medio Stat Virtus: Does A Mixed Economy Increase Welfare?|Over the past few decades, social enterprises have grown remarkably. This paper investigates how social enterprises affect access to social services (e.g., education and health-care) and utilitarian welfare. To this end, two economic systems are compared: a market economy system, where all firms are profit maximizers, and a mixed economy system, where both for-profit businesses and social enterprises are present. Findings show that individuals are more likely to have access to social services within mixed economy. Moreover, conditions are derived under which utilitarian welfare is larger within mixed economy. Public policies in support of social enterprises (e.g., subsidies) are shown to result in the following trade-off: access to social services is further enhanced but utilitarian welfare is more likely to be lower than that within market economy.
P51|Role of social and economic interactions in territory development of Iceland|Iceland was identified as a country with relatively high achieved competitiveness level and at the same time negative growth capacity, i.e. trend of relatively fast declining of this competitiveness. As a research hypothesis the authors suggest that Iceland's social and economic interactions - looking at the interconnection of this country with other â€œworlds-economiesâ€ - are not diversified enough. The analysis of export and import flows, flows of international migration as well as logistic interconnections (direct flights) of Iceland shows that â€œenergy consumers with strong social infrastructureâ€ (â€œthe USAâ€™s/the UKâ€™s groupâ€ ), i.e. a market-capitalist â€œworld-economyâ€ , is an absolute leader (80-90%) for Icelandic international trade and migration â€“ both incoming and outgoing. The research hypothesis that Icelandâ€™s territorial development (in particular, negative trend of territory development during the last 10 years) is greatly determined by intensity and direction of Icelandâ€™s social and economic interactions, has been proved based on the analysis of Icelandic statistics as well as results of several researches â€“ both Icelandic and global. As the outcomes of the research showed, Iceland is â€œon friendly termsâ€ mainly with the representatives of its own â€œworld-economyâ€ . Also a kind of sub-â€œworld-economyâ€ is formed which can be referred to as a Northern-Atlantic one. Social and economic interactions with the representatives of its own â€œworld-economyâ€ mainly draw Icelandâ€™s territory development in their direction, and, as the trends of their development are negative or stagnate, Icelandâ€™s trend of competitiveness generally is also drawn after them.
P51|So what is Capital in the Twenty-First Century? Some notes on Piketty’s book Working paper, forthcoming in Capitalism & Society|This study was inspired by Piketty’s excellent and important book. Its title and numerous statements in it arouse in readers expectations of a comprehensive analysis of capitalism. By comparison the author of this paper felt important aspects were lacking. The capitalist system has numerous immanent traits and innate tendencies, of which the paper takes a closer look at three properties. 1. One basic feature is dynamism, innovation, and creative destruction. No picture of capitalism can be full if this basic aspect is ignored. 2. Capitalism inevitably brings about a high degree of inequality; this must be eased by reforms, but cannot be entirely overcome. 3. The basic characteristics of capitalism – private ownership and the dominance of market coordination – give rise to strong incentive mechanisms that encourage but owners and enterprise executives to innovate and to cooperate effectively. One of the main incentives is competition, especially oligopolistic competition. There are strong mutual effects among these three important tendencies. It is impossible to understand well Piketty’s main subject, the distribution of income and wealth, if it is divorced from the other two tendencies. The study ends with its author’s own value judgements on the favourable and harmful, unjust attributes of the capitalist system.
P51|Politico-Economic Regimes And Attitudes: Female Workers Under State-Socialism Abstract: This paper investigates the extent to which attitudes are affected by political regimes and government policies. We focus on female attitudes toward work and gender-role attitudes in the population at large, which have been shown to have significant effects on labor market outcomes. We exploit the imposition of state-socialist regimes across Central and Eastern Europe, and their efforts to promote women’s economic inclusion, for both instrumental and ideological reasons, presenting evidence from two different datasets. First, we take advantage of the German partition into East and West after 1945 and unique access to restricted information on place of residence to implement a spatial regression discontinuity design. We find more positive attitudes toward work in the sample of East German women. We also find evidence that increased female access to higher education and fulltime employment, arguably two of the very few positive aspects of living under state-socialism, may have served as channels for regime influence. Second, we employ a difference-in-differences strategy that compares attitudes formed in Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) and Western European Countries (WECs), before and after the imposition of state socialism in CEECs. Gender-role attitudes formed in CEECs during the state socialist period appear to be significantly less traditional than those formed in WECs|No abstract is available for this item.
P51|Trust and the regulation of corporate self-dealing|The economic impact of corporate self-dealing and the regulation against such activity both vary across countries. In this work, we examine the influence of trust on shareholder protection. We hypothesize that anonymous trust can affect self-dealing through two channels. First, trust may complement existing formal regulation. Alternatively, trust and formal regulation can act as substitutes. To test these hypotheses, we examine the association between a country's anti-self-dealing index and anonymous trust. We find that anonymous trust inversely relates to formal self-dealing regulation. We further find that anonymous trust positively relates to financial market development. Collectively, this evidence suggests that trust substitutes for formal self-dealing regulation, providing an alternative mechanism for shareholder protection.
P51|On the intensity of liquidity spillovers in the Eurozone|This paper seeks to elucidate dimensions and directions of the liquidity spillover phenomenon in the Eurozone equity markets during the global financial crisis of 2007–2008. The research examines questions relevant to the shift-contagion in the Eurozone countries during the time of crisis, as well as the role of a liquidity channel of transmission relaying external shocks among those countries. The findings document the existence of non-linearities in the transmission mechanisms across selected markets; we use a structural model introduced by Favero and Giavazzi (2002) while controlling for interdependence. The result is in line with the crisis-contingent theories that suggest transmission of shocks through an endogenous liquidity channel. Furthermore, we notice a pattern of liquidity spillover from small markets to the German, French, Italian and UK markets even after controlling for monetary policy shocks, and we confirm the persistence of liquidity co-movements, supporting the argument that financial contagion in the Eurozone market was transmitted and intensified via the liquidity channel.
P51|Language, culture and institutions: Evidence from a new linguistic dataset|Kashima and Kashima's (1998) linguistic dataset has played a prominent role in the economics of culture, providing the instrumental variables used in two seminal works to identify the causal effect of culture on institutional quality. However, for economists, this dataset has a number of weaknesses, including poor overlap with a key cultural dataset and reliance on sources of linguistic information of uneven quality. We address these issues by constructing a new linguistic dataset based on an authoritative source of linguistic information, the World Atlas of Language Structures. The resulting dataset has greater overlap with key sources of cultural information, is arguably less subject to selection bias, and provides more refined information regarding key dimensions of linguistic variation. We show that the variables in this dataset are significantly correlated with commonly used measures of individualism and egalitarianism. In addition, we reexamine the key results from the literature on culture and institutions, showing the causal relationship between culture and institutions is robust to the use of the new linguistic instruments.
P51|Do the type of sukuk and choice of shari’a scholar matter?|Sukuk, the shari’a-compliant alternative mode of financing to conventional bonds, have considerably expanded over the last decade. We analyze the stock market reaction to two key features of this instrument: sukuk type and characteristics of the shari’a scholar certifying the issue. We use the event study methodology to measure abnormal returns for a sample of 131 sukuk from eight countries over the period 2006–2013 and find that Ijara sukuk structures exert a positive influence on the stock price of the issuing firm. We observe a similar positive impact from shari’a scholar reputation and proximity to issuer. Overall our results support the hypotheses that the type of sukuk and the choice of scholars hired to certify these securities matter for the market valuation of the issuing company.
P51|Religious origins of democracy & dictatorship|Weber considered the Protestant work ethic the foundation of modern capitalism. I extend Weber's theory by arguing that states with predominantly Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Muslim populations have had a stronger inclination toward underdevelopment and dictatorship than states with Protestant or Jewish majorities. This is the case because their respective religious collectives (monastery, tariqa) promote the hierarchical provision of common goods at the expense of market incentives. I define the aforementioned three religions as collectivist, in contrast to Protestantism and Judaism, which I define as individualist. I provide a historical overview that designates the Jewish kibbutz as the collective of democracy and the Eastern Orthodox monastery as the collective of dictatorship. Focusing on collectivist economies, I find that modernization, as a credible commitment to the improved future provision of public goods, occurs when the threat of a radical government is imminent and when the leader has high extraction of rents from the economy. The emergence of radical governments is more likely in collectivist than in individualist economies. Historical illustrations from collectivist economies include the Russian Revolution, the Islamic Revolution in Iran, and the postwar welfare state in Western Europe.
P51|Want freedom, will travel: Emigrant self-selection according to institutional quality|We investigate emigrant self-selection according to institutional quality using up to 3566 observations on bilateral migration flows from 77 countries over the 1990–2000 period. We relate these flows to differences in political and economic institutions. We improve and expand upon previous studies by (i) examining decade-long migration flows that (ii) include flows not only to OECD countries but also to non-OECD countries, also (iii) utilizing an estimation method that takes into account the information in zero value migration flows and (iv) examining not only total migration flows but also college-educated and non-college-educated subsamples separately. We find that economic freedoms are a significant pull factor for potential migrants. Once economic freedoms are controlled for, measures of political institutions do not always enter significantly into our estimations. Results are similar for college- and non-college-educated subsamples. Improvements in legal systems and property rights appear to be the strongest pull factor for potential migrants.
P51|Why do companies issue sukuk?|This paper investigates the determinants for firms to choose sukuk over conventional bond. We investigate the potential impact of information asymmetries through moral hazard and adverse selection to explain why firms prefer using sukuk. We perform logit regressions of the choice of debt type to determine which characteristics lead a firm to issue a sukuk rather than a bond. We use a dataset of sukuk and conventional bond issuances in Malaysia from 2004 to 2013. We find evidence of the influence of information asymmetries and adverse selection on the choice of the sukuk market.
P51|Coping with the Horizontal Hitch: The 'Con-Formism' of the Degrowth Alternative|Normally, during modernity, critical thinking and anti-systemic movements have countered the ruling institutions by envisaging not only new values and ideals, but mainly new 'forms' of social regulation. The current crisis reveals that, contrary to this tradition, the institutions in office and the antagonistic way of thinking now share the same basic 'horizontal' form. The degrowth project represents a paradigmatic example of this structural homology. The ecological and social crises, standing at the origins of the political engagement for degrowth, are not the outcome of execrable 'values' but mainly of the 'horizontal' form adopted by current institutions. In fact, the horizontal regime is uninterested in the promotion of specific values or ideas of justice. It only ensures that each singularity (the citizen and their networks) can freely play their game on the basis of their own values. This indifference is the basic reason for ecological, social and economic deregulation. The paradox of degrowth is that, on the one hand, it evokes the necessity of a return to 'vertical' regulation (i.e. collective sovereignty), while on the other, it is deeply subaltern to the paradigm of horizontalism (the same that frames the growth regime).
P51|Financing of Social Protection Systems. Budget Funds for Social Economy|In the present article I propose to address some of the problems of financing social protection systems and we chose to analyze the partial financing of budgetary funds of a non-profit organization, funds which they can use in order to continue and develop further projects within social economy. The main purpose of the social economy, compared with the market economy order is not making profit, but is to improve living conditions and delivering new for disadvantaged or vulnerable part of. Case study exposed, reveals how an NGO can to keep the values which characterize - transparency, responsibility, accountability, integrity, solidarity, courage, justice, democracy - through economic power and it can get during its evolution. I will present a few milestones of financing social protection systems in case the Romanian Association for Transparency has managed to highlight the social economy structures in Romania. This study is intended to be a research paper in order to analyze means of obtaining allocations of funds for development organizations, organizations that play an important role in supporting government policies. We presented the sources of funding that an association may use in order to accomplish the objectives and to capitalize know-how, while continuing to engage in social life, making her known values and Principe. The use of budgetary funds and the non-refundable but is an alternative to obtaining a possibility of self-financing organization and implementation of social policies and processes in different systems of social protection financing.
P51|Does democracy reduce the HIV epidemic? Evidence from Kenya|Does democracy help Kenyan citizens to struggle against the HIV epidemic? Yet, very little attention has been devoted to establish whether political regimes react differently to the HIV infection. Using an electoral definition of democracy makes a contribution in understanding which aspects of political rules matter to manage the disease. Using a difference-in-difference design that draws upon pre-existing variations in HIV intensity and cohort's exposure to democracy, we find that a person living under democracy is less likely to have a HIV infection. Further, we present some evidence of ethnic favoritism and gender disparities during periods of non-democracy.
P51|Estructuras económicas y tendencias del Crecimiento Real en Bolivia, 1980-2015|En este trabajo se describe la estructura económica de Bolivia a lo largo del período trimestral que abarca desde 1980 al 2015, mediante el uso de los momentos estadísticos; a la vez de puntualizar los acontecimientos que influyeron en el comportamiento del producto interno bruto a nivel consolidado y sectorial. Este análisis comprende el crecimiento sectorial y la magnitud en que éstos participan en el producto interno bruto (Pib). En consecuencia, se deduce la capacidad de las políticas públicas para fortalecer los sectores que presentan mayor relación o asociación con el crecimiento de la economía. Los resultados indican que en Bolivia dos sectores que evidenciaron mayor crecimiento (petróleo-gas y electricidad-agua), son los que menos aportaron a la composición del Pib. Por otra parte, el sector de mayor participación en la economía (manufactura), fue el que mostró menor crecimiento sectorial. A su vez, todos los sectores ejercieron una participación entorno a su promedio, excepto la contribución relativa de la administración pública –sin condición estadística de normalidad- para el período abordado.
P51|Quality of employment regimes and diversity of emerging countries|Emerging countries and their leaders, the BRICS, can be revisited with an institutionalist approach enabling a better recognition of their diversity. Focusing on the composition of their labour nexus, this paper offers to question the category formed by these countries by studying their variety of quality of employment regimes. Two interesting results came out from this study using a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and a Mixed Clustering (MC) break two institutional dimensions into fourteen indicators. (1) Four specific quality of employment regimes appear, illustrating their heterogeneity and the weakness of this category. (2) The BRICS appear notably scattered over some socio-economic aspects of each leader. Far from composing a coherent and independent regime, BRICS countries dispersion can be explained by a specific combination of socio-economic and institutional factors to each one of them.

P51|Soviet Foreign Trade Earnings Revisited|Soviet statistics authorities attempted to incorporate foreign trade earnings into national income, based on a unique formula. First, we clarify that they must have applied the so called Burge-Geary system for trading gain or terms of trade to their specific accounting in a different context. Then we prove that this Soviet practice should have been corrected. Second, demonstrating our estimate of Soviet foreign trade earnings by using Soviet official data on foreign trade and input-output tables, we explore implications of our estimate. We further look at how present Russia has succeeded to the Soviet statistical and institutional legacies of foreign trade earnings in the national accounting.
P51|Estimating GDP and Foreign Rents of the Oil and Gas Sector in the USSR then and Russia now|A Soviet legacy for present-day Russia is found in its resource dependency as well as its implicit exposition of resource rents from foreign trade in the national accounting. Estimating rents from the oreign trade of oil and gas, we demonstrate how large the GDP of the oil and gas sector had been in the Soviet Union and has been in present-day Russia, as well.
P51|The Scandinavian Fantasy: Sources of Intergenerational Mobility in Denmark and the US|This paper examines the sources of differences in social mobility between the US and Denmark. Measured by income mobility, Denmark is a more mobile society, but not when measured by educational mobility. There are pronounced non‐linearities in income and educational mobility in both countries. Greater Danish income mobility is largely a consequence of redistributional tax, transfer, and wage compression policies. While Danish social policies for children produce more favorable cognitive test scores for disadvantaged children, they do not translate into more favorable educational outcomes, partly because of disincentives to acquire education arising from the redistributional policies that increase income mobility.
P51|Problems of Management by Balanced Long-Term Economic Development through Physical Economy|The purpose of the research is to substantiate physical and economic basis for economic development management. This refers to necessity to base management theory and practice on combination of classical and the latest economic and management provisions developed by devotees of the European science of the XVIII-XXI century with improvements made by Ukrainian scientists such as S.A. Podolinskyi, V.I. Vernadskyi and M.D. Rudenko. It discloses physical and economic basis for economic development management. Attention is paid to economic balance issues and analyses formulas, which should be taken as a basis to build complete model of economic balance that by its ontology is based on fundamental energy conservation and conversion law. It presents the balance summation of the annual yield and distribution of cereal crop in the conditions of extended reproduction, common reproduction and in the conditions of formation of distortion of public reproduction. It was proven that scientific heritage of Ukrainian thinkers enables to define edges of economic development management on a physical economy basis.
P51|Innovation Accounting Of Tax-Revenue Drivers: Cointegration Evidence From Ghana|This study uses cointegration, and innovation accounting analysis to examine the volatility and extent of the short-term and long-term relationships between the drivers of tax revenues and tax revenues in Ghana from 1980 to 2011. The principal and consistent discovery from this study is that cocoa farmersâ€™ tax (CFTAX) is the least volatile and import taxes (IMPTAX), is the most volatile in the observed period. The estimated cointegrating relationships identify at least two long-run vectors for the drivers of tax revenues. We also find that among the drivers of tax revenues, the cocoa farmersâ€™ income taxes are the quickest to adjust to long-run equilibrium in the current year. The forecast error variance decompositions reveal that the cocoa farmersâ€™ income taxes are the strongest endogenous of the VAR system driver of tax revenues, and that they play a dominant role in Ghanaian tax revenues in the observed period. The empirical evidence supports the descriptive statistics that cocoa farmersâ€™ income tax revenues remain the largest and most reliable source of income for the Ghanaian economy. Since tax revenues from cocoa farmers continue to drop because of falling cocoa futures and low production, Ghanaian policymakers must diversify their taxrevenue drivers to include a sales tax on discretionary goods and services such as imported tobacco and imported alcohol. As tax revenue increase option has become elusive, the hardline option is to gradually eliminate government expenditures in the areas of colonial delicacies such as free fuel, chauffeurs for government officials (ministers and members of parliament etc), excessive per diems from the president to other government officials and many more, just to mention but few
P51|Government activity and economic growth – one size fits All?|Abstract This study investigates the role of government activity in economic growth, arguing that economic systems are important and that, therefore, one size of government does not fit all countries. Taking a panel of 111 countries over the years from 1971 to 2010, we consider clusters of economic systems as predicted by an extended Varieties of Capitalism (VoC) approach. The empirical growth impact of government activity is positive but u-shaped and depends on both the quality of institutions and the institutional setting. For the polar cases of liberal economies and Scandinavian coordinated market economies, the potential growth impact is quite similar and superior to other clusters of countries. However, the maximum growth effect is realized for above-average levels of government activity in the Scandinavian countries, while this would be detrimental to growth in liberal countries. Hence, high levels of government activity are consistent with growth but only in economic systems consistently rooted in a high level of government activity.

A meghatározó okok kvantitatív elemzése<BR>[Differences in death rates between East-Central and Western European countries. Quantitative analysis of the deciding factors]|Európa keleti és nyugatit részén a munkaképes korú népesség halálozási rátái még napjainkban is lényeges különbségeket mutatnak. E cikkben 45 ország 2011. évi halálozási rátáit vizsgáljuk, és keresztmetszeti regressziós elemzéssel számszerűsítjük az országok közötti eltérések okait.

P51|Comparing the Global and Merged with the Local and Separate: On a Downside to the Integration of Regions and Nations|This paper looks at the integration of regions and nations through the prism of the merger of populations (societies). The paper employs a particular index of social stress. Stylized examples of the merging of two populations suggest that with integration, the social stress index will increase. The examples form the basis for the development of new formulas for calculating the social stress of an integrated population as a function of the levels of social stress of the constituent populations when apart. The formulas reveal that the social stress of an integrated population is higher than the sum of the levels of social stress of the constituent populations when apart. This raises the distinct possibility that the merging of populations may be a social liability: integration may fail to give the populace a sense of improved wellbeing.
P51|Spiegare la crisi: stagnazione secolare o caduta tendenziale del saggio del profitto?|Summers has recently reintroduced the hypothesis of “secular stagnation”, first proposed by Alvin Hansen in 1938 as an explanation for the protracted slump of the US economy. However, the secular stagnation hypothesis looks rather as a description, than as an explanation of the current low-growth environment. In this paper we consider the Marxian hypothesis of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall as an alternative theoretical paradigm. Looking at the post-WWII data, the Marxian hypothesis provides an adequate picture of the long-run growth trends. This conclusion is reinforced once we take into account the counteracting factors mentioned by Marx, all of which, and in particular the use of share capital, were operating in the last decades. The paper concludes by outlining some alternative scenarios of recovery.
P51|Democracy and Globalization Are not Prerequisites for Higher Income: A Cross Country Analysis|This paper reports results from a cross country econometric analyses over 150 countries pertaining to possible correlation between per capita GDP and democracy, corruption, globalization and human development indices. Our findings include 1) of the four indices, the human development index has the strongest influence on per capita GDP and its growth, 2) fighting corruption pays as higher levels of cleanliness and transparency tend to raise per capita GDP, but less so in lower income economies, 3) the globalization index does not show any significant correlation with per capita GDP, and 4) the democracy index is not significantly correlated with per capita GDP or growth. but in some country it can hinder growth. The moral of our investigation is that economic growth does not automatically lead to better democracy, and higher per capita income does not warrant higher level of democracy. Democracy is not a means to higher income, but rather, it is an independent value in itself.

One feature of monetary unification, which replaces diverse currencies with a common currency, is that it brings about a change in the comparison environment, expanding the reference space of individuals in a given country to encompass individuals from the joining countries. Overall, calculations regarding six enlargements of the Economic and Monetary Union between 1999 and 2011 reveal an increase of ARD on six occasions when we hold incomes constant, and on five when we take into consideration changes in incomes. In addition, we observe an uneven distribution of the costs and benefits from monetary integration among the participating countries when these costs and benefits are measured in terms of ARD."
P51|Transition Towards a New Phase? The crisis of 2007-2008 and its impact on current metamorphosis of capitalism|This manuscript investigates how far has the post-crisis global economy navigated towards a new phase of capitalism. This question is underpinned by a conjecture: capitalism, as a dynamic and flexible economic system, has in their crises a key element for its long-term dynamics. The manuscript is organized in five sections. The first surveys the literature on the role of crises in metamorphoses of capitalism. The second section surveys the structural changes before the crises, the third section summarizes the rescue operation and movements in the epicentre of the crisis, and the fourth section asks whether or not structural reforms of capitalism are in the political agenda. The fifth section evaluates the stage of current transition towards a new phase of global capitalism.
P51|Private enforcement, corruption, and antitrust design|We examine how the rationale for enabling versus precluding private antitrust enforcement depends on whether antitrust enforcement is corruption-free or plagued by corruption. Corruption in courts affects the incentives to bring forth private antitrust lawsuits. This, in turn, along with corruption in antitrust agency enforcement, alters the incentives to commit antitrust violations. The social welfare effect of enabling private antitrust enforcement in the presence of corruption depends on whether corrupt officials in the ensuing bribery contests favor a particular firm and if so which one and to what extent. Under some circumstances, corruption actually increases the social desirability of private antitrust enforcement relative to the no-corruption scenario. Our analysis highlights that the effects of a given legal arrangement for antitrust enforcement critically depend on the corruption environment and, thus, that the appropriate design of antitrust institutions is context-specific.
P51|Is Seeing Believing? How Americans and Germans Think about their Schools|What do citizens of the United States and Germany think about their schools and school policies? This paper offers the first broad comparison of public thinking on education in the two countries. We carried out opinion surveys of representative samples of the German and American adult populations in 2014 that included experiments in which we provided additional information to randomly selected subgroups. The paper first describes key characteristics of the U.S. and German education systems and then analyzes how information and institutional context affect public beliefs in the two countries. Results indicate both similarities and differences in the structure of American and German public opinion on schools and school policies.
P51|Does the Euro affect the dynamic relation between stock market liquidity and the business cycle?|Does Eurozone equity market liquidity affect economic growth? If so, how does the Euro currency affect the dynamic relationship between growth and stock market liquidity (macro-liquidity relation) of the Eurozone? We address these questions using data from ten Eurozone countries and the UK. The findings document the predictability role of liquidity proxies on economic growth, suggesting that stock market liquidity influences economic growth. The results reveal that liquidity increases substantially after a structural break realized around the Euro's introduction in Europe, and in all countries except Portugal we find that liquidity improvement coincides with higher growth. During periods of high exchange-rate volatility between currencies (which tend to be periods of high uncertainty and economic convergence), growth becomes highly affected by stock market liquidity movements.
P51|On the wrong side of the law – Causes and consequences of a corrupt judiciary|Empirical research on the determinants of corruption has made substantial progress over the last decade. To date, the consequences of different structures of the legal enforcement institutions have, however, only played a marginal role. This contribution deals with both the determinants of corruption in the judiciary and the consequences of judicial organization for corruption at large. Regarding the latter, it is shown that the actual independence of the judiciary as well as that of prosecution agencies is correlated with lower levels of corruption. This is also true for a third indicator that measures the degree to which judges are held accountable for their decisions (“judicial accountability”). Furthermore, independence and accountability function as complements in preventing corruption – judicial accountability without independence appears to be ineffective, whereas judicial or prosecutorial independence alone can even have adverse effects.
P51|Economic growth and judicial independence, a dozen years on: Cross-country evidence using an updated Set of indicators|Over 10years ago, Feld and Voigt (2003) introduced an indicator for objectively measuring the actual independence of the judiciary and demonstrated its utility in a large cross-section of countries. The indicator has been widely used, but also criticized. Many new indicators for judicial independence have been developed since. Yet, all of them are based on subjective evaluations by experts or confined to measuring the legally prescribed level of independence. This paper presents more recent objective data on de jure and de facto judicial independence (JI) and strongly confirms previous results that de jure JI is not systematically related to economic growth, whereas de facto JI is highly significantly and robustly correlated with growth. In addition, we show that the effect of de facto JI depends on the institutional environment, but not on a country’s initial per capita income.
P51|Institutions and diversification: Related versus unrelated diversification in a varieties of capitalism framework|The varieties of capitalism literature has drawn little attention to industrial renewal and diversification, while the related diversification literature has neglected the institutional dimension of industrial change. Bringing together both literatures, the paper proposes that institutions have an impact on the direction of the diversification process, in particular on whether countries gain a comparative advantage in new sectors that are close or far from what is already part of their existing industrial structure. We investigate the diversification process in 23 developed countries by means of detailed product trade data in the period 1995–2010. Our results show that relatedness is a stronger driver of diversification into new products in coordinated market economies, while liberal market economies show a higher probability to move in more unrelated industries: their overarching institutional framework gives countries more freedom to make a jump in their industrial evolution. In particular, we found that the role of relatedness as driver of diversification into new sectors is stronger in the presence of institutions that focus more on ‘non-market’ coordination in the domains of labor relations, corporate governance relations, product market relations, and inter-firm relations.
P51|Endogenous supply side constraints to export-led growth and aggregate growth implications in transition economies|This paper analyses the endogenous limits to export-led growth inherent in an economy's supply side. The supply side determination of export growth relates it, as well as the cross-sectoral subsidy, to the economy's industrial structure and difference in productivity growth between sectors. Starting off from fixed sector sizes we endogenise the relation between sector sizes and the productivity growth differential and highlight an economy's structural flexibility. We also highlight the differing implications for the economy from whether a widening productivity growth gap is due to higher productivity growth in the tradable sector or lower productivity growth in the non-tradable sector. When analyzing a transition economy's ability to transform differences in productivity growth into aggregate growth we find a highly context specific relation. We show how transition might be characterized by aggregate growth exceeding tradable sector productivity growth or vice versa depending on the combination between industrial structure, the prevailing incentives for structural change and the ability to take advantage of such incentives. We identify tipping points for endogenous phase shifts where aggregate growth changes from accelerating to diminishing growth and vice versa.
P51|Institutions Do Not Rule: Reassessing the Driving Forces of Economic Development|The pursuit to uncover the driving forces behind cross-country income gaps has divided economists into two major camps: One emphasizes institutions, while the other stresses non-institutional forces such as geography. Each school of thought has its own theoretical foundation and empirical support, but they share an implicit hypothesis—the forces driving economic development remain the same regardless of a country’s stage of development. Such hypothesis implies a theory that the process of development in human history is a continuous improvement in income levels, driven by the same forces, and that structural changes do not dictate the influences of geography and institutions on national income. This paper tests this theory and found it not supported by the data. Specifically, non-institutional factors predominantly explain the cross-country income variations among agrarian countries, while institutional factors largely account for the income differences across industrialized economies. In addition, we find evidence of developmental trap in which noninstitutional forces explain a country’s lack of industrialization, while institutions do not. The finding that institutions cannot account for the absence/presence of industrialization lends support to views held by many prominent historians who have cast serious doubts on the notion that institutional changes caused the British Industrial Revolution.
P51|Institutional Constraints on Modern Economic Growth|"How to import modern Western Institutions to suppress economic growth in underdeveloped countries? Russian experience and some warnings for newcoming reformers The monograph «Institutional Constraints on Modern Economic Growth"" deals with the most dangerous obstacles standing in the way of long term economic growth. Some of these obstacles have been studied extensively, while others are well known but have been largely forgotten over time; finally, there are some that for various reasons are normally ignored. ""I believe that the United States today is not an appropriate model for Mexico or other low-income countries…. There have been no summits about how you privatize governmental activities. You have seen summits about how to raise taxes, about spending more of the taxpayers' money, about how to impose more controls on the people. That is the sense in which I say, take as your model the U.S. in its first 150 years. We can afford our nonsense now because we had so long a period during which to build a base.

P51|"\""The parts and the whole”: Unbundling and re-bundling institutional systems and their effect on economic development"|This paper surveys the growing empirical neo-institutional literature dealing with economic development and shows that it has essentially developed a one-dimensional perspective on institutions and their effect on economic development that has overlooked the fact that economic effects of institutions actually tend to cluster. The paper introduces an original framework to analyze institutional systems and the clustered effect of institutions. Drawing on this framework and on recent empirical studies having attempted to unbundle or re-bundle institutional systems along these lines, it is argued that understanding how institutions cluster their impact on economic outcomes imposes to give more attention to institutional systems, notably by (1) unbundling the specific economic effects of specialized institutions from those of such general purpose institutions as rule of law or property right enforcement, and by (2) re-bundling these effects so that de jure and de facto complementarities and hierarchies can be identified between specialized and general purpose institutions.
P51|Banking Unconditionally: The Political Economy of Chinese Finance in Latin America|Globalization scholars have long-debated to what extent economic integration, and specifically, mobile private capital constrains national policymaking. With Western capital reeling from the 2008 financial crisis, state-owned capital made inroads globally. China, as the world's largest saver, expanded its cross-border lending, funneling almost US$300 billion to developing countries since the crisis. What are the implications for debtor governments' room to maneuver? I argue that China's rapid financial expansion globally has helped increase national-level policy flexibility by removing the budget constraint traditionally imposed by the IMF and global markets. Unlike their stringent borrower conditionality, Chinese investors tend not to impose onerous policy conditions. Given the recent emergence of Chinese financing, I employ a comparative case study analysis of two of China's largest debtors â€” Brazil and Venezuela â€” before and after the introduction of Chinese credit. I find that government budget deficits increase as Chinese state-to-state financing accounts for a larger share of total external public financing. These findings offer important new insights for the study of globalization, the Latin American left, and China-Latin American relations, by helping explain the structural conditions that enable nations to veer from Western governance models.

P51|International currency exposures, valuation effects and the global financial crisis|We examine the evolution of international currency exposures, with a particular focus on the 2002–12 period. During the run up to the global financial crisis, there was a widespread shift towards positive net foreign currency positions, such that relatively few countries exhibited the archetypal emerging-market “short foreign currency” position on the eve of the global financial crisis. During the crisis, the upheaval in currency markets generated substantial currency-generated valuation effects — much of which were not reversed. There is some evidence that the distribution of valuation effects was stabilizing in the sense of showing a negative covariation pattern with pre-crisis net foreign asset positions.
P51|International Currency Exposures, Valuation Effects, and the Global Financial Crisis|"We examine the evolution of international currency exposures, with a particular focus on the 2002-12 period. During the run up to the global financial crisis, there was a widespread shift towards positive net foreign currency positions, such that relatively few countries exhibited the archetypal emerging-market short foreign currency"" position on the eve of the global financial crisis. During the crisis, the upheaval in currency markets generated substantial currency-generated valuation effects - much of which were not reversed. There is some evidence that the distribution of valuation effects was stabilizing in the sense of showing a negative covariation pattern with pre-crisis net foreign asset positions.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
P51|Rounding the Corners of the Policy Trilemma: Sources of Monetary Policy Autonomy|A central result in international macroeconomics is that a government cannot simultaneously opt for open financial markets, fixed exchange rates, and monetary autonomy; rather, it is constrained to choosing no more than two of these three. This paper considers whether partial capital controls and limited exchange rate flexibility allow for full monetary policy autonomy. We find partial capital controls do not generally allow for greater monetary control than with open capital accounts, unless they are quite extensive, but a moderate amount of exchange rate flexibility does allow for some degree of monetary autonomy, especially in emerging and developing economies.

P51|Firm Learning and Growth|We study the implications of introducing learning (Jovanovic, 1982) in a standard monopolistically competitive environment with firm productivity heterogeneity. Our setup predicts that firm growth rates decrease with age, holding size constant, and decrease with size, holding age constant, a fact that models focusing on idiosyncratic productivity shocks have difficulty matching. We characterize the planner's problem and show that relative quantities between any two firms are the same in both planner's allocation and the decentralized economy. As a result, any inefficiency is driven by a discrepancy in the firm entry and exit thresholds. We calibrate the model using Colombian plant-level data and demonstrate how policies directly affecting firm entry and exit can be welfare enhancing. In particular, age-dependent subsidies allow young firms to avoid early exit and thus benefit consumers through access to a larger number of varieties. (Copyright: Elsevier)
P51|Export-led innovation: the role of export destinations|This article analyzes the effect of exporting activity on the innovative performances of firms in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK. It argues that the positive effect of exporting on innovation usually found in the literature varies according to the specific destinations of exports, and it identifies two dimensions along which export destinations might differ: the level of foreign technological spillovers available to exporting firms (the technological learning effect) and the type of foreign demand that exporting firms are able to access (the foreign demand effect). The empirical analysis, which takes advantage of firm-level information about the export destinations of exporters, shows that while the technological learning effect increases mainly the incentives to introduce brand new product innovations, the foreign demand effect fosters the adoption of process innovations.
P51|Outward FDI and Domestic Input Distortions: Evidence from Chinese Firms|This paper examines how domestic distortions a ect firmsâ€™ investment strategies abroad. The study first documents puzzling empirical findings concerning Chinese multina- tional corporations, which include that private multinational corporations are less productive than state-owned multinational corporations. A theoretical model is built to rationalize these findings and yields additional empirically consistent predictions. The key insight is that dis- crimination against private firms domestically incentivizes these firms to produce abroad, which results in less tough selection into foreign direct investment for them. A calibra- tion exercise shows the quantitative impacts of domestic distortions on gains in aggregate productivity after investment liberalization.
P51|ソ連の家計貯蓄率，1965－1989：不足効果，非公式経済効果，相乗効果，強制貯蓄|1950年代末以降における家計貯蓄の急増は，不足の深刻化の結果生じた「強制貯蓄」の問題として取り上げられ，その結果発生する「金融危機」という観点からも活発に議論されてきた．しかし，資料制約を主たる理由として，十分に説得的な実証的結論を得ていない．ソ連家計の貯蓄行動に関する議論の中心的な論点は，貯蓄の増大が公式市場の不足に伴う非自発的な貯蓄によるものであるか，非公式経済において利用可能であるか否か，という点にあった．本稿では，この問題に取り組むために，1965－1989年のソ連構成共和国のオリジナル・パネルデータを構築し，家計貯蓄率に影響を与える自発的動機と非自発的動機を区別して，その決定要因の推定を行った．分析の結果，家計の貯蓄率に対して，（1）不足要因，（2）非公式経済要因，さらに，（3）両者の相乗効果，というソ連特有の要因の影響が確認された．即ち，不足は非自発的な貯蓄を形成し，非公式経済は取引動機としての自発的な貯蓄を形成する．一方で，公式市場の未充足需要が非公式経済に移転し消化される相乗効果の作用の結果，非自発的貯蓄の一部は解消される．推定結果に基づき算定したソ連の強制貯蓄は，1980年代以降に急増し，ソ連崩壊直前には貯蓄の4割にも達した．一方で，各決定要因の影響は地域ごとに異なり，不足が強く非公式経済が小さいスラブ・バルト地域では強制貯蓄率が貯蓄の3～5割と高い一方で，非公式経済が発達した中央アジア・コーカサス地域では強制貯蓄率が1割以下という明確な地域的分化が確認された．
P51|Forced Savings in the Soviet Republics: Re-examination|"The current paper empirically examines the determinants of household savings rates in the Soviet republics, by utilizing the panel data of an aggregated household budget survey in the period from 1965 to 1989. Earlier studies claimed that increases in household savings starting from the late 1950s were the direct result of worsening shortages of consumer goods; therefore, they considered Soviet households' savings to be involuntary ones and that households were ""forced"" to save under severe shortage conditions in the official consumer market. But they failed to fully investigate this problem mainly because of unavailability of data on household incomes and expenditures and of ignorance of a widespread informal economy (""second economy""). When the informal economy could at least partly provide households with opportunities to spend their money on lacking goods, households would be able to choose whether to save money and stand in line for scarce goods at the official retail shops, or move to the informal market. This understanding leads to the implication that there existed neither involuntary nor forced savings. In order to tackle this unsolved research problem, the Soviet households' savings rate function is estimated by taking into account shortages, the informal economy, and other factors, among them life-cycle factors, and then the ""forced savings rate"" is calculated. The main findings of this study are as follows: Firstly, even taking into account these factors, there existed Soviet-unique factors, namely the shortage factor, informal factor, and demand-spillover effect. Secondly, the magnitudes of these three factors varied among regions, so forced savings rates also varied. According to our estimation results, forced savings in the Slavic and Baltic regions accounted for more than 40% of the total savings just before the collapse of the Soviet Union, while those in the Caucasian and Central Asian regions accounted for less than 10%."
P51|Varieties Of Capitalism And Government Spending In Developed And Developing Countries|Empirical papers on the size of government suffer from neglecting preferences for government activity as discussed in the literature on varieties of capitalism. Cross-country evidence for a sample of 126 developed and developing countries reveals a global divide. Among developing countries, Asian countries are closer to continental European economies, i.e., they reveal relatively higher levels of spending dependent on the quality of governance. Latin American countries rather tend towards low-spending anglo-saxon economies and spend to stabilize rather than to fight inequality. Considering these preferences, we do not find evidence that open countries spend more in order to buffer macroeconomic risks.
P51|Virginia political economy: a rational reconstruction|Recognition of a distinctive style of political economy denoted as Virginia political economy appeared early in the 1960s. It is common though not universal to identify a school of thought by the academic location of the main figures associated with the creation and propagation of a particular set of ideas. By this approach, Virginia political economy is associated with the three academic venues where James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock did most of their work. This paper takes a methodological approach to identifying Virginia political economy, which gives Virginia political economy an analytical rather than a regional identity. I do this by employing a form of rational reconstruction to articulate what I perceive to be the analytical hard core of Virginia political economy. While Buchanan and Tullock were pivotal characters in the development of Virginia political economy, that hard core is neither reducible to Buchanan and Tullock nor do they convey fully that hard core as is has arisen through scholarly interaction among many people over 50 years.

P51|G. Warren Nutter’s “Traveler’s tale of the Soviet economy”: A witness to the actual world|The text of G. Warren Nutter’s 1956 “Traveler’s tale of the Soviet economy” challenges the belief that only credentialed experts offer useful economic analysis. Nutter’s introduction is a remarkable statement of an approach in which an expert attempts to see the world through eyes unfiltered by theoretical propositions. His distrust of theory is such that his “Tale” was hurriedly written so that these presuppositions did not creep in to “correct” the naïve impressions of a tourist. Two decades after Nutter’s trip, Alain Besançon (Survey: A Journal of East and West Studies 25(4): 143–159, 1980 ) pointed out the inconsistency between the Soviet world described by witnesses and that described by orthodox Western economic models. More recently an inconsistency in the sequences of models in American economic textbooks—faster Soviet growth without catching up to American levels—has been detailed (Levy and Peart Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization 78: 110–125, 2011 ). A difference between the witnessed world and the modeled world in the sequence of textbooks is that the modeled world was not possible. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015

A könyvnek nemcsak a címe, hanem számos megfogalmazása is azt a várakozást keltheti, hogy a kapitalista rendszer átfogó elemzése kerül az olvasó kezébe. Ehhez képest a tanulmány szerzőjében hiányérzet támadt. A kapitalista rendszernek számos immanens tulajdonsága, veleszületett hajlama van. Közülük hárommal foglakozik a tanulmány. 1. A kapitalizmus egyik alapvonása a dinamizmus, az innováció, a teremtő rombolás. Nem adhat teljes képet a kapitalizmusról az, aki ezt az alapvetően fontos jelenséget ignorálja. 2. A kapitalizmus óhatatlanul nagyfokú egyenlőtlenséget hoz létre; ezt reformokkal kell enyhíteni, de teljesen nem küszöbölhető ki. 3. A kapitalizmus alapvető jellegzetességei, a magántulajdon és a piaci koordináció dominanciája nagy hatású ösztönzési mechanizmusokat hoznak létre, amelyek mind a tulajdonosokat, mind a vállalatok vezetőit innovációra és hatékony működésre serkentik. Az egyik legfontosabb ösztönző a verseny, különösen az oligopolisztikus verseny. A kapitalista rendszernek e három fontos tendenciája között szoros kölcsönhatás érvényesül.

P51|Revisiting Neoclassical Economic Growth: A Survey in the Literature|During the second half of the twentieth century economists have build newer models of economic growth that consider policy influences of growth and divergent outcomes among countries. These models address issues concerning economic growth, operation of financial markets, trade policy, government expenditures, and taxation. In this essay we have revisited the interdependence of political and economic institutions, taking the neoclassical growth model of Solow (1956) as a point of departure, which maintains that long run economic growth can be explained by capital accumulation, population growth and technological progress. We first discuss the evolution of the neoclassical school of economics in a historical context, and the role of various institutions in engendering economic growth. Subsequently the role of government spending, political stability, property rights and special interest groups (SIG’s) affect economic growth have been discussed, and how these institutions can explain different countries to grow at divergent rates and achieve different levels of wealth.
P51|How sukuk shapes firm performance|With the large expansion of Islamic finance in the recent years, sukuk, which are the Shariaâ€ compliant substitute to conventional bonds, are now becoming more prominent. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of sukuk issuance on firm performance. To do so, we analyse how stock market performance and operating performance (OP) are influenced by issuance of sukuk and bonds on a sample of Malaysian listed companies. We consider the shortâ€ term and mediumâ€ term stock market reaction through the computation of cumulative abnormal returns andÂ buyâ€ andâ€ hold abnormal returns. We investigate the impact on OP by performing regressions and by calculating abnormal operating performance (AOP) so that we can compare how issuance affects similar firms. We find that sukuk issuance generates a negative stock market reaction both in the short term and in the medium term. We also find evidence that issuing sukuk hampers OP. The analysis of AOP shows that sukuk issuers have better performance than their matched bond issuers, but that sukuk contributes to reduce the gap in performance over time. Overall, our results support the view that sukuk issuance hampers stock market performance, but that it is not attributable to a signalling effect on the bad financial situation of the issuer. We interpret our findings as evidence of adverse selection taking place on the financed projects and agency problems stemming from the specific sukuk structuring with stock market investors more reluctant to invest in sukuk issuers.
P51|Structural Change, Globalization and Economic Growth in China and India|In their period of rapid economic growth China and India have experienced profound structural transformations. The aim of the paper is to analyze the relation between structural change, the process of globalization and economic growth in the two great Asian countries, using a highly disaggregated dataset for the 1987-2009 period. While China had a longer and more intensive productivity growth than India, the latter had a somewhat more balanced growth. Both countries registered higher within-sectors gains in productivity than between-sectors ones. Our analysis also shows that there exist important feedbacks between structural change, globalization and economic growth over time. When the reallocation of labor is large, it may positively impact on the future rates of economic growth. At the same time, however, it seems that a too rapid economic growth may hinder a smooth reallocation of labor. In both countries, new policies should be designed to favor labor movement across sectors and areas, to reduce the wage-productivity differentials and to integrate the informal sector in formal markets in India, in order to foster structural changes and enhance economic growth. If a too unbalanced economic growth has somewhat limited the extent of structural change, globalization has on the contrary promoted it. High level of export, import and FDI not only has been related to higher rates of economic growth, but also to a deeper reallocation of resources across sectors, modifying the comparative advantage and reorganizing the production.
P51|Correlates and Determinants of Direct Democracy|This paper studies correlates and determinants of direct democracy institutions (DDIs), such as referendums and initiatives, based on the premise that constitutions themselves are endogenous. Our sample covers as many as 132 countries from 1950 to 2006. We find that the likelihood that a country includes DDIs in its constitution increases over time, particularly during the 1990s and 2000s. In our econometric analysis, we employ a two-tier approach, the first tier analyzing the time-invariant factors associated with the existence of DDIs, the second tier focusing on changes in time-variant factors. We discover that (i) new constitutions make the introduction of DDIs more likely; (ii) the degree of democratization is positively related to constitutions containing DDIs; (iii) an increase in the number of riots and assassinations raises the likelihood of constitutionally anchoring DDIs; (iv) if political leaders achieved power or were removed from office through irregular means, the introduction of DDIs is more likely; if they leave office due to health reasons, DDIs are less likely to be included in the constitution; and (v) religious fractionalization is negatively associated with the possibility of referendums.
P51|The Welfare And The Economic Growth: Two Faces Of The Same Coin|The research starts with review of the evolution of the concept of welfare. The model of economic growth and social welfare of the European Union continuously adapts to social and economic changes of contemporary European society. As a result of the financial and economic crisis and its impact on the EU’s economy, including economic contraction and rising unemployment, European Commission has launched the Strategy “Europe 2020”. The study will focus on the analysis of the strategy “Europe 2020” as a tool for economic growth and welfare.
P51|Institutional determinants of labour market outcomes in the EU – A Social Model Employment Efficiency and Income Distribution Index|Labour market performance as measured by employment rates conceals significant differences among EU countries. In 2014 the variation was between 48.8% in Greece and 74.4% in Sweden. Average employment rate for the EU28 was at 64.8% in 2014, perceptibly below the Lisbon goal of 70 percent. Inequality in income distribution as measured by S80/S20 income quintile share ratio ranges in 2013 from 3.4 in Czech Republic to 6.6 in Bulgaria, Romania and Greece and has risen especially in Southeast European countries during the last years. To some extent, labour market and social institutions may account for these differences. Implemented social models in Europe differ from each other by different combinations of policies and institutions showing the dimensions of social models. We use these dimensions to develop two indices which capture the employment and income distribution efficiency of social models i.e. shows how institutions impact on employment and income distribution. Both indices can be used to rank and compare the institutional quality of social models across EU countries.
P51|The Economic Cycle And The Innovation Activity Of The Polish Industry System|Industrial structures in the “catching up” type of countries usually are not too competitive in nature, and mainly they differ in the low share of high-technology products in the international trade. The aim of the conducted studies was an attempt to search for directions, as well as the power of impact of different phases of the business cycle on the innovation activity of the Polish industrial system. Consequently, this was to allow to determine the boundary conditions for the national network of innovations and its model structure, which would take into account the specificity of Poland. The methodical part of the paper was based on the theory of probability (probit modelling). Based on the analysis performed based on 5209 industrial companies (questionnaire survey) it was stated that in the prosperity phase the implementation of the innovation activity is significantly higher than in other phases of the business cycle. On the other hand, during recession and stagnation, the innovation activity is a less common phenomenon, but is not completely abandoned. Research results did not confirm the occurrence of the counter-cyclical approach to the conducted innovation activity in the national industrial system. The economic situation is thus an important factor, which influences the decision whether to undertake, activate or, in some cases, limit the innovation activity in companies. Therefore, there is a need to take into account the existing market conditions in the programming of the innovation policy within the impact on the phenomenon of the innovation processes in Poland.
P51|The Role Of The Level Of Development, Geographical Factors, And Culture For The Efficacy Of Economic Freedom|There are many studies focused on the role of economic freedom in creating conditions supportive for economic growth. Most of the recommendations in this area are based on the observations of the highly developed countries. But is it reasonable to generalize these findings to other countries, independently from their conditions? Contemporarily, the number of the research conducted for the countries outside the world's forefront is growing. Results are varied – some elements of economic freedom seem to be effective unconditionally, some of them bring different results. The aim of the paper is to examine the role of such factors as a stage of economic development, geographical location, and culture in the context of the efficacy of economic freedom. The study was conducted with usage of regression models for panel data and based on the indicators connected with economic freedom and economic growth.

P51|Market or Government – Is There a Third Way?|The paper deals with the discussion on the possible models of economy – market economy, which is usually associated with capitalism, and planned economy, which is usually associated with socialism. The experience of the 20th century has shown that efforts to choose the model of socialism have failed. Is it sufficient to make a conclusion, that capitalism is preferred to socialism not depending on conditions? Even if so, that the events of the 21st century show, that model of capitalism also has faced serious contra versions, and thus should be significantly modified. The great economists from Smith to Keynes have made forecasts about the new model of economy in the future – neither socialism, nor capitalism in a common sense. To solve the global problems, we need to think outside the box, revising critically the conventional wisdoms, thus creating a new model of economy. A possible way in that direction may be the localization of economy in a global scale.
P51|Why Has Latin America Sped Up Ahead of the Philippines in Economic and Political Reform?|This paper compares trends in key economic, political and social development outcomes in the Philippines with those of Latin America, particularly since the 1990s. To do so, it uses standard indicators of development, including measures of institutional quality and good governance. The paper finds that Latin America is not only at a higher level of development, but has also made faster progress in most areas than the Philippines. This is especially the case as regards GDP per capita, poverty, education, health, infrastructure, social protection, right to life and security of the person and corruption. The Philippines, however, performs significantly better as regards gender and race and in some “niche” areas of ICT, including high-tech exports, while posting slightly higher ratings in government effectiveness. Both regions do well in the areas of macro-economic management and financial sector development. Overall performance as regards the quality of democracy is also roughly comparable. The paper argues that key policy drivers of the divergence include Latin America’s: a) higher and better public spending; b) greater transparency and integrity in both the public and private sectors; and c) freer and more competitive markets.
P51|Worker problem-solving and the nature of the firm: new theory, new evidence|This paper proposes a different theory of the firm and demonstrates how it can be employed to yield hypotheses about differences in innovation and human resource strategy according to the shareholder/stakeholder and liberal/coordinated market dichotomies. The theory assumes that feasible production and demand sets are nonconvex due to interaction among activities; thus firms exist to permit the identification and exploitation of profit opportunities through coordinated action. This implies that firms face a nonconvex profit landscape comparable to the fitness landscapes invoked in evolutionary biology. Given the complexity of these landscapes and the uncertainty of the location of profit hills, there is a tradeoff between exploiting existing or adjacent hills and prospecting for more distant ones: the first minimizes risk, the second maximizes potential profit. A further assumption is then introduced, that shareholder firms seek to maximizes the present value of expected future profit streams, while stakeholder firms maximize the likelihood of achieving profitability over a given time horizon. Combining these theoretical priors, we characterize the likely innovation, organizational and human resource characteristics of the two types of firms and the effects exerted by their external environment, as described in the Varieties of Capitalism literature. These theoretical predictions are confirmed in a set of case studies of a stakeholder firm in liberal and coordinated environments and a shareholder firm in a coordinated environment. This is seen through differences in the role of worker problem-solving, which brings together innovation and learning, organizational structure and human resource strategy.
P51|Risk Management Practices in Islamic Bank: A Case Study of Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited|Islamic banking industry has been growing rapidly for last three decades. As risk is inherent in banking business it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management framework and process. In this paper, a humble attempt has been made to study and analyze risk management practices of Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited (IBBL), one of the leading Islamic banks in Bangaladesh. Annual reports of IBBL and 7 other full-fledged Islamic banks, Bangladesh Bank, the central bank of Bangladesh, publications and guidelines on risk management, secondary data collected from various published papers and Datastream are used to analyze and support the findings of the study. It is found that the bank has developed an extensive risk management framework and process. The bank is found to be moderate to low risk taker in terms of investment exposures. The bank has been generating sustainable earnings from its depositors fund but lower return on shareholder’s fund due to lack of shari’ah compliant financial instruments in Bangladesh. Even though the bank mobilizes funds on profit and loss sharing principle, but study indicates that all risks are actually borne by the bank e.g., financing impairment is charged to shareholders only like conventional banks. Physical assets constitute a significant portion of the bank’s balance sheet and evidently these assets are funded by shareholders fund. Currently, the bank does not use any derivative instruments as they are not available in the financial market of Bangladesh. Income gap analysis of the bank shows that its rate sensitive assets are higher than rate sensitive liabilities which seem unfavorable in decreasing interest rate environment, consequently, bank’s profitability declined over the year. In spite of that, the spread between funding cost and financing income is above 5%. It can be argued that the inclination towards murabaha financing is evident from the analysis and 72% of the exposure of the Bank lies under the Risk weight category of 50% or below, which is considered to be one of the significant strengths of IBBL. Moreover, displaced commercial risk and excess liquidity risk tend to affect significantly the bank’s efficiency and profitability.
P51|A Critical Overview of Islamic Economics from a Welfare-State Perspective|This paper builds upon the following critique of Islamic economics: (a) Persistence on the literal interpretation of what the theology of Islamic law implies socioeconomically, (b) Rejection subsequently of the core western economic principle of homo economicus-cum-competition, though homo economicus behavior is innermost to absence of riba al-fadl (of exploitation in the goods markets) in the large atleast impersonal markets of our times, (c) Rejection, because of the ahistorical view of the West and hence, of inability to realize that the Cold War European welfare state with a constitution inspired by social solidarity as it derives not politically but religiously from Islamic law, might be worth followed by Islam, and (d) Identification of riba an-nasiya (of exploitation in the financial markets) with zero interest rate charges and not with zero commercial bank seigniorage.
P51|Theory of Gharar and its interpretation of Risk and Uncertainty from the perspectives of Authentic Hadith and the Holy Quran: A Qualitative Analysis|The inconclusive definition of Gharar as risk and uncertainty can be commonly found in the contemporary literatures. The difference in the meaning of Gharar is generally thought to be due to the difference in the jurisprudence point of views. The current practice is that there is no standard in defining the terms. Hence, this study introduces steps in defining terminology namely; dictionary definition, Arabic linguistic definition and jurisprudence definition. However, the philosophy of risk as stated in the Holy Quran and Hadith differs from the concept of risk in conventional finance. The finding reveals that risk in Islamic banking refers to a wider interpretation covering the concepts gharar. mysir, mukhatarah, al ghunm bil ghurm and al kharajbil daman than the element of uncertainty as in the conventional finance.
P51|Competitiveness of the Czech Republic - Sustainability and the Social Aspect of Competitiveness|The objective of the study is to analyse the Czech position in the fi eld of global competitiveness. In the past, the only data used for evaluating the position of a country were “hard data”: data that were measurable. Nowadays, many research institutions as well as scientists have come with a new idea. Not only hard data are important for a country’s position in the competitiveness rank, but also soft data have to be taken into account. The General Competitiveness Index (GCI), used for measuring competitiveness, has been replaced with the Sustainability- adjusted Competitiveness Index (SCI). Two sustainability pillars are added to the general competitiveness: the social sustainability pillar and the environmental sustainability pillar. This study analyses the GCI and the SCI in the context of sustainability. The main objective is to fi nd out how these two sustainability pillars infl uence the competitiveness position of the Czech Republic. The method used in the study is an analysis and comparison of the hard and soft data, which means that it is based on a multidimensional analysis used by the WEF and the IMD. The study confi rms that there is an increasing infl uence of these soft - qualitative - data.
P51|The Genesis of Islamic Economics Revisited By Abdul Azim Islahi|"The present paper is an attempt to correct Timur Kuran on various issues related to the genesis of Islamic economics. It demonstrates that ""Islamic economics"" is not a product of twentieth century. The term may be new but its origins go back to early period of Islam. Its evolution up to the present state of a distinguished discipline can be divided into six distinct phases. The paper argues that the modern Islamic economics was never a sectarian subject. Nor was it developed for Muslims' identity and protection purpose. Scholars of different regions and of diverse affiliations promoted it and its propounders aimed at the well-being of all."
P51|Export-Led Innovation Among European Firms. Demand and Technological Learning Effects|This paper investigates the effect of exporting activities on the innovation strategies of European firms in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK. The paper puts forward the hypothesis that such a positive effect is driven two main mechanisms. The first is a technological learning effect that allows firms active in international markets to benefit from foreign knowledge spillovers in technologically advanced markets and decrease their research cost for the development of innovations. The second is a demand effect induced by fast-growing foreign markets that increase the potential output of firms. The empirical analysis, which addresses important endogeneity issues related with the strategic choice of the markets of destination operated by firms, shows that the two effects induce the adoption of different innovation strategies. While the technological learning effect positively affect the decision of firms to introduce brand new product innovations, the demand effect fosters the adoption of efficiency and imitation strategies. The paper shows that the effect of exporting activity on innovation strategies crucially depends on the type of export destinations. The lower levels of the technological learning effect which is found among the export destinations of Italian and Spanish firms might represent a possible obstacle for the ability of these countries to increase their future innovative capacities.
P51|Trust and E-Commerce in the Ukraine and Poland in the Eyes of Young Urban Professionals|The article seeks an explanation of the fact that an average Ukrainian's e-commerce expenses is almost three times as high as a Pole’s, measured as a percentage of their wallet. Based on statistical data from both these countries andsector reports, it is showed that technical, legal and organizational conditions fore-commerce are slightly worse in the Ukraine then they are in Poland and other EU countries. An e-questionnaire given to early adaptors of new technological trends – two groups of ca. 100 of young professionals from big cities in Poland and Ukraine, showed that the level of trust toward people met over the Internet is radically higher in the Ukraine than in Poland. The trust factor was taken to be one of the possible explanations for this phenomenon.
P51|L’essor du secteur de la santé annonce-t-il un modèle de développement anthropogénétique ?|Pourquoi en longue période les dépenses de santé croissent-elles plus vite que le PIB ? Il importe d’abandonner une approche statique en termes d’équilibre au profit d’une problématique évolutionniste et institutionnaliste qui prend en compte le caractère socialement construit et historiquement déterminé de la maladie, des connaissances et des techniques médicales qui évoluent avec les modalités de financement et l’organisation des soins. Une mise en perspective historique suggère que la santé, alliée avec l’éducation, est en train de dessiner un mode de développement original, qualifié d’anthropogénétique. À l’échelle du xxie siècle, il pourrait s’imposer tant dans les sociétés de vieille industrialisation que dans celles qui accèderont au développement.

P51|The Nordic Model: Existence, Emergence and Sustainability|In a world where inequality is on the rise alongside an increase in income, it becomes of paramount interest for anyone to find a nation or a group of nations which manage to have well-performing economic and social indicators. This curiosity about finding a ?third? model led us to the Nordic Model.Our qualitative paper titled ?Establishing the existence of Nordic model and its sustainability? is aimed at documenting the present condition of the Model in the five countries that come under the purview of the Model: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. We begin with establishing the existence of the Model using certain social and economic indicators. We look at the various reasons, both historical and those unique to these countries, behind the emergence and success of the model. We discuss the major problems that these countries as a whole are facing with regard to continuing the existing system or improving it. We look at possible ways in which the countries could sustain the model.
P51|Politico-Economic Regimes and Attitudes: Female Workers Under State-Socialism|This paper investigates the extent to which attitudes are aï¬€ected by political regimes and government policies, and the channels of inï¬‚uence. We focus on gender-role attitudes and female attitudes toward work, exploiting the imposition of state-socialist regimes across Central and Eastern Europe, and the fact that the new regimes encouraged womenâ€™s employment, for both ideological and instrumental reasons. We use two diï¬€erent identiï¬ cation strategies and datasets. First, we take advantage of the German partition into East and West after 1945 and restricted-access information on place of residence to execute a spatial regression discontinuity design. We ï¬ nd more positive attitudes toward work in the sample of women who used to live in East Germany. In terms of channels, we ï¬ nd evidence that the experience of employment, arguably one of the very few positive aspects of living under state-socialism in East Germany, changed womenâ€™s attitudes. We do not ï¬ nd similar evidence for the role of propaganda. Second, we employ a diï¬€erence-in-diï¬€erences strategy that compares attitudes formed in Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) and Western European Countries (WECs), before and after the imposition of state socialism in CEECs. Gender-role attitudes formed in CEECs during the state socialist period appear to be signiï¬ cantly less traditional than those formed in WECs. Overall, our study addresses previous identiï¬ cation and data limitations and ï¬ nds that attitudes are profoundly aï¬€ected by politico-economic regimes.
P51|Is Independence Good Or Bad For Development In Small Island Economies? A Long-Run Analysis|It is well established that sovereign independent small islands have lower incomes than politically affiliated islands. Many studies have argued that this is a causal relationship, with independence acting as a drag on development performance. Cross-section data from the past four decades has been viewed as evidence for this hypothesis, but longer-run time series data do not support it. This paper uses time series for GDP, infant mortality, life expectancy and international trade to check whether the emergence of the two modern convergence clubs (sovereign and affiliated) occurred before or after decolonisation. It appears that the two groups of island economies began to diverge about 1920, with separation largely complete by the time political status was assigned during decolonisation in the period 1950-1970. The causes of this early divergence remain unidentified.
P51|An Attempt To Quantify The Economic And Financial Losses In Ecosystems|"Currently, the disturbances (mainly negatives), occurring in socio-economic systems, have fewer short-term solutions, and the medium-term and long term disregard greater sustainable development at the levels micro, meso and macro. Economic and financial losses registered in such eco-systems, affected by disturbances in the stability and integrity of them, are leading, in most cases, to major climate changes, especially at regional level and local zones, with unexpected and diverse implications, sometimes irreversible over the enviromental environment. Quantifiable value such losses, both quantitative and qualitative, in a specific case (losses in Norway spruce, Picea abies, forests affected by biotic and abiotic factors of Bârgău Mountains) may provide new ways of approach. This is the view in which we are interested in: the economic and financial losses may be quanitifiable in the effects of the disturbances cause, in a manner of the ""rolling snowball"", with larger damages (losses) in the adjacent zones, or in the downstream from Bârgau Mountains (situation that can be generalized)."
P51|Social market economy: Towards a comprehensive composite index|Institutions that potentially have a positive impact on economic performance rarely exist outside of a system of institutions; rather they are embedded in the economic order of a country. It is thus imperative to investigate bundles of performance-enhancing institutions, particularly those bundles that form the basis for economic orders. This paper is based on bundles of institutions that have empirically proven to be prosperity enhancing. It proposes a measurement of this bundle of institutions in the form of a composite index, which is based on 12 different data series. Index data is available for 163 countries between 2005 and 2010 and it allows for comparative analyses using the overall index as well as its three sub-indices, measuring political, economic and societal institutional quality. The index is a step towards a more systematic international comparison of institutional settings. In future research, it can contribute to identifying prosperity enhancing bundles of institutions through regression analysis.
P51|From independence to the Euro introduction: varieties of capitalism in the Baltic States|The Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, are very successful in transformation. From 1991 to 2015 they regained independence and transformed their economies from socialist central planning into functioning mar-ket economies, joined the EU in 2004 and became member of the Euro zone. Estonia introduced the Euro al-ready in 2011 while Latvia followed in 2014 and Lithuania in 2015. Thereof follow two questions. First, why all three Baltic countries are so successful? And secondly, do we really find everywhere the pattern of the “Shining star” Estonia, followed by Latvia and at least Lithuania? According to modern Varieties of Capitalism theory all three economies can be classified as Central and Eastern European Countries in the style of Liberal Market Economies (CEEC-LME). As can be shown, there are also differences in the institutional setups of all three Baltic States. During the period of transformation a pattern of Estonia followed by Latvia and at least Lithuania evolved which is also reflected by the sequence of joining Euro area. But institutional patterns are not determined in the long run. Since the crisis of 2008/09 the pattern within the Baltics changed. While Estonia remains on the first rank Lithuania overtook Latvia in terms of growth and wealth. Deregulation in Lithuania – which may be observed by the development of the Economic Freedom Index of the Heritage Foundation within the last ten years – may be the main reason. But also, the low sophistication of the Lithuanian banking system as well as Latvia’s massive suffering from the crisis may explain the last change of the pattern in the Baltics. There are several possibilities to illustrate the different paths of development of the Baltic States. While Geography Hypothesis is not able to explain the differences, the extractive political institutions in Estonia and Latvia can illustrate the lead of both countries in contrast to Lithuania till the crisis in 2008/09. Additionally, different basic values in all three Baltic States are responsible for the different developmental paths. They can also be traced back to the different history and culture of the three Baltic countries.
P51|Economic Growth Elasticity of Structural Changes: Case of Thailand|Thailand's economic base was gradually shifted from agricultural-based to industrial and service country for the last 30 years. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of those structural changes on economic performance using Cochrane - Orcutt and Newey-West Model. For the result, an incremental employment in agricultural sector yielded the negative effect on economy. Also, an increase in employment in service sector was better than industrial sector in supporting economic growth. Thus, government of Thailand should no longer support agricultural sector but service-based economy instead.
P51|Measuring and decomposing the overall efficiency of multi-period and -division systems associated with DEA|The combination way of component efficiencies into the overall efficiency is a central topic in the efficiency modeling of network systems based on data envelopment analysis (DEA). In terms of the feature and advantage of DEA modeling as the multiplier generation on inputs/outputs, it is desirable that the combination weights are derived from the data and self-generated in calculation process. The prior weights choice makes DEA modeling lose the objectivity and generalization in efficiency measures. This study proposes a new formulating approach of dynamic network DEA (DN-DEA) models to measure and decompose the overall efficiency of multi-period and -division systems without the pre-specified weights to combine component efficiencies into the overall efficiency. In our formulating approach, the double identities of carry-overs connecting consecutive periods and linkers connecting consecutive divisions are fully accounted for. This approach is applicable for the formulations of both radial measures (DN-CCR and DN-BCC) and non-radial measures (DN-SBM). This study extends Kao’s (in press) relational approach of dynamic DEA to dynamic network systems for empirical comparison. In contrast to Kao’s (in press) approach, our approach can present a weighted average decomposition of the overall (in)efficiency score into components ones by a set of endogenous weight sets which are the most favorable for the tested multi-period and -division system. This makes sense of the comparison between overall and component (in)efficiency scores. In this context, the overall efficiency score is less or more than all component ones. We applied our models to evaluate the innovation efficiency of OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries.
P51|Is There a Sustainable Learning Economy Regime?|In this paper we deal with the concept of the learning economy and its suitability to describe the modern globalizing economy. We contend that in contrast to the many fleeting catchwords and phrases found in economics and public policy, the notion of the learning economy represents a superior conceptual starting point, which reflects a new and emerging economic regime. Even though it is still circumscribed to a small minority of developed countries, the learning economy offers a concrete example for the more numerous ‘have nots’ of the world to emulate.
P51|Do Islamic banks shift from mark-up to equity financing when their contracting environments are improved?| Islamic banks should share their profits and losses with their customers through equity financing but most of their assets are mark-up financing, which resembles loans. Theoretically, one of the reasons is Islamic banks operate in poor contracting environments where equity financing is very risky. Using fixed-effects models, we examine whether better contracting environments induce Islamic banks to shift from mark-up to equity financing. We find no evidence that contracting environments do, which means debt-like instruments will continue dominating Islamic banks’ assets in the near future.
P51|Role of the State in Economy and State Capitalism. The Case of Singapore|The article deals with problems of state capitalism. It can be defined as maximisation of political control over economy and society and it is used as the characteristics of systems which exist in China, Russia, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, etc. State capitalism used to be effective in early periods of development when resources had to be concentrated. Corporations under state ownership are also able to compete on global markets and take advantage of their size and political support. Singapore represents an original connection of economic freedom and authoritarian capitalism. It is based on a free-market foreign-oriented economy which stresses financial market development, infrastructure, education, macroeconomic surroundings and fiscal management. The state as an owner and creator of the institutional framework plays an important role.
P51|Regional competitiveness, economic growth and stages of development|This paper positions the concept of regional competitiveness within theories concerning regional economic growth and stages of economic development. It examines the sources of regional competitiveness encompassing an analysis based on the particular stage of economic development that the nations within which regions are situated have reached. As a means to achieve this, the paper undertakes an empirical analysis of data stemming from the World Competitiveness Index of Regions, and identifies regional competitiveness as a dual concept that explains relative differences in rates of economic development across regions, as well as an understanding of the future economic growth trajectories of regions at a similar stage of economic development. As with endogenous growth and development theory, the notion of regional competitiveness presented here places knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurship at the forefront of conceptualisations of regional economic differentiation.
P51|Economic and Political Transitions from Premodern to Modern States in the Meiji Restoration and Xinhai Revolution: A Strategic Approach|Economists often identify a reduction in the share of agricultural employment as a quantitative indication of the economic growth of nations. But this process did not occur in earnest in the People’s Republic of China until the 1980s and to some extent in Japan until well into the mid-20th century. Were extractive political regimes, commonly regarded as the primary drivers of economic performance, solely responsible for the lateness of these developments? This paper deals with this question from a strategic perspective by examining the interactions between the polity and the economy in both countries. It begins by characterizing the complementary nature of the peasant-based economy and the agrarian-tax state in premodern China and Japan. It then describes how endogenous strategic forces evolved from among the intermediate organizations in each country to challenge the incumbent dynastic ruler in response to the commercialization of the peasant-based economy on one hand and the fiscal and military weakening of the agrarian-tax state on the other. The paper then introduces a three-person game model between a ruler and two challenging organizations, and derives conditions for multiple equilbria and their comparative static. The analytical results help to identify the endogenous strategic forces that led the Meiji Restoration and the Xinhai Revolution to move from a premodern state of play to nation-state building and modern economic regimes in each country.
P51|Welfare models, inequality and economic performance during globalisation|The objective of this paper is to explore whether “the efficiency thesis” concerning the relation between welfare states and globalisation is functional for economic growth or, alternatively, whether “the compensation thesis” produces better results in terms of economic growth. The current crisis (2007-12) was a test for many advanced economies to determine whether the socio-economic model that those countries built in the last several decades was able to cope with the challenges of globalisation. My hypothesis is that the efficiency thesis, according to which globalisation needs to be accompanied by the retrenchment of welfare states in order for firms to be competitive, does not causegrowth. The tests are conducted in a sample of 42 countries made up of OECD and EU members. On the contrary, our econometric exercises indicate that the “compensation thesis” (i.e.,regulated globalisation and an expanded welfare state) is better able to produce higher economic growth.
P51|The Critisism Of Dominant Neo-Classical Economics In The Light Of Post Aut?St?C Econom?Cs: Case Of Global Cr?S?S|Dominant neo classical system is criticized for not solving the problems of current economics. In other words, it is seen the reason of current economic issues. And also it is believed that unsolved problems come with global crisis were developed by dominant classical thought. In 2000?s Post Autistic economic movement came to the scene with published declaration by pupils of Ecole Normale Superieure in France. According to declaration dominant economic thought turn into the autistic characteristic. Due to this fact, economic science is vanished by intense mathematical formulas. So that had broken of connection with real life. In this paper first, basic hypothesis of neo classical thought will be examined. Following that, solving suggestion for problematic area in the light of autistic movement will be explained. In the other words, especially in the course of time, the current economic system remains incapable to meet society?s expectations, demands, and requirements, the system and method debate has been increasing. Recently, the basic reason that led to criticism by focusing the global economic crisis has developed in the direction of the Neo-classical system. Another purpose of this study is to open discussion of last 2008 global crisis to Turkey?s assessment from the view point of Post Autistic Economics.
P51|Financial Structure, Income Inequality and Privatization of Risk in the EU|The global financial crisis of 2007/2008 was the painful peak of a decade of “financial euphoria” and inadequate financial re-regulation in the advanced economies. However, during that period of “financial euphoria”, the structure of the developed financial systems in the EU varied significantly, considering the importance of the banking market or that of the capital market in the system as a whole. Thus, an area for political economy research emerges, considering the institutions and the structural elements of an economy that could have contributed to this kind of differentiation. In this paper, the analysis is focused on the financial system’s funding from individuals and households as one of the three basic fields of the financial intermediation process. Particularly, we discuss and examine the relationshipbetween “privatization of risk” and income inequality -as characteristics of the households’ investment orientation- with the development of structurally varied financial systems in the EU. The descriptive and statistical results suggest that households’ investment orientation is related with the differentiation in the characteristics of the EU financial systems. However, this nexus can partially interpret -in terms of political economy- the varied financial systems in the EU, as the analysis must take into account the remaining fields of the financial intermediation process: the funding from international and interbank markets and the financial system’s funding to the economy.
