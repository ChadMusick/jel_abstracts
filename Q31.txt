Q31|Measuring global real economic activity: Do recent critiques hold up to scrutiny?|Hamilton (2018) suggests that the Kilian (2009) index of global real economic activity is misleading and calls for alternative measures. The problems documented by Hamilton are a consequence of a coding mistake in the computation of the original index. Specifically, the nominal freight rates underlying the Kilian index were accidentally logged twice. Once this coding error is corrected by removing one of the log transformations, none of the concerns raised by Hamilton remains valid and the index may be used as originally intended. Moreover, it can be shown that the corrected index differs only slightly from the original index and that the key empirical results in Kilian (2009) and related studies remain unchanged when replacing the index.
Q31|For want of a chair: teaching price formation using a cap and trade game|The tradable or transferable permit system, “cap and trade”, is one of the most innovative policy options developed by environmental economists. Over the last 40 years, cap and trade programs have been used around the globe by some of the world’s biggest economies. By placing a cap on a bad, whether a pollutant or excess fish mortality, and then allowing firms to buy and sell the right to generate it, policy makers combine government intervention with market-based incentives in order to improve welfare and internalize the externality. Such programs represent a great opportunity for economics instructors to show students how economic theory can be used in the real world by policy makers while teaching foundational economic concepts. By using an in-class game that utilizes a mobile app or paper-based interaction to create a market for a pollutant (or another rival but non-excludable resource), students can learn several important tenants of economics. These include how prices are formed and how price-based incentives lead to voluntary, as if cooperative, behavior by agents. This active learning method engages students while improving their comprehension of price formation, gains from trade, voluntary response to incentives, and an important environmental economics policy.
Q31|Total, asymmetric and frequency connectedness between oil and forex markets|We analyze total, asymmetric and frequency connectedness between oil and forex markets using high-frequency, intra-day data over the period 2007 -- 2017. By employing variance decompositions and their spectral representation in combination with realized semivariances to account for asymmetric and frequency connectedness, we obtain interesting results. We show that divergence in monetary policy regimes affects forex volatility spillovers but that adding oil to a forex portfolio decreases the total connectedness of the mixed portfolio. Asymmetries in connectedness are relatively small. While negative shocks dominate forex volatility connectedness, positive shocks prevail when oil and forex markets are assessed jointly. Frequency connectedness is largely driven by uncertainty shocks and to a lesser extent by liquidity shocks, which impact long-term connectedness the most and lead to its dramatic increase during periods of distress.
Q31|Supply Flexibility in the Shale Patch: Evidence from North Dakota|We analyse if output flexibility in oil production depends on the extraction technology.In particular, we ask to what extent shale oil producers respond to price incentives by changing completion of new wells as well as oil production from completed wells. Using a novel well-level monthly production data set covering more than 15,000 crude oil wells in North Dakota, we find large differences in response between conventional and unconventional (shale) extraction technology: While shale oil wells respond significantly to spot future spreads by changing both well completion and crude oil production, conventional wells do not. Our results indicate that firms using shale oil technology are more flexible in allocating output intertemporally. We interpret such output pattern of shale oil wells to be consistent with the Hotelling theory of optimal extraction.
Q31|Limit pricing, climate policies, and imperfect substitution|The effects of climate policies are often studied under perfect competition and constant marginal extraction costs. In this paper, we allow for monopolistic fossil fuel supply and more general cost functions, which, in the presence of perfectly substitutable renewables, gives rise to limit-pricing behavior. Four phases of supply may exist in equilibrium: sole supply of fossil fuels below the limit price, sole supply of fossil fuels at the limit price, simultaneous supply of fossil fuels and renewables at the limit price, and sole supply of renewables at the limit price. The consequences of climate policies for initial extraction depend on the initial phase: in case of sole supply of fossil fuels at the limit price, a renewables subsidy increases initial extraction, whereas a carbon tax leaves initial extraction unaffected. With simultaneous supply at the limit price or with sole supply of fossil fuels below the limit price, a renewables subsidy and a carbon tax lower initial extraction. Both policy instruments decrease cumulative extraction. If fossil fuels and renewables are imperfect but good substitutes, the monopolist will exhibit ‘limit-pricing resembling’ behavior, by keeping the effective price of fossil close to that of renewables for considerable time.
Q31|The Shift in Global Crude Oil Market Structure: A model-based analysis of the period 2013–2017|The global crude oil market has gone through two important phases over the recent years. The ﬁrst one was the price collapse that started in the third quarter of 2014 and continued until mid-2016. The second phase occurred in late 2016, after major producers within and outside OPEC agreed to cut production in order to adjust the ongoing fall in oil prices, which is now known as the OPEC+ agreement. This paper analyzes the eﬀects of these recent developments on the market structure and on the behavior of major producers in the market. To this end, we develop a partial equilibrium model with a spatial structure for the global crude oil market and simulate the market for the period between 2013 and 2017 under oligopolistic, cartel and perfectly competitive market structure setups. The simulation results reveal that, although the oligopolistic market structures ﬁt overall well to the realized market outcomes, they are not successful at explaining the low prices during 2015 and 2016, which instead are closer to estimated competitive levels. Moreover, we further suggest that from 2014 onward, the market power potential of major suppliers has shrunk considerably, supporting the view that the market has become more competitive. We also analyze the Saudi Arabia- and Russia-led OPEC+ agreement, and ﬁnd that planned production cuts in 2017, particularly of Saudi Arabia (486 thousand barrels/day) and Russia (300 thousand barrels/day), were below the levels of estimated non-competitive market structure setups. This explains why the oil prices did not recover to pre-2014 levels although a temporary adjustment was observed in 2017.
Q31|Bosques en Bolivia: Una estimación espacial de los costos de la Deforestación|La deforestación en Bolivia se ha incrementado de manera considerable en los últimos años, la misma conlleva a emisiones de dióxido de carbono, pérdida de biodiversidad, variación del ciclo hidrológico, entre otras. El presente estudio tiene el objetivo de estimar el impacto de la deforestación y la de sus costos en términos monetarios. Debido a la complejidad de cada variable, se emplea distintas metodologías para cada una de ellas (emisión de dióxido de carbono, pérdida de biodiversidad y variación del ciclo hidrológico).La misma que consiste en una contabilidad de carbono y el uso del precio de carbono, además de un modelo BIOM de extrapolación de especies y el uso de elasticidad de consumo y riqueza absoluta de las especies para la cuantificación de los costos. Finalmente se hace uso de econometría espacial y el índice de escasez de agua para la variación del ciclo hidrológico. El análisis de los resultados es realizado en tres categorías: a nivel municipal, a nivel departamental y a nivel nacional para dos periodos de tiempo 1990-2000 y 2000-2010. Adicionalmente, en base a los resultados se formula conclusiones y recomendaciones sobre el costo de la deforestación en Bolivia. Los cuales determinan que el costo de la deforestación en Bolivia representa una cifra mayor al 10% del PIB de Bolivia.
Q31|Developing an electricity satellite account (EISA): an application to Scotland, UK|Within the system of national accounts the electricity sector is typically reported as a single entry representing generation, transmission, distribution and trade. The way in which these components interact with the economy differs greatly, a feature lost within the standard accounting framework. In this paper we propose an Electricity Satellite Account (ElSA) approach to better understand the linkages between the economy and the electricity sector, with a particularly focus on generation technologies. To develop this framework, we draw parallels to Tourism Satellite Accounts (TSAs). To illustrate the practical steps in constructing ElSAs, we develop an ElSA for Scotland for 2012. We show how the ELSA framework gives an improved understanding of the electricity sector, which is critical in improving the usefulness of such accounts future climate and energy, as well as economic, policy.
Q31|Factors affecting farmers’ WTP for innovative fertilizer against soil salinity|Salt stress noxiously shocks agricultural yield all over the world affecting production either it is for subsistence or economic outcomes. However, the market for anti-salinity products is still developing and little is known about the willingness to pay for agricultural supplies, these have been largely focused on using stated preference methods only. This paper applied both Contingent and Inferred Valuation Method for the purpose of examining the determinants of farmers’ willingness to pay for two packages of an innovative anti-salinity fertilizer, which does not yet exist in the market, in the regions of southwest Greece. With the aid of questionnaire, primary data were obtained from 150 farmers. Willingness to pay for the two packages of liquid fertilizer was measured through dichotomous choice. For the econometric analysis, interval regression model was used. The results revealed that farmers’ willingness to pay for the specific anti-salinity product is influenced by a host of factors. Especially, the regression showed that the size of cultivated land, the level of education, the knowledge scale about salinity, the package of liquid fertilizer that farmers usually buy and the consequentiality script have a positive effect on willingness to pay, whilst hypothetical bias and inferred valuation method have a negative effect. Also, we examined a methodological issue concerning the order that the package of fertilizer was appeared in the willingness to pay question which has a positive effect on willingness to pay. The implication is that taking these factors into account while large companies are looking for new and profitable products by investing for research and development enables companies’ managers to come up with projects that win acceptance from the farmers.
Q31|Do heterogeneous countries respond differently to oil price shocks?|The article studies the macroeconomic impact of oil price changes in 17 highly heterogeneous countries classified in six groups: advanced, emerging, oil producer, non-oil producers, with energy price controls and without energy price controls. The results show that despite analyzed countries differ in several dimensions, most differences regarding oil price shocks impacts can be captured comparing two groups: advanced vs. emerging. Moreover, most of the differences in the way countries react to oil price shocks come from the source of the shock rather than by the group which the countries belong to. Remarkably, there are no significant differences in the response of industrial production between oil and non-oil producer countries. We posit, as potential explanations of the later finding the decline in the energy intensity of the global economy and the degree of trade openness.
Q31|Asymmetric Effects of Terms of Trade Shocks on Tradable and Non-tradable Investment Rates: The Colombian Case|Terms of trade (ToT) shocks drive business cycles and have direct impact on the macroeconomic equilibrium conditions in commodity-exporter countries. ToT shocks also affect the dynamics of other variables such as national income and relative prices, and consequently, cause agents and firms to adjust their saving, spending and investment decisions accordingly. The latter is of special interest because of its link with potential GDP and the capital stock of the economy, relevant concepts when assessing sustainable and long-run growth. In this document we explore how tradable and nontradable investment rates respond asymmetrically to ToT shocks. We estimate a Threshold VAR (TVAR) in which the ToT are the transition variable. The empirical results suggest the existence of two regimes (low and high ToT levels) and that ToT shocks have different effects on tradable and nontradable investment rates depending not only the direction of the shock, but also on the levels from which the shock departs. **** Los choques de Términos de Intercambio (TdI) determinan en parte los ciclos económicos y tienen impacto directo en el equilibrio macroeconómico en los países exportadores de materias primas. Estos choques también afectan las dinámicas de variables como el ingreso nacional y los precios relativos, haciendo que los agentes y las firmas ajusten sus decisiones de ahorro, gasto e inversión. La inversión es de especial interés debido a su vínculo con el PIB potencial y el stock de capital de la economía, conceptos que resultan relevantes al evaluar el crecimiento sostenible y de largo plazo. En este documento se estudian cómo las inversiones transable y no transable reaccionan de forma asimétrica a choques de TdI. Estimamos un modelo VAR por umbrales (TVAR) en el cual la variable de transición son los TdI. Los resultados sugieren la existencia de dos regímenes (de altos y bajos TdI) y que los choques de TdI producen respuestas asimétricas en la inversión transable y no transable, dependiendo no sólo de la dirección del choque, sino del nivel de TdI desde el cual se parte cuando éste sucede.
Q31|Simple Rules for Climate Policy and Integrated Assessment|Abstract A simple integrated assessment framework that gives rules for the optimal carbon price, transition to the carbon-free era and stranded carbon assets is presented, which highlights the ethical, economic, geophysical and political drivers of optimal climate policy. For the ethics we discuss the role of intergenerational inequality aversion and the discount rate, where we show the importance of lower discount rates for appraisal of longer run benefit and of policy makers using lower discount rates than private agents. The economics depends on the costs and rates of technical progress in production of fossil fuel, its substitute renewable energies and sequestration. The geophysics depends on the permanent and transient components of atmospheric carbon and the relatively fast temperature response, and we allow for positive feedbacks. The politics stems from international free-rider problems in absence of a global climate deal. We show how results change if different assumptions are made about each of the drivers of climate policy. Our main objective is to offer an easy back-on-the-envelope analysis, which can be used for teaching and communication with policy makers.
Q31|Shale oil revolution: Implications for oil dependent countries|The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently announces that the explosive increases in the United States oil output, particularly from shale oil, would make the country become worldâ€™s top oil producer and eventually exporter ahead of Saudi Arabia and Asia in the coming years. Motivated by this projection, we therefore examine the implications of the US shale oil on oil exports of OPEC and selected non-OPEC countries using the Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) approach. Our results reveal that the US oil supply shocks particularly those due to shale oil are critical in the output and supply decisions of OPEC and major non-OPEC oil exporters. Underestimating the potential consequences of US overtaken the current world oil giants and failure to put in place critical structural shifts by these countries, especially alternative revenue sources, pose a potential threat to their growth prospects.
Q31|La confrontation des systèmes institutionnels nationaux dans l'interdépendance : les échanges gaziers UE-Russie|Les interdépendances fortes entre l’UE et ses fournisseurs extérieurs en matière de gaz naturel mettent au premier plan les problématiques de conflits et de logiques contradictoires liées à la coexistence d’arrangements institutionnels différents dans l’échange. Cet enjeu émerge clairement sur la relation entre l’UE et la Russie. Dans le même temps, la confrontation de ces deux espaces institutionnels semble avoir un « impact transformatif » sur les régulations, les systèmes institutionnels et les politiques énergétiques de la Russie et de l’UE. Elle ouvre en particulier de nouvelles structures d’opportunités pour les acteurs impliqués. L’objet de cet article est d’analyser les conflits et risques économiques et institutionnels qui résultent de la confrontation de ces deux espaces de régulation. Il est ensuite de mettre en évidence les changements induits par l’interdépendance tant du côté de la Russie que du côté de l’UE.
Q31|Contracts for the Management of a Non-Renewable Resource under Asymmetric Information and Structural Price Breaks|We characterize the optimal contract for resource extraction in a context where the concessionaire has private information on the initial stock of resource. The dynamics of extraction is characterized by a virtual Hotelling rule in which costs of extraction are replaced with virtual costs of extraction. We analyze how structural breaks in the price of resource impact the dynamics of extraction. JEL Codes: Q31, D82. Keywords: Non-Renewable Resource Management, Delegated Management, Optimal Contract, Asymmetric Information.
Q31|Is Shale Gas a Good Bridge to Renewables? An Application to Europe|Abstract This paper explores whether climate policy justifies developing more shale gas and addresses the question of a potential arbitrage between shale gas development and the transition to clean energy. We construct a Hotelling-like model where electricity may be produced by three perfectly substitutable sources: an abundant dirty resource (coal), a non-renewable less polluting resource (shale gas), and an abundant clean resource (solar). The resources differ by their carbon contents and their unit costs. Shale gas extraction’s technology (fracking) generates local damages. Fixed costs must be paid to develop shale gas and to deploy the clean resource on a large scale. Climate policy takes the form of a carbon budget. We show that, at the optimum, a more stringent climate policy does not always go together with an increase of the quantity of shale gas extracted, and that banning shale gas extraction most often leads to bring forward the development of the clean resource, but not always. We calibrate the model for Europe in order to determine whether shale gas should be extracted and in which amount, and to evaluate the effects of a moratorium on shale gas use.
Q31|The Distribution of Material Footprints in Germany|This study investigates the within-country heterogeneity of material footprints implied by households' consumption in Germany. Material footprints are defined as the amount of biomass, minerals, and fossil fuels extracted to produce the goods that households consume. Combining input-output data with households' consumption expenditures from the German sample survey of income and expenditure (EVS), we present the first comprehensive study on the distribution of material footprints among households, highlighting hot spots of unsustainable consumption patterns by household groups. Households in the quartile with the highest consumption expenditures have material footprints three times as large as those in the quartile with the lowest expenditures. We use a microeconomic model to study households' consumption behavior using EVS data. The results suggest that price-based instruments can reduce material footprints of luxury consumption such as leisure and private transport without imposing large burdens on less affluent households. The material footprints caused by energy consumption do not react sensitively to price changes, which suggests that non-price policies are more effective to reduce them.
Q31|The Green Paradox and learning by doing|Production of a renewable substitute to fossil fuels is modeled as causing the cost of this backstop technology to fall over time in proportion to the scale of the substitute production and how long it has been in use. The unit cost of resource extraction is assumed to rise as the stock is depleted, so learning by doing will increase the reserves permanently left in the ground. The green paradox can nevertheless be present, in the sense that the resource extraction path can initially lie above what it would be in the absence of a parallel production of renewable energy. In a monopolistic market, the resource monopolist’s optimal price path is two-phased, even with inelastic demand. In the limit-pricing phase, the price is falling, due to the progressive learning by doing effect, and the extraction path is rising.
Q31|Market Structure and Supply Shocks: Evidence from Mining Disasters|This paper provides new evidence on how imperfectly competitive markets with excess capacity mitigate the adverse impact of supply shocks on prices. We study the potash market, which is controlled by a syndicate that assigns output quotas in proportion to production capacity of its members. This sharing rule creates incentives for excess capacity investment. Hence, it insulates the market from the impact of extreme events. Using a novel data set of potash mine disasters, we show that permanent or long-term loss of up to 4% of global or 20% of country production capacity does not affect the production levels and the commodity prices.
Q31|An Economic Perspective on Mexico's Nascent Deregulation of Retail Petroleum Markets|Retail petroleum markets in Mexico are on the cusp of a historic deregulation. For decades, all 11,000 gasoline stations nationwide have carried the brand of the state-owned petroleum company Pemex and sold Pemex gasoline at federally regulated retail prices. This industry structure is changing, however, as part of Mexico's broader energy reforms aimed at increasing private investment. Since April 2016, independent companies can import, transport, store, distribute, and sell gasoline and diesel. In this paper, we provide an economic perspective on Mexico's nascent deregulation. Although in many ways the reforms are unprecedented, we argue that past experiences in other markets give important clues about what to expect, as well as about potential pitfalls. Turning Mexico's retail petroleum sector into a competitive market will not be easy, but the deregulation has enormous potential to increase efficiency and, eventually, to reduce prices.
Q31|Living Standards Analysis Model: The First Prototype|How do we understand the synergies and trade-offs of a given policy on area beyond that policy, such as the effect of housing on health and on income? How do we choose between policies in completely different areas, such as an education policy and a health policy? Treasury’s Living Standards Framework provides one possible starting point, but it provides little assistance tracing the many dependencies between policy areas. A model that includes those dependencies could help. The Living Standards Analysis Model (LSAM) is designed to do this. A first prototype of the model has just been developed. This model includes all eleven aspects of wellbeing as described by the OECD’s How’s Life? framework and linkages between the different aspects for a small open economy. Most models for studying wellbeing only include one or two aspects, missing the rich set of interactions that can occur with greater coverage. As an early prototype, this version of the model does have many flaws and requires significant further development, but it forms a basis for creating an improved model as well as providing some qualitatively useful results. The model is loosely based on a stocks-and-flows type of model, with a small general equilibrium model covering the market economy part of the model. This paper is focussed on the description of the model.
Q31|Pricing Carbon and Adjusting Capital to Fend Off Climate Catastrophes|Abstract The optimal reaction to a potential productivity shock as a consequence of climate tipping is to substantially tax carbon in order to curb the risk of tipping, but to adjust capital as well in order to smooth consumption when tipping occurs. We also allow for conventional marginal climate damages and decompose the optimal carbon tax in two catastrophe components and the conventional component. We distinguish constant and increasing marginal hazards. Moreover, the productivity catastrophe is compared with recoverable catastrophes and with a shock to the climate sensitivity. Finally, we allow for investments in adaptation capital as an alternative to counter the potential adverse effects of climate tipping. Quantitatively, the results are investigated with a calibrated model for the world economy.
Q31|Dynamically Stable Preferences|This paper models the indirect evolution of the preferences of a population of fully rational agents repeatedly matched to play a symmetric 2 x 2 game in biological fitnesses. Each agent is biased in favor of one of the strategies, and receives a noisy signal of his and his opponent`s bias. With sufficiently accurate signals, the resulting global game selects a unique outcome, allowing preference biases to be shaped by the replicator dynamics. Stability analysis in this setting requires the extension of recent techniques for evolution on infinite strategy spaces, introducing new setwise stability concepts. In coordination games, the interval of preference biases supporting the Pareto-dominant equilibrium is Lyapunov stable and weakly attracting, by virtue of constituting a strongly uninvadable set. In Prisoners` Dilemmas that satisfy Kandori and Rob`s (Games and Economic Behavior 22, 1998, 30-60) marginal bandwagon property, meanwhile, an interval of biases supporting efficient cooperation is a neutrally uninvadable set, and thus Lyapunov stable.
Q31|Time-varying relationship between oil price and exchange rate|This paper contributes to better understand the dynamic interaction between U.S. effective exchange rate (EER) and oil price by considering a Time-Varying Parameter VAR model with the use of monthly data from 1974 to 2017. Our findings show a depreciation after an oil price shock in the short-run for any period of time, although the pattern of long-run responses of U.S. EER is diverse across different period of time, with an appreciation being observed before the mid-2000s and a depreciation afterwards. This diversity of response should lead policy makers to react differently in order to counteract such shocks. Furthermore, the reaction of oil price to an appreciation of U.S. EER is negative, with the response being similar in the short-run but different in the long-run for each period of time. Thus, the different responses may generate different adverse effects on investment and the knowledge of such effects may help financial investors to diversify their investments in order to optimize the risk-return profile of their portfolios.
Q31|Difficulties in the forecasting of iron ore price: a review|"The interest in the analysis of the iron ore market significantly increased after a sharp spike in the iron ore price in 2008-2010 and consecutive decline. Understanding of the reasons for these shifts are crucial for further development of the industry because a high price motivates investments in developing new mines but a long lead time for new projects and high price volatility make these investments very risky. The analysis of the studies of the iron ore market shows that the short-run behavior of iron ore price is highly dependent on oil price and variations in supply and demand, and is very difficult to predict. There are strong chances that the iron ore price will remain highly volatile with a low average in the long-run. The dependence on the price of oil and the corresponding volatility can be reduced by a gradual shift of iron ore sellers to non-fossil-fuel transport. This shift can be facilitated by the public policy regulations, offered in Ali et al. (2017) if this approach dominates the ""modestly optimistic perspective"" offered in Tilton et al. (2018), which relies mostly on market forces in the intergenerational distribution of nonrenewable resources. However, this approach also allows for a more stable iron ore price in the case of cartelization of iron ore sellers. Using the arguments of Jones (1986), fortified by an incentive compatibility mechanism, the current situation in the iron ore market is quite favorable for coordinated actions of iron ore sellers."
Q31|The predictive relationship between exchange rate expectations and base metal prices|In this paper we show that survey-based-expectations about the future evolution of the Chilean exchange rate have the ability to predict the returns of the six primary non-ferrous metals: aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc. Predictability is also found for returns of the London Metal Exchange Index. Previous studies have shown that the Chilean exchange rate has the ability to predict copper returns, a world commodity index and base metal prices. Nevertheless, our results indicate that expectations about the Chilean peso have stronger predictive ability relative to the Chilean currency. This is shown both in-sample and out-of-sample. By focusing on expectations of a commodity currency, and not on the currency itself, our paper provides indirect but new and strong evidence of the ability that commodity currencies have to forecast commodity prices. Our results are also consistent with the present-value-model for exchange rate determination.
Q31|The impact of oil prices on CO2 emissions in China: A Wavelet coherence approach|This paper observes the possible co-movements of oil price and CO2 emissions in China by following wavelet coherence and wavelet partial coherence analyses to be able to depict short-run and long-run co-movements at both low and high frequencies. To this end, this research might provide the current literature with the output of potential short run and long run, structural, changes in CO2 emissions upon a shock (a change) in oil prices in China together with the control variables of World oil prices, fossil energy consumption, and renewables consumption, and, urban population in China. Therefore, this research aims at determining wavelet coherencies between the variables and phase differences to exhibit the leading variable in potential co-movements. By following the time domain and frequency domain analyses of this research, one may claim that the oil prices in China has considerable negative impact on CO2 emissions at high frequencies for the periods 1960-2014 and 1971-2014 in China. Besides, one may underline as well other important output of the research exploring that the urban population and CO2 emissions have positive associations, move together for the period 1960-2014 in China. Eventually, this paper might suggest that authorities follow demand side management policies considering energy demand behavior at both shorter cycles and longer cycles to diminish the CO2 emissions in China.
Q31|The analysis of the influence of motivation, competence, and incentive toward employee performance at pt Sianjur resort, a housing developer of Oma Deli Medan, Indonesia|This research aims to find out the influence of motivation, competence, and incentive variables toward employee performance. Population of this research is all employees of PT. Sianjur Resort, Medan, Indonesia that is, 37 people. The sample is selected using total population sampling method. The data is collected using questionnaires, while it is analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis. The research results prove that motivation, competence, and incentive simultaneously give significant influence toward employee performance. Motivation, competence, and incentive partially give significant influence toward employee performance. It is recommended that PT. Sianjur Resort pay more attention to aspects that can increase employee performance such as giving incentive regularly and fairly so that there is no negative perception among employees about discriminative behaviour by the employer in term of giving incentive. It is also suggested that PT. Sianjur Resort’s employees increase their performance based on motivation, competence, and incentive that have been given, such as increasing self-competence without waiting for the command from the employer, so self-performance can be more increased.
Q31|Oil price volatility spillover effects on food prices in Nigeria|Studies have been done on oil price volatility spillover effects on the prices of food in both pre-crisis and post-crisis periods. However, what has been sparingly studied is oil price volatility spillover effects on urban prices of food and rural prices of food. The disparity in the rural-urban spending in Nigeria is an area that can further be explored by evaluating the effects of oil price volatility spillover on prices of food in these areas. This study therefore adopts GARCH (1, 1)-TY model to evaluate the impulse response function and variance decomposition of these effects on prices of food in pre-crisis and post-crisis periods. Findings show that in full sample and post-crisis periods both aggregate price of food (APF) and urban average price of food (APFU) positively respond to oil price shocks while rural average price of food (APFR) responds negatively to oil price shocks. However, the response of the urban average price of food proves to be more significant in the post-crisis periods as it appears relatively most affected in this period by a greater percentage of oil price shocks.
Q31|A wavelet analysis of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices|In this paper, we aim to explore the relationship between natural gas and crude oil prices for the U.S. economy over the time period 1997 and 2017 in both the unconditional and conditional framework by conditioning the relationship on natural gas production. The time period covers the recent shale gas supply boom. Our results indicate that during the shale gas revolution period of 2007–2013, oil and natural gas prices were procyclical and oil prices were leading natural gas prices. Once we control for the natural gas production we find that significant or high wavelet coherency is observed during 2000–2015 for 3–4 years scale. These results have implications for cross-market policy effects.
Q31|Strategic Demand Response to Dynamic Pricing: A Lab Experiment for the Electricity Market|Despite the efforts of restructuring power markets over the last decades, the lack of demand response in the retail electricity markets remains a significant concern. Possible demand response would help to reduce prices and volatility by better matching supply and demand through improved price signals. In this paper we develop a laboratory tool to experimentally investigate the demand response in the electricity market. The baseline treatment constitutes a two-period ‘wait-or-buy’ game with an exogenous first period, an automated supplier, and twenty subject buyers. While the seller offers a fixed number of a product in the market, consumers decide on purchasing the product immediately or waiting until the next period, taking (i) price uncertainty and (ii) inventory risk into account. This treatment captures demand response in the retail market with scarce products. We design an additional treatment by removing the inventory constraint and introducing a devaluation rule, where consumers only bear the price risk – thus mimicking the demand response in the electricity market. We find that in both retail and electricity market treatments consumers play on average the equilibrium predictions and buy strategically. However, there are systematic deviations from rationality in both settings, i.e., consumers buy too soon or wait too long.
Q31|Can the US shale revolution be duplicated in continental Europe? An economic analysis of European shale gas resources|Over the past decade, the rapid increase in shale gas and shale oil production in the United States has profoundly changed energy markets in North America, and has led to a significant decrease in American natural gas prices. The possible existence of large shale deposits in continental Europe, mainly in France, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, has fostered speculation on whether the U.S. shale revolution could be duplicated in Europe. However, a number of uncertainties, notably geological, technological, regulatory, and relating to public acceptance make this possibility unclear. We present a techno-economic model of shale gas production amenable to direct estimation on historical production data to analyze the main determinants of the profitability of shale wells and plays. We contribute an in-depth analysis of an extensive production dataset covering 40,000 wells and accounting for nearly 90% of shale gas production in the six main plays of the continental United States from 2004 to 2014. We combine this analysis with a discussion of the main differences between the American and European contexts to calibrate our model and conduct Monte-Carlo simulations. This enables us to estimate the distribution of breakeven prices for shale gas extraction in continental Europe. We find a median gross breakeven price before taxes and royalties of $10.1 per MMBtu. This would make extraction unprofitable in Europe in the current natural gas price environment, with
Q31|Water Innovation and Water Governance: Adaptive Responses to Regulatory Change and Extreme Weather Events|This paper investigates the effect of federal and state level regulatory changes with respect to drinking water quality, water pollution and water quantity in the United States on the level of relevant technological innovation. We construct and use a unique dataset covering major amendments and additions to regulated contaminants lists as stipulated in the legislative acts most relevant to the policy area we study, along with a list of technological patents pertaining to water quality and quantity over a period of more than 30 years. We find in general the impact of water regulation on innovation to be both statistically and economically significant.
Q31|Prices versus Quantities: The Impact of Fracking on the Choice of Climate Policy Instruments in the Presence of OPEC|This paper analyzes the impact of declining extraction costs of shale oil producers on the choice of the policy instrument of a climate coalition in the presence of a monopolistic oil supplier such as OPEC. Shale oil producers' extraction costs represent an upper bound for the oil price OPEC can charge. Declining extraction costs ultimately limit OPEC's price setting behavior and thus impacts the optimal climate policy of the climate coalition. A pure cap-and-trade system is weakly welfare-inferior relative to a carbon tax for the climate coalition. While high extraction costs allow OPEC to appropriate the whole climate rent in case of quantity regulation, declining extraction costs imply OPEC to capture only a part of the climate rent. A carbon tax always generates positive revenue and thus is welfare-superior in general. However, low extraction costs prevent OPEC from exerting its market power, leading the climate coalition to implement the Pigouvian tax in the first place. Both market-based instruments are equivalent in this case. Complementing a quota with a base tax cannot outperform a pure carbon tax.
Q31|Supply Flexibility in the Shale Patch: Evidence from North Dakota|We analyse if supply exibility in oil production depends on the extraction technology. In particular, we ask to what extent shale oil producers respond to price incentives by changing completion of new wells as well as oil production from completed wells. Using a novel well-level monthly production data set covering more than 15,000 crude oil wells in North Dakota, we find large differences in response between conventional and unconventional (shale) extraction technology: While shale oil wells respond significantly to spot future spreads by changing both well completion and crude oil production, conventional wells do not. Our results suggest that firms using shale oil technology are more exible in allocating output intertemporally. We interpret such output pattern of shale oil wells to be consistent with the Hotelling theory of optimal extraction.
Q31|Energy Price Reform: A Guide for Policymakers|This essay reviews the conceptual and quantitative literature on the efficient system of fossil fuel energy prices in different countries for reflecting supply and environmental costs, as well as the environmental, fiscal, and economic benefits from energy price reform. Drawing on recent experiences in numerous countries, the ingredients for successful reform are then discussed (e.g., the need for a comprehensive reform strategy and for compensating vulnerable groups). Low energy prices, fiscal pressures, and momentum for climate action provide an especially conducive environment for price reform and much is happening rapidly on the ground, however there is a long way to go to reap the enormous benefits at stake (e.g., at the global level, over a 20 percent reduction in carbon emissions and revenues gains of 4 percent of GDP).
Q31|OPEC, Shale Oil, and Global Warming - On the importance of the order of extraction|We show that OPEC's market power contributes to global warming by enabling producers of relatively expensive and dirty oil to start producing before OPEC reserves are depleted. We fully characterize the equilibrium of a cartel-fringe model and use a calibration to examine the importance of this extraction sequence effect. While welfare under the cartel-fringe equilibrium can be significantly lower than under a first-best outcome, almost all of this welfare loss is due to the sequence effect. Moreover, the recent boom in shale oil reserves may reduce social welfare and renewables subsidies can increase the carbon content of current extraction.
Q31|Modeling fluctuations in the global demand for commodities|It is widely understood that the real price of globally traded commodities is determined by the forces of demand and supply. One of the main determinants of the real price of commodities is shifts in the demand for commodities associated with unexpected fluctuations in global real economic activity. There have been numerous proposals for quantifying global real economic activity. We discuss which criteria a measure of global real activity must satisfy to be useful for modeling industrial commodity prices, we examine which of the many alternative measures in the literature are most suitable for applied work, and we explain why some popular measures are inappropriate for modeling industrial commodity prices. Given these insights, we examine the question of whether there has been a slowdown in global real economic activity between 2011 and 2016 and by how much. Drawing on a range of new evidence, we show that the global commodity price boom of the 2000s appears to have been largely transitory and that the partial recovery after 2016 has been fueled by the strength of advanced economies rather than China. Our analysis has important implications for the design of structural models of commodity markets, for the analysis of the transmission of commodity price shocks to commodity-importing and -exporting economies, and for commodity price forecasting.

Q31|Rapacious Oil Exploration in face of Regime Switches: Breakthrough Renewable Energy and Dynamic Resource Wars|Rapacious fossil fuel extraction occurs if fossil fuel producers fear that there is a probability that their under-the-ground assets becomes worth less. They show that rapacious depletion of oil reserves occurs if there is a probability of a breakthrough renewable energy coming to the market or a probability of climate policy finally becoming seriously ambitious. These are examples of one-way regime switches leading to the so-called Green Paradox. Two-way regimes switches also lead to rapacious oil depletion. They occur if there is a chance of being removed from office in a partisan political context with perennial election cycles or if there are dynamic resource wars with the hazard of being removed from office dependent on fighting efforts. This rapacity effect is stronger in societies with bad institutions and lack of political cohesiveness.
Q31|Trade in fossil fuel deposits for preservation and strategic action|In the world economy with interdependent markets for fossil fuel deposits and extracted fossil fuel, some coalition of countries may fight climate change by purchasing and preserving fossil fuel deposits, which would be exploited otherwise. Assuming that deposits are traded on a market with a uniform price, we find that the outcome is efficient if the coalition is a price taker in both markets, but inefficient if it acts strategically in the deposit market but not in the fuel market, or acts strategically in both markets. The latter result demonstrates that Harstad’s (2012, Theorem 1) ‘efficiency-despite-strategic-action result’ is not robust with respect to changes in the concepts of the deposit market and market (or bargaining) power. In a simplified parametric version of the game, a strategically acting coalition buys fewer deposits, consumes more fuel, and puts up with higher climate damage than in first-best.
Q31|Exploitation and Recycling of Exhaustible Resources: The Case of Rare Earths and Phosphorus|We study the exploitation of recyclable exhaustible resources such as rare earths and Phosphorus. We use a standard Hotelling model of resource exploitation that includes a primary sector and a recycling sector. We show that, when the primary sector is competitive, the price of the recyclable resource increases through time. This result stands in contrast to durable resources, for which the optimal price path is either decreasing or U-shaped. We then show a new reason why the price of an exhaustible resource may decrease: when the primary sector is monopolistic, the primary producer has incentives to delay its production activities in order to delay recycling. As a consequence, the price path of the recyclable resource may be U-shaped. We also show that a technological improvement in the recycling sector increases the price in the short term but decreases it later.
Q31|Impact of Indiaâ€™s National Food Security Act on domestic and international rice markets| Policy making in food security is at a crossroads in India, particularly for the rice crop. Whereas India has emerged has a leading rice exporter over the last two years, the government has also introduced a large food subsidy program called the National Food Security Act. The program requires that 33.6 million metric tons of rice per year be distributed to the marginalized rural and urban populations of the country. In this study, we analyze the long-term impact of Indiaâ€™s Food Security Act on its domestic rice market and the international market for rice. We specify and apply a structural demand-and-supply model to Indiaâ€™s rice market and link it with the world rice market, as part of a broad partial equilibrium modeling system of international agriculture commodity markets. We specifically focus on three different scenariosâ€”subsidy as a price effect, subsidy as an inelastic income effect, and subsidy as an elastic income effectâ€”under the broader framework of the National Food Security Act. We find that at the end of the projection period (the 2024/2025 crop year), as a result of the rice subsidy program, the consumption of rice increases significantly by 6,831 thousand metric ton (MT) in the case of the price effect while the inelastic income effect has little on production, consumption which increase by 265 thousand MT and 269 thousand MT, respectively and no impact on rice export of India.
Q31|The Grey Paradox: How fossil-fuel owners can benefit from carbon taxation|This paper considers the distributional impact of optimal carbon taxation on fossil-fuel owners. A carbon-emitting exhaustible resource competes with a dirtier abundant resource and a clean backstop. A time-dependent carbon tax is set to optimally use these resources under a cap constraint over CO2 atmospheric concentration. As the cap is tightened, the dirtier resource becomes less competitive compared to the exhaustible resource (the “competition effect”), but the timing and duration of extraction of the exhaustible resource is modified (the “timing effect”). We provide analytical expressions of these effects, and determine conditions over size of reserves, pollution contents, extraction costs and demand elasticity such that the exhaustible-resource owners’ profits increase as the ceiling is tightened. Calibrations for the transport and power sectors suggest that the profits of conventional-oil and natural-gas owners increase compared to a baseline without regulation for plausible carbon-ceiling values.
Q31|Climate Policy with Tied Hands: Optimal Resource Taxation Under Implementation Lags|Abstract In the presence of implementation lags, announced Pigouvian taxation leads to fossil fuel prices that are too low from society’s perspective. This results in excessive emissions and reduced incentives for green innovation. Such effects are compounded by the presence of pre-existing subsidies to fossil fuel use. We show that the intertemporal resource tax path may need to be modified to optimally take into account the perverse incentives from policy lags and pre-existing policies. We find that it might be optimal to subsidize, rather than tax resource extraction at the instant of implementation.

Q31|Inflation dynamics in pre and post deregulation era in Ghana: Do petroleum prices have any influence?|The study looks at the impact of price of petroleum prices on inflation in the Ghanaian economy in the pre and post deregulation era and associated direction of causality as well as the extent of pass through of high international petroleum products price to the domestic retail market. An ARDL model was applied on time series monthly data of various petroleum fuel prices as well as exchange rate.A pass-through formula use by Baig et al, (2007) was also applied. The results reveal that changes in LPG, Kerosene and premium prices have marginal impact on inflation. The pass through analysis revealed Ghana has not pass through more than 50% of increase price of international or import petroleum product of gasoline, kerosene and LPG to the ordinary consumers in the period of the study and this was lower in the post deregulation than pre deregulation. The study therefore recommends full deregulation to continue since it favours lower pass through of fuel price increase in the world market to ordinary consumers whiles may consider gasoline and premium price increase at the expense of kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas price if inflation is to be shielded from fuel price increase.
Q31|Analysing the Effect of Oil Price Shocks on Asset Prices: evidence from UK firms|This study examines the responses of some of the UK transportation, travel and leisure, and oil and gas firms to oil price changes. Fama-French-Carhart's (1997) four-factor asset pricing model is augmented with the oil price risk factor to study the association of oil and stock prices of 25 firms over the period from January 1998 to December 2012. The extent of the exposure of UK transportation and travel and leisure firms is generally negative but it is particularly significant for a number of firms including delivery services, travel and tourism, and airlines. Oil price risk exposures of UK oil and gas companies are generally positive and significant. With the aid of asymmetric and scaled specifications, some firms show strong evidence of asymmetry in the reaction of stock returns to changes in the price of oil comprising travel and tourism, airlines, and integrated oil and gas. Moreover, the results document that oil price risk exposures vary over time. In particular, the global recession of 2008 has significantly contributed to the oil price risk exposure of travel and tourism and integrated oil and gas firms. These results should be of interest to financial analysts, corporate executives, regulators and policy makers.
Q31|OPEC, Saudi Arabia, and the shale revolution: Insights from equilibrium modelling and oil politics|Why did OPEC not cut oil production in the wake of 2014's price fall? This study aims at aiding the mostly qualitative discussion with quantitative evidence from computing quarterly partial market equilibria Q4 2011 – Q4 2015 under present short-term profit maximisation and different competition setups. Although the model performs reasonably well in explaining pre-2014 prices, all setups fail to capture low prices, which fall even beyond perfect competition outcomes. This result is robust with respect to large variations in cost parameters. Rejecting present short-term profit maximisation, as well as a qualitative discussion of Saudi Arabian politics and the shale oil revolution, lead to the conclusion that the price drop of 2014-16 was most plausibly the result of an attempt to defend market shares and to test for shale oil resilience, besides being fuelled by other factors such as rising competitiveness of alternative technologies. Although shale oil might have increased competition permanently (as supported by model results), the agreement of December 2016 should not be misunderstood as an OPEC defeat.
Q31|Oil returns and volatility: The role of mergers and acquisitions|This paper provides a novel perspective to the oil-stock market nexus by examining the predictive ability of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) over West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil returns and volatility using a nonparametric quantile-based methodology. Our findings suggest that M&A activity carries significant predictive power over oil return and volatility, while predictability displays remarkably distinct patterns across various quantiles representing normal, bull and bear market states. We also observe that M&A activity by oil firms, i.e. both the acquiring and target firms considered active in the oil and gas (O&G) industry, generally carries greater predictive power over both oil returns and volatility compared to M&A activity by non-oil acquirers, i.e. acquirers that have entered the O&G industry by buying an oil company. Our findings imply that M&A activity in the O&G industry carries valuable fundamental information regarding future expectations on oil price dynamics and should be taken into account in forecasting exercises.
Q31|Turkey's Role in Natural Gas - Becoming a Transit Country?|This paper analyses the possible future role that Turkey can play in European natural gas markets. We employ a global gas market simulation model, COLUMBUS, to assess the outcomes of different scenarios concerning natural gas supply routes to Europe through Turkey up to 2030. The results imply simply that under current conditions, i.e., a more competitive environment in European gas markets leading to low gas prices, Turkey’s role would be of only minor importance. In accordance with various scenarios presented in this study, Turkey’s role is seen at its most important when European demand increases and Russia exerts power in the European markets.
Q31|Can the US shale revolution be duplicated in continental Europe?: An economic analysis of European shale gas resources|Over the past decade, the rapid increase in shale gas and shale oil production in the United States has profoundly changed energy markets in North America, and has led to a significant decrease in American natural gas prices. The possible existence of large shale deposits in continental Europe, mainly in France, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, has fostered speculation on whether the U.S. shale revolution could be duplicated in Europe. However, a number of uncertainties, notably geological, technological, regulatory, and relating to public acceptance make this possibility unclear. We present a techno-economic model of shale gas production amenable to direct estimation on historical production data to analyze the main determinants of the profitability of shale wells and plays. We contribute an in-depth analysis of an extensive production dataset covering 40,000 wells and accounting for nearly 90% of shale gas production in the six main plays of the continental United States from 2004 to 2014. We combine this analysis with a discussion of the main differences between the American and European contexts to calibrate our model and conduct Monte-Carlo simulations. This enables us to estimate the distribution of breakeven prices for shale gas extraction in continental Europe. We find a median gross breakeven price before taxes and royalties of $10.1 per MMBtu. This would make extraction unprofitable in Europe in the current natural gas price environment, with
Q31|Phasing out coal and phasing in renewables – good or bad news for arctic gas producers?|This paper examines to what extent downscaling of global coal based electricity generation encourages gas demand and affects regional activity in gas production, with emphasis on the arctic regions. In our reference scenario up to 2050 we take into consideration that renewables is set to increase its contribution to global electricity production over time, while coal will contribute less. We find that a policy scenario with further phasing out of coal and phasing in of renewables in line with the 2 degrees scenario for the power sector up to 2050, will lead to reduced arctic gas production compared to the reference scenario, although total worldwide electricity production doubles over the same period. However, even in a situation with less resources and higher costs in the Arctic, future investments in new reserves in the region are still profitable in our policy scenario, as total arctic gas production then is only marginally lower in 2050 than today.
Q31|OPEC, Shale Oil, and Global Warming - On the Importance of the Order of Extraction|We show that OPEC’s market power contributes to global warming by enabling producers of relatively expensive and dirty oil to start producing before OPEC reserves are depleted. We fully characterize the equilibrium of a cartel-fringe model and use a calibration to examine the importance of this extraction sequence effect. While welfare under the cartel-fringe equilibrium can be significantly lower than under a first-best outcome, almost all of this welfare loss is due to the sequence effect. Moreover, the recent boom in shale oil reserves may reduce social welfare and renewables subsidies can increase the carbon content of current extraction.
Q31|Market Power in Nonrenewable Resource Markets: An Empirical Dynamic Model|This paper estimates a dynamic model of the world markets for five nonrenewable resources over the period 1970–2004 and tests for market power in each of these markets. The results show that during the study period the world markets for copper, iron, lead, tin, and zinc were characterized by oligopolistic behavior. Our model enables us to estimate an upper bound for the price elasticity of demand for those markets exhibiting market power. We find that the demand for copper, iron, lead, and zinc is relatively inelastic, while the demand for tin is extremely elastic.
Q31|Prices versus quantities: The impact of fracking on the choice of climate policy instruments in the presence of OPEC|This paper analyzes the impact of declining extraction costs of shale oil producers on the choice of the policy instrument of a climate coalition in the presence of a monopolistic oil supplier such as OPEC. Shale oil producers' extraction costs represent an upper bound for the oil price OPEC can charge. Declining extraction costs ultimately limit OPEC's price setting behavior and thus impacts the optimal climate policy of the climate coalition. A pure cap-and-trade system is weakly welfare-inferior relative to a carbon tax for the climate coalition. While high extraction costs allow OPEC to appropriate the whole climate rent in case of quantity regulation, declining extraction costs imply OPEC to capture only a part of the climate rent. A carbon tax always generates positive revenue and thus is welfare-superior in general. However, low extraction costs prevent OPEC from exerting its market power, leading the climate coalition to implement the Pigouvian tax in the first place. Both market-based instruments are equivalent in this case. Complementing a quota with a base tax cannot outperform a pure carbon tax.

Q31|Achieving Efficiency in Dynamic Contribution Games|We analyze a game in which a group of agents exerts costly effort over time to make progress on a project. The project is completed once the cumulative effort reaches a prespecified threshold, at which point it generates a lump-sum payoff. We characterize a budget-balanced mechanism that induces each agent to exert the first-best effort level as the outcome of a Markov perfect equilibrium, thus eliminating the free-rider problem. We also show how our mechanism can be adapted to other dynamic games with externalities, such as strategic experimentation and the dynamic extraction of a common resource.
Q31|Forty Years of Oil Price Fluctuations: Why the Price of Oil May Still Surprise Us|It has been 40 years since the oil crisis of 1973/74. This crisis has been one of the defining economic events of the 1970s and has shaped how many economists think about oil price shocks. In recent years, a large literature on the economic determinants of oil price fluctuations has emerged. Drawing on this literature, we first provide an overview of the causes of all major oil price fluctuations between 1973 and 2014. We then discuss why oil price fluctuations remain difficult to predict, despite economists' improved understanding of oil markets. Unexpected oil price fluctuations are commonly referred to as oil price shocks. We document that, in practice, consumers, policymakers, financial market participants, and economists may have different oil price expectations, and that, what may be surprising to some, need not be equally surprising to others.
Q31|Using Carbon Pricing Revenues to Finance Infrastructure Access|Introducing a price on greenhouse gas emissions would not only contribute to reducing the risk of dangerous anthropogenic climate change, but would also generate substantial public revenues. Some of these revenues could be used to cover investment needs for infrastructure providing access to water, sanitation, electricity, telecommunications and transport. In this way, emission pricing could promote sustainable socio-economic development by safeguarding the stability of natural systems which constitute the material basis of economies while at the same time providing public goods that are essential for human well- being. An analysis of several climate scenarios with different stabilization targets and technological assumptions reveals that emission pricing has a substantial potential to close existing access gaps.
Q31|Global oil market and the U.S. stock returns|This paper provides an analysis of the link between the oil market and the U.S. stock market returns at the aggregate as well as industry levels. We empirically model oil price changes as driven by speculative demand shocks along with consumption demand and supply shocks in the oil market. We also take into account in our model all the factors that affect stock market price movements over and above the oil market, in order to quantify the pure effect of oil price shocks on returns. The results show that stock returns respond to oil price shocks differently, depending on the causes behind the shocks. Impulse response analysis suggests that consumption demand shocks are the most relevant drivers of the stock market return, relative to other oil market driven shocks. Industry level analysis is performed to control for the heterogeneity of the responses of returns to oil price changes. The results show that both cost side and demand side effects of oil price shocks matter for the responses of industries to oil price shocks. However, the main driver of the variation in industries' returns is the shock to aggregate stock market.
Q31|Structural Changes in U.S. Cotton Supply| Recent droughts have caused policy makers to implement water use restrictions in some areas, causing shifts out of irrigated cotton production. With the passage of the 2014 Farm Bill, cotton lint is no longer considered a program crop, and producers will now have to rely on using additional crop insurance for protection. Low cotton prices coupled with lack of domestic policies could negatively impact the amount of acreage dedicated to cotton production. Cotton supply functions were estimated to determine if structural changes exist.
Q31|The Evolution of the Chinese Housing Market and Its Impact on Base Metal Prices|The Chinese housing market has grown rapidly following its liberalization in the 1990s, generating significant economic activity and demand for base metals. In this paper, we discuss the evolution of the Chinese housing market and quantify its importance for the overall Chinese economy and its linkages to base metal prices. We estimate that the housing boom was responsible for roughly a quarter of the 85 per cent increase in base metal prices from 2002 to 2010. Since 2014, however, a substantial inventory overhang has led to a steep correction in the housing market, which in turn has contributed up to a third of the 25 per cent decline in base metal prices. While the drag on metal prices should ease as the Chinese housing market stabilizes, the level of support from this sector will likely remain minimal compared with the experience of the past decade.
Q31|Will We Ever Stop Using Fossil Fuels?|Scientists believe significant climate change is unavoidable without a drastic reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases from the combustion of fossil fuels. However, few countries have implemented comprehensive policies that price this externality or devote serious resources to developing low-carbon energy sources. In many respects, the world is betting that we will greatly reduce the use of fossil fuels because we will run out of inexpensive fossil fuels (there will be decreases in supply) and/or technological advances will lead to the discovery of less-expensive low-carbon technologies (there will be decreases in demand). The historical record indicates that the supply of fossil fuels has consistently increased over time and that their relative price advantage over low-carbon energy sources has not declined substantially over time. Without robust efforts to correct the market failures around greenhouse gases, relying on supply and/or demand forces to limit greenhouse gas emissions is relying heavily on hope.
Q31|Criminals and the Price System: Evidence from Czech Metal Thieves|People steal copper and other nonferrous metals to sell them to scrap yard. Simultaneously, prices at scrap yards are set by the world market. We argue that shocks in metal prices represent a quasi-experimental variation in gains from crime. This allows us to estimate the behavioral parameters of supply of offenses and test the economic theory of criminal behavior. Our estimates suggest that the long-term elasticity of supply of metal thefts with respect to the re-sale value of stolen metal is between unity and 1.5. Moreover, the system tends to equilibriate quickly—between 30 and 60 percent of a disequilibrium is corrected the following month and the monthly price elasticity estimates are around unity.
Q31|How Large Are Global Energy Subsidies?|This paper provides a comprehensive, updated picture of energy subsidies at the global and regional levels. It focuses on the broad notion of post-tax energy subsidies, which arise when consumer prices are below supply costs plus a tax to reflect environmental damage and an additional tax applied to all consumption goods to raise government revenues. Post-tax energy subsidies are dramatically higher than previously estimated, and are projected to remain high. These subsidies primarily reflect under-pricing from a domestic (rather than global) perspective, so even unilateral price reform is in countries’ own interests. The potential fiscal, environmental and welfare impacts of energy subsidy reform are substantial.
Q31|Limit Pricing, Climate Policies, and Imperfect Substitution|The effects of climate policies are often studied under the assumption of perfectly competitive markets for fossil fuels. In this paper, we allow for monopolistic fossil fuel supply. We show that, if fossil and renewable energy sources are perfect substitutes, a phase will exist during which the monopolist chooses a limit pricing strategy. If limit pricing occurs from the beginning, a renewables subsidy increases initial extraction, whereas a carbon tax leaves initial extraction unaffected. However, if the initially fossil fuels are cheaper than renewables, a renewables subsidy and a carbon tax lower initial extraction, contrary to the case under perfect competition. Both policy instruments lower cumulative extraction. If fossil fuels and renewables are imperfect but good substitutes, the monopolist will exhibit `limit pricing resembling' behavior, by keeping the effective price of fossil close to that of renewables for considerable time. The empirical question whether energy demand is elastic or inelastic has less drastic implications for the fossil price and extraction paths than under perfect substitutability.
Q31|Wirksamkeit von Klimapolitiken: Empirische Methoden und Evidenz|"Die vorliegende Arbeit wurde von Julian Dieler während seiner Tätigkeit als Wissen-schaftlicher Mitarbeiter im Zentrum für Energie, Klima und erschöpfbare Ressourcen am ifo Institut erstellt. Spätestens seit der Unterzeichnung des Kyoto-Protokolls im Jahre 1997 ist Klimapolitik ein permanentes Thema sowohl auf der nationalen, als auch auf der internationalen politischen Bühne. Und dies vollkommen zu Recht, da die Dringlichkeit, effektive und realisierbare Klimapolitikmaßnahmen zu finden, immer größer wird. Schätzungen des Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) zufolge wird das „Klima-Budget"" zur Erreichung des 2-Grad-Ziels bereits im Jahre 2045 aufgebraucht sein. Um einen optimalen Klimapolitikmix zu bestimmen bedarf es einer Analyse von Politikmaßnahmen und deren Effektivität. Die vorliegende Arbeit trägt zu dem wissenschaftlichen Diskurs hierüber bei. Kapitel 1 analysiert die Effektivität von Benzin- und Dieselsteuern in Europa durch das Schätzen von Preis- und Steuerelastizitäten der Benzin- und Dieselnachfrage. Preis- und Steuerelastizitäten sind ein weit verbreitetes Maß, um die Effektivität von Konsumsteuern zu messen. Die Haupterkenntnis aus der Studie, die diesem Kapitel zugrunde liegt, besteht in dem Nachweis eines Steuerantizipationseffekts der Konsumenten. Wird für diesen nicht kontrolliert, wird die Effektivität von Steuern auf den Treibstoffverbrauch in der kurzen Frist überschätzt. Das zweite Kapitel beinhaltet ebenfalls eine methodische Erweiterung der bestehenden Literatur zur Schätzung der Treibstoffnachfrage. Da in dieser Literatur oftmals Mikrodaten zur Anwendung kommen, die eine große Anzahl von Nullbeobachtungen aufweisen, führt die Schätzung der Nachfrage mit dem standardmäßig verwendeten log-linearen Modell geschätzt mit der Kleinsten-Quadrate-Methode zu verzerrten Schätzergebnissen für die Elastizitäten. Kapitel 2 schlägt alternative Modelle vor und vergleicht deren Güte anhand mehrerer Modellvergleichstests. Das dritte und letzte Kapitel führt einen neuen Klimapolitikindex ein, der einen Vergleich der Stringenz der Klimapolitik in den OECD Ländern ermöglicht. Und zwar sowohl zwischen den Ländern, als auch für die einzelnen Länder über die Zeit."
Q31|Beschäftigungseffekte der Exportkreditgarantien des Bundes und globale Wertschöpfungsketten|Die deutsche Exportwirtschaft ist seit Jahrzehnten eine wichtige Säule für die gesamtwirtschaftliche Entwicklung der Bundesrepublik. Entscheidend für den Erfolg deutscher Unternehmen bei der Erschließung internationaler Märkte ist neben der Innovationskraft der Firmen ebenso die Finanzierungsmöglichkeit von Exportgeschäften. Um Exporteure gegen Finanzierungrisiken in wachstumsstarken aber auch risikoreichen Ländern abzusichern, stellt der Bund Exportkreditgarantien – sogenannte Hermesdeckungen – zur Verfügung. Allerdings müssen hierfür gewisse Kriterien in Bezug auf einen Mindestanteil deutscher Wertschöpfung erfüllt sein. Vor dem Hintergrund zunehmend internationalisierter Wertschöpfungsketten hat das ifo Institut im Auftrag des Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaft und Energie untersucht, inwiefern deutsche Exporteure mit hohen ausländischen Wertschöpfungsanteilen Beschäftigung in Deutschland schaffen und ob eine Erhöhung des deckungsfähigen ausländischen Wertschöpfungsanteils zu einer Veränderung der Beschäftigungswirkung von Hermesdeckungen führt. Die Studie kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass die vorliegende Deckungspolitik bei Hermesdeckungen für einen Großteil der Unternehmen ausreichend flexibel gestaltet ist, eine Zulassung höherer ausländischer Wertschöpfungsanteile jedoch zusätzliche Arbeitsplätze in Deutschland und Europa schaffen würde. Die Studie beinhaltet zudem eine kritische Diskussion über die Weiterreichung von Ausfallrisiken an Länder, deren Unternehmen an deutschen Exporten teilhaben.
Q31|Banken sind zur Stabilisierung des Ölpreises wichtiger als die Konjunktur|In seinem Kommentar diskutiert Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, Universität Duisburg- Essen, die Gründe für die aktuellen Ölpreisschwankungen und schlägt Maßnahmen zur Abmilderung des Risikos vor, das durch den großen Einbruch der Ölpreise für die politische und wirtschaftliche Stabilität in weiten Regionen verursacht wird.
Q31|The Impacts of Other-Regarding Preferences and Ethical Choice on Environmental Outcomes: A Review of the Literature|This paper reviews the literature concerning the impacts of other-regarding preferences and ethical choice on environmental outcomes when agents behave strategically. We consider two types of other-regarding preferences: (i) envy or status concern, (ii) altruism and inequality aversion. We contrast these preference-based approaches with the ethical approach in which some choices are made on ethical ground and thus are not necessarily utility-maximizing. Models exhibiting other-regarding preferences do not yield unambiguous results concerning the effects of strategic behavior on the environment. In contrast, models in which choices are motivated by Kantian ethics display more robust results.
Q31|Phasing out the U.S. Federal Helium Reserve: Policy insights from a world helium model|This paper develops a detailed partial equilibrium model of the global helium market to study the effects of the recently decided rapid phase out of the U.S. Federal Helium Reserve (FHR), a vast strategic stockpile accumulated during the 1960s. The model incorporates a detailed representation of that industry and treats both helium producers and the FHR as players in a dynamic non-cooperative game. The goal of each player is assumed to be the maximization of discounted profit, subject to technical and resource constraints. We consider two alternative policies aimed at organizing the phase out of the FHR: the currently implemented one and a less stringent one whereby the FHR would be allowed to operate as a profit-maximizing agent during an extended period of time. Evidences gained from a series of market simulations indicate that, compared to the current policy, a less stringent policy mandate systematically increases the financial return to the U.S. federal budget, always enhances environmental outcomes as it lowers helium venting into the atmosphere, and also augments global welfare in three out of the four scenarios considered in the paper.
Q31|Mitigating Environmental and Public-Safety Risks of United States Crude-by-Rail Transport|We present a medium-term market equilibrium model of the North American crude oil sector via which we develop a scenario analysis to investigate strategies to mitigate the environmental and public-safety risks from crude-by-rail transportation across the United States. The model captures crude oil movements across rail- roads, pipelines and waterways, while distinguishing between light and heavy crude qualities. We find that restricting rail loads or increasing pipeline capacity from areas driving production will significantly reduce rail movements. However, lifting the United States crude oil export ban in isolation will only increase rail transportation volumes. We show that an integrated policy of targeted rail caps, pipeline investments and lifting the export ban sustainably addresses medium-term crude-by-rail risks in the United States.
Q31|Non-renewable resources in the long run|We model a competitive economy in which production is dependent on labor and a non-renewable resource, the stock of which is inhomogeneous. We solve the model analytically and show how—in infinite time—the economy moves away from an initial balanced growth path (b.g.p.) and towards a mature b.g.p. The characteristics of the initial b.g.p. match historical observations of slowly declining resource price and consumption growth tracking global product. The mature b.g.p. depends on the nature of the stock; the more steeply cross-sectional area declines with depth, the faster the rate of price increase. We show how the theoretical model may be adapted and parameterized to explain and predict the evolution of markets for specific resources, applying the model in two cases, copper and petroleum.
Q31|Gold and silver manipulation: What can be empirically verified?|The issue of gold and silver price manipulation, in particular price suppression, is examined. We use a mixture of normal approach to decompose the returns into abnormal and control samples. Price suppression is a form of market manipulation of the runs type, where longer negative runs with lower returns than expected would be observed. To explore whether this form of manipulation can be empirically detected the length of runs and the total return observed during a run were computed for modelled abnormal and control clusters in gold and silver. In both metals the proportion of negative runs in the abnormal cluster is greater than the proportion of negative runs in the control cluster. In both cases the average return for negative runs is significantly lower in the abnormal cluster than in the control cluster. When average returns over positive runs are compared the abnormal group has significantly higher expected returns than the control group. Given the short maximum run lengths in the abnormal cluster and the fact that positive runs have significantly higher average returns in the abnormal cluster than in the control cluster, it is likely that that the high volatility associated with the abnormal cluster is the driver of the results presented in this study, as opposed to manipulation.
Q31|Evolution of the world crude oil market integration: A graph theory analysis|This paper investigates the evolution of the world crude oil market and the pricing power for major oil-producing and oil-consuming countries using graph theory. A minimal spanning tree for the world crude oil market is constructed and some empirical results are given. The integration of the world crude oil market is verified. Furthermore, the world crude oil market is characterised as a geographical and organisational structure. The crude oil markets of adjacent countries or regions tend to link together, while OPEC is well-integrated. We also found that the links in the South and North American region and the African region are relatively stable. The crude oil markets in the U.S., Angola and Saudi Arabia take up the core, with a higher ‘betweenness centrality’ and lower ‘farness’, whereas the markets in the East and Southeast Asian countries are on the fringe. Finally, the degree of globalisation for the world crude oil market is becoming further entrenched, verified by a decreasing normalised tree length; hence, its systemic risk may increase due to the future uncertainty of world politics.
Q31|The relationship between U.S. retail gasoline and crude oil prices during the Great Recession: “Rockets and feathers” or “balloons and rocks” behavior?|Previous studies of the relationship between crude oil and gasoline prices have often found “rockets and feathers” behavior: a scenario where gasoline prices increase more rapidly when crude oil prices rise than they fall when crude oil prices drop. While we find this behavior in times of generally rising crude oil prices, we find the opposite to be true during times of generally falling crude oil prices, a phenomenon we call “balloons and rocks” behavior. This result was obtained by testing for parameter stability in error-correction models which were estimated for periods of significant variability in both crude oil and gasoline prices. The data used to estimate these results is unique in the literature as it is comprised of daily U.S. retail gasoline prices and daily crude oil prices. The sample was taken during the Great Recession, an exceptional period of time that saw both sharp increases and decreases in gasoline and crude oil prices.
Q31|Estimating dynamics of US demand for major fossil fuels|Long-run demand relationships among fossil fuels in the United States were investigated using annual data covering 1918 through 2013. Due to the endogeneity problem among the variables of interest, as indicated by the findings from the Granger Causality test, weak exogeneity test, and Directed Acyclic Graphs, the use of the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) method was deemed appropriate. The SUR model demonstrated that there was low level of substitutability among fossil fuels, but the small magnitude of the estimated coefficient indicates that natural gas, oil, and coal are more properly classified as independent goods than as substitutes of each other within the US market. Income elasticities for all three fossil fuels indicate that they are normal goods. Several external shocks have significant impact on demand for each of the fossil fuels. Slightly lower explanatory power of oil demand equation may be explained with the fact that the model did not include US oil imports although the US economy has been dependent, to some degree, on imported oil.
Q31|Uncertainty and crude oil returns|We use a copula approach to investigate the effect of uncertainty on crude-oil returns. Using copulas to construct multivariate distributions of time-series data permit the calculation of the dependence structure between the series independently of the marginal distributions. Further, we implement the copula estimation using a rolling window method to allow for a time-varying effect of equity and economic policy uncertainty on oil returns. The results show that higher uncertainty, as measured by equity and economic policy uncertainty indices, significantly increase crude-oil returns only during certain periods of time. That is, we find a positive dependence prior to the financial crisis and Great Recession. Interestingly, estimation of the copula over the entire sample period leads to a negative dependence between the equity and economic policy indices and the crude-oil return.
Q31|Assessing market structures in resource markets — An empirical analysis of the market for metallurgical coal using various equilibrium models|The prevalent market structures found in many resource markets consist of high concentration on the supply side and low demand elasticity. Market results are therefore frequently assumed to be an outcome of strategic interaction between producers. Common models to investigate the market outcomes and underlying market structures are games representing competitive markets, strategic Cournot competition and Stackelberg structures that take into account a dominant player acting first followed by one or more players. We add to the literature by expanding the application of mathematical models and applying an Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC), which is used to model multi-leader–follower games, to a spatial market. Using our model, we investigate the prevalent market setting in the international market for metallurgical coal between 2008 and 2010, whose market characteristics provide arguments for a wide variety of market structures. Using different statistical measures to compare model results with actual market outcomes, we find that two previously neglected settings perform best: First, a setting in which the four largest metallurgical coal exporting firms compete against each other as Stackelberg leaders, while the remainders act as Cournot followers. Second, a setting with BHPB acting as sole Stackelberg leader.
Q31|The price and income elasticities of natural gas demand: International evidence|Natural gas contributes a growing share of the world's energy mix. In this paper we use national-level data for a sample of 44 countries to estimate the price and income elasticities of natural gas demand. We present both single-equation results and results instrumenting natural gas prices with proved natural gas reserves. Our instrument includes both domestic reserves and distance-weighted reserves in other countries. We obtain estimates of the average long-run price elasticity of natural gas demand of around −1.25 and of the average long-run income elasticity of natural gas demand of +1 and higher. We also present separate estimates for final natural gas demand by industry and households.
Q31|Stationarity changes in long-run energy commodity prices|Situated at the intersection of the literatures on speculative storage and non-renewable commodity scarcity, this paper considers whether changes in persistence have occurred in long-run U.S. prices of the energy commodities crude oil, natural gas and bituminous coal. We allow for a structural break when testing for a break in persistence to avoid a change in the stochastic properties of prices being confounded by an unaccounted-for deterministic shift in the price series. We find that coal prices are trend stationary throughout their evolution and that oil prices change from stationarity to non-stationarity in the decade between the late 1960s to late 1970s. The result on gas prices is ambiguous. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for a possible structural shift when testing for breaks in persistence, while being robust to the exact date of the structural break. Based on our analysis we caution against viewing long-run energy commodity prices as being non-stationary and conclude in favor of modeling commodity market fundamentals as stationary, meaning that speculative storage will tend to have a dampening effect on prices. We also cannot reject that long-run prices of coal and, with some hesitation, gas follow a Hotelling-type rule. In contrast, we reject the Hotelling rule for oil prices since the late 1960s/early 1970s.
Q31|Imperfect cartelization in OPEC|A model of global oil production is applied to study cartelization by OPEC countries. We define a measure for the degree of cooperation, analogous to the market conduct parameter of Cyert et al. (1973), Geroski et al. (1987), Lofaro (1999), and Symeonidis (2000). This parameter is used to assess the incentives of different OPEC members to collude. We find that heterogeneity in OPEC and the supplies of the non-OPEC fringe create strong incentives against collusion. More specifically, OPEC's supply strategy, although observed to be substantially more restrictive than that of a Cournot–Nash oligopoly, is found to still be more accommodative than that of a perfect cartel. The strategy involves allocating larger than proportionate quotas to smaller and relatively costlier producers, as if to bribe their participation in the cartel. This is in contrast to predictions of the standard cartel model that such producers should be allocated relatively more stringent quotas. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cartel collusion is more likely to be sustained for elastic than for inelastic demand. Since global oil demand is well known to be inelastic, this observation provides another structural explanation for why OPEC behavior is inconsistent with that of a perfect cartel. Our study points to multiple headwinds that limit OPEC's ability to mark up the oil price.
Q31|Forecasting spot oil price in a dynamic model averaging framework — Have the determinants changed over time?|This paper is aimed on the analysis of monthly spot oil prices (WTI) between 1986 and 2015. The methodology is based on Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA) and Dynamic Model Selection (DMS) framework. The important feature of DMA method is an allowance for both time-varying coefficients and large state space model (i.e., the set of oil price determinants can change in time). Within this framework it was explicitly shown how the significance of oil price determinants vary in time. These determinants itself were chosen with respect to some previous studies. Contrary to the currently reported DMA applications in some other fields, no significant evidence was found that DMA is superior over, for example, ARIMA model. However, DMA could also not been rejected as a significantly worse model due to certain statistical tests. The performed DMA analysis was checked for robustness on various model parameters and for certain computational issues.
Q31|Supply and demand determinants of natural gas price volatility in the U.K.: A vector autoregression approach|Since 2008, the U.K. natural gas market has witnessed a marked drop in volatility. This fall has coincided with specific events in oil and gas sector such as the onset of the U.S. “shale gas revolution” and the subsequent rerouting of liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments from the U.S. to other markets such as Asia and Europe. LNG cargoes, along with other sources of flexibility such as underground storages and interconnector import, can potentially reduce volatility. On the other hand, demand shocks can increase volatility. To examine the dynamics relationship between daily shocks in U.K. gas demand and supply, and the gas spot price volatility, we use a vector autoregressive (VAR) model. While we find evidence that daily deviations in aggregated gas demand significantly impacts volatility, we are unable to find direct evidence for an impact from shocks in disaggregated demand or supply. In fact, one important contribution of the paper is to suggest that flexible sources of supply such as LNG, storage and interconnector flows react to shocks in retail demand, dampening their potential effects on volatility.
Q31|Assessing global fossil fuel availability in a scenario framework|This study assesses global, long-term economic availability of coal, oil and gas within the Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) scenario framework considering alternative assumptions as to highly uncertain future developments of technology, policy and the economy. Diverse sets of trajectories are formulated varying the challenges to mitigation and adaptation of climate change. The potential CO2 emissions from fossil fuels make it a crucial element subject to deep uncertainties. The analysis is based on a well-established dataset of cost-quantity combinations that assumes favorable techno-economic developments, but ignores additional constraints on the extraction sector. This study significantly extends the analysis by specifying alternative assumptions for the fossil fuel sector consistent with the SSP scenario families and applying these filters (mark-ups and scaling factors) to the original dataset, thus resulting in alternative cumulative fossil fuel availability curves. In a Middle-of-the-Road scenario, low cost fossil fuels embody carbon consistent with a RCP6.0 emission profile, if all the CO2 were emitted freely during the 21st century. In scenarios with high challenges to mitigation, the assumed embodied carbon in low-cost fossil fuels can trigger a RCP8.5 scenario; low mitigation challenges scenarios are still consistent with a RCP4.5 scenario.
Q31|Dynamic spillovers between Shanghai and London nonferrous metal futures markets|This paper examines the dynamic return and volatility spillovers between the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SFE) and the London Metal Exchange (LME) from 2007 to 2016 using the new spillover index of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). Our results indicate that the LME nonferrous metal futures have a greater impact on SFE nonferrous metal futures. In particular, these trends are more pronounced in the aftermath of the recent financial crises, indicating the strength of spillovers during periods of turmoil. The direction of spillovers significantly depends on time variation.
Q31|Global trade impacts of increasing Europe's bioenergy demand|European governments are rapidly turning to biomass to comply with the EU's legislated renewable energy targets for 2020 and 2030. To do so, EU member states will likely have to increase imports of biomass from timber rich regions, which will undoubtedly disrupt international wood product markets. In this study, a static global forest trade model of coniferous wood products is used to examine the effects of expanded demand for wood pellets in Europe to generate reliable electricity. Positive mathematical programming (PMP) is used to calibrate the model to 2012 bilateral trade flows. To assess the impact of increased wood-pellet demand on global forest products, we consider a scenario where EU demand for wood pellets doubles. Model results suggest increases in the world prices of industrial roundwood (1%), particleboard ($34/m3), fibreboard ($30/m3), pulp ($65/t) and pellets (71% to 128%), while the prices of sawnwood and plywood & veneer are projected to fall by $12/m3 and $4/m3, respectively. The gains and losses are unevenly distributed between timber rich and timber poor regions; Russia, Canada and the U.S. experience large net welfare gains of $706 million, $544 million and $416 million, respectively, while Asia loses $1.8 billion. In the forest products sector, the gains outweigh losses with economic benefits increasing by some $4.9 billion, but this is a cost to the consumers of electricity and/or taxpayers in the regions implementing these renewable energy policies. The price of wood pellets is projected to rise between $107 and $154 per tonne. The findings highlight the need to account for the interconnections among softwood forest products globally.
Q31|Optimal timing of carbon capture policies under learning-by-doing|Using a standard Hotelling model of resource exploitation, we determine the optimal energy consumption paths from three options: dirty coal, which is non-renewable and carbon-emitting; clean coal, which is also non-renewable but carbon-free thanks to carbon capture and storage (CCS); and solar energy, which is renewable and carbon-free. We assume that the atmospheric carbon stock cannot exceed an exogenously given ceiling. Taking into account learning-by-doing in CCS technology, we show the following results: (i) clean coal exploitation cannot begin before the outset of the carbon constrained phase and must stop strictly before the end of this phase; (ii) the energy price path can evolve non-monotonically over time; and (iii) when the solar cost is low enough, an unusual energy consumption sequence along with solar energy is interrupted for some time and replacement by clean coal may exist.
Q31|Second-best carbon taxation in the global economy: The Green Paradox and carbon leakage revisited|Acceleration of global warming resulting from a future carbon tax is large if the price elasticities of oil demand are large and that of oil supply is small. The fall in the world interest rate weakens this weak Green Paradox effect, especially if intertemporal substitution is weak. Still, social damages from greenhouse gases drop if the fall in oil supply and cumulative emissions is strong enough. If the current carbon tax is set too low, the second-best future carbon tax is set below the first best too to mitigate adverse Green Paradox effects. Unilateral second-best optimal carbon taxes exceed the first-best taxes due to an import tariff component. The intertemporal terms of trade effects of the future carbon tax increase current and future tariffs and those of the current tax lower the current tariff. Finally, carbon leakage and globally altruistic and unilateral second-best optimal carbon taxes if non-Kyoto oil importers price carbon too low are analysed in a three-country model of the global economy.
Q31|Assessing the EU ETS with an Integrated Model|The European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is the main instrument of the European Union (EU) against climate change. This mechanism is considered, from the theoretical point of view, as the most cost-effective method to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG). However, previous studies show that the agents who participate in these markets can behave in a way which may lead to inefficient CO 2 prices, creating doubts about the effectiveness of the system. This paper analyzes these possible anomalies by modeling the EU ETS under a rational market hypothesis and comparing the results with real market transactions. For this, we have built a bottom-up model, which represents the EU ETS in an integrated way, paying particular attention to the interactions among the most emissions intensive industries. The results show the benefits of this integrated modeling approach and how it better reflects real market conditions. We also present some preliminary conclusions regarding the behavior of the agents in the ETS market.
Q31|What drives commodity price booms and busts?|What drives commodity price booms and busts? We provide evidence on the dynamic effects of commodity demand shocks, commodity supply shocks, and inventory demand shocks on real commodity prices. In particular, we analyze a new data set of price and production levels for 12 agricultural, metal, and soft commodities from 1870 to 2013. We identify differences in the type of shock driving prices of the various types of commodities and relate these differences to commodity types which reflect differences in long-run elasticities of supply and demand. Our results show that demand shocks strongly dominate supply shocks.
Q31|The Green Paradox and Interjurisdictional Competition across Space and Time|This paper demonstrates that unintended effects of climate policies (Green Paradox effects) also arise in general equilibrium when countries compete for mobile factors of production (capital and resources/energy). Second, it shows that countries have a rationale to use strictly positive source-based capital taxes to slow down resource extraction. Notably, this result comes about in the absence of any revenue requirements by the government, and independently of the elasticity of substitution between capital and resources in production. Third, the paper generalizes the results obtained by Eichner and Runkel (2012) by showing that the Nash equilibrium entails inefficiently high pollution.
Q31|Unilateral Climate Policies: Incentives and Effects|Abstract We analyze the effect of climate policies using a two-region partial equilibrium model of resource extraction. The regions are heterogeneous in various aspects, such as in their climate policies and resource extraction costs. We obtain analytical and numerical conditions for a Green Paradox to occur as a consequence of a unilateral increase in carbon taxation and backstop subsidy. In order to assess the welfare and climate consequences of unilateral policy changes, we calibrate the model to real world parameter values. We find that forming a ‘climate coalition’ and introducing carbon taxation even in the absence of real climate concerns is the best course of action for the largest fossil fuel-using regions.
Q31|Non-cooperative and Cooperative Responses to Climate Catastrophes in the Global Economy: A North–South Perspective|Abstract The optimal response to a potential productivity shock which becomes more imminent with global warming is to have carbon taxes to curb the risk of a calamity and to accumulate precautionary capital to facilitate smoothing of consumption. This paper investigates how differences between regions in terms of their vulnerability to climate change and their stage of development affect the cooperative and non-cooperative responses to this aspect of climate change. It is shown that the cooperative response to these stochastic tipping points requires converging carbon taxes for developing and developed regions. The non-cooperative response leads to a bit more precautionary saving and diverging carbon taxes. We illustrate the various outcomes with a simple stylized North–South model of the global economy.
Q31|Wealth Effects of Rare Earth Prices and China’s Rare Earth Elements Policy|Abstract Rare earth elements (REEs) have become increasingly important because of their relative scarcity and worldwide increasing demand, as well as China’s quasi-monopoly of this market. REEs are virtually not substitutable, and they are essential for a variety of high-tech products and modern key technologies. This has raised serious concerns that China will misuse its dominant position to set export quotas in order to maximize its own profits at the expense of other rare earth user industries (wealth transfer motive). In fact, export restrictions on REEs were the catalyst for the U.S. to lodge a formal complaint against China in 2012 at the World Trade Organization (WTO). This paper analyzes possible wealth transfer effects by focusing on export quota announcements (the so-called MOFCOM announcements) by China, and the share price reactions of Chinese REE suppliers, the U.S. REE users, and the rest of the world REE refiners. Overall, we find limited support for the view of a wealth transfer in connection with MOFCOM announcements only when disentangling events prior to and post the initiation of the WTO trial, consistent with the trial triggering changes to China’s REE policy and recent announcement to abolish quotas. We do find, however, that extreme REE price movements have a first-order effect on all companies in the REE industry consistent with recent market trends to enable hedging against REE price volatility.
Q31|Peter Murphy, Universities and Innovation Economies: The Creative Wasteland of Post-Industrial Society|This is a brilliant, indeed an indispensable book. It provides a compelling diagnosis of the decline and failure of the contemporary bureaucratic and managerially governed university, the post-industrial-bureaucratic driven economy, and the social-liberal-democratic-bureaucratic state. It deals with matters that those of us who work in universities, particularly in Australia and the United Kingdom (US universities are still far less centralized), and who know from the inside that so much of what has happened over the last thirty years or so has pretty well destroyed the university as a place for reading, reflection, discussion, dispute, deliberation, and inventive imaginative responses to what are thrown up by the spirits of the times. But what makes the book truly remarkable is the thoroughness of the diagnosis and the mountains of evidence that the book marshals to make its case. Moreover, both the diagnosis and the evidence that is summoned to confirm the diagnosis could only have been made by someone who effortlessly moves between the disciplinary compartmentalisations, which, when kept separate, only serve to dilute any diagnosis of the nature of the problems and the forces and interests that conspire not only to create the problems but, sadly, to make then insoluble. Murphy is, to use one of those buzz-words that usually smacks of ‘bureaucratise’, ‘multi-skilled’ - precisely because he exemplifies that combination that is, sadly, all too rarely to be found, let alone nurtured in universities today: he is a real scholar, a prodigious researcher, and an inventive thinker.
Q31|The Environmental Cost of Global Fuel Subsidies|Despite increasing calls for reform many countries continue to provide subsidies for gasoline and diesel. This paper quantifies the external costs from global fuel subsidies using the latest available data and estimates from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Under preferred assumptions about supply and demand elasticities, current subsidies cause $44 billion in external costs annually. This includes $8 billion from carbon dioxide emissions, $7 billion from local pollutants, $12 billion from traffic congestion, and $17 billion from accidents. These external costs are in addition to conventional deadweight loss, estimated to be $26 billion annually. Government incentives for alternative fuel vehicles are unlikely to cost-effectively reduce these externalities as they do little to address traffic congestion or accidents and only indirectly address carbon dioxide and local pollutants.
Q31|Unilateral Supply Side Policies and the Green Paradox|This paper deals with possible foreign reactions to unilateral carbon supply reducing policies. It differentiates between demand and supply side reactions as well as between intra- and intertemporal shifts of greenhouse gas emissions. Ritter & Schopf (2014) integrate stock-dependent marginal physical extraction costs into Eichner & Pethig’s (2011) general equilibrium carbon leakage model. Using this model, we change the policy instrument from an emissions trading scheme to a deposit preserving system. The results are as follows: Under similar conditions than those derived by Ritter & Schopf (2014), the weak green paradox and the strong green paradox arise. In case of acting today, these conditions are tightened due to the energy market channel of carbon leakage. In case of acting tomorrow, the change in the physical user cost of extraction additionally influences the effectiveness of the carbon supply reducing policies. In both cases, it can be more effective to preserve the deposits with the lowest marginal physical extraction costs first.
Q31|Economic Valuation of Sand and Gravel in Davao del Norte, Philippines|The study aims to quantify the economic value of the sand and gravel which is deemed as a non-renewable resource. A survey was conducted to extract the consumer surplus of the households, also construct the demand equation for the resource. With the demand equation for sand and gravel at , the consumer surplus was estimated at P8271. Using the economic valuation technique, the economic value of sand and gravel was estimated at P729,568,368. Thus, a very high value imputed on the environmental resource. The survey showed that 82% of the population in Davao del Norte is amenable for a policy to regulate sand and gravel extraction. With the new valuation measure of the sand and gravel, a new price may be introduced at price range between P125-P225 per cubic meter. The new price is set to be used as payment for environmental services and compensation projects at the quarry sites. Also, the cost structures of permitees in Davao del Norte are too low compared to the operators in Compostela Valley, Davao Oriental and Davao City. The cost of operation in Davao del Norte is approximately 18% of the cost in Davao Oriental and 20% of the cost of Compostela Valley. The cost differences are largely due to the permit cost which is cheaper in Panabo and Tagum than in other areas. This is suggestive that the permitees may likely absorb the cost rather than transfer operation given their high producer surplus value.
Q31|The Impact of a People’s Republic of China Slowdown on Commodity Prices and Detecting the Asymmetric Responses of Economic Activity in Asian Countries to Commodity Price Shocks|The recent slowdown of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has led to question to what extent the PRC demand of commodities can have an impact on commodity prices. We take into account the fact that commodity prices are characterized by structural breaks, and to this end we make use of novel econometric procedures incorporating the Flexible Fourier Form when testing for causal relations between the PRC slowdown and commodity prices. We find varying degrees of response of the PRC slowdown on different commodity prices. Further, this study determines whether the economic growth in selected developing and emerging Asian countries that are heavily dependent on commodities respond in an asymmetric manner to positive commodity price shocks as opposed to negative price shocks. Adopting a structural dynamic regression and censoring positive and negative shocks, we find limited evidence of any asymmetric response of economic activity to positive and negative commodity price shocks.
Q31|Limit Pricing, Climate Policies, and Imperfect Substitution|The effects of climate policies are often studied under the assumption of perfectly competitive markets for fossil fuels. In this paper, we allow for monopolistic fossil fuel supply. We show that, if fossil and renewable energy sources are perfect substitutes, a phase will exist during which the monopolist chooses a limit pricing strategy. If limit pricing occurs from the beginning, a renewables subsidy increases initial extraction, whereas a carbon tax leaves initial extraction unaffected. However, if initially fossil fuels are cheaper than renewables, a renewables subsidy and a carbon tax lower initial extraction, contrary to the case of perfect competition. Both policy instruments lower cumulative extraction. If fossil fuels and renewables are imperfect but good substitutes, the monopolist will exhibit ‘limit pricing resembling’ behavior, by keeping the effective price of fossil close to that of renewables for considerable time. The empirical question whether energy demand is elastic or inelastic has less drastic implications for the fossil price and extraction paths than under perfect substitutability.
Q31|The Chinese Food Industry: development, constraints and policies|"Given the phenomenon of growing urbanization, the pressure on food demand for a rising population as well as changing diets, China has had to resort to imports, becoming a net importer of food. In absence of external flows, this scenario is set to continue and could then materialize in a future Malthusian scenario. Improved efficiency and productivity, reform of land use rights, but also the policy of ""going out"" or land grabbing are some of the plausible strategies that the country could improve to avoid an inexorable stabilization or, at worst, a decline in domestic production, as well taking into account the impact of climate change on agricultural commodities. Starting from these premises, the paper aims to analyze the existing scenario identifying constrains and policies that could prevent the development of the Chinese food industry."
Q31|Buy coal for preservation and act strategically on the fuel market|In Harstad’s (2012) model, climate damage only hits one group of countries, called the coalition, and the coalition’s climate policy consists of capping own fuel de- mand and supply combined with the purchase of fossil fuel deposits for preserva- tion. Harstad’s Theorem 1 states that if the deposit market clears the coalition’s strategic fuel-cap policy implements the ﬁrst-best. The present paper reconstructs that eﬃciency result and argues that the deposit market equilibrium as deﬁned in Harstad (2012) fails to be attained, unless the non-coalition countries act cooper- atively on the deposit market. Without such cooperation, the coalition’s strategic action on the fuel market distorts the allocation to its own favor.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q31|The workforce composition of young firms and product innovation: Complementarities in the skills of founders and their early employees|We investigate the extent to which complementarities between technical and business skills of founders and employees matter for the generation of market novelties by new ventures. Using data about German start-ups, we find that there are no complementarities between technical and business skills within the group of founders, but that there are significant complementarities between technically trained founders and employees who have business skills. This suggests that the innovation potential of start-ups by technically trained founders is best explored by hiring employees who are trained in business. However, a reverse relationship does not exist: There are no complementarities between founders with business skills and employees with technical skills.
Q31|A Functional Approach to Test Trending Volatility: Evidence of Trending Volatility in the Price of Mexican Agricultural Products| In this paper we extend the traditional ARCH(1) model by including a functional trend term in the conditional volatility of a time series. We derive the main properties of the model and apply it to all agricultural commodities in the Mexican CPI basket for three different time periods that implied changes in price regulations an behavior: pre-NAFTA (1987-1993), post-NAFTA (1994-2005)and commodity supercycle (2006-2014). The proposed model seems to adequately fit the volatility process and also outperforms, in the short run, the ARCH(1) and GARCH(1,1) models, some of the most popular approaches used in the literature to analyze price volatility. Our results show that, consistent with anecdotal evidence, price volatility trends of fruits and vegetables increased from the period 1987-1993 to 1994-2005, whereas they decreased for livestock products. From 1994-2005 to 2006-2014, fruits and vegetable trends decreased, whereas they increased for livestock products. Additionally, we identify some agricultural products that, due to their increasing price volatility trends, may present a risk for food inflation in the short run.
Q31|Do nonrenewable-energy prices affect renewable-energy volatility? The case of wood pellets|Over the past decade, the U.S. Southeast has experienced a rapid expansion of wood-pellet biomass production for European export. This renewable wood-pellet supply requires nonrenewable-energy inputs in its manufacturing and logistics, which suggests possible price-volatility spillovers between renewable and nonrenewable markets. A BEKK-MGARCH model is employed for investigating these possible price-volatility spillovers. Overall, results suggest a limited negative effect of past volatile nonrenewable-energy prices influencing current wood-pellet price volatility. Specifically, high volatilities in nonrenewable-energy prices do not affect the volatility of wood-pellet prices. Thus, any stability concerns in terms of nonrenewable-input prices affecting the wood-pellet market are not warranted.
Q31|El choque petrolero y sus implicaciones en la economía colombiana|La economía colombiana se ha visto impactada por la fuerte caída en la cotización internacional del petróleo, la cual se caracterizó por ser sorpresiva, acelerada y de magnitud considerable. Según los analistas, este choque podría ser persistente y extenderse por varios años. Sumado a lo anterior, el volumen de producción de hidrocarburos en el territorio nacional también podría caer, como resultado de la menor inversión en el sector ante los bajos precios del crudo. El presente documento hace un análisis descriptivo del choque petrolero reciente y de sus determinantes, así como de sus implicaciones para la economía colombiana. A la fecha, el desplome de los precios ha afectado los términos de intercambio del país y con ello el ingreso nacional, impactando las cuentas externas y la tasa de cambio, las finanzas públicas, la confianza de los mercados y el riesgo país. Lo anterior se ha traducido en una significativa desaceleración de la actividad económica. La respuesta de política económica ha sido coherente con un sólido marco institucional previamente establecido, que ha propiciado un ajuste ordenado de la economía a las nuevas circunstancias externas. Entre las características más importantes de dicho marco de política se destacan un régimen de inflación objetivo con flexibilidad cambiaria, una regla fiscal para el Gobierno Nacional y una política macro-prudencial que aboga por la estabilidad financiera. ****** The Colombian economy has been hit by the sharp fall of international oil prices, which was characterized for being unexpected, sudden and of considerable magnitude. According to analysts, this shock could be persistent and last for several years. On top of that, the volume of oil production in the country could also decrease due to a fall of investment in the sector in the context of lower oil prices. This document aims to provide a descriptive analysis of the recent oil shock, its determinants, and their implications for the Colombian economy. To date, falling oil prices have deteriorated the country's terms of trade and thus, its national income. Other key variables such as the current account, the exchange rate, the public finance, market’s confidence and the country risk premium have also been affected. As a result, a significant economic slowdown is taking place. The economic policy response has been coherent with a sound institutional framework previously established, which has encouraged an orderly adjustment to the new external circumstances. Among the key elements of such framework it is worth mentioning an inflation-targeting scheme with flexible exchange rate, a fiscal rule for the central Government, and a macro-prudential policy aiming at preserving financial stability.
Q31|Optimum Commodity Taxation with a Non-Renewable Resource|Optimum commodity taxation theory asks how to raise a given amount of tax revenue while minimizing distortions. We reexamine Ramsey's inverse elasticity rule in presence of Hotelling-type non-renewable natural resources. Under standard assumptions borrowed from the non-renewable-resource-extraction and from the optimum-commodity-taxation literatures, we show that a non-renewable resource should be taxed in priority whatever its demand elasticity and whatever the demand elasticity of regular commodities. It should also be taxed at a higher rate than other commodities having the same demand elasticity and, while the tax on regular commodities should be constant, the resource tax should vary over time. The appropriate taxation rule depends on the government's revenue needs; the higher these needs, the closer the consumer price to the monopoly price. Reserves are a form of capital and royalties tax its income; our results contradict Chamley's conclusion that capital should not be taxed at all in the very long run. When reserves to be extracted are responsive to the taxation of extraction, in the absence of any subsidy to reserve discoveries, the optimal tax rate on extraction obeys an inverse elasticity rule almost identical to that of a commodity whose supply is perfectly elastic. As a matter of fact, there is a continuum of optimal combinations of extraction taxes and subsidies. When the government cannot commit, extraction rents are completely expropriated and subsidies are maximum. In general the optimum Ramsey tax not only causes a distortion of the extraction path, as happens when reserves are given, but also distorts the level of reserves developed for extraction. When that distortion is the sole effect of the tax, it is determined by a rule reminiscent of the inverse elasticity rule applying to elastically-supplied commodities. La taxation optimale des biens cherche à lever des revenus fiscaux donnés en minimisant les distorsions. Nous réexaminons la règle de l'élasticité inverse de Ramsey en présence de ressources non-renouvelables à la Hotelling. Sous les hypothèses standard des littératures de l'extraction des ressources non-renouvelables et de la taxation optimale, une ressource non-renouvelable doit être taxée en priorité, quelles que soient l'élasticité de sa demande et l'élasticité de la demande pour les autres biens. Elle doit l'être à un taux plus élevé qu'un autre bien dont la demande est aussi élastique et, contrairement au taux s'appliquant aux biens conventionnels, ce taux doit varier dans le temps. La taxe dépend des besoins en revenus fiscaux; plus ils sont élevés, plus le prix correspondant s'approche du prix de monopole. Les réserves minérales constituent une forme de capital que taxent les royalties; Chamley a montré qu'il est néfaste de taxer le capital à très long terme. Au contraire, même lorsque les réserves à extraire dépendent du traitement fiscal de l'extraction, en l'absence de toute subvention à l'exploration, le taux optimal de la taxe obéit à la même règle d'élasticité inverse que les biens conventionnels dont l'offre est parfaitement élastique. En fait, il y a une infinité de combinaisons optimales de taxes à l'extraction et de subventions à la constitution de réserves. Si le gouvernement n'est pas en mesure de s'engager à s'abstenir de taxer les producteurs, ces derniers sont entièrement expropriés et ce sont des subventions qui doivent financer la constitution de réserves. En général, la taxe optimale de Ramsey cause une distorsion tant sur le profil d'extraction (comme lorsque les réserves sont données) que sur le volume des réserves lorsque celles-ci sont endogènes. Lorsque cette dernière distorsion est le seul effet de la taxe, elle obéit à une règle proche de celle qui s'applique aux biens conventionnels dont l'offre est élastique.
Q31|Achieving Sustainable Energy Security: 2030 Outlook for ASEAN, People Republic of China and India|The rapid growth of ASEAN economies, the People’s Republic of China and India (called ACI henceforth) — major drivers of Asia and the world economy—during the last five decades has caused significant strains on their scarce resources, particularly energy and contributed to serious problems of energy security, environmental degradation and climate change. In coming decades, these economies are expected to witness high growth, lack of adequate traditional energy sources, high dependence on imported energy, heavy reliance on energy-intensive industries, and rising transportation demands. In the coming decades, their energy demand may create serious challenges in terms of energy security. Adopting sustainable and innovative management practices and policies for key resources such as energy and mitigating environment and climate change problems are among major common challenges for all the ACI economies. This paper examines primarily on the ACI’s sustainable energy security outlook until 2030 through an overview of the ACI’s energy resources, production mix, consumption mix, emissions of greenhouse gases, and the state of the development of renewable, clean and new energy. The paper projects the ACI’s energy demand and its impact on carbon dioxide emissions until 2030 under different policy scenarios using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) analysis. Furthermore, the paper evaluates ACI’s sustainable energy security situation through examining ACI’s energy self-sufficiency, dependence on imported energy, energy import diversification transportation security and energy infrastructure financing. Lastly it provides some policy recommendation to achieve sustainable energy security in ACI.
Q31|Der Ölpreis auf den Weltmärkten – ein Oligopolspiel mit ungewissem Ausgang|Seitdem sich im Lauf des letzten Jahres die Rohölpreise nahezu halbiert haben, wird viel darüber spekuliert, wie deren zukünftiger Verlauf sein könnte. In seinem Kommentar befasst sich Georg Erber, European Productivity Research Center, mit dem Einfluss der OPEC und der USA auf die Erdölpreise.
Q31|Kurz zum Klima: Rohstoffmärkte im »Superzyklus«|Dieser Artikel diskutiert die Gründe der aktuellen Preisverfälle auf Industrierohstoffmärkten, sowie deren volkswirtschaftliche Auswirkungen auf Deutschland und rohstoffexportierende Länder.
Q31|Status und Perspektiven der Kohle für die weltweite Energieversorgung|Nach Ansicht von Hans-Wilhelm Schiffer, World Energy Council, London, und Thomas Thielemann, RWE Power AG, Köln, sind der verstärkte Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien und die Nutzung von Kohle keine Gegensätze. Kohle sei ein Schlüsselfaktor für die Sicherheit der Energieversorgung und zudem kostengünstiger als andere Energien. Damit leiste sie einen entscheidenden Beitrag zur Bezahlbarkeit von Energie, zur Sicherung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Industrie und damit zur wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung. Aber auch unter dem Gesichtspunkt des Klimaschutzes sei ein Ersatz von Kohle durch Erdgas nicht zielführend. Zum Erreichen der Klimaziele der Staatengemeinschaft seien vielmehr, neben dem Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien und der fortgesetzten Steigerung der Energieeffizienz, die Nutzung fortgeschrittener Technologien auch bei Kohle unverzichtbar.
Q31|Kurz zum Klima: Zerrinnt uns der Sand zwischen den Fingern?|Sand als wichtiger Rohstoff ist durchaus begrenzt und kostbar. Deshalb ist ein umsichtiger und nachhaltiger Umgang mit ihm notwendig. Der Beitrag gibt einen kurzen Überblick über die Auswirkungen des exzessiven Sandabbaus, die von Verlusten bei der Biodiversität über negative Klimafolgen bis hin zu geopolitischen Konsequenzen reichen.
Q31|Petrodollar Recycling, Oil Monopoly, and Carbon Taxes|We identify a new general equilibrium transmission channel of climate policy on oil extraction, assuming an oil monopolist who accounts for the implications of oil supply on her capital asset returns. Policy-induced adjustments in asset holdings lead to postponement of extraction under a wide range of reasonable parameter settings: present extraction can drop considerably for a moderately high carbon tax. For endogenous exploration, a decrease in first-period extraction and in cumulative extraction at the same time is also possible. This contrasts with the literature on supply-side effects of climate policy which neglects these capital market implications. Concerns about carbon taxes arising from impeding climate-damaging supply reactions are alleviated, while taxing asset returns may induce acceleration of extraction.
Q31|The taxation of nonrenewable natural resources|We provide an analytical overview of the distortionary effects of some common forms of taxes faced by the nonrenewable resources sector of the economy. In the category of taxes meant specifically to capture the resource rent, we look at a specific severance tax, an ad valorem severance tax, a profit tax and a ‘lump-sum’ tax, with emphasis on their effects on the extraction decisions over time and on the initial reserves to be developed. In the category of taxes meant for all sectors of the economy, we look at the corporate income tax and its special provision for the resource sector in the form of a depletion allowance, with emphasis on the effects on the intra-industry resource extraction decisions and on the inter-industry allocation of investment.
Q31|El choque petrolero y sus implicaciones en la economía colombiana|La economía colombiana se ha visto impactada por la fuerte caída en la cotización internacional del petróleo, la cual se caracterizó por ser sorpresiva, acelerada y de magnitud considerable. Según los analistas, este choque podría ser persistente y extenderse por varios años. Sumado a lo anterior, el volumen de producción de hidrocarburos en el territorio nacional también podría caer, como resultado de la menor inversión en el sector ante los bajos precios del crudo. El presente documento hace un análisis descriptivo del choque petrolero reciente y de sus determinantes, así como de sus implicaciones para la economía colombiana. A la fecha, el desplome de los precios ha afectado los términos de intercambio del país y con ello el ingreso nacional, impactando las cuentas externas y la tasa de cambio, las finanzas públicas, la confianza de los mercados y el riesgo país. Lo anterior se ha traducido en una significativa desaceleración de la actividad económica. La respuesta de política económica ha sido coherente con un sólido marco institucional previamente establecido, que ha propiciado un ajuste ordenado de la economía a las nuevas circunstancias externas. Entre las características más importantes de dicho marco de política se destacan un régimen de inflación objetivo con flexibilidad cambiaria, una regla fiscal para el Gobierno Nacional y una política macro-prudencial que aboga por la estabilidad financiera.
Q31|Behavioral Determinants of Russian Nuclear State-Owned Enterprises in Central and Eastern European Region|Rosatom State Nuclear Corporation play a substantial role in the energy sector of the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region and the behavioral characteristics of the company forms the basis of this article. Rosatom is positioned as the dominant provider of nuclear technology and fuel supplies to the region, in large part stemming from the Soviet legacy in CEE countries. Compounding this challenge, nuclear energy is one of the major sources of power generation in CEE. Given the long-time, near monopoly of Russian nuclear technology/design in the region and plans to expand further the nuclear capacity of select CEE countries, the sector requires careful monitoring from both a technical and security-minded perspective.
Q31|International capital markets, oil producers and the Green Paradox|A rapidly rising carbon tax leads to faster extraction of fossil fuels and accelerates global warming. We analyze how general equilibrium effects operating through the international capital market affect this Green Paradox. In a two-region, two-period world with identical homothetic preferences and without investment, the global interest rate falls and the Green Paradox weakens. With investment or a relatively more impatient oil-importing region, the Green Paradox may be strengthened because the future oil demand function shifts downward or because the interest rate rises. If the oil-importing region is very much more patient than the oil-exporting region, the Green Paradox may be reversed but in our calibrated model the effects are tiny. With exploration and endogenous initial oil reserves, a future carbon tax lowers cumulative oil extraction in partial equilibrium. If the boost to current oil extraction is weakened, strengthened or reversed in general equilibrium, so is the fall in cumulative extraction. A partial and general equilibrium welfare analysis of a future carbon tax, both for full and partial exhaustion, is given. The effects of stock-dependent extraction costs are separately discussed in an Appendix.
Q31|Refining for export and the convergence of petroleum product prices|The petroleum refining industry has changed over the past decades from one in which capacity primarily served local and regional markets to one in which trade in refined petroleum products has become more widespread. We investigate the hypothesis of increasing globalization by examining the convergence of prices for refined products across different markets. Using data on refined products from market centers in the US and Europe, we test for convergence of prices using standard time-series techniques. The data plainly show that markets for refined petroleum products have become more interrelated as Europe exported its gasoline surplus and global demand for petroleum products approached refining capacity. Econometric evidence supports the hypothesis that the US and European markets for oil and refined products are integrated. We find evidence that a structural break during the financial crisis of 2008 changed the long-run equilibrium price relationships and the short-run price dynamics. Refined product markets are likely to experience continued globalization given trends in the United States and Europe and because of key export-oriented refining capacity investments made to take advantage of access to specific crude oil sources.
Q31|An assessment of optimal gas pricing in Russia: A CGE approach|Domestic gas prices in Russia are administratively regulated, and they are substantially lower than export netback prices. The administrative price regulation operates as an implicit subsidy on domestic gas consumption. The Russian government aims to liberalise domestic wholesale gas prices in the long term. While the “export netback parity” is defined as a political objective, it seems not to be a necessary target anymore. The export netback parity is not economically rational for Russia because the average export netback price of gas is higher than the marginal cost due to Gazprom's market power in export gas markets. An optimal domestic gas price is still not well-defined. This paper addresses this question by employing a comparative static, single-country, multi-sector Computable Generation Equilibrium model (CGE). The administrative regulation of domestic gas prices is explicitly modelled. The main findings are as follows. An increase in the domestic gas price provides economic efficiency gains: the more elastic the export and domestic demand for gas, the larger the welfare gains. The optimal domestic gas price should be approximately 55% of the export netback price. Increasing the domestic gas price provides additional government revenues, which can be used to reduce distortionary taxes. On sectoral effects, the structure of the Russian economy shifts from energy toward non-energy intensive sectors in response to an increase in the domestic gas price. There is an increase in the export supply of gas. Furthermore, an increase in the domestic gas price leads to a reduction in total CO2 emissions.
Q31|Boom or bust? Mapping out the known unknowns of global shale gas production potential|To assess the global production costs of shale gas, we combine global top-down data with detailed bottom-up information. Studies solely based on top-down approaches do not adequately account for the heterogeneity of shale gas deposits and hence, are unlikely to appropriately capture the extraction costs of shale gas. We design and provide an expedient bottom-up method based on publicly available US data to compute the levelized costs of shale gas extraction. Our results indicate the existence of economically attractive areas but also reveal a dramatic cost increase as lower-quality reservoirs are exploited. At the global level, our best estimate suggests that, at a cost of 6US$/GJ, only 39% of the technically recoverable resources reported in top-down studies should be considered economically recoverable. This estimate increases to about 77% when considering an optimistic recovery of resources but could be lower than 12% when considering pessimistic ones. The current lack of information on the heterogeneity of shale gas deposits as well as on the development of future production technologies leads to significant uncertainties regarding recovery rates and production costs. Much of this uncertainty may be inherent, but for energy-system planning purposes, with or without climate change mitigation policies, it is crucial to recognize the full ranges of recoverable quantities and costs.
Q31|The global markets for coking coal and iron ore — Complementary goods, integrated mining companies and strategic behavior|The global market for coking coal is linked to the global market for iron ore since both goods are complementary inputs in pig iron production. Moreover, international trade of both commodities is highly concentrated, with only a few large companies active on both input markets. Given this setting, the paper presented investigates the strategy of quantity-setting (Cournot) mining companies that own both a coking coal and an iron ore division. Do these firms optimize the divisions' output on a firm level or by each division separately (division-by-division)? First, using a theoretical model of two Cournot duopolies of complementary goods, we find that there exists a critical capacity constraint below/above at which firm-level optimization results in identical/superior profits compared with division-level optimization. Second, by applying a spatial multi-input equilibrium simulation model of the coking coal and iron ore markets, we find that due to the limited capacity firms gain no (substantial) additional benefit from optimizing output on a firm level.
Q31|The financial economics of gold — A survey|We review the literature on gold as an investment. We summarize a wide variety of literature, including the papers in this special issue of International Review of Financial Analysis to which this survey acts as an editorial introduction. We begin with a review of how the gold markets operate, including the underresearched leasing market; we proceed to examine research on physical gold demand and supply, gold mine economics and move onto analyses of gold as an investment. Additional sections provide context on gold market efficiency, the issue of gold market bubbles, gold's relation to inflation and interest rates, and the very nascent literature on the behavioural aspects of gold.
Q31|Convenience yield and inventory accessibility: Impact of regional market conditions|The theory of storage predicts that convenience yield and inventory level of the same commodity are in an inverse relationship. Conceptually, inventories which are readily accessible by market participants at a given location drive the perceived benefits of owning the physical commodity. The price hike observed in the global base metal markets especially during the pre- and post-global financial crisis period is largely attributed to an exponential consumption growth in Asian countries. Geographical location, according to our study, affects the explanatory power of inventories for changes in convenience yield perceived by market participants at a certain location. In particular, we use data for three different regions, namely, Asia, Americas and Europe, for six major base metals. We test whether one certain region explains the changes of convenience yield better than other regions. Our results indicate that the Asian region is more informative than other regions and thereby accessible inventories are likely to have a stronger impact on the perceived convenience yield.
Q31|Thorium: Crustal abundance, joint production, and economic availability|Recently, interest in thorium׳s potential use in a nuclear fuel cycle has been renewed. Thorium is more abundant, at least on average, than uranium in the earth׳s crust and, therefore, could theoretically extend the use of nuclear energy technology beyond the economic limits of uranium resources. This paper provides an economic assessment of thorium availability by creating cumulative-availability and potential mining-industry cost curves, based on known thorium resources. These tools provide two perspectives on the economic availability of thorium. In the long term, physical quantities of thorium likely will not be a constraint on the development of a thorium fuel cycle. In the medium term, however, thorium supply may be limited by constraints associated with its production as a by-product of rare earth elements and heavy mineral sands. Environmental concerns, social issues, regulation, and technology also present issues for the medium and long term supply of thorium.
Q31|What are metal prices like? Co-movement, price cycles and long-run trends|The dynamics of metal prices are not only highly relevant for consumers due to their extensive uses in various industries, but also for a number of producing countries. For these countries, export earning are often the main source of revenues. Therefore, the precise examination of metal prices, their long and short-run cyclical behavior, and their co-movement is essential for economic planing and forecasting purposes. This study examines the dynamics of 20 monthly price series of a variety of mineral commodities during the past 100 years. Compared to early studies, who are either restricted to the history of the recent 50–60 years or are based on yearly data frequency, this data set is a huge advantage. Co-movement, short-run cycles and super cycles are analyzed by means of common statistical methods and compared to the results in the literature. Findings suggest that metal prices do not necessarily follow similar patterns. Although a common pattern is discernible within certain metal groups such as precious metals and non-ferrous metals, other metal groups like electrical metals and steel alloys can show very different price dynamics with respect to co-movement and short-run price cycles. However, the results in the literature concerning super cycles (1910–1938, 1938–1968, 1968–1996, 1996–ongoing) can usually be confirmed for the data set in this study.
Q31|Forecasting the COMEX copper spot price by means of neural networks and ARIMA models|This paper examines the forecasting performance of ARIMA and two different kinds of artificial neural networks models (multilayer perceptron and Elman) using published data of copper spot prices from the New York Commodity Exchange, (COMEX). The empirical results obtained showed a better performance of both neural networks models over the ARIMA. The findings of this research are in line with some previous studies, which confirmed the superiority of neural networks over ARIMA models in relative research areas.
Q31|An assessment of mining efficiency in Turkish lignite industry|This article focuses on the mining activities of Turkish Coal Enterprises (TKI), the major lignite supplier in Turkey. First, we analyzed the lignite production and overburden removal activities of TKI from a historical perspective and then employed the Principle Component Analysis to build a mining efficiency index of TKI and investigated its historical development since the establishment of the company. We found that labor productivity and operational structure have been the most important factors, positively affecting the index. The current article makes two important contributions: (1) by using the most comprehensive data set available on TKI for the first time, and (2) by developing a Mining Efficiency Index (MEI), which can be used to analyze productivity in lignite mining activities in different countries.
Q31|Transparent and opaque pricing: The interesting case of lithium|Appreciating the pricing arrangements for a mineral and its compounds provides useful insight into the nature of its market and the industrial structure of its production. This paper focuses on the case of lithium, which has emerged from being a minor metal with limited profitable applications in 1950 to its glamour metal status some 65 years later. During this period bilateral contracts based on producer prices have been the major way in which prices have been negotiated. The entry of a major new producer (SQM) in the late 1990s led to a situation where price information was difficult to obtain, even though competition in the sector was growing. This is consistent with a movement from cooperative oligopoly to non-cooperative oligopoly. Growing price transparency since 2010 has been associated with the actual and projected entry of several new producers. With its continuing growth it seems inevitable that lithium will be formally traded on one of major metal exchanges within the next decade. In addition to this, the practice of transfer pricing between branches of established multinational producers also applies to the lithium industry.
Q31|Invention and Diffusion of Water Supply and Water Efficiency Technologies: Insights from a Global Patent Dataset|This paper identifies over 50,000 patents filed worldwide in various water-related technologies between 1990 and 2010, distinguishing between those related to availability (supply) and conservation (demand) technologies. Patenting activity is analyzed — including inventive activity by country and technology, international diffusion of such water-related technologies, and international collaboration in technology development. Three results stand out from our analysis. First, although inventive activity in water-related technologies has been increasing over the last two decades, this growth has been disproportionately concentrated on supply-side technologies. Second, whilst 80% of water-related invention occurs worldwide in countries with low or moderate water scarcity, several countries with absolute or chronic water scarcity are relatively specialized in water efficiency technologies. Finally, although we observe a positive association between water scarcity and local filings of water patents, some countries with high water availability, in particular Switzerland or Norway, nevertheless appear as significant markets for water-efficiency technologies. This suggests that drivers other than local demand, like regulation and social and cultural factors, play a role in explaining the global flows of technologies.
Q31|Fossil fuels, alternative energy and economic growth|We present a theoretical framework that incorporates energy within an endogenous growth model. The model explicitly allows for the interaction and substitution between fossil fuels, defined as a non-renewable resource derived from some fixed initial stock, and alternative energy, defined as renewable resource whose production requires capital input. The dynamics of the model depict a unique balance growth to a steady state. The saddle path of consumption temporarily peaks, when fossil fuels are plentiful and cheap, followed by a fall, as fossil fuel become more scarce and alternative energy production has yet to take over, until finally the steady state is reached where alternative energy production fuels the entire economy.
Q31|Should we extract the European shale gas? The effect of climate and financial constraints|In the context of the deep contrast between the shale gas boom in the United States and the recent ban by France of shale gas exploration, this paper explores whether climate policy justifies developing more shale gas, taking into account environmental damages, both local and global, and addresses the question of a potential arbitrage between shale gas development and the transition to clean energy. We construct a Hotelling-like model where electricity may be produced by three perfectly substitutable sources: an abundant dirty resource (coal), a non-renewable less polluting resource (shale gas), and an abundant clean resource (solar). The resources differ by their carbon contents and their unit costs. Fixed costs must be paid for shale gas exploration, and before solar production begins. Climate policy takes the form of a ceiling on atmospheric carbon concentration. We show that at the optimum tightening climate policy always leads to bringing forward the transition to clean energy. We determine conditions under which the quantity of shale gas extracted should increase or decrease as the ceiling is tightened. To address the question of the arbitrage between shale gas development and the transition to clean energy, we assume that the social planner has to comply to the climate constraint without increasing energy expenditures. We show that when the price elasticity of electricity demand is low, a binding financial constraint leads to an overinvestment in shale gas and postpones the switch to the clean backstop. We calibrate the model for Europe and determine whether shale gas should be extracted, depending on the magnitude of the local damage, as well as the potential extra amount of shale gas developed because of a financial constraint, and the cost of a moratorium on extraction
Q31|OPEC's market power: An empirical dominant firm model for the oil market|We estimate a dominant firm-competitive fringe model for the crude oil market using quarterly data on oil prices for the 1986–2016 period. The estimated structural parameters have the expected signs and are significant. We find that OPEC exercised market power during the sample period. Counterfactual experiments indicate that world GDP is the main driver of long-run oil prices. However, supply (depletion) factors have become more important in recent years.
Q31|Structural Changes in the Global Commodities Market|Commodities play an important part in the growth of the material production and in the world trade in goods and services. The access to raw materials is vital for sustaining the economic and social development of any country and for satisfying domestic demand for material goods. Increasing demand for commodities and the need for assuring a sustainable supply pose great challenges on the world economy. This paper is dealing with the main developments which occured during the last 15 years in the global commodity market, a major driver of the world economy, pointing out to the rapidly growing consumption, on the one hand, and the remarkable role played by China, an extremely dynamic economy, which has become by far the largest world consumer for such important commodities as aluminium, copper, nickel, meat, soybeans, on the other hand.
Q31|The Role of Carbon Capture and Sequestration Policies for Climate Change Mitigation|This paper takes the ‘policy failure’ in establishing a global carbon price for efficient emissions reduction as a starting point and analyzes to what extent technology policies can be a reasonable second-best approach. From a supply-side perspective, carbon capture and storage (CCS) policies differ substantially from renewable energy policies: they increase fossil resource demand and simultaneously lower emissions. We analyze CCS and renewable energy policies in a numerical dynamic general equilibrium model for settings of imperfect or missing carbon prices. We find that in contrast to renewable energy policies, CCS policies are not always capable of reducing emissions in the long run. If feasible, CCS policies can carry lower social costs compared to renewable energy policies, in particular when second-best policies are only employed temporally. In case fossil resources are abundant and renewable energy costs low, renewable energy policies perform better. Our results indicate that a pure CCS policy or a pure renewable energy policy carry their own specific risks of missing the environmental target. A smart combination of both, however, can be a robust and low-cost temporary second-best policy. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015
Q31|Determination of Wages and Exchange Rate with Game Theory|In every country, wages are determined by Nash rule or governments determine wages. According to Nash equilibrium, policy of determination wages is respect to exchange rate and there is a game between NWC and MAS. In this paper, we survey a game theory method to survey policy of determination wages and exchange rate to stability economics. When exchange rate increases, import good's price rise and we have cost push inflation, therefore wages are increased and then we have unemployment. Then wages are determined respect to exchange rate changes. But in real world, some conditions affected on Nash equilibrium and wages are determined as non Nash method and government equals between benefits of workers and principals. In this paper, we survey wage making in Iran and reveal that in some courtiers such as Iran, government determines wages and create equilibrium in labor market.
Q31|Should we extract the European shale gas? The effect of climate and financial constraints|In the context of the deep contrast between the shale gas boom in the United States and the recent ban by France of shale gas exploration, this paper explores whether climate policy justifies developing more shale gas, taking into account environmental damages, both local and global, and addresses the question of a potential arbitrage between shale gas development and the transition to clean energy. We construct a Hotelling-like model where electricity may be produced by three perfectly substitutable sources: an abundant dirty resource (coal), a non-renewable less polluting resource (shale gas), and an abundant clean resource (solar). The resources differ by their carbon contents and their unit costs. Fixed costs must be paid for shale gas exploration, and before solar production begins. Climate policy takes the form of a ceiling on atmospheric carbon concentration. We show that at the optimum tightening climate policy always leads to bringing forward the transition to clean energy. We determine conditions under which the quantity of shale gas extracted should increase or decrease as the ceiling is tightened. To address the question of the arbitrage between shale gas development and the transition to clean energy, we assume that the social planner has to comply to the climate constraint without increasing energy expenditures. We show that when the price elasticity of electricity demand is low, a binding financial constraint leads to an overinvestment in shale gas and postpones the switch to the clean backstop. We calibrate the model for Europe and determine whether shale gas should be extracted, depending on the magnitude of the local damage, as well as the potential extra amount of shale gas developed because of a financial constraint, and the cost of a moratorium on extraction.
Q31|Mining and Quasi-Option Value|We study the timing-of-extraction problem facing a decentralized mine owner when extraction entails environmental damage. As expected, when the environmental damage from mining is known, the socially optimal timing will depend on the magnitude of the damage relative to these costs in the rest of the world. But when environmental damage is uncertain, and these costs are revealed over time, a quasi-option value arises. We show that even if expected environmental costs are identical to those in the rest of the world, any uncertainty over these costs will cause the social planner to optimally delay mining until better information arrives. We show conditions under which it is optimal to postpone the mining decision indefinitely, and conditions when it is optimal to postpone only for a finite duration. The analysis leverages a crucial observation that distinguishes the non-renewable resource problem from the traditional quasi-option value framework. In the traditional framework, the presence of an irreversible investment and uncertainty can help nudge the decision maker to preserve an option, but it by no means implies the decision maker should always preserve the option. In contrast, for a non-renewable resource model, the arbitrage condition underpinning the Hotelling rule suggests that in the absence of uncertainty, the marginal mine owner is completely indifferent between mining immediately and at any point in the future. Thus, for our problem, any uncertainty will convince her to defer the mining decision.
Q31|Dynamics And New Challenges In The Global Commodity Market|Global economy and particularly the world production of goods depends to a large extent on the supply of raw materials, of resource inputs extracted from the environment as well as an easy access to them. Commodities play an important part in the growth of global production and in the world trade in goods and services. The access to raw materials is vital for sustaining the productive capacity of the economy and also for satisfying domestic demand for industrial goods. On the other side, increasing demand for commodities and the need for assuring a sustainable supply pose great challenges on the world economy. The issue of raw materials supply represents a high-priority theme in the political agenda of the European Union. The Raw Materials Initiative launched in 2008 by the European Commission is based on three main pillars: - to ensure the access to raw materials on world market at undistorted conditions; - to foster sustainable supply of raw materials from European sources; - to reduce the EU's consumption of primary raw materials. (EC, 2008). To this end, EC has started to take action in order to ensure access to resources and avoid supply shortages. A great deal of attention is being paid to the study of recent developments in the global and particular commodity markets, taking into consideration fundamental aspects as supply concentration, governance of producing countries, the pressure of demand and its impact on prices, material's substitutability, stressing the role of resource consumption efficiency, recycling and substitution of vital raw materials and thus providing policy makers and industry with reliable information on how to efficiently manage resource inputs. This paper is dealing with the main developments which occurred during the past decade or so in the global commodity market, a major driver of the world economy, with particular reference to selected key-markets - as: aluminium, copper, nickel; cotton; corn, meat-swine, rice, wheat, soybeans; oil - emphasizing the issue of price volatility and new challenges in the market.
Q31|Global Warming and the Green Paradox: A Review of Adverse Effects of Climate Policies|This article examines the possible adverse effects of well-intended climate policies, an outcome known as the Green Paradox. A weak Green Paradox arises if the announcement of a future carbon tax or a sufficiently fast rising carbon tax encourages fossil fuel owners to extract reserves more aggressively, thus exacerbating global warming. We argue that such policies may also encourage more fossil fuel to be locked in the crust of the earth, which can offset the adverse effects of the weak Green Paradox. We show that a subsidy on clean renewables may have similar weak Green Paradox effects. Green welfare (the converse of environmental damages) declines (i.e., the strong Green Paradox) if the beneficial climate effects of locking up more fossil fuel do not outweigh the short-run weak Green Paradox effects. Neither the weak nor the strong Green Paradox occurs for the first-best Pigouvian carbon tax. We also discuss dirty backstops, spatial carbon leakage, and green innovation.
Q31|Unilateral Carbon Taxation in the Global Economy: The Green Paradox and carbon leakage revisted|Unilateral, second-best carbon taxes are analysed in a two-period, two-country model with international trade in final goods, oil and bonds. The increase in oil demand and acceleration of global warming resulting from a future carbon tax are large if the price elasticities of oil demand are large and that of oil supply is small, but are attenuated by the fall in the world interest rate especially if intertemporal substitution is weak. Despite this Green Paradox effect, green welfare rises if the fall in oil exploration is strong enough. If the current carbon tax is too low, the second-best future carbon tax is set below the first best to mitigate adverse Green Paradox effects. Unilateral exceed first-best carbon taxes due to an import tariff component. The intertemporal terms of trade effects of the future carbon tax increase current and future tariffs and those of the current tax lower the current tariff. Unilateral taxes are time inconsistent. Finally, carbon leakage and globally altruistic and unilateral optimal carbon taxes if other oil importers do not price carbon are analysed in a three-country model of the global economy.
Q31|Price and Income Elasticities of Gasoline Demand in Iran: Using Static, ECM, and Dynamic Models in Short, Intermediate, and Long Run|Price and income elasticities of gasoline demand show whether the price policy, pursued by the Iranian government, can decrease the high gasoline consumption sufficiently or not. Since the two oil price shocks in 1970 and 1973, interest in the study of oil products demand has increased considerably, especially on gasoline. High gasoline consumption is a serious crisis in Iran, posing economically, politically, and environmentally threats. In this study, the elasticities are estimated over three intervals, short run, intermediate run, and long run in Iran during 1976-2010, by putting the estimates of Error Correction Model (ECM), static model, and dynamic model in an increasing order, respectively. The short run, intermediate run, and long run price elasticities are −0.1538, −0.1618, and −0.3612 and the corresponding income elasticities are 0.2273 - 0.3581, 0.4636, and 0.7284, respectively. Not only do these elasticities imply that the gasoline demand is price and income inelastic but also the adjustment velocity, estimated by ECM, is a low point at −0.1942. Based on the estimations, the gasoline demand responds to the changes of price and income slightly and slowly. Therefore, policy makers should develop more strategies to reduce gasoline consumption, for example, substitute goods, public transportation systems, and environmental standards settings
Q31|Mesures de compensation écologique : risques ou opportunités pour le foncier agricole ?| Compenser revient à équilibrer un effet par un autre : les mesures de compensation obligent un aménageur à compenser les effets négatifs de son projet. Deux types d’approches sont envisagées, la première est fondée sur la demande de compensation, dans ce cas l’aménageur cherche des surfaces sur lesquelles il pourra compenser son emprise ; la seconde est axée sur l’offre de compensation, dans cette approche un prestataire sécurisera des terrains, au moyen d’acquisition ou par des contrats durables. L’analyse de la règle du jeu et des modalités de mise en œuvre de la compensation écologique, permet de vérifier la cohérence de ces mesures avec les politiques foncières territorialisées. Les aspects fonciers et les notions d’anticipation et de concertation avec le monde agricole apparaissent comme les déterminants principaux de l’efficacité de ces mesure
Q31|Commodity and Food Speculation, Is There a Need for Regulation? A Discussion of the International Research|Much empirical research has already been conducted in order to analyze how speculation affects commodity and especially food prices. This paper examines the effects of speculation based on the most recent research. It is time to break with the innumerable studies examining the same material, yet always reaching different conclusions. Investigations using econometrics prove neither an influence of speculation on prices, nor the contrary. This paper explains however that speculation influences spot prices of commodities and food if it creates a significant excess demand over a significant time period. In this case speculation might be seen as harmful and unethical, why regulation should be discussed. JEL Classification: G13, Q11, Q31
Q31|Oil Security Issues in Asia and the Pacific|By 2010, demand for oil in developing Asia substantially exceeded that of North America and Europe combined, but demand for natural gas has been expanding rapidly and countries with large coal resources have used them instead of oil wherever possible. The goal of oil security is to make domestic economies and the international market adaptable to changes in availability and price. Increasing oil production and decreasing demand; producing more alternatives; and increasing stocks, fungibility, and market responsiveness augment security while subsidies diminish it. The threat today is not targeted cutoffs; it is price spikes, and strategic reserves can help counter them. Lack of specification restricts the free flow of petroleum products and therefore decreases regional energy security; fungibility would be greatly increased if there were some degree of standardization. In 2010, 76% of all Middle East exports went to Asia, but oil from the Middle East and Africa will not satisfy the growing Asian demand. Asian refining capacity cannot, however, cope with the large undeveloped resources in the Americas from super-heavy deposits or tar sands. A flourishing benchmark futures market east of Suez would help to ensure fair pricing and to moderate long-term price fluctuations.
Q31|Quantity-setting Oligopolies in Complementary Input Markets - the Case of Iron Ore and Coking Coal|This paper investigates the benefits of a merger when goods are complements and firms behave in a Cournot manner both in a theoretical model as well as in a real-world application. In a setting of two complementary duopolies a merger between two firms each producing one of the goods always increases the firms’ total profit, whereas the remaining firms are worse off. However, allowing for a restriction on one of the merging firms’ output, we proof that there exists a critical capacity constraint (i) below which the merging firms are indifferent to the merger, (ii) above which the merger is always beneficial and (iii) the lower the demand elasticity is the smaller this critical capacity constraint becomes. Using a spatial multi-input equilibrium model of the iron ore and coking coal markets, we investigate whether our theoretical findings may hold true in a real market as well. The chosen industry example is particularly well suited since (a) goods are complements in pig iron production, (b) each of the inputs is of little use in alternative applications, (c) international trade of both commodities is highly concentrated and (d) a few (large) firms are active in both input markets. We find that due to limited capacity, these firms gain no substantial extra benefit from optimising their divisions simultaneously.
Q31|External Effects of Hydraulic Fracturing: Risks and Welfare Considerations for Water Supply in Germany|In this paper, we investigate the externalities related to hydraulic fracturing (‘hydrofracking’) in Germany, based on a detailed analysis of hydrofracking risks and potentials, and a stylized social welfare analysis related to adverse impacts of unconventional gas production on both surface and ground water resources and water supply. Natural gas is extracted by a profit-maximizing monopolist. Society faces several kinds of negative externalities, including additional water purification costs. The results of our sensitivity analysis show that the maximized welfare is in any case higher than the welfare resulting from the profit-maximizing quantities, as is predicted by our model. Also, the regulator always has to pay a subsidy in order to maximize welfare, which shows that the monopolist has an incentive to exercise his market power in order to keep the prices up for profit maximization. The monopolist’s profits are always non-negative, whereas the welfare-maximizing shale gas production generally reduces his profits. As profits do not drop below zero, however, there is no need to employ a second-best approach. We conclude that increasing costs and/or an increasing price sensitivity will lead to reduced profits and to reduced social welfare, while for an increasing choke price it is the other way around.
Q31|Estimating the rebound effect of technological improvement in Iran?s industry sector|Rebound effect refers to the phenomenon that energy savings from improvement in energy efficiency are lower than expected due to unintended second-order effects. The main reason of improving energy efficiency is Technological improvement. According to Khazzoom formula, the rebound effect of improving technology is equal to price elasticity of demand so in this research natural gas demand function is estimated. In addition to the economic drivers (natural gas price, price of substituted energy factors, industry value added), there are number of exogenous factors that drive energy demand. This research therefore uses Structural Time Series Model to estimate natural gas demand in Iran`s industry sector during 1988 to 2009 and then Khazzoom rebound effect is calculated. Estimated short run and long run rebound effect in Iran`s industry sector are 63 percent and 133 percent respectively, with a generally increasing UEDT in a decreasing rate. UEDT has upward sloping but level of UEDT is fixed during the period of research so the model is ?smooth trend model?. Relating to the research findings improving technology in Iran`s industry sector reduces Natural gas consumption up to 37 percent in short run. But in long time period increases Natural gas consumption up to 133 percent. So in short run technological improvement can reduce consumption approximately but in long run price policy reform should be used simultaneously.
Q31|Asymetria relacji cen paliw płynnych w Polsce i cen ropy naftowej|Celem artykułu jest próba odpowiedzi na pytanie, czy w warunkach polskiego rynku paliwowego możemy mówić o istnieniu asymetrii w relacji między cenami paliw a cenami ropy naftowej, a więc sytuacji, w której ceny paliw zmieniają się szybciej, gdy cena surowca na światowym rynku wzrasta, niż gdy spada. W ramach weryfikacji powyższej hipotezy posłużono się analizą kointegracji, a następnie asymetrycznym modelem korekty błędem (Error Correction Model, ECM) oraz modelem ECM z relacją kointegrującą zdefiniowaną w postaci progowej autoregresji TAR (Threshold Autoregressive, TAR lub Momentum Threshold Autoregressive, MTAR). Otrzymane rezultaty pozwalają uznać za wysoce prawdopodobne, iż asymetryczny charakter relacji cen paliw z ceną ropy naftowej dotyczy gazu LPG i oleju napędowego, a nie dotyczy cen benzyny. Szczególnie w przypadku oleju napędowego widoczna jest niemal dwukrotnie szybsza reakcja na wzrost cen ropy naftowej, niż spadek cen surowca. Takie wyniki mogą być tłumaczone na tle różnic cenowych między cenami poszczególnych paliw oraz różnic w strukturze ich odbiorców. Benzyna to paliwo o najwyższym poziomie cen, dla konsumentów stanowi wyznacznik sytuacji na krajowym rynku paliwowym. Wzrost cen ropy naftowej na światowych rynkach obserwowany po 2004 r. przekładał się niemal w całości na coraz to wyższy poziom cen benzyny na stacjach paliw, co z kolei mogło wpłynąć na skłonność konsumentów do poszukiwania informacji na temat różnic cenowych między poszczególnymi sprzedawcami paliw. Sprzedawcy świadomi, iż wśród nabywców benzyny dominują głównie gospodarstwa domowe, mogą szybciej dostosowywać ceny benzyny do zmian zachodzących na rynku, niż w przypadku oleju napędowego, którego nabywcami są głównie podmioty gospodarcze.
Q31|OPEC and political considerations when deciding on oil extraction|Two oil price shocks changed the pattern of cheap oil. The first was the Arab embargo on oil exports in 1973. Oil prices rose five fold. In 1978, the second was the fall of Shah Iran. Prices soared to $80–$100 a barrel in today’s prices. In 1960, OPEC was established and since then it has been a considerable political and economic force in the oil market. Two thirds of the world’s oil reserves belong to OPEC members. OPEC is accused of being responsible for most of the price increases due to their production cuts and market power. This paper provides a general framework to examine the role of OPEC in affecting oil prices through the extracted quantities. A mathematical model is developed to explore the objective function of OPEC, which includes economic and political considerations. The idea is that OPEC members consider both the political support of their citizens and profits when determining oil extraction rates. This support is represented by a “harm function” which was added to the objective function of OPEC. The solution of the model lends some support for inclusion of this harm function, through which OPEC benefits from the cuts in production aimed at harming the western countries. For this harm function to be meaningful empirically, OPEC members should have a high harm indicator, α t . With high harm indicator values, OPEC harms itself financially. The results suggest that OPEC appears to be accepting considerable monetary setbacks to appease its citizens’ taste for harming the West. At different discount rates, the monetary losses range from about 10–20%. Solving the mathematical model required estimation of the residual demand that OPEC faces plus the cost function that applies to OPEC production. This paper reports the results of these estimations.

Q31|Social Network Effects and Green Consumerism|One of the drivers of green consumerism are social network externalities that are associated with buying 'green' because green consumerism is fashionable, or because of reputation effects. We analyze how the strength of this social network effect impacts green consumerism, environmental externalities and total welfare. We discuss a model where products are differentiated according to their environmental quality, where the production of green products generates positive externalities to all, and where those consumers purchasing a green product variety receive the additional benefits of being a member of the network of green consumers. Depending on the strength of the social network effect, we show that (a) firms may produce lower quality, (b) the market may generate fewer positive environmental externalities, and (c) total welfare may deteriorate. The main policy implication is that if there is a network effect, regulators should choose a stricter minimum environmental quality standard.
Q31|Optimal Timing of Carbon Capture and Storage Policies Under Learning-by-doing|"Using a standard Hotelling model of resource exploitation, we determine the optimal consumption paths of three energy resources: dirty coal, which is depletable and carbon-emitting; clean coal, which is also depletable but carbon-free thanks to an abatement technology (CCS: Carbon Capture and Storage), and solar energy which is renewable and carbon-free. Carbon emissions are released into the atmosphere and we assume that the atmospheric carbon stock cannot exceed a given ceiling. We consider learning-by-doing in the abatement technology, implying that the marginal CCS cost is decreasing in the cumulative consumption of clean coal. We show the following results. i) Learning-by-doing does not imply ""early"" capture, i.e. the clean coal exploitation must begin at the earliest once the carbon cap is reached. ii) The energy price path can evolve non-monotonically over time. iii) When the solar cost is low enough, there may exist unusual energy consumption sequence along which solar energy is interrupted for some time and replaced by clean coal."
Q31|An introduction to the economics of rare earths|The aim of this paper is to examine the supply risk of rare earths and its impact on low carbon technologies deployment. Bringing together seemingly disconnected strands of scientific literature, this multidisciplinary approach allows to provide an overarching overview of the economics of rare earths. In terms of supply risk, as opposed to the common belief, it is not Chinas dominant position per se, but its industrial policies which distort the rare earths market. On the demand side, the results of this paper disprove the widespread allegation that availability risk impedes deployment of offshore wind. Contrary to this, a potential supply shortage of rare earths would disrupt the further development of the automotive industry and its electrification. Ultimately, uncertainty about volatile prices and threat of supply shortages induce manufacturers to shift away from technologies containing rare earths, and thus render innovation in these economically nonviable.
Q31|Energy Transition to Renewables: Problems|What will come first ? non-acceptable global warming or extinction of oil reserves? Both processes can bring substantial costs to the mankind, but their order has important economic implications. The answer to this question will either lower oil price in the long run or will lead to its further rise. It is very important for Russian economy. From the global perspective, both dangers should be taken into account, and transition to renewable energies is the only remedy for both. However, the optimal speed of this transition depends on temporal dynamics of both threats that is highly uncertain at this moment. The goal of this paper is to review the problems with different renewable energies and to outlay different scenarios for the timing of major impact from global warming and oil peak. The problems with renewable energies have mostly economic origin. The global resources of hydropower are limited. While wind is already cheap, it should be balanced due to stochastic supply. Solar energy also needs to be balanced and is still relatively expensive. Oil products and their liquid renewable substitutes (biofuels) will thus remain an important compliment to electricity in the long run. However, biofuels are competing with agriculture for land, and thus can replace only a limited fraction of energy. The first signs of global warming bring the costs today and it comes as increased frequency of extreme weather phenomena (hurricanes, floods, etc). The rate of temperature increase has some range of uncertainty but it generally accepted that +2 degrees is an acceptable limit, and it might come in the middle of the 21st century. One of the policies to deal with it is not to extract all fossil fuels from the ground. However, it is highly likely that all oil will be extracted before global warming will have severe consequences. Since only biofuels can substitute oil in transport, given the current trend in transportation, peak oil can cause too much demand for biofuels, that will be dangerous for food security. Both the price of oil and biofuels would rise to such level, that current level of transportation will be impossible. This can cause resettlement of people to smaller cities. It is possible to conclude that while renewable energies represent a remedy, full transition will not be easy.
Q31|Ressourcenproduktivität - Indikatoren und Fortschritte|Bei der Bewertung des Ressourceneinsatzes in Deutschland spielt die Auswahl von Indikatoren eine wichtige Rolle. Veränderungen in der internationalen Arbeitsteilung wie eine verringerte Fertigungstiefe und eine über das Wirtschaftswachstum hinausgehende Steigerung des internationalen Handels lassen sich hierbei berücksichtigen. So kann der ursprüngliche Rohstoffeinsatz dem Land der letzten Verwendung und nicht dem produzierenden Land zugerechnet werden. Dies ist eine für Deutschland bedeutsame Korrektur. Die Daten zeigen für Deutschland – auch im Vergleich mit anderen EU-Ländern – nennenswerte Fortschritte bei der Ressourcenproduktivität. Die in der Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie der Bundesregierung von 2002 vorgesehene Verdopplung der Rohstoffproduktivität bis 2020 gegenüber 1994 wird jedoch schwer zu erreichen sein.
Q31|Dynamic market power in an exhaustible resource industry: The case of rare earth elements|This paper investigates China's capability to exert power on Rare Earth markets until 2020. A dynamic partial equilibrium model allowing for a disaggregated representation of the mining sector and endogenous investment in capacities is developed. The model is calibrated on a novel dataset on Rare Earth mines. Simulations show that Chinese market power is a transitory phenomenon. In 2014 and 2015, Light Rare Earth prices increase by 21 per cent and Heavy Rare Earth prices more than double compared to free trade, if assuming export restrictions to remain unchanged. Market power on Light Rare Earths vanishes almost completely by 2017 due to the entry of new suppliers, while it persists until 2019 for Heavy Rare Earths. Export restrictions imply a loss of Marshallian welfare of US$ 1.96 billion outside China. In the short run, even moderate cuts in export quotas can increase exerted market power substantially. Altering tariffs induces smaller but more persistent effects. Sensitivity checks indicate that the results are robust, but delayed opening of new mines and demand shocks can be important for China's capability to exert market power.

Q31|The Organizational Benefits Generated By The Membership To A Conglomerate Of Regional Clustering Type. The Implications Of ‘Rosia Montana Project‘ On Creating A Mining Cluster In The ‘Apuseni Mountains‘ Area From Romania|Starting from Michael Porter‘s statement, according to which the cluster, the simpleconcentration, pack or spatial, territorial agglomeration of SMEs, specialized in a field (service,product, knowledge) or interrelated areas, can generate sustainable competitive advantages in themarket (including global) in this sector of specialization, in this article I will try to address theissue regarding to the implementation of regional cluster concept and of sustainable regionaldevelopment in the ‘Apuseni Mountains‘ area, taking into account as nucleus the mining projectfrom Rosia Montana (Romania), which could represent a real lever and a good example forstimulating the mining industry competitiveness, both at regional and also at national level. Theidea of designing a regional cluster model, that has as ‘motor drive‘ the mining project from RosiaMontana, which otherwise should be like a point of ‘concentric radiance‘ in the purpose oflaunching of new economic activities and of developing of new specialized firms, could contributeto the increase of employment and of competitiveness of the companies in the region and implicitlyto the improvement of the life of communities in which the cluster will be implemented, bringingalso significant benefits to the Romanian state, both directly, but also indirectly through themultiplier effect and thus providing an example of good practice for other initiators of regionalclusters.
Q31|Cumulative Carbon Emissions and the Green Paradox|The green paradox states that a gradually more ambitious climate policy such as a renewables subsidy or an anticipated carbon tax induces fossil fuel owners to extract more rapidly and accelerate global warming. However, if extraction becomes more costly as reserves are depleted, such policies also shorten the fossil fuel era, induce more fossil fuel to be left in the earth, and thus curb cumulative carbon emissions. These consequences are relevant, as global warming depends primarily on cumulative emissions. There is no green paradox for a specific carbon tax that rises at less than the market rate of interest. Because this is the case for the growth of the optimal carbon tax, the green paradox is a temporary second-best phenomenon. There is also a green paradox if there is a chance of a breakthrough in renewables technology occurring at some random future date. However, there will also be less investment in opening up fossil fuel deposits, and thus cumulative carbon emission will be curbed.
Q31|Econometric modelling of world oil supplies: terminal price and the time to depletion|This paper develops a novel approach by which to identify the price of oil at the time of depletion, the so-called “terminal price” of oil. It shows that while the terminal price is independent of both GDP growth and the price elasticity of energy demand, it is dependent on the world real interest rate and the total lifetime stock of oil resources, as well as on the marginal extraction and scarcity cost parameters. The theoretical predictions of this model are evaluated using data on the cost of extraction, cumulative production, and proven reserves. The predicted terminal prices seem sensible for a range of parameters and variables, as illustrated by the sensitivity analysis. Using the terminal price of oil, I calculate the time to depletion, and determine the extraction and price profiles over the lifetime of the resource. The extraction profiles generated seem to be in line with the actual production and the predicted prices are generally in line with those currently observed.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q31|Teoretické Aspekty Vymedzenia Energeticko-Bezpečnostných Komplexov|Cieľom práce je analýza teoretických aspektov formovania a existencie bezpečnostných a následne energeticko-bezpečnostných komplexov, ktoré predstavujú základ pre hlbšiu analýzu politických, ekonomických, bezpečnostných a energetických vzťahov na regionálnej úrovni.

Q31|Aké Faktory Vplývajú Na Cenu Ropy Brent?|Počas prvej dekády 21. storočia bola cena ropy na svetovom trhu vysoko volatilná. V predkladanom príspevku sa snažíme vytvoriť model pre cenu ropy Brent, ktorý by bol schopný vysvetliť čo najviac variability vo vývoji ceny ropy Brent v období 1994 – 2011. Uvažujeme s viacerými modelmi založenými na exogénnych premenných, ktoré najviac vplývajú na cenu ropy Brent. Všetky prezentované modely sa zameriavajú na vysvetlenie ceny ropy výlučne prostredníctvom faktorov dopytu a ponuky a abstrahujú od geopolitických, prírodných a špekulačných faktorov. Prichádzame k záveru, že na cenu ropy Brent vplývajú predovšetkým faktory strany ponuky, pričom faktory strany dopytu nie sú silne korelované s cenou ropy Brent.
Q31|An assessment of energy resources for global decarbonisation|This paper presents an assessment of global economic energy potentials for all major natural energy resources. This work is based on both an extensive literature review and calculations based onto natural resource assessment data. In the first part, economic potentials are presented in the form of cost-supply curves, in terms of energy flows for renewable energy sources, or fixed amounts for fossil and nuclear resources, using consistent energy units that allow direct comparisons to be made. These calculations take into account, and provide a theoretical framework for considering uncertainty in resource assessments, providing a novel contribution aimed at enabling the introduction of uncertainty into resource limitations used in energy modelling. The theoretical details and parameters provided in tables enable this extensive natural resource database to be adapted to any modelling framework for energy systems. The second part of this paper uses these cost-supply curves in order to build a tool for analysing global scenarios of energy use, in the context of exploring the feasibility global decarbonisation using renewable energy sources. For such a purpose, a theoretical framework is given for evaluating either flows of stock energy resources for given price path assumptions for the related energy carriers, or the prices of energy carriers given energy demand assumptions. Results of both approaches are used in order to produce a complete comparison of global energy resources. The particular case of the feasibility of global decarbonisation by the end of the century is explored. Since the scale of the required amount of energy flows from renewables is comparable to the sum of the technical potentials, the associated scale of global land use for energy production is found to be large. For complete decarbonisation, without energy demand reductions, 7 to 12\% of the global land area could be required for energy production activities, emphasising the importance of improving energy consumption patterns and intensity of the global economy. The third part of this work is an appendix that provides all missing details, equations and databases necessary to understand and reproduce the work of Part I. This part is therefore aimed at enabling energy modellers to reproduce exactly and use in their own work the database that was constructed in this work.
Q31|Going Full Circle: Demand-Side Constraints to the Green Paradox|We argue that the literature on the green paradox has largely ignored the demand side of the resource market, and that this side of the market may mitigate the size of an emissions increase in response to imperfect climate policies. These claims are informed by recent empirical findings. Our arguments lead to clear policy recommendations.
Q31|UK Natural Gas: Gas-Specific or Oil Driven Pricing?|In this paper we investigate the time-varying relationship between oil and natural gas in the UK. We develop a model where relative prices can move between pricing-regimes; markets switch between being decoupled and integrated. Our model endogenously accounts for periods where oil and natural gas temporarily decouple due to gas specific pricing. We show that gas-specific pricing is primarily related to fall/winter peak-load gas pricing and that mean reversion in relative prices is dependent on the time of the year. Most of the reversion back to oil occurs in spring and summer when demand for gas to heating and electricity is low and net-availability and transport capacity high. Accounting for periods of gas specific pricing is relevant when determining the long-run equilibrium value of oil relative to natural gas. Utilizing the regime where evidence is strongest for integrated markets we find that oil is historically priced at 2.3 times the value of natural gas in the UK, and that markets have been decoupled for 49% of the sample. Our results do not indicate that peak-load pricing has become more prevalent in recent years, i.e., we find no evidence of underinvestment in capacity after deregulation.
Q31|Structural Shift in Global Natural Gas Markets: Demand Boom in Asia, Supply Shock in the US|"The significance of natural gas is on the rise due to the restructuring and decarbonization of energy systems worldwide. Natural gas is widely available and flexible as it can be used in electricity generation, manufacturing, transport, and private households. Compared to other fossil fuels, natural gas produces relatively low carbon dioxide emissions during combustion. For this reason, the natural gas sector also has an important supportive role to play when it comes to the European energy transition towards renewable energies. Against this backdrop, DIW Berlin has examined the potential of the global natural gas market and carried out model-based analyses of possible scenarios for meeting different climate change targets. The structural shift in the international natural gas market that has been observed for some years now is also set to continue in the medium and long term. While the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, particularly Qatar, will remain swing suppliers due to their geographical location, Russia's significance in supplying Europe will decline in the future. New techniques such as fracking enable the exploitation of unconventional natural gas resources, which could potentially see the US become a strong natural gas exporter and also give other regions around the world the opportunity to extract their own natural gas. However, in Europe, the potential for additional production of domestic resources by extracting shale gas through fracking is rather limited for technical reasons and due to a lack of political support in the context of an adequate international natural gas supply. Asian demand for natural gas is expected to strongly rise as a result of the ever-increasing appetite for energy generated by economic growth. This demand region will absorb the major share of future natural gas trade. In Europe, the situation could develop along a number of different trajectories, depending on whether natural gas is used as a ""bridge fuel"" in the transition toward an energy system based on renewable energies or as a complement to fluctuating renewable power generation in the long term."
Q31|Strukturverschiebung in der globalen Erdgaswirtschaft: Nachfrageboom in Asien, Angebotsschock in den USA|With the restructuring and decarbonization of energy systems, the significance of natural gas is on the increase worldwide. It is widely available and flexible - natural gas can be used in electricity generation, manufacturing, transport, and private households. Compared to other fossil fuels, combustion of natural gas leads to relatively low carbon dioxide emissions. For this reason, the natural gas economy also has an important supportive role to play when it comes to the European energy transition towards renewable energies. Against this backdrop, DIW Berlin examines the potential of the global natural gas market and carries out model-based analyses of the possible scenarios for meeting different climate change targets. The structural shift in the international natural gas economy that has been observed for some years now is also set to continue in the medium and long term. While the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, particularly Qatar, will remain swing suppliers due to their geographical location, Russia's significance in supplying Europe will decline in future. New techniques such as fracking enable the exploitation of unconventional natural gas reserves, which could potentially see the US become a natural gas export leader and also give other regions around the world the opportunity to domestically extract natural gas. However, in Europe, the potential for additional exploitation of domestic reserves by extracting shale gas through fracking is rather limited for technical reasons and a lack of political support in the context of an adequate international natural gas supply. Asian demand for natural gas is expected to increase as a result of the burgeoning energy hunger generated by economic growth. This demand region, set to dominate in the medium term, will tie up the lion's share of future natural gas trade. [...] Erdgas gewinnt weltweit immer größere Bedeutung bei der Umstrukturierung und Dekarbonisierung von Energiesystemen. Es ist flächendeckend verfügbar und flexibel einsetzbar in Verstromung, Industrie, Verkehr und im Haushaltsbereich. Im Vergleich zu anderen fossilen Energieträgern wird bei seiner Verbrennung relativ wenig CO2 emittiert. Aus diesem Grund kommt der Erdgaswirtschaft auch bei der europäischen Energiewende in Richtung erneuerbarer Energieträger eine wichtige unterstützende Rolle zu. Das DIW Berlin untersucht vor diesem Hintergrund das Potential des globalen Erdgasmarktes und analysiert modellgestützt mögliche Entwicklungsszenarien für verschiedene Klimaschutzziele. Die seit einigen Jahren zu beobachtende strukturelle Verschiebung der internationalen Erdgaswirtschaft wird sich auch mittel- und langfristig fortsetzen. Während die Staaten des arabischen Golfs, insbesondere Katar, aufgrund ihrer geographischen Lage als flexibler Anbieter (Swing Supplier) verbleiben, sinkt künftig die zentrale Bedeutung Russlands für die Versorgung Europas. Neue Techniken wie das Fracking, die die Erschließung sogenannter unkonventioneller Erdgasvorkommen ermöglichen, lassen die USA zur potenziellen Erdgasexportmacht aufsteigen und bieten anderen Weltregionen Hoffnung auf eigene Förderung. In Europa hingegen erscheint das Potential zusätzlicher einheimischer Gewinnung durch Fracking von Schiefergas aufgrund technischer Unsicherheiten und fehlender politischer Unterstützung im Kontext eines ausreichenden, internationalen Erdgasangebotes als gering. Immer mehr Nachfrage nach Erdgas wird aus Asien kommen, wo der wachstumsinduzierte Energiehunger kontinuierlich steigt. Diese mittelfristig dominante Nachfrageregion wird einen Großteil des zukünftigen Erdgashandels binden. In Europa sind mehrere Entwicklungspfade möglich, in Abhängigkeit davon, ob Erdgas als Brückentechnologie auf dem Weg zu erneuerbar-basierten Systemen genutzt wird, oder langfristig ein Komplement zur unsteten Einspeisung Erneuerbarer darstellt.
Q31|The Role of Natural Gas in a Low-Carbon Europe: Infrastructure and Regional Supply Security in the Global Gas Model|In this paper, we use the Global Gas Model to analyze the perspectives and infrastructure needs of the European natural gas market until 2050. Three pathways of natural gas consumption in a future low-carbon energy system in Europe are envisaged: i) a decreasing natural gas consumption, along the results of the PRIMES model for the EMF decarbonization scenarios; ii) a moderate increase of natural gas consumption, along the lines of the IEA (2012) World Energy Outlook's New Policy Scenario; and iii) a temporary increase of natural gas use as a bridge technology, followed by a strong decrease after 2030. Our results show that import infrastructure and intra-European transit capacity currently in place or under construction are largely sufficient to accommodate the import needs of the EMF decarbonization scenarios, despite the reduction of domestic production and the increase of import dependency. However, due to strong demand in Asia which draws LNG and imports from Russia, Europe has to increasingly rely on pipeline exports from Africa and the Caspian region from where new pipelines are built. Moreover, pipeline investments open up new import and transit paths, including reverse flow capacity, which improves the diversification of supplies. In the high gas consumption scenario similar pipeline links are realized-though on a larger scale, doubling the costs of infrastructure expansion. In the bridge technology scenario, the utilization rates of (idle) LNG import capacity can be increased for the short period of temporary strong natural gas demand.
Q31|Do Financial Investors Destabilize the Oil Price?|We assess whether and to what extent ?nancial activity in the oil futures markets has contributed to destabilize oil prices in recent years. We de?ne a destabilizing ?nancial shock as a shift in oil prices that is not related to current and expected fun- damentals, and thereby distorts e¢ cient pricing in the oil market. Using a structural VAR model identi?ed with sign restrictions, we disentangle this non-fundamental ?- nancial shock from fundamental shocks to oil supply and demand to determine their relative importance. We ?nd that shocks to oil demand and supply remain the main drivers of oil price swings. Financial investors in the futures market can however destabilize oil spot prices, although only in the short run. Moreover, ?nancial ac- tivity appears to have exacerbated gyrations in the oil market over the past decade, particularly in 2007-2009.
Q31|Factors Affecting Energy Demand in Developing Countries: A Dynamic Panel Analysis|This work presents an empirical study of energy demand, in which demand for energy is expressed as a function of various factors, such as income, price, economic structure, and CO2 emission. Parameter values are estimated econometrically, using a panel data approach of 16 developing countries over 30-years period. In general, the empirical results of this study confirm the majority of the findings in energy demand analysis where income and price have shown to be important determinants in energy demand. Moreover, economic structure and also CO2 emission appear to exert significant impact on energy demand. Short- and long-run elasticities of demand are estimated and some policy suggestions are given to improve energy saving and green energy consumption in developing countries.
Q31|Strategic behaviour in international metallurgical coal markets|This paper analyses whether prices and trade-flows in the international market for metallurgical coals were subject to non-competitive conduct in the period 2008 to 2010. To do so, I develop mathematical programming models – a Stackelberg model, two varieties of a Cournot model, and a perfect competition model – for computing spatial equilibria in international resource markets. Results are analysed with various statistical measures to assess prediction accuracy of the models. The results show that real market equilibria cannot be reproduced with a competitive model. However, real market outcomes can be accurately simulated with the non-competitive models suggesting that market equilibria in the international metallurgical coal trade were subject to strategic behaviour of coal exporters.
Q31|Global Applied General Equilibrium Analysis Using the Global Trade Analysis Project Framework|This chapter provides an overview of the first two decades of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) – an effort to support a standardized database and computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling platform for international economic analysis. It characterizes GTAP in four different dimensions: institutional innovation, a network, a database and a standardized modeling platform. Guiding principles for the GTAP modeling framework include flexibility, ease of use, transparency, and symmetric treatment of production and utility fundamentals across regions. The chapter reviews core modeling assumptions relating to the regional household, private consumption behavior, welfare decomposition, the “Global Bank,” treatment of the international trade and transport sector, and imports. Model validation and sensitivity analysis, as well as software issues receive attention as well. The chapter also offers brief overviews of the two major areas of application: international economic integration and global environmental issues. It closes a discussion of future directions for the Project.
Q31|Rare earth elements as critical raw materials: Focus on international markets and future strategies|Supply of some critical raw materials by European industry is becoming more and more difficult. After the case of natural textile fibres, in particular cotton, and timber, over the last few years the problem of rare earths (REs) availability has also risen. The 97% of the global supply of rare earth metals (REMs) is produced by China, that has recently done copious cuts of its exports, apparently in order to protect its environment. This fact has greatly increased the REs prices, causing tension and uncertainty among the world hi-tech markets. Many of these materials, in fact, have very few effective substitutes and low recycling rates too. In addition, their natural reserves of rare earths are concentrated in a small number of countries (China, Brazil, US, Russia, Democratic Republic of Congo). REMs are a group of 17 elements particularly used in many new electronic and advanced components: such as fuel cells, mobile phones, displays, hi-capacity batteries, permanent magnets for wind power generation, green energy devices, etc. Many analysts foresee much more requests in the next decades.
Q31|Lithium availability in the EU27 for battery-driven vehicles: The impact of recycling and substitution on the confrontation between supply and demand until2050|The adverse impacts of climate change are widely recognized as well as the importance of the mitigation of carbon dioxide (CO2). Battery driven vehicles are expected to have a bright future, since GHG emissions can be reduced. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries appear to be the most promising, due to their high energy density. Recently, the discussion concerning adequate lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) resources is resolved. The current challenge is the needed increase in flow rate of Li2CO3 into society to foresee in forecasted demand. This research determines ten factors which influence the availability of Li-ion batteries for the EU27 in the coming decades. They are used in a system dynamics analysis. The results of this research show that undersupply can be expected in the EU27 until 2045 somewhere between 0.5Mt and 2.8Mt. Substitution of Li2CO3 in other end-use markets and recycling can relieve the strain on Li2CO3 supply to some extent. In 2050, 20% of the vehicle fleet in the EU27 can be battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The lack of resources in the EU27 and the geographical distribution of lithium in politically sensitive areas suggest that the shares of lithium available for the EU27 will be less than assumed in this research. The increase in flow rate shows to be the bottle-neck for a transition to (partly) battery driven vehicles in the EU27, at least when Li-ion batteries are used. Focusing on large-scale application of BEVs with Li-ion batteries in order to substantially mitigate CO2 emissions in transport is a futile campaign.
Q31|An analysis of future platinum resources, emissions and waste streams using a system dynamic model of its intentional and non-intentional flows and stocks|Platinum is increasingly used intentionally and non-intentionally in several applications. This has raised the concern about its future resources, emissions and losses during its life cycle. On the one hand, increasing platinum emissions might affect human health. On the other hand, the accumulated platinum in mineral waste, soil, landfill sites and construction materials as a result of the emissions, losses and the utilization of secondary materials can be seen as potential resources for platinum. This paper is aimed at (1) analyzing the long term impacts of the use of platinum intentionally and non-intentionally on its future demand and supply, release to the environment and accumulation in mineral waste, soil, landfill sites and construction materials and (2) quantifying the amount of platinum in secondary materials that would be available for platinum future supply. The analysis is carried out on a global level using a system dynamic model of platinum intentional and non-intentional flows and stocks. The analysis is based on four scenarios for the introduction of fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). The results show that platinum demand is increasing overtime in all scenarios at different rates and its identified resources are expected to deplete before the end of the century with or without the introduction of FCVs. The release of platinum to the environment and the accumulation in soil are expected to decrease when conventional ICE vehicles is replaced by FCVs. The amount of platinum accumulated in mineral waste, soil, landfill sites and construction materials by the time platinum is depleted are more than double its identified resources and would be potential resources for platinum that are available in different parts of the world. The methodology presented in this paper can be used in the assessment of other technologies and other metals.
Q31|An empirical approach to determine specific weights of driving factors for the price of commodities—A contribution to the measurement of the economic scarcity of minerals and metals|In recent years, commodity markets show a large amount of volatility and substantial price jumps, indicating an increasing economic scarcity in many cases. As this scarcity makes commodity procurement a critical issue for national economies, industry sectors and manufacturing companies, a number of criticality indices have been presented and utilized in science as well as in practice. These indices are mostly based on an aggregation of different key figures, both qualitative and quantitative. However, the weighting of the different factors is in most cases arbitrary or based on rough estimates.
Q31|Byproduct production of minor metals: Threat or opportunity for the development of clean technologies? The PV sector as an illustration|Today, the fight against global warming and the coming hydrocarbon exhaustion involve a drastic increase of clean energies. These technologies resort to many minor metals which are byproduct of major metals. We will take the definition of Hagelüken and Mesker (2010, Complex Life Cycles of Precious and Special Metals. In: Edition Thomas E. Graedel, Ester van der Voet (Eds.), Strüngmann Forum Report, Linkages of Sustainability, MIT Press) to show precisely what minor metals are: “[they are] metals that have relatively low production or usage, which occur in low ore concentrations, are regarded as rare, or are not traded at major public exchanges”. We will analyze the byproduct status affecting almost each minor metal in order to determine if the link with the metal main product can involve a threat for clean technology development. This paper will also deal with the theory and implications of the relationship between the byproduct and the main-product and then check it with empirical data. Until now, byproduct metal production and its variations seem relatively independent from major metal production thanks to the non-saturation of potential supply. By 2050, photovoltaic solar development should not lead to the saturation of potential supply.
Q31|How to evaluate raw material supply risks—an overview|Some strategic raw materials do have an extremely unsecure supply situation. Several working groups around the world have made criticality assessments for metallic raw materials to analyze the driving impact factors for this instability. However, the influences on raw material availability are manifold and therefore criticality assessment methods are very heterogeneous. Here we give an overview about the differences and similarities of supply risk evaluation in 15 criticality assessment methods. We take the example of Indium, which has been rated in 60% of these criticality studies, and show which data base is used for supply risk evaluation. Our results show a lack of consensus about which indicators give reliable information for raw material supply risk and how these indicators should be aggregated. We anticipate our essay to be a starting point for more justified indicator selection and weighting in criticality assessments.
Q31|Learning and price volatility in duopoly models of resource depletion|The combination of learning and depletion in non-renewable resource markets adds significant volatility to commodity prices. The market consists of a small number of suppliers who make depletion plans based on their perceptions of how sensitive price is to supply. Learning leads to changes in these perceptions and hence the revision of depletion plans, which can have a dramatic effect on market supply and price. Firstly, price trends upwards faster than the rate of time preference as the non-renewable resource approaches exhaustion. Secondly, there are frequent escape episodes in which price rises rapidly before gradually falling back. The striking volatility and nonstationarity in commodity prices that results has parallels in oil price data.
Q31|Climate Policy and Catastrophic Change: Be Prepared and Avert Risk|The optimal reaction to a pending climate catastrophe is to accumulate capital to be better prepared for the disaster and levy a carbon tax to reduce the risk of the hazard by curbing global warming. The optimal carbon tax consists of the present value of marginal damages, the non-marginal expected change in welfare caused by a marginal higher risk of catastrophe, and the expected loss in after-catastrophe welfare. The last two terms offset precautionary capital accumulation. A linear hazard function calibrated to an expected time of 15 years for a 32% drop in global GDP if temperature stays at 6 degrees Celsius implies with a discount rate of 1.4% a precautionary return of 1.6% and a carbon tax of 136 US $/tC. More intertemporal substitution lowers precautionary capital accumulation and lessens the need for a high carbon tax, but implies less intergenerational inequality aversion which pushes up the carbon tax.
Q31|La filiera corta: una possibile strategia per migliorare la competitività dell’azienda agraria|The paper aims to determine the possible competitive advantage for farms thatadopt a short supply-chain strategy. In particular, by carriying out an analysis of asample of fruit and vegetable farms, we wanted to find out how the business relatesto the market and the reasons that induced the entrepreneur to move into a shortsupply-chain set up. The study was prompted by the wish to determine, empirically,the economic benefits arising from the adoption of the short supply chain. In fact,there is a vast literature on the economic benefits produced by the short supply chainsuch as the demand stability due to customer loyalty and the ability to influencedirectly the price through the reduction of production costs, especially oftransportation and packaging ones. In addition, the farmer may obtain greaterremuneration of production factors, re-appropriating a portion of the value thatusually gets eaten up during the various stages of the supply chain system, thusbecoming price-maker (Saccomandi, 1999). In particular, we focused our analysis ondetermining the net income of the entrepreneur who decides to pursue a shortsupply-chain strategy by comparing it, using the same parameters, with farms wherethere is not a short supply chain. From this empirical analysis it emerges that theshort supply-chain cannot be the only way to sell farm products, as it absorbs only apart of production. Nevertheless, it enables the entrepreneur the recoup a greaterproportion of production costs.
Q31|Vegetable Edible Oils|The article presents the evolution of the world vegetable edible oils and oilseeds markets in 2012 and projections for 2013. It contains an indepth analysis of the production, consumption, trade and stocks, by the main types of oils and oilseeds, at the world level and by the main countries. The author underlines the continuation of the declining prices trend for most of oils, reflectind the significant increase of oilseeds production, the demand slowing down and the increased oilseeds stocks.
Q31|GENERAL ASSESSMENT OF PRICE TRENDS IN THE MAIN INTERNATIONAL COMMODITY MARKETS IN 2012 AND PROSPECTS for 2013|The article analyses the main developments of the international commodity markets in 2012, emphasizing the declining trend of prices in 2012/2011, reflecting a generally weaker demand and an uncertain global economic outlook. However, world commodity prices were still situated at relatively high levels compared to the historical levels, recorded before the world economic crisis outburst (2009). The short term prospects show a general decline for all the main commodity markets, including oil, with an average contraction of 2% in 2013/2012. The analysis goes in depth by individual commodity markets. The market study reveals the role played by China, the major actor of the global commodity market and the largest world market, in influencing international commodity prices.
Q31|150 Years Of Boom And Bust: What Drives Mineral Commodity Prices?|My paper is the first to provide long-run evidence on the dynamic effects of supply and demand shocks on mineral commodity prices. I assemble and analyze a new data set of prices and production levels of copper, lead, tin, zinc, and crude oil from 1840 to 2010. Price fluctuations are primarily driven by demand rather than supply shocks. Demand shocks affect the price persistently for up to 15 years, whereas the effect of supply shocks persists for a maximum of 5 years. My paper shows that price surges caused by rapid industrialization are a recurrent phenomenon throughout history. Mineral commodity prices return to their declining or stable trends in the long run.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q31|Values, food and bags: A study of consumption decisions in a laboratory supermarket|We study the relation between people's personal values and environmentally friendly consumption behavior. We first assessed subjects' personal values using the Aspiration Index. Then subjects participated in a laboratory supermarket offering organic and conventional food products and different kinds of bags. The results suggest that subjects' personal values are poor predictors of their ecologically-relevant consumption behavior. However, we find that subjects who spontaneously reflected upon power values made less ecologically sustainable consumption decisions than did those who reflected on universalism values. We discuss methodological differences as possible reasons for variations between our results and those of earlier studies.
Q31|Unilateral Climate Policy: Harmful or Even Disastrous?|This paper deals with possible foreign reactions to unilateral carbon demand reducing policies. It differentiates between demand side and supply side reactions as well as between intra- and inter-temporal shifts in greenhouse gas emissions. In our model, we integrate a stock-dependent marginal physical cost of extracting fossil fuels into Eichner and Pethig’s (Int Econ Rev 52(3):767–805, 2011 ) general equilibrium carbon leakage model. The results are as follows: Under similar but somewhat tighter conditions than those derived by Eichner and Pethig (Int Econ Rev 52(3):767–805, 2011 ), a weak green paradox arises. Furthermore, a strong green paradox can arise in our model under supplementary constraints. That means a “green” policy measure might not only lead to a harmful acceleration of fossil fuel extraction but to an increase in the cumulative climate damages at the same time. In some of these cases there is even a cumulative extraction expansion, which we consider disastrous. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014
Q31|The Taxation of Nonrenewable Natural Resources|"We provide an analytical overview of the distortionary e ects of some common forms of taxes faced by the nonrenewable resources sector of the economy. In the category of taxes meant specifically to capture the resource rent, we look at a specific severance tax, an ad valorem severance tax, a profit tax and a ""lump-sum"" tax, with emphasis on their effects on the extraction decisions over time and on the initial reserves to be developed. In the category of taxes meant for all sectors of the economy, we look at the corporate income tax and its special provision for the resource sector in the form of a depletion allowance, with emphasis on the effects on the intra-industry resource extraction decisions and on the inter-industry allocation of investment."
Q31|Monopolistic Sequestration of European Carbon Emissions|Mitigating climate change by carbon capture and storage (CCS) will require vast infrastructure investments. These investments include pipeline networks for transporting carbon dioxide (CO2) from industrial sites ('sources') to the storage sites ('sinks'). This paper considers the decentralised formation of trunk-line networks when geological storage space is exhaustible and demand is increasing. Monopolistic control of an exhaustible resource may lead to overinvestment and/or excessively early investment, as these allow the monopolist to increase her market power. The model is applied to CCS pipeline network formation in northwestern Europe. The features identified above are found to play a minor role. Should storage capacity be effectively inexhaustible, underinvestment due to the inability of the monopolist to capture the entire social surplus is likely to have substantial welfare impacts. Multilateral bargaining to coordinate international CCS policies is particularly important if storage capacity is plentiful.
Q31|Carbon taxation, OPEC and the end of oil|I develop a differential game between an oil cartel and an importer investing in research and development (R&D) to reduce the cost of a green substitute to oil. In equilibrium, the cartel is forced to deter the substitute, which thus imposes a price ceiling falling over time. Credible carbon taxes are below the Pigovian level, implying the importer cannot internalise the full pollution externality, much less capture resource rents. Without carbon pricing, the importer curtails long-run pollution using a costly R&D programme. Normatively, climate policy will be more expensive if relying on green R&D programmes only.
Q31|Climate Tipping and Economic Growth: Precautionary Capital and the Price of Carbon|The optimal reaction to a climate tipping point that becomes more imminent with global warming is to be precautionary in adjusting capital to prepare for the calamity and to price carbon to make catastrophic change less imminent. The saving response can be positive or negative. If the mean lag for the impact of the catastrophe is long enough, the saving response will be negative, because the precautionary return in the Keynes–Ramsey rule becomes negative. We also show the separate effects of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) and the relative risk aversion (RRA) using Duffie–Epstein preferences. Focusing on a productivity catastrophe, we calibrate our model and show how sensitive the policy responses are to the degrees of EIS and RRA, the trend rate of economic growth, the hazard rate, and how long it takes for the catastrophe to have its full impact.
Q31|Preserving Eastern or Offshore Oil for Preventing Green Paradoxes?|This paper deals with possible foreign reactions to unilateral carbon supply reducing policies. It differentiates between demand side and supply side reactions as well as between intra- and intertemporal shifts of greenhouse gas emissions. Ritter & Schopf (2013) integrate stock-dependent marginal physical costs of extracting fossil fuels into Eichner & Pethig’s (2011) general equilibrium carbon leakage model. Using this model, we change the policy instrument from an emissions trading scheme to a deposit preserving system. Thereby, we distinguish between purchasing high-value and low-value reserves. The results are as follows: In case of eastern oil kept underground, the weak and the strong green paradox arise under similar conditions to those derived by Ritter & Schopf (2013). In case of offshore oil kept underground, there is intra- and there can be intertemporal carbon leakage, but neither the present emissions nor the cumulative climate damages increase.
Q31|The transformative effect of unscheduled generation by solar PV and wind generation on net electricity demand|This study investigates the transformative effect of unscheduled solar PV and wind generation on electricity demand. The motivations for the study are twofold, the poor medium term predictions of electricity demand in the Australian National Electricity Market and the continued rise in peak demand but reduction in overall demand. A number of factors contribute to these poor predictions, including the global financial crisis inducing a reduction in business activity, the Australian economy’s continued switch from industrial to service sector, the promotion of energy conservation, and particularly mild weather reducing the requirement for air conditioning. Additionally, there is growing unscheduled generation, which is meeting electricity demand. This growing source of generation necessitates the concepts of gross and net demand where gross demand is met by unscheduled and scheduled generation and net demand by scheduled generation. The methodology compares the difference between net and gross demand of the 50 nodes in the Australian National Electricity Market using half hourly data from 2007 to 2011. The unscheduled generation is calculated using the Australian Bureau of Meteorology half hourly solar intensity and wind speed data and the Australian Clean Energy Regulator’s database of small generation units’ renewable energy target certificates by postcode. The findings are that gross demand rather than net demand helps explain both the overall reduction in net demand and the continued increase in peak demand. The study has two main conclusions. Firstly, a requirement for policy to target the growth in peak demand via time of supply feed-in tariff for small generation units. Secondly, modellers of electricity demand consider both net and gross demand in their forecasts. The time of supply feed-in tariffs are intended to promote the adoption of storage technologies and demand side participation and management. Modellers considering both net and gross demand are required to model unscheduled generation. This requirement ensues that more comprehensive solar intensity data be provided by the Bureau of Meteorology and that the Australian National Electricity Market Operator provide data in GIS format of each demand node using the Australian Statistical Geography Standard developed by Australian Bureau of Statistics to enable easier integration of large quantities of geographic data from a number of sources. The applicability of these finding become more relevant to other countries as unscheduled generation becomes more wide spread. This study is instrumental to a range of further research. Other sources of unscheduled generations should be considered to form a more comprehensive concept of gross demand, for instance, solar hot water and small hydro. Replacing electrical hot water heaters with solar hot water reduces the overnight demand, which may provide a considerable transformative effect on net electricity demand. In addition, energy efficiency is meeting demand for electricity; incorporating energy efficiency would form an even more comprehensive concept of gross electricity demand and could help improve longer term electricity demand projections.
Q31|The Linkage between Knowledge Intensive Innovation and Export in SMEs: An empirical study based on Turkish manufacturing SMEs|The increasing role of SMEs in Turkish export with the share of 60 per cent has deepened the need to better understand which factors and to what extend affect export propensity of SMEs. In this paper, the focus will be on the relationship between exportation and innovation, particularly knowledge-based innovation, as a significant driving factor. The data were retrieved from KOSGEB and the result of the analysis demonstrated a significant relationship. However, the effect of innovation on export in SMEs began decreasing noticeably after the firm reaches a certain level in R&D intensity, which was also observed.
Q31|Rettet die Energiewende? Warum eigentlich?|After the Fukushima accident, the German government decided to change the energy system in a dramatic way (the energy transition). The core of this project is the transition from a fossil fuel based system to a system that relies heavily on the use of renewable energies. In this paper, it is argued that this transition is not a rational answer to the climate change problem. In particular, the use of feedin tariffs neither leads to an efficient reduction of CO 2 emissions nor is it a rational strategy for any other political aim under discussion.

Q31|The tug-of-war between resource depletion and technological change in the global oil industry 1981 - 2009|We perform an empirical analysis of the extent to which ongoing technological change through R&D activity has offset the effect of ongoing depletion on the cost of finding additional reserves of oil in eight global regions. We introduce a finding cost function that among other factors depends on the cumulative number of past R&D expenses and cumulative past production, measuring technological change and depletion, respectively. For all our regions we find significant effects of both depletion and technological change on oil finding costs from 1981 to 2009, barring cyclical variations in finding costs that could come from changes in factor prices. For almost all regions technology more than mitigated depletion until around the mid-nineties. However, we find that depletion outweighed technological progress over the last decade.
