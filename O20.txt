O20|Business Dynamics, Knowledge Economy, and the Economic Performance of African Countries|This paper develops a framework (a) to examine whether or not the African business environment hinders or promotes the knowledge economy (KE), (b) to determine how the KE affects economic performance, and (c) how economic performance relates to the inequality-adjusted human socioeconomic development (IHDI) of 53 African countries during the 1996-2010 time period. We estimate the linkages with three related equations. The results support a strong correlation between the dynamics of starting and doing business and variations in KE. The results also show that there exists a weak link between KE and economic performance. Nonetheless, KE-influenced performance plays a more important role in socioeconomic development than some of the conventional control variables like foreign direct investment (FDI), foreign aid, and even private investment.

O20|Designing an Industrial Policy for Developing Countries: a New Approach|"In this study, the prevalent methodology for design of the industrial policy in developing countries was critically assessed, and it was shown that the mechanism and content of classical method is fundamentally contradictory to the goals and components of the endogenous growth theories. This study, by proposing a new approach, along settling Schumpeter's economic growth theory as a policy framework, designed the process of entering, analyzing and processing data as the mechanism of the industrial policy in order to provide ""theoretical consistency"" and ""technical and Statistical requirements"" for targeting the growth stimulant factor effectively."
O20|Are Trade Preferences a Panacea? : The African Growth and Opportunity Act and African Exports|"Does""infant industry""preferential access durably boost export performance? This paper exploits significant trade policy changes in the United States around the turn of the 21st century to address this question. The expansion of Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) products for less developed countries in 1997 and the implementation of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) in 2001 is used to assess whether preferential access boosts exports of eligible products in general and apparel specifically. The phase-out of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) in 2005 is used to assess whether any expansion in apparel exports survived the erosion of preferences. To find a causal impact of these changes on exports to the United States from a given beneficiary country, the analysis uses a triple-differences regression and 26 years of newly constructed trade and tariff data at the country-product-year level (1992-2017). The analysis finds that the AGOA boosted African apparel exports, and the expansion of the GSP increased African exports of other eligible products. While the marginal impacts on African apparel exports grew sharply in the first years of AGOA, the impacts leveled off after 2005, when the end of the MFA quotas unleashed competition from Asian countries. The illusion of sustained African apparel exports is created by three late-bloomers in East Africa offsetting the boom-bust pattern in Southern Africa and the never-significant response in Central and Western Africa. Firm-level customs data for selected countries reveal that even in East Africa, the recent export growth was driven by new entrants rather than by incumbent firms whose competitiveness might have been nurtured by the big preference margins during the early AGOA period. Understanding the heterogeneous response to trade preferences remains a challenge. However, preliminary evidence suggests that preferential access per se was not sufficient but needed to be complemented by specific domestic reforms: tariff liberalization, reduced regulatory burden, enhanced connectivity, and competitive exchange rates."
O20|Accounting for Timing when Assessing Health-Related Policies|The primary focus of this paper is to offer guidance on the analysis of time streams of effects that a project may have so that they can be discounted appropriately. This requires a framework that identifies the common parameters that need to be assessed, whether conducting cost-effectiveness or benefit-cost analysis. The quantification and conversion of the time streams of different effects into their equivalent health, health care cost or consumption effects avoids embedding multiple arguments in discounting policies. This helps to identify where parameters are likely to differ in particular contexts, what type of evidence would be relevant, what is currently known and how this evidence might be strengthened. The current evidence available to support the assessment of the key parameters is discussed and possible estimates and default assumptions are suggested. Reporting the results in an extensive way is recommended. This makes the assessments required explicit so the impact of alternative assumptions can be explored and analysis updated as better estimates evolve. Some projects will have effects across different countries where some or all of these parameters will differ. Therefore, the net present value of a project will be the sum of the country specific net present values rather than the sum of effects across countries discounted at some common rate.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O20|A Model-Based Assessment of the Distributional Impact of Structural Reforms|This paper studies the effects of structural reforms on the functional distribution of income in EU Member States. To study this mechanism we use a DSGE model (Roeger et al. 2008) with households supplying three types of labour, low-, medium- and high-skilled. We assume that households receive income from labour, tangible capital, intangible capital, financial wealth and transfers and we trace how structural reforms affect these types of incomes. The quantification of structural reforms is based on changes in structural indicators that can significantly close the gap of a country’s average income towards the best performing countries in the EU. We find a general trade-off between an increase in employment of a particular group and the income of the average group member relative to income per capita. In general, reforms which aim at increasing employment of low skilled workers are associated with a fall in wages relative to income per capita. Capital owners generally benefit from labour market reforms, with an increasing share in total income, due to limited entry into the final goods production sector. This suggests that labour market re-forms may lead to suboptimal distributional effects if there are rigidities in goods markets present, a finding which confirms the importance of ensuring that such reforms are accompanied or preceded by product market reforms.
O20|A communitarian definition of shared value rooted in local development studies and in the Olivettian experience|"This paper aims at introducing a variation on the concept of shared value originally proposed by Porter and Kramer (2011). The variation is based on a couple of suggestions provided by Becattini (2011) commenting on that concept: the first concerns the rooting of shared value in processes of local development, as those exemplified by successful industrial districts, where the business sphere and the local community are strictly integrated within place-based relations. The second suggestions is the mention of the experience of the Olivetti company and the Canavese area (Ivrea, Italy) in the first decades after WWII. Becattini described this experience as an uncommon situation of reconciliation between a corporate function of profit and the function of social utility of a place. Hence, our study entails two main steps. Firstly, a conceptual discussion will focus on 1. the relation between shared value and local development; 2. the underlying connection with the Olivettian experience and the theorization of the concept of ""community"" included in the writings of Adriano Olivetti; 3. some implicit relations between the communitarian views of Olivetti and Becattini. Secondly, the reassessment of the concept of shared value, and in particular the reference to the Olivettian experience seen as a paradigmatic and forerunning case, brings to the proposal of our variation. This is the definition of what we call a ""communitarian shared value"", taking its roots to logics that combine business strategies of shared value, communitarian relations and culture, and processes and policies of local development."
O20|The Average and Heterogeneous Effects of Transportation Investments: Evidence from sub-Saharan Africa 1960-2010|Previous work on transportation investments has focused on average impacts in high- and middle-income countries. We estimate average and heterogeneous effects in a poor continent, Africa, using roads and cities data spanning 50 years in 39 countries. Using changes in market access due to distant road construction as a source of exogenous variation, we estimate an 30-year elasticity of city population with respect to market access of 0.06--0.18. Our results suggest that this elasticity is stronger for small and remote cities, and weaker in politically favored and agriculturally suitable areas. Access to foreign cities matters little.
O20|Economic and Political Factors in Infrastructure Investment: Evidence from Railroads and Roads in Africa 1960--2015|Transport investment has played an important role in the economic development of many countries. Starting from a low base, African countries have recently initiated several massive transportation infrastructure projects. However, surprisingly little is known about the current levels, past evolution, and correlates of transportation infrastructure in Africa. In this paper, we introduce a new data set on the evolution of the stocks of railroads (1862-2015) and multiple types of roads (1960-2015) for 43 sub-Saharan African countries. First, we compare our estimates with those from other available data sets, such as the World Development Indicators of the World Bank. Second, we document the aggregate evolution of transportation investments over the past century in Africa. We confirm that railroads were a ``colonial'' transportation technology, whereas paved roads were a ``post-colonial'' technology. We also highlight how investment patterns have followed economic patterns. Third, we report conditional correlations between 5-year infrastructure growth and several geographic, economic and political factors during the period 1960-2015. We find strong correlations between transportation investments and economic development as well as more political factors including pre-colonial centralization, ethnic fractionalization, European settlement, natural resource dependence, and democracy.
O20|Free Education Helps Combat Child Labor? The Effect of a Free Compulsory Education Reform in Rural China|This paper evaluates the effect of a free compulsory education reform in rural China on the incidence of child labor. We exploit the cross-province variation in the roll-out of the reform and apply a difference-in-differences strategy to identify the causal effects of the reform. We find that the exposure to the free compulsory education significantly reduces the incidence of child labor for boys, but has no significant effect on the likelihood of child labor for girls. Specifically, one additional semester of free compulsory education decreases the incidence of child labor for boys by 8.3 percentage points. Moreover, the negative effect of the reform on the likelihood of child labor is stronger for boys from households with lower socioeconomic status. Finally, the free compulsory education reform may induce parents to reallocate resources towards boys within a household and thus may enlarge the gender gap in human capital investment.

O20|Blended Finance Evaluation: Governance and Methodological Challenges|There is an urgent need to better understand the role that the use of blended finance in development co-operation can play in achieving the SDGs. By adopting the “Blended Finance Principles for Unlocking Commercial Finance for the SDGs” in 2017, members of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee have committed to “monitor blended finance for transparency and results”. The practical implications of monitoring and evaluating blended finance are currently being explored with a view to providing further policy guidance on the implementation of such Principles. This paper contributes to the ongoing consultation process s by discussing governance and methodological challenges in blended finance evaluation and proposing a few options to deal with them.In their review of the present practice of blended finance evaluation, as of end 2018, authors identify some key issues that need to be addressed and put forth initial ideas in order to ensure that evaluations improve the knowledge base on blended operations. The paper starts with a discussion of some key management and organizational challenges that influence how blending operations are monitored and evaluated. It continues with an overview of main evaluation methodologies that could be used for blended finance evaluation and challenges associated with applying them, and it outlines the challenges of assessing additionality. The paper concludes with a summary of identified issues from a review of a sample of completed evaluations of blended finance, highlighting the methodological challenges that they reveal.
O20|Learning from Results-Based Management evaluations and reviews|What have we learned from implementing results-based management in development co-operation organisations? What progress and benefits can be seen? What are the main challenges and unintended consequences? Are there good practices to address these challenges?To respond to these questions this paper reviews and analyses the findings from various evaluations and reviews of results-based management systems conducted by members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), the OECD/DAC Results Community Secretariat and other bodies in the past four years (2015-2018). It also draws on emerging lessons from new methods for managing development co-operation results.This analytical work aims to: identify recent trends in results-based management, explore challenges faced by providers when developing their results approaches and systems, select good practices in responding to these challenges that can be useful for the OECD/DACResults Community, considering new approaches, new technologies and evolving contexts. This body of evidence will inform the development of a core set of generic guiding principles for results-based management in development co-operation.
O20|Transition Finance: Introducing a new concept|In answer to the call expressed within the Addis Ababa Action Agenda to mobilise all available resources – domestic and foreign, public and private – in support of the Sustainable Development Goals, the Development Co-operation Directorate develops a new work stream on transition finance to explore the evolution and interaction of public (official development assistance and other official flows) and private (foreign direct investments and remittances) sources of finance across the development continuum – studying multiple stages of development: low income countries, middle income countries, fragile contexts, and different regions of the world. Its ultimate objective is to advise the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) in preparing countries for transition (outlining the optimal financial mix and offering policy recommendations) and in building resilience.This paper introduces the concept of transition finance and initiates research to advise the DAC on its role as a major provider of development assistance among other public and private providers of financing for the 2030 Agenda.
O20|Enabling Civil Society: Select survey findings|Civil society and civil society organisations (CSOs) are important to development co-operation, both as implementing partners for members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), and as development actors in their own right. Agenda 2030 is clear on the necessity of mobilising CSOs to implement, and uphold accountability for, the Sustainable Development Goals. The Global Partnership for Effective Development Co operation has committed to ensuring effectiveness in relation to CSOs in development co-operation, inclusive of the provision of CSO enabling environments.Recognising that how DAC members work with CSOs is part of CSO enabling environments, in 2017 the OECD Development Co-operation Directorate (DCD) established a work stream on civil society to provide guidance on DAC member support for civil society and a strategy for engaging with civil society. Under the work stream, a study on how DAC members work with CSOs was launched to identify areas of DAC member support to and engagement with CSOs for which guidance is needed. This paper introduces a selection of key findings and recommendations from two 2018-2019 surveys complemented with DAC statistical data.The paper points to evidence of member effort to work with CSOs in ways that enable CSOs to maximise their contribution to development. However, evidence also shows that members need to continuously examine their practices to ensure coherence between objectives and the many advantages that CSOs are seen to bring to development, and the members’ means of support to and engagement with CSOs.
O20|Cyber Security Framework for the Internet-of-Things in Industry 4.0|This research article reports the results of a qualitative case study that correlates academic literature with five Industry 4.0 cyber trends, seven cyber risk frameworks and two cyber risk models. While there is a strong interest in industry and academia to standardise existing cyber risk frameworks, models and methodologies, an attempt to combine these approaches has not been done until present. We apply the grounded theory approach to derive with integration criteria for the reviewed frameworks, models and methodologies. Then, we propose a new architecture for the integration of the reviewed frameworks, models and methodologies. We therefore advance the efforts of integrating standards and governance into Industry 4.0 and offer a better understanding of a holistic economic impact assessment model for IoT cyber risk.
O20|Analysing IoT cyber risk for estimating IoT cyber insurance|This paper is focused on mapping the current evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) and its associated cyber risks for the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) sector. We report the results of a qualitative empirical study that correlates academic literature with 14 - I4.0 frameworks and initiatives. We apply the grounded theory approach to synthesise the findings from our literature review, to compare the cyber security frameworks and cyber security quantitative impact assessment models, with the world leading I4.0 technological trends. From the findings, we build a new impact assessment model of IoT cyber risk in Industry 4.0. We therefore advance the efforts of integrating standards and governance into Industry 4.0 and offer a better understanding of economics impact assessment models for I4.0.
O20|The Impacts of Domestic and Foreign Direct Investments on Economic Growth: Fresh Evidence from Tunisia|This paper aims to analyze the impact of domestic investment and Foreign Direct Investment on economic growth in Tunisia during the period 1976–2017. This study is based on the Auto-Regressive Distributive Lags (ARDL) approach that is proposed by Pesaran et al (2001). Bound testing approaches to the analysis of level relationships. According to the results of the analysis, domestic investment and foreign direct investment have a negative effect on economic growth in the long run. However, in the short run, only domestic investment causes economic growth. The findings are important for Tunisian economic policy makers to undertake the effective policies that can promote and lead domestic and foreign investments to boost economic growth.
O20|Pakistan’s Agriculture Trade with South Asia|Agriculture sector has major contributor towards GDP of Pakistan and also absorbs the extensive portion of labor force. It is observed from the examination of trade data from 2010 to 2017 that integration within South Asia is limited merely with Afghanistan and India while trade with Maldives and Nepal shows negligible figures. Agriculture exports can be increased by developing value chains and trade ties with countries towards which Pakistan has limited export volume. Further, to expand the agriculture exports Pakistan must also focus on export of animals and food products. Overall agriculture growth can be achieved by making public investment in basic inputs including water and seeds through which productivity can be increased.
O20|Controlling as driving force at today?s dynamic changing companies|The task of controlling is to support the management with reports, forecasts and analyses in order to be able to take economically rational decisions. In today?s fast changing economic and information technological environment the management has to react rapidly. This means new challenges for controlling. Due to digitalization, even more real time data is available, can be stored and shared fast. This lead to a change of controlling processes. The focus of reports changed from analysing past figures to current and future trends. Controlling become the strategic early warning system of the companies. This changes the role of controllers, as it is transforming into business partners of management, and also new roles, like Data Scientist will turn up and new skills are needed. Controlling support management to take more adequate decisions, what secure the long-term survival of the company, so in an indirect way the transformation of controlling is a driving force of the companies at today?s dynamically changing environment.
O20|Ghana's new national income data series: follow-up to M Huq and M Tribe's - The economy of Ghana: 50 years of economic development (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018)|This paper follows from the publication of our jointly authored book on the Ghanaian economy which was published in September 2018 (Huq and Tribe, 2018). This volume contains an extensive database which provides consistent series for most of the major macroeconomic features of the economy from 1960 to 2015. However, later in September 2018 the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) published a significant update of the national income statistics (GSS, 2018a) and in this paper we aim to explore some of the implications of this update. As originally published, the new national income data do not permit a direct comparison of the old and new series at constant prices of the same year, and the paper contains estimates which contribute to covering this omission. The calculations using the new data series also provide estimates for constant price data which demonstrate the structural changes reported by the GSS publications in more detail than was contained within the official data release. Using a range of new data sources (including the Integrated Business Enterprise Survey â€“ GSS, 2017b â€“ and the Labour Force Survey â€“ GSS, 2016) within the 2008 edition of the United Nations System of National Accounts (UN, 2008) the new national income series includes an upwards shift of approximately 30 per cent in GDP, and new estimates of manufacturing value added which amount to an increase of approximately 350 per cent. Statistical comparability of the new GDP series, particularly within sub-Saharan Africa, is an area which will need further consideration.
O20|Are trade preferences a panacea? The African growth and opportunity act and African exports|"Does ""infant industry"" preferential access durably boost export performance? This paper exploits significant trade policy changes in the United States (US) to address this question. The expansion of Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) products for less developed countries in 1997 and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) in 2001 are used to assess whether preferential access boosts exports of eligible products in general and apparel specifically. The end of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) in 2005 is used to assess whether apparel export expansions survived the erosion of preferences. To find a causal impact of these changes, we use a triple-differences regression and 26 years of newly constructed trade and tariff data at the country-product-year level (1992-2017). The analysis finds that AGOA boosted African apparel exports and the GSP expansion increased African exports of other eligible products. While the marginal impacts on African apparel exports grew sharply in the first AGOA years, they leveled off after 2005, when the MFA end unleashed competition from Asian countries. The illusion of sustained African apparel exports is created by late-bloomers in East Africa offsetting boom-bust patterns in Southern Africa and insignificant responses in Central and West Africa. Firm-level customs data reveal that even in East Africa the recent export growth was driven by new entrants rather than incumbent firms whose competitiveness might have been nurtured by the big preference margins in the early AGOA period. Preferential access per se was not sufficient but needed to be complemented by specific domestic reforms: tariff liberalization, reduced regulatory burden, and enhanced connectivity."
O20|Employment Targeting in a Frictional Labor Market|Governments in both developing and developed economies play an active role in labor markets in the form of providing both formal public sector jobs and employment through public workfare programs. We refer to this as employment targeting. In the context of a simple search and matching friction model, we show that the propensity for the public sector to target more employment can increase the unemployment rate in the economy and lead to an increase in the size of the informal sector. Employment targeting can therefore have perverse effects on labor market outcomes.
O20|Income inequality and Economic Development: evidences from Brazilian Municipalities|This note aimed to investigate, within Brazilian municipalities, the relationship between income inequality and economic development. We used data from 5,566 Brazilian municipalities, and parametric and nonparametric tools were used. The results obtained show that there is no inverted-U relationship between these two variables. Our best model (the nonparametric model) suggest an U-shape relationship between income inequality and economic development. This finding differs from previous studies presented in the literature. This results indicates that even in the more developed municipalities, the gap between rich and poor is increasing.
O20|Challenges of Doing Business in Africa: A Systematic Review| This paper provides a systematic review of challenges to doing business in Africa. It complements the extant literature by answering two critical questions: what are the linkages between the ease of doing business and economic development; and what are the challenges to doing business in Africa? In providing answers to these questions, the nexus between the ease of doing business and economic development is discussed in six main strands, namely: wealth creation and sharing; opportunities of employment; balanced regional and economic development; Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and GDP per capita; standards of living and exports. Moreover, challenges to doing business are articulated along the following lines: (i) issues related to the cost of starting a business and doing business; (ii) shortage of energy and electricity; (iii) lack of access to finance; and (v) high taxes and low cross-border trade.
O20|Public–Private Partnership Systems in the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, and Indonesia|Infrastructure plays a critical role in boosting the economy’s overall productivity and development toward improving the quality of life. Public–private partnership (PPP) is considered as one of the key modalities for sustainable infrastructure development. This paper analyzes and compares the PPP systems in the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, and Indonesia to identify the requirements for making this modality an effective catalyst for infrastructure’s contribution to sustainable development. These countries have used the increased capacity and transactional experience in handling these partnerships to develop their PPP markets and strengthen their institutional framework to increase the use of PPPs to provide infrastructure services. A comparative analysis is then conducted to draw lessons for other economies in developing Asia seeking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their PPPs. The analysis underscores how strong institutions, unified procurement frameworks, and effective dispute resolution mechanisms can improve the implementation of infrastructure PPPs.
O20|Greening Finance Industry In Hong Kong: The Role Of Partnership|This paper adopted a case study approach to explore the role of partnerships between government, industry and education in transforming Hong Kong into a green finance hub. Findings from several interviews with the bank and finance companies in Hong Kong are presented, adding a new dimension to the existing literature in terms of providing new theoretical understanding to current practices with the intention of introducing environmental, social and governance (ESG) or sustainability related programs in the banking and finance industry of Hong Kong. The paper conceptualized existing partnership patterns in the finance industry with the education sector and government across the industry and explored their skills needs for the green economy. The study reported in the paper highlighted that there is need to scale up green finance market development in promoting environmental sustainability in Hong Kong. This requires specific green finance developmental strategies from the government, finance and banking business community as well as the support of partnerships with universities. Our results revealed that vocational professional educational and training providers may not have a significant impact and neither will they share a significant role in greening the finance sector. A theoretical model adopted for the study (quintuple helix model) was used to illustrate the interaction and the flow of knowledge and innovation between different actors in support of sustainable development (Carayannis et. al., 2012). Based on this model, a framework to support effective partnerships for greening the finance industry is suggested. Such actions as the uptake of green bond and social responsible investment and improving disclosure standard of environmental, social and governance aspects in the field are proposed as important aspects for partnerships.
O20|Promoting Metropolitan And Periurban Agriculture In Urban Climate: The Madre Project|The paper presents an approach to put forward Metropolitan and Peri-Urban Agriculture (MPA) in the framework of the MADRE Interreg MED project. The MADRE project, which stands for ?Metropolitan Agriculture for Developing and innovative sustainable and Responsible Economy?, is designing a methodological framework in order to identify and characterize best practices of MPA in Mediterranean urban conurbations. Aiming at promoting a change process in the metropolitan food supply model, the project will focus on identifying key factors that foster and hamper MPA development according to stakeholders actively involved in MPA, i.e. key players from the quadruple helix involving private actors (farmers, producers and SMEs), civil society (consumers? groups, NGOs), academia and research and public authorities. It should be noted that the MPA innitiatives started to be more and more considered as an important factor for supplying food to the city dwellers, not only in developing countries but also to the metropolitans of the Northern sphere. It can play a crucial role towards encountering climate change by backing up urban ecosystems and urban biodiversity. To address the challenges of MPA, the approach proposed by MADRE partners is to allow a technical and political empowerment of local food production networks of five countries (France, Greece, Italy, Albania and Spain) through the development of a transnational cluster of MPA stakeholders. Such a transnational organization and networking, will allow those actors to foster their eco-innovation capacity (i.e. producers? innovation, consumers? innovation, social innovation, territorial innovation, transnational innovation and academic research) and thus to increase their impact on national, regional and metropolitan policies. Although there are still gaps of knowledge and uncertainties in studying sustainability issues for the three pillars (environment, economy and society) the proposed approach provides a roadmap for decision-makers to put forward urban agriculture in an organized manner. (This paper has received funding from the ERDF through the MED Interreg Programme under Grant Agreement No. 1MED15_1.1_M3_138).
O20|A Dangerous Alliance? The Relationship Between Ecuador and China|Abstract The aim of this article is to outline the relationship between Ecuador and China, highlighting its main threats to the development of the Ecuadorian Republic, and in particular how the implementation of the buen vivir economic paradigm which Ecuador is experimenting with may be affected if it does not change the terms of engagement with the Asian giant. The article is structured as follows: in the introduction, we present an overview of the historical framework of the Chinese relationship with Ecuador. There follows an analysis supported by data on the commercial situation between the two countries and its implications for the development of the Latin-American state. In our final remarks, we present the possible routes that Ecuador could follow to secure its path to development, while highlighting possible conditions under which Ecuador could cooperate with China while avoiding a state of dependency.
O20|Development cooperation to ensure that none be left behind|The development cooperation system is undergoing a dramatic process of change. New actors are on stage, new instruments (beyond ODA) are being used, and the fields of work have been clearly widened. The enlargement of the development cooperation system is in line with the ambitious and comprehensive 2030 Agenda. However, those changes also imply massive tensions and challenges to the current development cooperation system in terms of its objectives, procedures and narrative. This paper presents some of these challenges in light of the â€œleaving no-one behindâ€ mandate. The paper discusses, firstly, how the development cooperation system can be brought up to date, taking into account massive changes in the international landscape; secondly, it argues why development cooperation may be still useful and effective in supporting an Agenda that goes beyond ODA; and finally, it discusses some dilemmas around the way in which resources should be allocated in order to preserve the distributive purpose of development cooperation.
O20|Western Balkans EU Accession: Is the 2025 Target Date Realistic?|The European Commission has set a target date of 2025 for Western Balkan EU accession, while also outlining a broader new strategy which includes Brussels taking a more active role in solving political disputes in the region, and upgrading infrastructure as part of the Berlin Process. We welcome these moves economic underdevelopment in the region is closely tied to political fractures. Aside from resolving political conflicts, improved governance in the region will also be necessary. In terms of meeting economic accession criteria, the region faces a host of challenges, but we believe that a focus on upgrading infrastructure and developing a much bigger and more competitive industrial base should be the priorities. While the economic influence of third parties in the region is not as significant as often portrayed, this is not guaranteed to last, particularly in the case of China, which is set to increase its economic presence in the Western Balkans in the coming years. Even if the region takes a great leap forward towards the EU, there are other barriers in the way which could also hold back accession. Nevertheless, while the 2025 target represents a highly ambitious best-case scenario, it could serve as a powerful incentive for countries in the region to speed up their reform agendas. We do not completely rule out at least Montenegro and Serbia joining the bloc by 2025 or shortly thereafter.
O20|Measuring Financial Capability of the Street Vendors|Financial capability of an individual is the ability to use and manage financial products for current and future financial needs with adequate financial knowledge. This paper examines financial capability on four dimensionsfinancial management to meet current needs, future financial planning, financial products management, and financial knowledge using a sample of street vendors in Bhubaneswar, India. A financial capability index for each individual in the sample has been calculated in a manner that satisfies monotonicity, anonymity, normalisation, uniformity, shortfall sensitivity and hiatus sensitivity to level axioms. We find that education, age, business experience, and daily turnover significantly affect the financial capability of an individual. Moreover, street vendors in regions with higher number of bank branches are found to have significantly higher financial capability
O20|Technological justice: A G20 agenda|Technological justice can play an important role within the international system in resolving global challenges and creating a smart and more egalitarian society. Technological and scientific developments are generating huge opportunities for tackling societal challenges. However, the benefits of technology and innovation are unequally distributed, and they tend to cause economic and political disruptions in our societies that widen inequalities within states as well as between countries. Digitalisation and, especially, automation are challenges that must be faced if developing countries are to avoid premature de-industrialization, expulsion from global value chains of the world economy, and the serious damage to their growth paths that would result. The authors propose adopting the concept of 'technological justice' within our societies as a new paradigm for the international system to reconcile technological advances with the societal challenges facing our global society, especially poverty and sustainability; and propose a number of policies and measures by which the G-20 could take on a central role in pushing this major contribution onto the global agenda. The authors participate in the T-20 network of think tanks that facilitates interaction between its members, the public policy community and the general public, being its primary objective to add value to the G20 process with evidence-based public policy proposals on areas of interest for the international agenda.
O20|Place-specific Determinants of Income Gaps: New Sub-National Evidence from Chiapas, Mexico|The literature on income gaps between Chiapas and the rest of Mexico revolves around individual factors, such as education and ethnicity. Yet, twenty years after the Zapatista rebellion, the schooling gap between Chiapas and the other Mexican entities has shrunk while the income gap has widened, and we find no evidence indicating that Chiapas indigenes are worse-off than their likes elsewhere in Mexico. We explore a different hypothesis. Based on census data, we calculate the economic complexity index, a measure of the knowledge agglomeration embedded in the economic activities at a municipal level in Mexico. Economic complexity explains a larger fraction of the income gap than any individual factor. Our results suggest that chiapanecos are not the problem, the problem is Chiapas. These results hold when we extend our analysis to Mexico’s thirty-one federal entities, suggesting that place-specific determinants that have been overlooked in both the literature and policy, have a key role in the determination of income gaps.
O20|Transferencias condicionadas y sus impactos sobre el desempeño económico local: Evidencia para Colombia|Este artículo examina el efecto del programa de transferencias monetarias condicionadas (CCT) Familias en Acción (FA) sobre el desarrollo económico local. Utilizando el impuesto municipal de industria y comercio como proxy de la actividad económica local mediante el uso de datos panel complementados con las técnicas de Soporte Común se obtienen resultados que sugieren que el programa está asociado negativamente con el desempeño económico de los municipios en el largo plazo. El aumento de una desviación estándar en el stock de las transferencias de FA, genera una disminución de 0,13 desviaciones estándar en este impuesto. Además se encuentra que mayores transferencias acumuladas per cápita de FA están asociadas a menores niveles de impuesto predial –siendo este último proxy de capital físico- el cual es un canal a través del que se explica la relación negativa entre las transferencias de FA y el desempeño económico. En complemento se evidencio que el programa FA ha contribuido a aumentar el capital humano en los municipios con hogares beneficiarios. Sin embargo, particularmente su efecto global en el desarrollo económico no es necesariamente positivo.
O20|Inversión en actividades de ciencia, tecnología e innovación|Los constantes cambios generados por las actividades de ciencia, tecnología y la innovación (ACTI) y las rápidas transformaciones de la sociedad producto de los avances en la investigación y el desarrollo (I+D) y la innovación en diferentes áreas del conocimiento sugieren que estos nuevos desarrollos sean tenidos en cuenta en las metodologías para el cálculo de los indicadores. Por tanto, no es incompatible que la forma como se miden los indicadores de ACTI e I+D presenten cambios y actualizaciones que busquen adaptar las estadísticas de ciencia, tecnología e innovación (CTI) a los nuevos estándares internacionales y a las diferentes necesidades de la sociedad. Desde esta perspectiva la medición es un insumo fundamental para determinar las mejores políticas a implementar en temas de Investigación y Desarrollo de los países dada las nuevas teorías del crecimiento económico.

O20|Long Run Growth in Haiti|In this paper, we first assess the historical evolution of total factor productivity in Haiti and then consider alternative scenarios related to accelerating growth. Specifically, we focus on issues of intertemporal coordination between population growth, TFP (Total Factor Productivity), capital accumulation, foreign debt, output, and consumption. To that end, we developed a model of the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans type. This class of models are the workhorse of most contemporary work in modeling the long and very long term growth of countries (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004 and Acemoglu 2009). In doing so, we make two contributions to the empirical economic analysis of developing countries such as Haiti: (a) we estimate Haiti’s capital stock and perform a growth accounting exercises using data that goes back to the 1950s; and (b) we built a 2016 macro consistent dataset and use it to calibrate a long-run growth model for a small open economy such as Haiti.
O20|Who Creates New Firms When Local Opportunities Arise?|New firm formation is a critical driver of job creation, and an important contributor to the responsiveness of the economy to aggregate shocks. In this paper we examine the characteristics of the individuals who become entrepreneurs when local opportunities arise due to an increase in local demand. We identify local demand shocks by linking fluctuations in global commodity prices to municipality level agricultural endowments in Brazil. We find that firm creation response is almost entirely driven by young individuals with generalist and managerial skills. In contrast, we find no such response within the same municipalities among skilled, yet older individuals. Those individuals who respond to local demand shocks are younger and more skilled than the average entrepreneur in the population. Entrepreneurial response of young individuals is larger in municipalities with better access to finance, more skilled human capital, and with overall younger demographics. These results highlight how the characteristics of the local population can have a significant impact on the entrepreneurial responsiveness of the economy.
O20|The Value of Biodiversity as an Insurance Device|This paper presents a benchmark endogenous growth model including biodiversity preservation dynamics. Producing food requires land, and increasing the share of total land devoted to farming mechanically reduces the share of land devoted to biodiversity conservation. However, the safeguarding of a greater number of species is associated to better ecosystem services – pollination, flood control, pest control, etc., which in turn ensure a lower volatility of agricultural productivity. The optimal conversion/preservation rule is explicitly characterized, as well as the value of biological diversity, in terms of the welfare gain of biodiversity conservation. The Epstein-Zin-Weil specification of the utility function allows us to disentangle the effects of risk aversion and aversion to fluctuations. A two-player game extension of the model highlights the effect of volatility externalities and the Paretian sub-optimality of the decentralized choice.
O20|"Contemporary Frontier Transformation for Inclusive Growth: The Dual Role of ""Smart"" Competitiveness Factors"|"Objective - This paper aims to contribute to inclusive development literature by empirically verifying that some ""smart"" or ""knowledge-and innovation-related"" competitiveness enhancing factors, besides raising competitiveness and growth, enable inclusiveness and sustainability. Methodology/Technique - The methodology used includes making ranks of frontier, advanced countries based on World Economic Forum data regarding competitive quantities and qualities of smart factors and growth and inclusive and sustainable outcomes. Then, a Spearman's rank correlation analysis is used to determine the similarities between each factor rank and each outcome rank. Findings - The smart factors show a significant relationship with both growth and inclusiveness/sustainability outcomes; this may be a target for use as policy instruments to promote both growth and inclusiveness. The study found that higher levels of business-sophistication and network-related training, access and use of existing-technology, and ICT utilization factors contribute to higher levels of growth and also infer higher levels of employment, intergeneration eco-adjusted savings and lower levels of inequality, poverty and carbon intensity. Novelty - Given that current government and international organization policies aimed at improving competitiveness/growth vis-à-vis inclusiveness/sustainability remain separated, the results of this study may assist in improving the collaboration between these two objectives. The policy implications of this study include: certain dual competitive-inclusive enhancing policies can be suitably designed and targeted to uplift smart elements and the acceleration of inclusiveness and sustainability alongside the competitiveness-growth nexus. Further, developing countries may learn to leapfrog the development frontier without developing competitiveness and inclusiveness/sustainability separately, but rather each at a time."
O20|Turgot, Smith and Steuart on Stadial Histories|The theory of the stages of society appeared in the mid-18th century. Following a successful reception over the course of the second half of the century, the four-stage theory was finally adopted by Classical Economics, holding that the exchange economy is the final outcome of a long period of economic development. This paper carries out a comparative analysis of the stadial histories of Turgot, Smith and Steuart. We found theories which were similar, but which were identical in the pre-eminence of the productive forces and economic organisation. Firstly, a number of dynamic principles are noted?i.e., a natural tendency to improve their conditions, a series of shocks that change the historical stage and the innovative capacity of some individuals. Secondly, the necessary conditions for the movement from the agricultural stage to commercial society do not coincide. Turgot requires an accumulation of capital, Smith uses the market and Steuart points to the artificial institutions created by merchants. This is the central point in order to understand the differences between their economic theories.
O20|The Economic Benefits of Investing in Cultural Tourism: Evidence from the Colonial City of Santo Domingo|This paper draws together quantitative methodologies from environmental and tourism economics to develop a framework for evaluating investments in cultural tourism. Indirect and induced benefits of investment in cultural tourism contribute to the overall returns on investment and not including these considerations can result in a nontrivial undervaluation of returns. To illustrate the approach, the framework is applied to a hypothetical US$90 million investment in cultural tourism in the Colonial City of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. While there is an opportunity cost of allocating resources to cultural tourism, this paper demonstrates the costs of not doing so by considering a disinvestment in cultural tourism. Results of the analysisshow greater economic growth and household well-being with increased investment, with disinvestment generating significant negative consequences for economic output, employmentand terms of trade.
O20|Smart City Indicators: Can They Improve Governance in Croatian Large Cities?|The focus of this research is to implement the smart city methodology and develop smart city indicators for twenty-five large Croatian cities in order to develop a reference model for monitoring the success of Croatian large cities. Starting from the fact that only two Croatian cities have prepared a smart management strategy and that only thirty cities have developed smart projects in various sectors, the purpose of this research is to show the development of smart city indicators for the large cities through six dimensions of the smart city model: smart economy, smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart environment and smart living. The smart city indicators are based on publicly accessible data and easily available sources. In addition, web scraping techniques were used to obtain data that are not available from public sources. After data collection, all variables were standardized, allowing the comparison of indicators of different measuring units. Twenty-nine indicators were identified and used to compare the twenty-five large Croatian cities and evaluate their comparative advantages. The main results of the research include an assessment of the smart urban development index and ranking of cities according to the degree of urban development. The smart city indicator is above average in only eleven large cities. Measures for promoting smart development have been proposed to city policy-makers. The research results have implications for increasing rationality in the use of local public resources.
O20|Who Creates New Firms When Local Opportunities Arise?|New firm formation is a critical driver of job creation, and an important contributor to the responsiveness of the economy to aggregate shocks. In this paper we examine the characteristics of the individuals who become entrepreneurs when local opportunities arise due to an increase in local demand. We identify local demand shocks by linking fluctuations in global commodity prices to municipality level agricultural endowments in Brazil. We find that the firm creation response is almost entirely driven by young and skilled individuals, as measured by their level of experience, education, and past occupations involving creativity, problem-solving and managerial roles. In contrast, we find no such response within the same municipalities among skilled, yet older individuals, highlighting the importance of lifecycle considerations. These responsive individuals are younger and more skilled than the average entrepreneur in the population. The entrepreneurial response of young individuals is larger in municipalities with better access to finance, and in municipalities with more skilled human capital. These results highlight how the characteristics of the local population can have a significant impact on the entrepreneurial responsiveness of the economy.
O20|Does Workfare Work Well? The Case of the Employment Generation Program for the Poorest in Bangladesh|Evidence on the effectiveness of workfare as an anti-poverty program in developing countries is weak compared with the relatively well-established role of public works during economic crisis as a social safety net. This paper contributes to evidence building by examining the impact of a large-scale workfare program in Bangladesh, the Employment Generation Program for the Poorest. Taking advantage of the program's distinguishable feature of direct wage transfer to a person's bank account, the paper uses accessibility to local banks as an instrumental variable to identify the program's impacts on rural social assistance beneficiaries. Based on locality-by-time fixed effects models over two rounds of locality panel data, the analysis finds that the Employment Generation Program for the Poorest has contributed to increasing overall household consumption and reducing outstanding loans. In particular, expenditures on quality food and health care have significantly increased, which likely helps individuals continue to engage in income-generating activities in the labor market. However, the implementation costs and poor quality of public assets built through work projects could potentially undermine the program's efficiency. Moreover, further evidence is required on the impacts of work experience through workfare on subsequent labor market outcomes and the value of public assets, to assess the program's effectiveness compared with administratively simpler alternative instruments such as unconditional cash transfers.
O20|Economics and Economic Methodology in a Core-Periphery Economic World| This paper uses a core-periphery distinction to characterize contemporary economics, economic methodology, and also today's world economy. First, it applies the distinction to the organization of contemporary economics through an examination of the problem of explaining economics' relations to and boundaries with other disciplines. Second, it argues that economics' core-periphery organization is replicated in a similar organization of the use and practice of contemporary economic methodology in economics. Third, it draws on the use of the core-periphery thinking in economics itself and the uneven development of the world economy to provide possible foundations for economics and economic methodology being organized in core-periphery terms. Fourth, the paper briefly discusses three as a potential countervailing forces operating on the development of contemporary economics that might work against its core-periphery organization.

O20|Travel Cost and Dropout from Secondary Schools in Nepal|The study relates the association between travel time to the lower secondary and secondary public schools of Nepal and the dropout grade before leaving secondary school using an ordered logit model. It is shown that as the travel time to the school increases, students are more likely to dropout from the school system in earlier grades. The results from this study will be useful to policymakers, especially from developing countries, as it places transport in the context of education.
O20|Breaking Down the Myths of Triangular Co-operation in Middle East and North Africa|The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development identifies triangular co-operation as a promising modality to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Triangular co-operation is thought mainly to happen in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). This working paper shows that triangular co-operation is a modality that is also used in other regions and therefore dispels the myth that there is little triangular co-operation in the Middle East and North Africa. Arab countries and institutions engage in triangular co-operation, be it as pivotal, facilitating or beneficiary partner. Yet, their activities, approaches and solutions to tackle development challenges have not been sufficiently captured in research on the topic. Arab triangular co-operation activities are of relatively longer duration and have bigger budgets than general triangular co-operation trends; activities often follow clear guidelines and are integrated into broader development co-operation strategies – even if Arab providers do not always characterise their activities as ‘triangular’. To conclude, this working paper identifies the added value of triangular co-operation in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and shows how triangular co-operation can promote further collaboration between the Arab providers and the members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), thus helping them to be more effective in supporting partner countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
O20|Operationalising selected reporting and flexibility provisions in the Paris Agreement|An enhanced transparency framework is a central component of the Agreement, and will apply to all Parties, with flexibility for developing country Parties that need it in the light of their capacities. This paper examines how such flexibility might be operationalised when reporting information under the future enhanced transparency system for greenhouse gas inventories and for progress towards the mitigation component of NDCs under Article 4. The paper also highlights how improvements over time in reporting of adaptation, and support needed and received could be encouraged. For each individual reporting element in these four areas, the paper identifies possible ways that countries with a range of different capacity levels could provide information for specific elements under the four reporting areas examined in the paper.
O20|Child well-being and the Sustainable Development Goals: How far are OECD countries from reaching the targets for children and young people?|This paper summarises available evidence on the distance that OECD countries need to travel in order to reach the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets for children and young people. More than 50 indicators are included in this analysis, covering 43 of the 169 targets, and 11 of the 17 Goals. The analysis finds that, on average, OECD countries are still far from reaching the targets pertaining to Goals 4 “Quality education”, and 8 “Decent work and economic growth”. Goals 1 “No poverty”, 2 “Zero hunger” and 16 “Peace, justice and strong institutions” are also highlighted as priority areas. However, the results vary widely across OECD countries, and among specific targets within each of the goals. Yet, all of these findings need to be considered in light of what it is not currently possible to measure. In particular, there are large data gaps for Goals 1 (“No poverty”), 5 (“Gender equality”), 11 (“Sustainable cities and communities”), and 16 (“Peace, justice and strong institutions”).
O20|Identifying the Factors Driving West African Migration|Since 2014 over 600 000 African migrants have arrived in Italy through the perilous Central Mediterranean route, and nearly 120 000 arrived in 2017. This paper is the first examination of migration motivations at the individual level using nationally representative surveys and focus group data collected in West Africa. Respondents in six West African countries cite economic factors as the reason for migrating and those who wish to stay claim family and love of country as the ties that bind. The study then specifically focuses on Nigeria, the country of origin for a quarter of all Africans traveling through the Central Mediterranean route. Half of the Nigerians were interested in leaving their country of origin if given the opportunity, well above the number in neighbouring countries. Evidence from the six-country survey suggests individuals are migrating for economic reasons but statistical analysis of the Nigeria data reveals a different set of push factors behind the desire to migrate. In fact, economic standing has a limited effect on Nigerians’ desire to leave their home. Instead, individual perceptions of the strength of Nigeria’s democracy are most strongly associated with Nigerians’ desire to migrate abroad, in addition to low levels of trust in local security institutions. Urban and more highly educated Nigerians, especially from Lagos, are also more likely to want to migrate abroad. These findings shed new light on domestic policy steps that could address the grievances and concerns of those who seek to migrate.
O20|The Arab Spring was predictable in 2007: Empirics of Proof|We model core demands for better governance (political, economic and institutional), more employment and less consumer price inflation using a methodological innovation on the complete elimination of cross-country differences in signals susceptible of sparking social revolts. The empirical evidence based on 14 MENA countries show that the Arab Spring was predictable in 2007 to occur between January 2011 and April 2012. While the findings predict the wave of cross-country revolutions with almost mathematical precision, caveats and cautions are discussed for the scholar to understand the expositional dimensions of the empirics.
O20|Labor Misallocation and Mass Mobilization: Russian Agriculture during the Great War|We exploit a quasi-natural experiment of military draftees in Russia during World War I to examine the effects of a massive, negative labor shock on agricultural production. Employing a novel district-level panel data set, we find that mass mobilization produces a dramatic decrease in cultivated area. Surprisingly, farms with communal land tenure exhibit greater resilience to the labor shock than private farms. The resilience stems from peasants reallocating labor in favor of the commune because of the increased attractiveness of its nonmarket access to land and social insurance. Our results support an institutional explanation of factor misallocation in agriculture.

O20|Debt Relief and Good Governance: New Evidence|Debt relief has been an instrument of development cooperation for almost 50 years. Its track record is mixed at best, and its drivers were mainly political during its practice. However, in the early 2000s, the HIPC Initiative increased the economic rationality remarkably, because LDCs had to deliver before they were relieved from their debt. Since then, debt as well as its relief has fallen significantly. In addition, the recipient countries have changed, more fragile countries are among the top recipients. We discuss the hypothesis that debt relief has changed another time; it nowadays seems to be – at least partly – a diplomatic instrument. We find that there is no significant improvement of governance quality within our sample of developing countries. Our regression results show that improvements in governance quality lead to higher level of debt forgiveness in 2000-2004 but not in the subsequent periods. Instead, we find that debt relief is determined by governmental spending behavior of the creditor country, which in turn can be explained by the fractionalization of the government. The analysis uses data from 1995 to 2013 and applies a 2-Step-Heckman filter model and a panel model with fixed country and year effects.
O20|Seeing is believing- can increasing the number of female leaders reduce sex selection in rural India?|Cultural values regarding gender roles encourage gender discrimination and the practice of sex selection. Increasing political and work force participation of women challenges such norms. Exploiting the implementation of an Indian law that required one-third of local political seats to be reserved for women, I investigate the impact of female leadership on sex selection in rural India. I find an increase in the survival of higher birth order girls if political seats at the local level have been reserved for women. I argue that the likely underlying mechanism is a change in beliefs due to exposure to female leaders.

O20|The Impact of Regime Type on Food Consumption in Low Income Countries|Competing studies use food consumption to measure the impact of political regime on the welfare of the poor. Democracies may outperform autocracies by using growth to hide redistribution, improving caloric consumption and currying favor. Alternatively, autocracies may have greater incentives to lower food prices to quell urban unrest. We test these competing theories using a more detailed, continuous, nuanced measure of food consumption quality ï¿½ cereal equivalent values. We find evidence to support the second hypothesis, that autocracies outperform democracies at low incomes. For higher incomes, democracies perform significantly better. Segregated by growth, autocracies again outperform democracies at low incomes.
O20|Strategic Management Tools and Techniques: A Comparative Analysis of Empirical Studies|There is no doubt that strategic management tools and techniques are important parts of the strategic management process. Their use in organizations should be observed in a practice-based context. This paper analyzes the empirical studies on the usage of strategic management tools and techniques. Hence, the main aim of this study is to investigate and analyze which enterprises, according to their country development level, use more strategic management tools and techniques and which of these are used the most. Also, this paper investigates which strategic management tools and techniques are used globally according to the results of empirical studies. The study presents a summary of empirical studies for the period 1990–2015. The research results indicate that more strategic tools and techniques are used in developed countries, followed by developing countries and fewest in countries in transition. This study is likely to contribute to the field of strategic management because it summarizes the most used strategic tools and techniques at the global level according to varying stages of countries’ economic development. Also, the findings from this study may be utilized to maximize the full potential of enterprises and reduce the cases of entrepreneurship failures, through creating awareness of the importance of using strategic management tools and techniques.
O20|Between-group contests over group-specific public goods with within-group fragmentation|Abstract We model a contest between two groups of equal sized populations over the division of a group-specific public good. Each group is fragmented into subgroups. Each subgroup allocates effort between production and contestation. Perfect coordination is assumed within subgroups, but subgroups cannot coordinate with one another. All subgroups choose effort allocations simultaneously. We find that the group that is more internally fragmented receives the smaller share of the public good. Aggregate rent-seeking increases when the dominant subgroups within both communities have larger population shares. Any unilateral increase in fragmentation within a group reduces conflict and increases the total income of its opponent. Strikingly, the fragmenting community itself may, however, increase its total income as well, even though its share of the public good declines. Hence, a smaller share of public good provisioning cannot be used to infer a negative income effect on the losing community.
O20|Decolonization, Property Rights and Language Conflicts|We model political contestation over school language policy, within linguistic communities where weak property rights protection leads to high decentralized expropriation. We show that improvements in governance institutions that facilitate property rights protection might exacerbate such language conflicts, even as they reduce the chances of persisting with educational indigenization, while, paradoxically, increasing the net social benefit from doing so. Our findings offer explanations of why languages and cultures of the colonizers continue to play a dominant role in the educational systems of most post-colonial developing societies, and why early post-independence attempts at cultural-linguistic indigenization were either reversed or slowed down subsequently. The main policy implication of our analysis relates to the connection it establishes between property rights protection and the welfare consequences of educational indigenization: such indigenization may improve social welfare when weak institutions lead to weak property rights protection, but reduce it otherwise.
O20|"Aging population in Asian countries |Lessons from Japanese experiences |"|Many Asian countries are facing a rapidly aging population. An aging population will cause social security expenditures in national budget to rise. Currently, fiscal conditions in Asian countries are relatively stable, but governments will be required to control social security expenditures to maintain fiscal soundness. Japan established universal health insurance and pension insurance systems in 1961. In 1973, the so called gfirst year of high-level social welfare h, free medical services for the elderly and the indexlinked pension system were started. Currently, in Japan, the aging rate, which measures the share of the population aged 65 years old or over, has reached 27%, while the country continues to face fiscal deficits and government debt has been accumulating. Other Asian countries have started to develop their countries f social security systems, so it is time to review the lessons that can be drawn from Japanese experiences relating to social security expenditures and national budget conditions. In this paper, we focused on Japanese social insurance systems, especially health insurance and pension insurance systems, and addressed some lessons to Asian countries. Lessons from health insurance system are: (1) It is important to determine public contributions f share of medical expenses not by patients f age, but based on their income and assets, (2) To establish universal health insurance system, it is important to ensure the stable financial revenues of insurers with subscribers who are unable to enroll with other insurers. Lessons from the pension insurance system are: (1) It is important for the government to manage sharp acceleration of inflation in such a way as to not increase pension benefits, thereby preventing the financial burdening of future generations, (2) The pension system should be designed based on the long-term projections of the population aging rate and total fertility rate, and policies should be adapted accordingly, (3) It would be preferable that the government take a gMacro-economic slide h pension system which is a fixed contribution schedule coupled with a mechanism to rebalance pension finances through automatic adjustment of benefits.
O20|Experimentation at Scale|"This paper makes the case for greater use of randomized experiments ""at scale."" We review various critiques of experimental program evaluation in developing countries, and discuss how experimenting at scale along three specific dimensions—the size of the sampling frame, the number of units treated, and the size of the unit of randomization—can help alleviate the concerns raised. We find that program-evaluation randomized controlled trials published over the last 15 years have typically been ""small"" in these senses, but also identify a number of examples—including from our own work—demonstrating that experimentation at much larger scales is both feasible and valuable."
O20|Employment, Education and the State|The 2016 India Employment Report demolishes the myths of both `demographic dividend' and `jobless growth' in the India growth story. But it recognises that the growth of decent, productive employment is too slow even to absorb the annual increment of new workers in the workforce, let alone eliminate the huge backlog of open unemployment and low productivity underemployment. This paper argues that this challenge is a man-made problem, the consequence of a range of dysfunctional policies that have a strong anti-employment bias. Moreover, a long standing elitist bias in education policy has pre-empted the provision of quality basic education without which the bulk of the workforce cannot be suitably skilled for decent, productive employment. The paper suggests that these dysfunctional policies are attributable to a fractionalized polity and India's soft state, which stands in sharp contrast to the hard states seen in the dramatically successful East Asian model of guided capitalism.
O20|Data for Development: DAC member priorities and challenges|The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development commits the international community to support the modernisation and strengthening of national statistical capacities and systems in developing countries and to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data to measure their progress against the Sustainable Development Goals. This paper, informed by a survey circulated among DAC members between February and April 2017, presents DAC members’ policies and practices to support national statistical capacities and systems in developing countries. It highlights some of the main challenges that DAC members face in relation to making data work for sustainable development, notably in co-ordinating their support for statistics to avoid duplication and find synergies, in mobilising more resources, and in using quality data for development co-operation decision-making, programming, monitoring and reporting. The findings presented in this paper will inform the analysis of the 2017 Development Co-operation Report on Data for Development which will be published in October 2017. The report will provide guidance to providers of development assistance on how to best support developing countries to have and use quality and timely data for enabling delivery of the SDGs.
O20|Dispelling the myths of triangular co-operation: Evidence from the 2015 OECD survey on triangular co-operation|Triangular co-operation features in the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda as an instrument to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. It combines the comparative advantages of the different partners involved, creates synergies, promotes learning among all partners and builds relationships based on trust. However, several myths have developed about triangular co-operation projects 1) being small in scale and scope, operating only in niche areas; 2) lacking systematic planning and implementation mechanisms; and 3) having no clear value added. This report addresses these three “myths” by analysing the results from a survey of triangular co-operation that the OECD conducted in 2015. It provides evidence on the “reality” from over 400 projects that were reported by the 60 respondents. The report concludes that triangular co-operation is a highly relevant and strategic mode of co-operation with increasing numbers of projects, budgets and durations, established planning mechanisms and a clear value added.
O20|Strengthening the results chain: Synthesis of case studies of results-based management by providers|This paper presents an analysis of evidence from seven case studies of results-based management by development co-operation providers. Analysis of themes from the case studies reveal six interrelated challenges which providers face in their efforts to manage for the results of development co-operation. The six challenges are: linking results to development goals, ensuring the purpose of results systems is well-defined, weighing up the benefits of aggregating and attributing results from standard indicators, enabling country ownership, using performance information alongside results information, and building and embedding a results culture. Providers continue to adopt a range of approaches to pursue a focus on results and there are many examples of good practice. The case studies suggest that in a complex development landscape some providers are prioritising the use of aggregated results information for domestic accountability, communication, and performance management over their use for learning and policy direction. In this context, the paper argues that in agency-wide results frameworks development co-operation results are often detached (or de-contextualised) from development results and discusses the implications of this, including the use of standard indicators to measure aggregated outputs. The paper uses case study evidence to discuss and suggest practical ways providers can build and maintain a strong results focus which enables analysis, insights and learning, and has achievement of development outcomes as its objective.

Policy priorities to overcome the middle-income trap in Latin America|The empirical literature on development has labelled as “middle-income trap” (MIT) the fact that many developing economies struggle to adjust to new sources of growth after reaching middle-income levels. For Latin America and the Caribbean, this is an especially challenging scenario, as only Chile, Trinidad and Tobago, and Uruguay have become high-income economies in the last six decades while several other LAC countries, already middle-income as early as 1950, stayed in that income range. This paper analyses empirically the main policy areas explaining the MIT, based on the experiences of 76 emerging economies and OECD countries, comparing those which evaded it and those which stayed there since the 1950s. Based on more than 200 000 estimations using a linear discriminant analysis, we identify institutional, social and economic features that help characterise policy priorities to overcome the middle-income trap. Furthermore, using the Synthetic Control Method, we present for selected Latin American countries their main policy gaps according to their unique characteristics.
O20|The Rural Economics of René de Girardin: Landscapes at the Service of l’Idéologie Nobiliaire|René-Louis de Girardin is remembered for having invited Rousseau at Ermenonville estate. Girardin believed it was necessary to further the debate on gardens on the basis of a principle of continuity that rejects any idea of enclosure. This made it possible to establish an agricultural model that increased production, and finally allowed the monopoly in grain sales to be broken. At the service of l’idéologie nobiliaire, his analysis shows the existence of a form of economic thinking in the second half of the 18th century that, giving primacy to agriculture, nevertheless cannot fall within the paths of physiocrats and agronomes.
O20|The Importance of Government Effectiveness for Transitions toward Greater Electrification in Developing Countries|Electricity is a vital factor underlying modern living standards, but there are many developing countries with low levels of electricity access and use. We seek to systematically identify the crucial elements underlying transitions toward greater electrification in developing countries. We use a cross-sectional regression approach with national-level data up to 2012 for 135 low- and middle-income countries. The paper finds that the effectiveness of governments is the most important governance attribute for encouraging the transition to increased electrification in developing countries, on average. The results add to the growing evidence on the importance of governance for development outcomes. Donors seeking to make more successful contributions to electrification may wish to target countries with more effective governments.
O20|Opening the Black Box: Managing the Aid Policy Process in Pakistan|Scholars have suggested the need to open the ‘black box’ of the aid delivery system to gain a deeper understanding of how the aid policy process works in practice. This research responds to this gap in the literature by exploring how donors and the Pakistan government interact in game and network settings to manage foreign aid in the complex aid policy network. Using Klijn and Koppenjan’s (2016) process analysis, this research explores specific network management strategies actors employ to govern the aid policy process, and facilitate game and network interactions. The findings indicate that connecting strategies were the most prevalent strategies in managing the aid policy process in Pakistan. In strategic donor government interactions, incentives, research, and informality not only promote collaboration and cooperation, but also enable actors to mitigate stagnation and influence policy decisions. New insights from this research are valuable in improving existing knowledge about how the aid community interacts and manages the aid policy process on the ground; which would eventually contribute to the understanding of aid effectiveness.
O20|Evaluation des pays en voie de développement selon la réalisation des objectifs du millénaire pour le développement : cas de la mortalité infantile en république démocratique du Congo (RDC)<BR>[Evaluation of developing countries according to the accomplishment of the millennium development goals: case of infant mortality in the democratic republic of Congo (DRC)]|"As the global Millennium Development Goals program has come to an end, it is time to evaluate the efforts of various countries that have subscribed to this vast program launched since the beginning of the third millennium. As far as we are concerned in this work, we are evaluating developing countries according to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) in general and in particular the fourth objective: ""to reduce infant mortality by 2/3 until 2015 "". The main objective of this paper is therefore to verify the achievement of this objective in the DRC for the period 1990 to 2015. Our analyze of the data collected at the World Bank site on the infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births) led to the conclusion that the DRC had reduced the infant mortality by 3/10, A value below the MDG threshold fixed at 2/3; In spite of the many strategies undertaken by the DRC for this purpose. This shows that the DRC has not reached the fourth Millennium Development Goal until 2015."
O20|The Roles of Knowledge Management for the Development of Organizations|Knowledge is the most important factor of production, next to labor, land and capital. It is about managing and sharing knowledge for the development of an organization. In the competitive business world, knowledge management (KM) has become more essential for the sustainable development of organizations. In the 21st century knowledge and KM become the most professional element in many fields of knowledge, such as, education, cognitive science, health, sociology, management science, information science, computer science, information and technology, economics, philosophy, psychology, knowledge engineering, artificial intelligence and all branches of business. Through the application of successful KM, organizations can improve their effectiveness and can gain competitive advantage. KM helps in the decision making process for the benefit of a company. It leads to higher efficiency in terms of less duplication of work, followed by notably better performance, enhancing new staffs’ capabilities and better quality decisions. The paper discusses the fundamentals and the importance of KM for professionals, users and technology experts. This article also examines the concepts of knowledge and KM in organizations. The major challenges and barriers for implementation of KM in organizations are discussed in some details. Additionally, the paper discusses the proficiencies, responsibilities, profiles and the roles of a knowledge manager. An attempt has been taken here to enhance knowledge related efficiencies in any organization.
O20|Neocolonialism or Balanced Partnership? Reframing Agricultural Relations Between the EU and Africa|The narratives in the media with respect to EU external policies and their effects on developing countries generally paint a picture of unequal power dynamics and negative externalities, particularly with respect to international trade and land grabbing. In this paper, I use trade data to argue that reality is more nuanced and aim to provide a preliminary sketch of the institutional dynamics between the EU and Africa. I focus on agricultural relationships to highlight the interplay between historical path dependencies, colonialism, trade policy and domestic institutions on the EU and African side. While trade is often portrayed in an overly simplified manner as the main factor hindering agricultural development, African countries are often plagued by a long history of extractive institutions, both politically and economically, which lead to a vicious cycle of unequally distributed resources, exploitation, insecure human rights and a lack of incentives for innovation. This becomes apparent when examining phenomena such as land-grabbing, which often involve African elites partnering with foreign investors to conclude controversial deals. Overall, this paper aims to highlight the necessity of building institutional capacity particularly in countries with a long history of extractive institutional continuity, and to underline the importance of state centralisation for agricultural development, so that African partners can fully take advantage of the preferential trade regime with the EU and improve their position with respect to power dynamics.
O20|Women Empowerment Index: Construction of a Tool to Measure Rural Women Empowerment Level in India|Poverty ignites the societal gap between men and women, while economic development narrows it down through its gender promotional activities. There is bidirectional relationship between economic development and empowerment of women. Women empowerment, being dependent on complex sociological and economic issues, needs to be measured in terms of specific parameters like ‘access to resources’, ‘decision making capability’ and ‘ability to take a stand’. This particular study develops an Index based on few sector-specific parameters to measure empowerment level of women engaged in Self Help Groups. Both ‘individual empowerment index’ and ‘group empowerment indices’ have been constructed, where‘financial liberty’, ‘ability to take decisions’, ‘heath condition of the women and ‘ability to stand up against the evils of the society’ have been considered as her empowerment parameters. The index was applied on 300 SHG Group members of rural West Bengal, which provided us an idea about the existing level of rural women empowerment in West Bengal.
O20|Dependency and Hegemony in Neoliberal South Africa|This article is about South Africa in the post-apartheid period. It has two aspects; first it examines the social and political process through which the African National Congress (ANC) shifted its emphasis away from the construction of the nationalist project (as defined by its 1955 Freedom Charter), towards a world view that privileges markets as the main organising mechanisms in society. Inevitably, accompanying this shift to neoliberalism there has been a corresponding surrender of macroeconomic economic policy autonomy. Such policy is now geared to propitiating global markets that periodically exhibit high degrees of instability. The question arises – how is the ANC able to manage two diametrically opposed tendencies without social upheaval and dislocation? The answers proffered here centres on hegemonic and dependency dynamics that are in motion in contemporary South Africa.
O20|Fertility and rural electrification in Bangladesh|We use a panel dataset from Bangladesh to examine the relationship between fertility and the adoption of electricity with the latter instrumented by infrastructure development and the quality of service delivery. We find that the adoption of electricity reduces fertility, and this impact is more pronounced when the household already has two or more children. This observation can be explained by a simple household model of time use, in which adoption of electricity affects only the optimal number of children but not necessarily current fertility behavior if the optimal number has not yet been reached.
O20|Contemporary Reforms in the Arabic System: Roots, Causes and Modern State-Building Challenges|This paper will focus on the common factors among Arab countries, which have experienced dramatic social and political changes since 2011. Rapid developments in the Arab world are expected to introduce an environment for the establishment of a new socio-political system. Sudden Arabic uprising, will be analyzed according to major historical and intellectual political changes throughout the modern era, in an attempt to challenge the argument that the Arabs will stay out of the historical context of the evolution of democracy.The main hypothesis of the study will emphasize that the current episodes of Arab Spring was triggered by a combination of economic, social and political factors directly related to the daily life of the people in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria among others Arabic countries. However, the aspirations and expectations of the masses exceeded the classical materialistic needs even for millions of low class citizens. The call for freedom, dignity and equality convincingly require an intellectual perspective for a modern state-building. The consequences of the Arab revolutions will open further areas for unprecedented challenges at both short and long terms of modern state-building. Major breakthrough in this evolution will certainly return Arabic political sociology to the heart of history. It will prove that Arabs can provide a genuine intellectual system with a valuable contribution to the progress of modern human civilization.
O20|Culture, diffusion, and economic development: The problem of observational equivalence|This research explores the direct and barrier effects of culture on economic development. It shows both theoretically and empirically that whenever the technological frontier is at the top or bottom of the world distribution of a cultural value, there exists an observational equivalence between absolute cultural distances and cultural distances relative to the frontier, preventing the identification of its direct and barrier effects. Since the technological frontier usually has the “right” cultural values for development, it tends to be in the extremes of the distribution of cultural traits, generating observational equivalence and confounding the analysis. These results highlight the difficulty of disentangling the direct and barrier effects of culture. The empirical analysis finds suggestive evidence for direct effects of individualism and conformity with hierarchy, and barrier effects of hedonism.
O20|Childhood health and educational investment under risk|Abstract A huge literature shows that childhood health and educational attainment are highly correlated. However, estimates for the effect of childhood health on educational attainment under risk generally confound the effect of liquidity constraints and of lack of insurance against risk. It is unclear whether the correlation between health and education under uninsured risk would remain if the capital markets were perfect and household faced no liquidity constraints. This paper fills in this lacuna in the literature. We develop a two period model of investment in education when future labor earnings are stochastically dependent on current investments in schooling and health. It is found that when there is uninsured risk, then parental investment in a child’s education will be inefficient even in the presence of perfect capital markets. Under certain assumptions, there will be a positive correlation between childhood health and educational investment. Health inequalities will translate into educational inequalities in an environment of uninsured risk. We are able to show that when perfect insurance markets are present, investments in child health and schooling will be optimal. From the policy perspective, this argues for the development of insurance markets. The results also suggest that policy interventions that target higher levels of educational investment among the population need to account for the effect of childhood differences in health.
O20|Multidimensional Human Opportunity Index|Abstract One fact that emerges from the evaluation of the Millennium Development Goals is that not all countries met all the goals and there are significant complementaries among failing on specific goals. This paper proposes the Multidimensional Human Opportunity Index (MHOI) that focuses on the complementaries among access to multiple services. We focus on access to services for children, with the aim of capturing equality in opportunity for children from diverse socio-economic backgrounds. This index builds on the Human Opportunity Index of the World Bank that measures children’s access to a basic service, such as access to clean water. However, the MHOI differs from the parent index in that we measure joint access to multiple services or access to a bundle of services. We apply the MHOI on two Himalayan states of South Asia, Nepal and Bhutan, and show that although each basic service is available to a large proportion of the population, only two-thirds in Bhutan and one half in Nepal have access to the bundle of basic services in 2011–2012.
O20|The relationship between Ecuador and China: a dangerous alliance?|The aim of this paper is to outline the relationship between Ecuador and China by highlighting the main threats for the development of the Ecuadorian Republic, in particular how it will affect the implementation of the buen vivir, the new economic paradigm experimented in the Latin American State, if it does not change the terms of affair with the Asian giant. The paper is structured as follows: in the introduction, we will present an overview on the historical framework of the relationships of China with Ecuador. Later there will be an analysis supported by data on the commercial situation between the two countries, and its implication over the development of the Latin American state. Finally, some final remarks will present the possible paths that Ecuador can follow to secure its way to development. With this, we will highlight under which conditions Ecuador and China can cooperate while avoiding a state of dependency.
O20|Green-oriented Knowledge Transfers in global markets: technologies, capabilities, institutions|The development of green technologies represents a key driver in the transition towards environmentally sustainable societies. Among environmental challenges, the implementation of national climate policies and international efforts to face the threat of climate change has been particularly effective at triggering the production of climate-friendly innovation in developed countries. This effectiveness has been acknowledged by several studies which observed that, for example, the production of patents related to renewable energy technologies has sharply increased over the last decades. However, the battle against climate change is far from being over. As the share of greenhouse gases emissions in developing countries is sharply growing, how to promote the transfer of available green technologies to these countries is one of the main challenges that policymakers are facing in recent years. Understanding the mechanisms behind technology transfer of “environmental” knowledge and how such transfer happens among countries with heterogeneous economic conditions and different capabilities is a complex exercise. In this report we provide an overview of the literature on green knowledge transfer and, more importantly, on how such literature can be strengthened to deepen the understanding of the interactions that are at stake. The conceptual analysis is aimed at offering a platform to set in-field projects with stakeholders (research/business oriented), to concretely implement the elaboration and general best practice identification for knowledge and technology transfers in the green economy transition.
O20|Fostering social mobility: The case of the 'Bono de Desarrollo Humano' in Ecuador|Social protection programmes are now implemented in many low and middle income countries due to their efficacy in reducing poverty, vulnerability, and inequality. However, the literature is scarce regarding long-term effects of social transfers. Using administrative panel data, this study analyses the determinants of social mobility in Ecuador using a multivariate welfare index, and evaluates the effect of the Ecuadorian social transfer programme Bono de Desarrollo Humano (BDH). Results show that social policies should focus on vulnerabilities related to household composition, the accumulation of human capital, and the accumulation of durable goods. Complementary policies must address gender, ethnic and geographical equity, as well as reproductive health. Finally, we find that the BDH does foster social mobility, especially for higher per capita amounts and if the transfer is complemented with economic inclusion programmes.

O20|The sustainable development goals and the systems approach to sustainability|The authors explore the link between the systems approach to sustainability and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were formally adopted by the UN in 2015. The systems approach depicts sustainable development as the intersection of the goals attributed to three interlinked systems: environmental (or ecological), economic and social. The authors illustrate how each of the 17 SDGs can be characterized as a goal primarily attributed either to the environmental, economic or social system, and as suggested by the systems approach, there may be important tradeoffs in attempting to attain all these goals simultaneously. By adopting standard methods of the theory of choice and welfare under imposed quantities, the authors show that is possible to measure the welfare effects of an increase in the indicator level for one SDG by identifying the tradeoffs that occur with achieving another goal. They present a quantitative assessment of current progress and tradeoffs among the 17 SDGs, using a representative indicator for each goal. They then conduct a preliminary welfare analysis of these tradeoffs through employing the approach developed in this paper. Although this analysis focuses on the potential tradeoffs among SDGs, the approach could also be applied to show complementarities, or 'win-wins', in simultaneous progress among two or more SDGs. Such an analysis can help in the design of appropriate policy interventions to achieve specific SDGs, minimizing the potentially negative knock-on effects on some goals whilst capitalizing on the positive win-win impacts on other SDGs.
O20|Culture, diffusion, and economic development| This research explores the effects of culture on technological diffusion and economic development. It shows that culture's direct effects on development and barrier effects to technological diffusion are, in general, observationally equivalent. In particular, using a large set of measures of cultural values, it establishes empirically that pairwise differences in contemporary development are associated with pairwise cultural differences relative to the technological frontier, only in cases where observational equivalence holds. Additionally, it establishes that differences in cultural traits that are correlated with genetic and linguistic distances are statistically and economically significantly correlated with differences in economic development. These results highlight the difficulty of disentangling the direct and barrier effects of culture, while lending credence to the idea that common ancestry generates persistence and plays a central role in economic development.
O20|Redistribution of Economic Resources due to Conflict: The Maoist Uprising in Nepal|Nepal has seen a significant reduction in poverty over the period 1995{2010 which encompasses the decade-long Maoist-led civil war. So was the post-conflict provision of economic resources to districts related to their involvement in promoting the Maoist cause? We tackle this question combining theory and empirics. Our model predicts that poorer districts are more likely to support the Maoists and in return they get promised economic gains conditional on the Maoists prevailing post-conflict. Combining data on conflict with consumption expenditure data from the Nepal Living Standards Survey and data on foreign aid, we test these predictions. Our panel data estimates and our cross-sectional analysis consistently find strong support for our hypotheses. These are confirmed by the IV analysis that we perform at the panel level.
O20|Modernization, Social Identity, and Ethnic Conflict|"Empirical evidence suggests that ethnic divisions or diversity in a society leads to negative outcomes in various dimensions, including civil conflict and economic development. It is often argued that the lack of shared social identity, that is, the dominance of subnational (particularly, ethnic) identities over national identity, lies behind the negative outcomes in ethnically heterogenous societies. If shared national identity is important, how can it be realized? In political science, there exist conflicting theses emphasizing effects of modernization on national identity. Which thesis is more relevant under what conditions? How are conflict and output affected by modernization through identity? How do policies such as ""nation-building"" policies affect the outcome? In order to examine these questions theoretically, this paper develops a model of social identity, ethnic conflict, and development. In the model, individuals choose a sector to work (between the modern sector and a traditional sector), social identity (between ethnic identity and national identity), and contributions to ethnic conflict. Thus, modernization (and output), identity, and conflict interact with each other."
O20|Why are cognitive abilities of children so different across countries? The link between major socioeconomic factors and PISA test scores|Path analysis was employed to examine the effects of socioeconomic factors on children’s level of cognitive ability (measured by PISA scores) at a cross-country level (N=55). The results showed that children’s level of schooling had a positive direct effect on their cognitive ability, while the direct effects of adult fertility rate and child mortality were significantly negative. As we found that child mortality had the largest total effect on cognitive ability, the results also confirmed that per capita income had indirectly channeled its positive effect on cognitive ability through the reduction in child mortality. Moreover, in the long term, parents’ education level had the largest positive indirect effect on cognitive ability because it significantly increased children’s schooling rate and reduced the fertility rate. We suggest that, in the countries considered herein, well-educated parents have higher awareness of quality of life that indirectly raises the cognitive ability of their children.
O20|European Funds Fraud: The Impact on the Process of Absorption of Structural and Cohesion Funds in Romania|The increase of the degree of absorption of European funds offered to Romania by the European Union represents one of its main objectives in the present and future situation. One of the main reasons that the funds are so important is the fact that, taking into consideration the microeconomic and macroeconomic situation that Romania is in, it represents an alternative financing mechanism of the economy that Romania can benefit in very advantageous conditions. Even under these conditions Romania- within 2007-2013 period of programming – couldn’t benefit from it by attracting as many structural and cohesion funds as possible, at least in comparison to other member states. In our opinion, that of the authors’ one of the reasons that led to such a low rate of absorption, alongside with the low administrative capacity of the state is the excessive bureaucracy, an inefficient legislative framework which is not harmonized with the European one, the lack of experience in using and administrating of European funds, the beneficiaries’ incapacity to sustain the financial support of the project (to assure the co-financing of the project), a low involvement of Romanian banking institutions in the process of supporting the beneficiaries of European funds. Another cause is the European funds fraud that happened in Romania. In the present article, the authors have decided to analyze the influence of European funds fraud on the degree of absorption of structural and cohesion funds in Romania.

O20|Economic growth in Iran through labor productivity growth|Economic growth is a fundamental measurement to assess a country's performance and productivity. For this reason, growth and productivity are in policy agenda of many countries especially success economic countries. Based on some studies and reports (e.g., those by UK parliament, 2016; OECD, 2012), labor productivity in developed countries is analyzed and considered as a secondary economic growth. In this study, we investigated the relationship between economic growth and change of labor productivity in Iran and their challenges. Our object was to answer to two questions: 1) Is any relationship between level of GPD and labor productivity in Iran? ; 2) What are the driving forces (effective factors) behind the growth of labor productivity?To answer to question 1, economic data from national and international information bank gathered. Relation between GDP and labor productivity examined by calculating some ratios and finally, trends and behavioral patterns analyzed. Patterns drew on Iran?s economic status compared with 10 other countries in regional category (such as USA, Japan, Turkey, and France). Therefore, the study findings revealed that there is a direct relationship between GDP and labor productivity In Iran. To answer to the question 2, initially we developed a conceptual model based on theories and considered labor productivity as complex and multi-dimensional phenomenon (Economic and social dimensions) and assumed labor productivity as a function of internal (organizational) and external (environmental) factors. According to find effective factors, a questionnaire based on conceptual model designed and before evaluating the reliability and validity of questionnaire, it reviewed with 15 academic and professionals. Data collected through questionnaires that distributed to 250 managers and employees from government and non-government sectors.Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) employed, which reported significant and positive relationship between the labor productivity and driving forces such as: competitiveness, size of government sector, unemployment, corruption, social security system (external factors) and Wage/salary, work culture, employee adaptability, employee knowledge and skill, team working, performance appraisal system, career management (internal factors). Whereas, the association between labor productivity and some variables such as sex, age, post and position, sector were not supported. Eventually, challenges based on driving forces that are identified as more effective, discussed.As conclusion findings can be applied by policy makers and managers to make policies to improve labor productivity and increase economic growth rate in Iran.
O20|Economic Transition in Algeria: A Review in Wake of the Recent Oil Crisis|The sudden and sharp fall in oil prices, in the summer of 2014, triggered a new debate about the ?bleak future? that awaits Algeria. Many asked whether the country would experience another economic and political crisis similar to that of the 1980s. In the ongoing debate, some blame the failure of the state for not having a clear and conscience economic policy to deal with this multidimensional crisis, while others refer to the inadequacies of the reforms put in place for the country?s transition from socialism to a market economy as the cause of the crisis. Proponents of the economic argument, see the recent crisis in Algeria as a manifestation of the contradiction between the accumulated wealth and the dire economic situation that the country periodically finds itself in because of the instability of oil prices. Political views, on the other hand, differ according to political affiliations, however most political parties call for a ?smooth transition? in order to enhance the existing democratic practices and put the country?s economy on the ?right truck.?This paper will not try to foresee Algeria?s near future, but rather to look back at the experience of the country in terms of (1) the economic and political conditions under which the country made its transition from ?socialism? to ?market socialism?, then its struggle to make the transition from ?market socialism? to a ?market economy?, (2) the reform programs that were deemed necessary to make these transitions, and (3) the economic and political dynamics behind the failure of these reforms that many hoped they would help Algeria to become industrialized nation in the 1980s and an emergent country in the first decade of this century.

O20|Revolution empirics: predicting the Arab Spring|Abstract The paper examines whether the Arab Spring phenomenon was predictable by complete elimination in the dispersion of core demands for better governance, more jobs, and stable consumer prices. A methodological innovation of the generalized methods of moments is employed to assess the feasibility and timing of the revolution. The empirical evidence reveals that from a projection date of 2007, the Arab Spring was foreseeable between 2011 and 2012. The paper contributes at the same time to the empirics of predicting revolutions and the scarce literature on modeling the future of socioeconomic events. Caveats and cautions are discussed.
O20|Industriepolitik 2.0<BR>[Industrial Policy 2.0]|Zusammenfassung Europa ist ein langfristiges Erfolgsmodell, weist aber seit der Finanzkrise ein niedriges Wachstum und eine erhöhte Arbeitslosigkeit auf. Die Einkommensdifferenzen sind zudem hoch. Europa hält sich auch nicht an seine geplante längerfristige Strategie. Die Notwendigkeit einer immer stärkeren Integration wird von den Bürgern nicht akzeptiert. Sezessionsbestrebungen und politische Polarisierung sind die Folgen. Karl Aiginger und Teresa Bauer beleuchten in diesem Zusammenhang die Rolle der europäischen Industrie, ihre relative Entwicklung im Verhältnis zur Gesamtwirtschaft und zu den USA. Auch Industriepolitik braucht neue Konzepte und eine stärkere Anbindung an gesellschaftliche Ziele; dies nicht zuletzt, um falsche, nur kurzfristig attraktive Ansätze zu verhindern.
O20|Quel Ciblage De La Croissance Et Des Politiques Sociales Dans Le Cadre De L’Évolution Des Stratégies De Réduction De La Pauvreté ?|La promotion récente par les organisations internationales de l’objectif de « développement inclusif » pour les pays en développement crée les conditions d’une convergence, dans les politiques de développement, de deux agendas jusqu’alors développés de façon indépendante : la réduction de la pauvreté d’une part, la croissance d’autre part. Quels peuvent être alors, dans le cadre des hypothèses théoriques de la Nouvelle Economie Institutionnelle, les mécanismes permettant de mettre en place une croissance bénéficiant aux plus pauvres ? En quoi le ciblage, concernant les politiques sociales, peut-il constituer un levier pour atteindre cet objectif ?
O20|Sectoral Infrastructure Investments in an Unbalanced Growing Economy: The Case of Potential Growth in India|We construct a two-sector (agriculture and modern) overlapping generations growth model calibrated to India to study the effects of sectoral tax rates, sectoral infrastructure investments, and labor market frictions on potential growth in India. Our model is motivated by the idea that because misallocation depends on distortions, policies that reduce distortions raise potential growth. We show that the positive effect of a variety of policy reforms on potential growth depends on the extent to which public and private capital are complements or substitutes. We also show that funding more infrastructure investments in both sectors by raising labor income taxes in the agriculture sector raises potential growth.
O20|On the value of foreign PhDs in the developing world: Training versus selection effects|"This paper compares the career effects of overseas and domestic PhD training for scientists working in an emerging economy, South Africa. Variations in scientific achievements of South African academics may arise be- cause those who attend ""better"" PhD programmes receive better training, but it may also be because good students select into good universities. We examine selection and training effects for four tiers of South African and two tiers of foreign universities. Those who received PhDs from universities in industrialized countries tend to be more productive than those whose PhDs were locally granted, but universities from industrialized countries do not necessarily provide better training than local universities. Pure selection effects contribute to career outcomes nearly as much as training effects. When looking at training in isolation, PhDs from top South African universities produce a similar quantity and quality research output to those from leading universities in the developed world."

O20|Public policy and mental health: What we can learn from the HIV movement|Mental health plays a key role in human development, both as a driver and as a goal in itself. Despite this, mental health has been strikingly neglected to date. The HIV movement has revolutionised health advocacy and registered remarkable successes in the past decades. The present study draws on the experience of this exceptional movement in order to find ways forward in the field of mental health. Adopting a broad analytical perspective, it discusses the differences and similarities between the fields of HIV and mental health and, based on this analysis, provides a concrete model for action that takes into account the peculiarities of mental health as a policy issue
O20|Entrepreneurial heterogeneity and the design of entrepreneurship policies for economic growth and inclusive development|Entrepreneurship is the object of renewed and increasing attention, not only by academics, but also by policy makers worldwide. This interest partly results from a positive perception of entrepreneurship as a driver of economic growth, and the urgency for policy makers to find ways to stimulate and sustain economic growth, in developed as well as in developing countries. This trend raises the need to have a clear understanding of the role of entrepreneurship in the economy and society. This paper acknowledges that there is a large heterogeneity across entrepreneurs in their ability to contribute to economic growth. We present insights from macro-economic studies supporting this statement. We next take a micro perspective and discuss the evidence based literature to identify the critical factors and entrepreneur characteristics that can lead to entrepreneurial success and contribute to growth. This discussion serves as a framework against which we reflect on the rationales and effectiveness of entrepreneurial policies in developing countries.
O20|Sustainable Development Goals and Japan: sustainability overshadows poverty reduction|The Development Cooperation Charter of Japan, which replaced the Official Development Assistance (ODA) Charter in February 2015, drives the countryâ€™s cooperation towards non-poor countries and non-poverty issues. The Sustainable Development Goals put Japan forward in these directions. As a result, the countryâ€™s focus on global poverty reduction is overshadowed by its national interests and sustainability under the concept of universality, which is a core principle of the Goals and differentiates them from the Millennium Development Goals.
O20|Participation in development: learning from the past and present in the Republic of Korea|The present study draws on two case studies, one on village dynamics during the 1970s rural community development movement in the Republic of Korea and the other on present day challenges and learning based on the experiences of a non-governmental organization from the Republic of Korea in implementing a community project together with local villagers in Cambodia. The study argues that the participatory approach, despite recent criticism and challenges associated with it, should remain the core mode of development cooperation because of its intrinsic and instrumental values in efforts to develop a sustainable community. Local leadersâ€™ accountability and leadership, as well as genuine partnerships, involving equitable sharing of power in decisionmaking among various stakeholders, including external donor agencies, are also underlined as crucial in engaging local people in their own development initiatives.
O20|When Measure Matters: Coresidency, Truncation Bias, and Intergenerational Mobility in Developing Countries|Biases from truncation caused by coresidency restriction have been a challenge for research on intergenerational mobility. Estimates of intergenerational schooling persistence from two data sets show that the intergenerational regression coefficient, the most widely used measure, is severely biased downward in coresident samples. But the bias in intergenerational correlation is much smaller and is less sensitive to the coresidency rate. The paper provides explanations for these results. Comparison of intergenerational mobility based on the intergenerational regression coefficient across countries, gender, and over time can be misleading. Much progress on intergenerational mobility in developing countries can be made with the available data by focusing on intergenerational correlation.
O20|Providing Policy Makers with Timely Advice: The Timeliness-Rigor Trade-off|Policy makers bemoan the lack of research findings to guide urgent decisions, whereas researchers' professional code puts rigor first. This article argues that provisional assessments, produced early in the research cycle, can bridge the gap. Numerous case studies point to the importance of early interaction with policy makers and the delivery of brief, policy-focused papers; but preliminary analyses may be flawed and so increase the chances of a wrong decision. This article demonstrates analytically that a preliminary assessment, supported by the offer of more refined research, provides an option that is superior, on average, to the current practice of submitting a final report at the end of the research cycle. Where practical implementation is concerned, it calls for donor-funded subsidies to promote the use of provisional assessments and for a rapid, independent, professional review process to ensure their quality. While the research-policy exchange in developing countries is a complex, context-specific phenomenon, the proposal offered here holds out some promise of improving decisions in the public sphere under a wide range of circumstances.
O20|Elusive Development in the Balkans: Research Findings|Summary Research findings of the latest round of the wiiw-GDN project on development in the Balkans are surveyed. Historical and structural deficiencies of development in the Balkan countries are discussed in detail with emphasis of the role of investment, integration, and structural and policy deficiencies. These structural features have led to policy challenges in particular after the crisis of 2008-2009. Which are investment- and export-led growth, which implies slower growth of consumption than national savings; slow growth of wages and incomes over the period of structural adjustment and for reasons of prevention of real exchange rate appreciation; and free access to foreign markets due to slower recovery of domestic demand. With the policy framework biased towards rigidity, and having in mind the needed structural adjustment, development policies that are compatible with them are infrastructure, physical and institutional, investments supported by the EU and regionally; trade integration – regional, European, and within the World Trade Organisation; financial and entrepreneurial cooperation within the manufacturing networks in the EU primarily; sustainable macroeconomic policies especially when it comes to external balances. A list of studies and of the relevant literature is included.
O20|On the value of foreign PhDs in the developing world: Training versus selection effects|"This paper compares the career effects of overseas and domestic PhD training for scientists working in an emerging economy, South Africa. Variations in scientific achievements of South African academics may arise because those who attend ""better"" PhD programmes receive better training, but it may also be because good students select into good universities. We examine selection and training effects for four tiers of South African and two tiers of foreign universities. Those who received PhDs from universities in industrialized countries tend to be more productive than those whose PhDs were locally granted, but universities from industrialized countries do not necessarily provide better training than local universities. Pure selection effects contribute to career outcomes nearly as much as training effects. When looking at training in isolation, PhDs from top South African universities produce a similar quantity and quality research output to those from leading universities in the developed world."

O20|Talent-Competitiveness of Hungary – Decline without “Fleurs du Mal”|This paper offers some ammunition to better understand Hungary’s position in the IMD World Talent Report 2015 (IMD WTR 2015). First, it gives a brief overview of the methodology of the IMD WTR by highlighting its main features. Second, it presents the 2015 ranking and puts the focus on Hungary’s withering talent competitiveness. The paper conveys the message that an overarching and consistent reform package is a must in the education system to foster talent utilisation. However, such a package is likely to be insufficient unless economic policy addresses the relevant shortcomings of the Hungarian innovation ecosystem.
O20|Economic reforms in China and India: past and future challenges|In China and India broad economic reforms since the 1980s progressively opened to private initiative and international trade and were key contributors to their formidable growth patterns. Today, the positive effects of past liberalizations are fading and the two countries have reached a level of development and complexity that requires a “new generation” of reforms, qualitatively more complex and politically less palatable. This paper identifies the turning points in China’s and India’s long phases of fast growth. It then turns to the open issues that need government action to support a sustainable and lasting growth process. In China, the priorities are to foster new growth engines by boosting domestic consumption and improving quality and efficiency on the supply side. In India, the reforms proposed by the government aim at facilitating investment, fostering innovation, protecting intellectual property, and building top-class manufacturing infrastructure. Broad reforms of financial and labor markets are also on the agenda. To make progress in these reforms both countries will require overcoming the resistance of vested interests and short term implementation costs.
O20|Radicalism Versus Gradualism: An Analytical Survey Of The Transition Strategy Debate|Academic debate on a transition strategy for former socialist economies continues even a quarter century after the collapse of the communism in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In this paper, through an analytical survey of 137 preceding studies, we present an overall picture of the debate and examine the relationship between the debate attitudes and the literature attributes in related studies. We found that the radicalists maintain a consistent debate attitude from the viewpoints of time speed and policy sequence of economic transition, while the debate attitude of the gradualists is more diversified. We also found that there is another group of researchers that stays within the framework of the radicalism-versus-gradualism debate while at the same time keeping at arm's length from both the radicalists and the gradualists. In addition, our cross tabulation analysis and regression estimation of qualitative selection models provide interesting findings on the relationship between the debate attitudes and the literature attributes.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O20|Austerity States, Institutional Dismantling and the Governance of Sub-National Economic Development: The Demise of the Regional Development Agencies in England|Contributing to interpretations of the governance geographies of austerity, the paper explains how, why and in what forms austerity states are constructed by actors in particular political-economic contexts and geographical and temporal settings, how and by whom they are articulated and pursued, and how they are worked through public policy and institutional and territorial architectures. Empirically, the focus is explaining the UK Government and its abolition and closure of the Regional Development Agencies in England. First, a more qualitative and plural conception of austerity states is developed to question singular and/or monolithic notions of state types and their transitions, and to better reflect the particularities of how state projects are configured and unfolded by actors within political-economic variegations of capitalism. Second, a more geographically sensitive approach and appreciation of (re)scaling are detailed to incorporate and extend beyond the predominantly national frame and decentralising narratives deployed in current accounts. Last, a historically literate interpretation of institutional dismantling is advanced better to explain the politics and restructuring of institutional landscapes by actors within austerity states.
O20|Trends and Patterns of Growth, Development, Achievements of China and India: A Comparative Analysis|Even before the onset of the 2008 global financial crisis and ongoing European debt crisis, much attention has been given to the re-emergence of the Asian giants, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and India. Both countries have attained unprecedented growth and economic development—PRC and India became the second and fourth largest economies of the world, respectively. Moreover, these countries remarkably improved their per capita income as PRC increased its per capita GDP by 13-fold from US$341 in 1990 to US$4,421 in 2010 whereas India posted a four times growth from US$384 in 1990 to US$1,342 in 2010. This has resulted in a remarkable poverty reduction in the last two to three decades in the two economies. PRC and India share several common characteristics, prospects and challenges. However, their approaches to growth and development as well as growth models have been different. The major objective of this paper is to compare the policies, institutions, strategies, reforms and market conditions that contributed to the rapid growth and development of the PRC and India which can provide lessons to the developing world, particularly emerging economies, that are also struggling to improve their economic development and quality of life amidst economic growth. This paper attempts to examine the differences between PRC and India in terms of trends and patterns of growth and development, economic models, sources and drivers of growth; achievements, policies and institutions since last three decades.
O20|Management of Bureaucrats and Public Service Delivery: Evidence from the Nigerian Civil Service|We study how the management practices bureaucrats operate under correlate with the quantity of public services delivered, using data from the Nigerian Civil Service. We have handâ€ coded independent engineering assessments of 4,700 project completion rates. We supplement this with a management survey in the bureaucracies responsible for these projects, building on Bloom and Van Reenen (). Management practices matter: increasing bureaucratsâ€™ autonomy is positively associated with completion rates, yet practices related to incentives/monitoring of bureaucrats are negatively associated with completion rates. Our evidence provides new insights on the importance of management in public bureaucracies in a developing country setting.

O20|Asistencia oficial para el desarrollo, capital social y crecimiento en América Latina|En este trabajo se examina la relación entre la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo (AOD), el capital social y el crecimiento económico en América Latina, con miras a determinar si el efecto de dicha asistencia en el crecimiento depende de las reservas de capital social del país receptor. Con ese objetivo se utiliza la “confianza” para medir el capital social en un panel incompleto de 18 países latinoamericanos en el período 2001-2010. Después de explicar los efectos relativos al país y al tiempo en un modelo de datos de panel dinámico, los resultados permiten ver que el efecto de la AOD en el crecimiento depende, de hecho, del nivel de confianza que existe. Esto sugiere que esa asistencia será más eficaz cuando se utilice en un ambiente donde dicho nivel sea elevado.
O20|Official development assistance, social capital and growth in Latin America|This study focuses on the relationship among official development assistance (ODA), social capital and economic growth in Latin American countries, attempting to determine whether the impact of such assistance on growth is conditional on the receiving country’s stock of social capital. To this end, we use “trust” to measure social capital in an unbalanced panel of 18 Latin American countries over the period 2001-2010. After accounting for country and time effects in a dynamic panel data model, our results show that the impact of ODA on growth is indeed conditional on the level of trust that exists. This suggests that this assistance will be more effective when used in a trust-rich environment.
O20|Making aid work for education in developing countries: An analysis of aid effectiveness for primary education coverage and quality|This paper examines the effect of education aid on primary enrolment and education quality. Using the most recent data on aid disbursements and econometric specifications inspired by the general aid effectiveness literature, we find some evidence that donors’ increase in funding has substantially contributed to the successful increase in enrolment over the last 15 years. The most robust effect is obtained by aid for education facilities and training. In addition, we find complementarities between aid for primary and secondary education. Our qualitative comparative analysis of education quality also highlights the relevance of a balanced mix of educational expenditures.
O20|Complexity paths in neo-Schumpeterian evolutionary economics, structural change and development policies|Recently, several authors of evolutionary and neo-Schumpeterian economics have identified in complex systems a common framework for accounting for a range of attributes they have been claiming are present in economic systems: path-dependence, positive feedbacks, micro-heterogeneity, emergent properties, and self-organization. Complexity seems to be broad enough to accommodate very different positions and it has been seen as a unifying approach for evolutionary and neo-Schumpeterian streams. This pluralism is reflected in the fact that many authors that draw upon complexity ideas from neo-Schumpeterian evolutionary theory, make contrasting policy recommendations in terms of if it should be vertical or horizontal or if it should promote bottom-up process or direct interventions. This is possible because the complexity approach has not yet been fully developed and its limits are still somewhat blurred. In this paper, we propose to explore this idea by identifying the theoretical backgrounds and the policy recommendations of different groups of neo-Schumpeterian evolutionary authors. We propose that backgrounds focused on different attributes of complexity lead to different development policies recommendations.
O20|Financial exclusion and financial capabilities in Canada|Purpose - The financially excluded are often denied basic financial services from mainstream banking institutions, leading them to high-cost fringe finance institutions (FFIs) such as payday loan companies and pawnshops. While strategies to address financial exclusion often include financial capabilities education, there does not appear to be evidence suggesting such education is an appropriate solution. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between financial capability and financial exclusion with survey data collected from the Canadian city of Kamloops located in the southern interior of British Columbia. Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory research addresses the objective with survey data collected on the banking habits and financial capability levels of fringe finance users in a Canadian city. Findings - The results imply that fringe finance users do not have lower levels of financial capability than those who do not use fringe finance, when education and income are controlled. Research limitations/implications - Limitations include the relatively small survey sample of 105 people in one urban center in Canada. Originality/value - While financial literacy is acknowledged to be an important life skill for all members of society, there is no conclusive evidence suggesting it is a solution to financial exclusion. This is the first research to examine the relationship between financial exclusion and fringe finance use in Canada by collecting data on fringe finance users with face-to-face interviews.
O20|Culture, Diffusion, and Economic Development|This research explores the effects of culture on technological diffusion and economic development. It shows that culture's direct effects on development and barrier effects to technological diffusion are, in general, observationally equivalent. In particular, using a large set of cultural measures, it establishes empirically that pairwise differences in contemporary development are associated with pairwise cultural differences relative to the technological frontier, only in cases where observational equivalence holds. Additionally, it establishes that differences in cultural traits that are correlated with genetic and linguistic distances are statistically and economically significantly correlated with differences in economic development. These results highlight the difficulty of disentangling the direct and barrier effects of culture, while lending credence to the idea that common ancestry generates persistence and plays a central role in economic development.
O20|Truth Behind Economic Performance, Natural Resources and Attracting Foreign Direct Investment|Using a preliminary investigation and analysis on the latest data on GDP (Gross Domestic Product) performance, GOI (Global Opportunity Index), Vulnerability Score, Readiness Score, and the number of resources of economic importance, exploratory or preliminary SEM (structural equation modelling) was prompted on the recent available data of the 131 countries (n=131). The model was robust, addressing concerns about multivariate assumptions and other measures on the goodness of fit. It was found that the number of natural resources of economic importance plays a large role in the GDP performance. Thus, the preliminary symptom of Dutch disease continues to manifest for as long as each country aims for development, with their resources as ultimate enticing factors for foreign direct investment (FDI). In addition, economic growth is so far observed to be associated with the vulnerability of the country to climate change. Finally, economic growth was found to be linked to the negative impacts argued by the dependency theory. Implication on governance was discussed.
O20|China¡¯s Reform: History, Logic and Future|This paper is a brief introduction of the core content and basic concepts of the book China¡¯s Reform: History, Logic and Future, and gives answers to questions such as why China¡¯s reform and opening-up policy has achieved great success, why the catch-up mode, extensive and extractive development mode China adopted in the past three decades are no longer sustainable and what China¡¯s market-oriented reforms should aim to achieve in the next stage so that readers can have a profound understanding of China¡¯s reform. Planning ahead, from the perspective of sustainable economic development, China badly needs to transform from factor-driven growth to efficiency-driven and innovation-driven growth, the key to which is to further encourage the liberalization of thought, promote reform and opening-up, unswervingly follow the path of economic liberalization, marketization and privatization, to establish an inclusive modern market system, to allow the market to play a decisive role in resource allocation and the private economy to play a dominant role in the national economy. The market-oriented reform is a complicated project and China is faced with at least three different aspects of reform in some key areas¡ªthe main body of private economy, the liberalization of financial market and the marketization of land. Meanwhile, China needs to efficiently balance three elements of good governance, that is, the rule of law, execution and democratic supervision, so as to facilitate the modernization of state governance system and governance capability.
O20|The visible hand: the role of government in China’s long-awaited industrial revolution| China is undergoing its long-awaited industrial revolution. There is no shortage of commentary and opinion on this dramatic period, but few have attempted to provide a coherent, in-depth, political-economic framework that explains the fundamental mechanisms behind China’s rapid industrialization. This article reviews the Embryonic Economic Development theory put forth by Wen (2016a). This article reviews the Embryonic Economic Development theory put forth by Wen . It illuminates the critical sequence of developmental stages since the reforms enacted by Deng Xiaoping in 1978: namely, small-scale commercialized agricultural production, proto-industrialization in the countryside, a formal industrial revolution based on mass production of labor-intensive light consumer goods, a sustainable ‘industrial trinity’ boom in energy/motive power/infrastructure, and a second industrial revolution involving the mass production of heavy industrial goods. This developmental sequence follows essentially the same pattern as Great Britain’s Industrial Revolution, despite sharp differences in political and institutional conditions. One of the key conclusions exemplified by China’s economic rise is that the extent of industrialization is limited by the extent of the market. One of the key strategies behind the creation and nurturing of a continually growing market in China is based on this premise: The free market is a public good that is very costly for nations to create and support. Market creation requires a powerful ‘mercantilist’ state and the correct sequence of developmental stages; China has been successfully accomplishing its industrialization through these stages, backed by measured, targeted reforms and direct participation from its central and local governments.

O20|Combinando protección social con generación de oportunidades económicas: una evaluación de los avances del programa Haku Wiñay|El objetivo de este volumen es proveer evidencia rigurosa de los impactos iniciales que ha tenido el proyecto Mi Chacra Emprendedora-Haku Wiñay en una muestra representativa de sus ámbitos de intervención en la sierra rural. El primer capítulo del libro sitúa el proyecto en el marco de las intervenciones que combinan programas de fomento productivo con la política social. En el segundo, se caracteriza la intervención y, en los siguientes, se describe la metodología de evaluación de impactos y se presentan los resultados de la evaluación. Complementando el análisis cuantitativo, se presentan dos estudios adicionales elaborados desde una perspectiva metodológica cualitativa. Estos estudios profundizan el análisis en temas clave para lograr la sostenibilidad de los impactos positivos generados por el proyecto. Finalmente, el libro concluye con un capítulo que sintetiza los resultados de los componentes cuantitativo y cualitativo de la evaluación, y reflexiona en torno a los dilemas de política vinculados a la ampliación de la escala del proyecto y la sostenibilidad de sus impactos.
O20|Industrias extractivas y desarrollo rural territorial en los Andes peruanos. Los dilemas de la representación política y la capacidad de gestión para la descentralización|Durante las últimas décadas, en el Perú se han producido cambios significativos en las formas de organización y representación local. Estos cambios han afectado el desarrollo de las políticas territoriales en el contexto de proyectos mineros a gran escala. El país ha hecho esfuerzos para contribuir a la gestión del territorio, para lo cual ha promovido instrumentos técnicos públicos como el plan de ordenamiento territorial (POT) y la zonificación ecológica económica (ZEE). Sin embargo, la ocupación desordenada del territorio y el crecimiento acelerado de la inversión han generado un debate sobre la eficacia de estas herramientas. Frente a los nuevos desafíos y las crecientes expectativas, las comunidades campesinas han tenido que negociar la venta o el acceso a sus recursos, mientras que las autoridades locales se han visto obligadas a enfrentar la implementación de políticas de ZEE orientadas al ordenamiento territorial de su jurisdicción. Como resultado, se ha generado una crisis de representatividad que ha contribuido a la proliferación de conflictos. Los cuatro ensayos presentados en este libro constituyen un intento por comprender tanto las transformaciones en las formas de representación política en ámbitos rurales como el efecto que estas tienen en la implementación de políticas de ordenamiento territorial en el contexto de grandes proyectos extractivos. El objetivo último es aportar al debate sobre cómo impulsar una mejor gestión territorial en el marco del desarrollo extractivo del país.
O20|Rethinking development in the Pacific Islands Forum countries|"Islands of the Pacific Ocean number in the many thousands. This essay focuses on a subset of islands, namely those â€” save Australia and New Zealand â€” belonging to the independent political entities gathered in the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF). With a handful of economic concepts and indicators I show that, as a conventionally conceived economic proposition, the islands have to be ""written off."" Modern expectations in regard to cost competitiveness in production and high standards of living in consumption are incompatible goals for the islands to reach. The islands are not viable economies, and its peoples are likely to remain the permanent economic dependents they are, relying on fickle aid from well-off peoples and their policymakers located far away from the islands. Nonviable economies invite unstable polities and ruptured cultures. Strangely, in all this there lies hope in that rethinking the nature, meaning, and practice of development may offer feasible alternatives to reconstitute otherwise failing societies. Potentially, the islands could become a unique laboratory for trying out new ideas of what it means to live a dignified, self-reliant, self-sustaining, satisfied, and happy human life."
O20|L’Agriculture Algerienne Face Aux Defis De La Securite Alimentaire : Analyse Retrospective Et Bilan De La Nouvelle Politique Agricole|Nous nous proposons de revenir, dans ce papier, sur l’évolution des politiques publiques menées dans le secteur agricole, en partant de la période de l’autogestion jusqu’aux réformes économiques appliquées durant les années 1990, dans un premier temps. Dans un second temps, nous allons essayer d’expliquer les fondements de la politique agricole mise en place durant la décennie 2000. Il s’agit alors de mettre l’accent sur le retour à l’interventionnisme étatique grâce à une politique volontariste visant le renouveau du secteur considéré comme un des moyens de diversification de l’économie algérienne, longtemps dominée par sa dépendance aux hydrocarbures. Dans ce cadre, il s’agit d’examiner les mesures d’encouragement de l’investissement agricole menées via le plan national de développement agricole et rural (PNDAR). Il s’agit également d’analyser les résultats obtenus suite à la mise en application de cette politique à l’échelle nationale durant cette période .
O20|Chinaâ€™s State Enterprises and the Free Market (Economics) Test|Among the core dilemmas accompanying any attempt made to investigate the Chinese economic model, there is the one pertaining to the place and role of state enterprises: has the evolution (at least nominally documented by indicators) of the country in the last almost four decades been done â€œdue toâ€ or â€œin spite ofâ€ the eminent place of these entities in nodal sectors of the economy? State/public enterprises are the official bastion of the Chinese Communist Party, dedicated, on one hand, to fuel the predominantly capitalistic economic development and, on the other hand, not least important, to strengthen Chinaâ€™s imperial geopolitical pretence and propensity. The economic literature hosts a still unclosed debate on the possibility and performance if not of central planning, at least of scientific dirigisme and bureaucratic management. State enterprises (from China) remain a pertinent case study, both theoretical and historical, in the endeavour to grasp features of economics and economies.
O20|Central and Eastern European countries between the 16+1 platform and Chinese OBOR - One Belt, One Road - Initiative|This paper aims at analysing the projects and the initiatives of the Central and Eastern European countries that have been finalised, are in progress or will be developed in the near future with the help of the existing or future financial instruments specific to the 16+1 platform and the One Belt, One Road complex program. For our research we selected four countries, namely: Poland, Romania, Serbia and Hungary, the group being relevant from the perspective of the transportation corridors connected to the â€ One Belt, One Roadâ€ initiative: (1) - Piraeus, Skopje, Belgrade, Budapest, Western Europe; (2) - Suez Canal, Constanta and then Danube, Western Europe, or through Moldova towards Ukraine and Poland; (3) â€“ Constanta, through the Black Sea and Caspian Sea and then the corridors mentioned at the previous point. We based our analysis on the data provided by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, China-CEEC think-tank network and the literature in the field.
O20|Developmental states in the 21st century - analytical structure of a new approach|The financial and economic crisis of 2008-9 and the following difficulties have brought back the analysis of active state involvement in the economy to the research agenda of economists, and a new renaissance of developmental state (DS) approach can be observed. The aim of our paper is to draw up a new approach of DS in the twenty-first century by reviewing most recent literature. In our analysis we argue that to construct a new DS concept one has to break up with the historical and geographical limitation of the classic DS paradigm and the ideological debate around it. Meanwhile one has to build upon most recent results of new institutional, political and development economics’ analysis as well as the more than half century long experiences of classic DS. While presenting the structure and main elements of the new DS approach we aim to highlight those questions and areas of analysis, where consensus seems to emerge in literature.
O20|Identity Conflict with Cross-Border Spillovers|We model simultaneous inter and within identity-group conflict in two territories connected by cross-territorial spill-overs. Within each territory, two groups contest the division of a group-specific public good, and all members contest the division of group income. Each group has a cross-border affiliate. Greater success (share) of its affiliate 'spills over' into higher efficiency of a group in inter-group conflict. We find that inter-group and total conflict move together within a territory, while within-group conflict and output move in the opposite direction. A unilateral increase in cross-border spill-over reduces inter-group conflict in the source territory but increases it in the destination; an equi-proportionate bilateral increase affects conflict in a non-monotone manner. Population increase in a territory, a larger minority, weaker property rights, higher relative labour productivity of the majority, may all increase inter-group conflict in the other territory. Community-neutral growth in labour productivity within a territory reduces inter-group conflict therein.
O20|The high cost of low quality infrastructure when natural disasters strike|There is clear evidence embedded in the geological record of natural disasters such as volcanic activity, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and the like striking earth for many millennia. Interestingly and for as yet unknown reasons, there has been a fourfold increase in such disasters over the last four decades. While the reason or reasons for this spike is yet to be understand (randomness, long-term trends or perhaps global warming), it has led to a great deal of research into the relationships between natural disasters and socio-economic factors. While many could be listed, research into whether disasters spawn public sector corruption, how effective mitigation actions such as tidal buoys and seismographs can prove to be, whether institutions such as property rights play a role in determining a disaster’s devastation and the impact of disasters on differing country’s economic growth serve as good examples. We add to this literature by considering the seemingly obvious relationship between the quality of a country’s infrastructure and deaths due to disasters which to date has not been tested as there has been no consistent, cross-country measure of infrastructure quality. To be sure, our expectation is that quality infrastructure mitigates disasters but it is this missing link in the research that we seek to fill. To provide a direct test of the importance of infrastructure, we consider 126 countries that experienced at least one natural disaster during the period 2005-2012. The data on disasters is taken from the EM-DAT archive, collected and maintained by the non-profit institution Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED). The uniqueness of the analysis is made possible by the use of the only consistent, cross-country measure of infrastructure quality recently made available by the World Economic Forum’s annual Global Competitiveness Report. Given that the key dependent variable throughout is a count of deaths, the empirical analyses are based on a series of Negative Binomial panel models. As expected, we find consistent, negative and strong statistically significant relationships between a country’s infrastructure quality and deaths due to disasters. Thus, the results suggest that when decision-making takes place within a country with respect to how its resources will be spent, investments in high-quality infrastructure will certainly yield positive returns when disasters strike. Similarly, governmental and non-governmental agencies that provide development assistance would well serve developing countries through loans and grants designed to provide funding for the development of high-quality infrastructure.
O20|Nonlinearity in the efficacy of foreign aid and evidence of poverty traps|Research on the efficacy of foreign aid has been extensively conducted over the last three decades, but empirically the results remain inconclusive. Previous literature has relied upon linear growth model to estimate their models, methods inconsistent with the existence of poverty traps. These approaches have found that the effect of foreign is either negative, to positive, or even conditional on the policy environment in the country. More recent theoretical literature has started to point towards a nonlinear effect of foreign aid on the level of income. This nonlinear effect is consistent with a poverty trap model. To provide empirical support for this theory this paper relaxes the assumption of linearity in the model to determine if the efficacy of foreign aid is nonlinear. To accomplish this the relationship between foreign aid and the level of income is examined using a cross sectional data set of 72 countries that received Official Development Aid between 1985 and 2014 using a multivariate adaptive regressive splines (MARS) estimation. The MARS model is a nonlinear approach that systematically identifies both threshold levels and interaction terms between independent variables. Most importantly, the MARS model will detect if foreign aid has a statistically significant threshold effect. This finding would be consistent with the poverty trap hypothesis and also explain why there has been a lack of consensus so far. The results suggest that by using a nonlinear estimation we significantly improve, 18 to 44 percent reduction in the residual sum of squares, the fit of our growth model compared to an ordinary least squares estimation, as well as also detect a threshold in the effect of foreign aid that is consistent with a poverty trap hypothesis. These results are consistent when we analyze foreign aid as either a percent of gross national income—threshold at 4.6 percent—or per capita—threshold at $24.97. Below these thresholds the effect of foreign aid is either negative, or statistically zero, but when foreign aid is sufficiently large the effect is large and positive. We also detect significant interactions between foreign aid and both human capital and population growth. The policy implication being that if a country is going to experience a positive impact on their level of income the amount of foreign aid needs to be sufficiently large enough. Furthermore, the interactions suggest that some degree of selectivity should take place on which countries are best equipped to use aid.
O20|The Consolidation Of Eu Governance: The European Semester And The Evaluation Of European Integration Deepening|Once it was introduced as an instrument for deepening European integration, the legitimacy, opportunity and utility of European Semester were repeatedly questioned from the perspective of its contribution to the institutionalization of European governance. Also, there is a strong and direct link between the further deepening of the European Union’s political and economic integration on the one hand, and the development of a culture of evaluating policies and programs on the other. Taking these aspects into account, the following questions arise: does the European Commission have, in its position as manager of the European Semester, a real capacity of evaluating all aspects regarding the deepening of European integration? Can the European Semester be a means for diffusing evaluation practice at the level of Member States? This is why, in this paper, we propose to give answers to these questions.
O20|Eight Strategies for Development in Comparison|The article provides a broad-based overview on competing development strategies and the economic performance of developing countries, mainly since the year 2000. Four traditional mainstream development strategies are discussed (Washington Consensus, neo-liberalism, “good governance” and MDGs) and three long-debated key strategic issues are reconsidered (inward or outward development with export-led growth, industrialisation or growth with predominant primary goods exports, foreign-aid-based development). A heterodox approach to development with a focus on macroeconomic policies and structural change is added and discussed in more detail. Implicitly, this lays the groundwork for a macroeconomic theory of development. The rough empirical comparison finds that countries and areas with strong emphasis on macroeconomic policies, mainly in Asia, have performed unambiguously better than the mainstream approaches since 1980. From successful Asian countries, it can be learnt that a long-run continuous growth and development performance with more resilience against adverse shocks is key. Almost all larger middle-income countries have embarked on industrialisation; strategies based upon primary commodities or high current account deficits are unlikely to be successful in the long run. A stronger role of a package of six macroeconomic policies is advised, particularly for the larger economies. Size matters in this respect. Smaller countries depend stronger on market niches and idiosyncratic strategies. The global economic order, due to liberalisation of trade and finance, including the prevailing global currency system, sets harsh constraints for policy space towards implementing national strategies.
O20|Donatello Strangio & Giuseppe Sancetta (Eds.), Italy in a European Context: Research in Business, Economics, and the Environment|Contributing to support the diffusion of an European culture and sense of citizenship. This is the aim of the book “Italy in a European Context: Research in Business, Economics, and the Environment” edited by Donatella Strangio & Giuseppe Sancetta. It is a collection of scholarly articles that cover the main issues related to role of Italy offering different perspectives ranging from economics and management, among others. It is a good read not only for students and scholars with a specific interest in the subject, but also for the institutions willing to reflect on the various issues surrounding the book. The authors contributing to this handbook are leading scholars conducting research on different fields. In fact, one of the main strengths of the book is the variety of perspectives offered by its chapters. After an introduction by the editors, the book is structured into two parts. The first section helps in understanding the critical role played by EU economic policies and aspects that concern political and social inequality. The second section of the book focuses on issues concerning counterfeiting, finance and environment.
O20|Parthasarathi Shome, The G20 Development Agenda: An Indian Perspective|In the aftermath of the global economic crisis during 2008-09, the group of 20 nations (G20) came together to implement a series of macro-economic and financial sector reforms to bring the world economy back on the path of stability. India, given its growing GDP and increased external sector orientation, became a crucial part of the group. Once the recovery process started since 2010, G20 moved on to adopt a series of development agendas, including provisions on food security, infrastructural augmentation, energy and environmental sustainability and so on. Given India’s unique position that allows coexistence of economic growth with livelihood challenges and considerations over environmental degradation, the new G20 development agendasmay significantly influence the country’sfuture policy choice and growth path. In this context, the recent volume edited by Shome is a well-structured and timely contribution to the literature, which analyses the G20 development agendas from an Indian perspective.
O20|Eliminating Extreme Poverty in Africa: Trends, Policies and the Role of International Organizations|Eradicating extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030 is the first goal among the UN Sustainable Development Goals that guide the current development agenda. This paper examines its feasibility for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the world's poorest but growing region. It finds that under plausible assumptions extreme poverty will not be eradicated in SSA by 2030, but it can be reduced to low levels. National and regional policies that focus on accelerating growth, while making it more inclusive would accelerate poverty reduction. International organizations, including informal ones such as the G20, can play a key role in this endeavor by encouraging policy coordination and coherence.
O20|Planification: Potential and role in XXI century market economy|"The authors, basing on a critical analysis of the experience of planning during the 20th century in a number of countries of Europe and Asia, and also on the lessons from the economics of ""real socialism"", set out to substantiate their conclusions on the advisability of ""reloading"" this institution. The aim is to create planning mechanisms, suited to the new economy, that incorporate forecasting, projections, direct and indirect selective regulation and so forth into integral programs of economic development and that set a vector of development for particular limited spheres of what remains on the whole a market economy. New planning institutions presuppose a supersession of the forms of bureaucratic centralism and a reliance on network forms of organization of the subject and process of planning."
O20|Escaping from a human capital trap? Italy's regions and the move to centralized primary schooling, 1861–1936|The role played by public policy in the development of Italy's human capital in the late nineteenth century and the Interwar period has long remained unexplored by quantitative economic history. This article explores whether a system of decentralized primary education slowed down regional convergence in schooling, since poor and backward areas could not afford to invest a suitable amount of resources in education. It also investigates whether a more centralized system introduced in 1911 fostered the development of basic education and reduced the country's regional disparities. The analysis confirms the existence of such a human capital trap and shows that centralized primary education fostered the development of Italy's schooling in the Interwar period.
O20|Energy Security Of Ukraine In The Context Of Its Sustainable Development|Energy security is an important issue for Ukraine's sustainable development. The main goal of the article is to show the state of energy security of Ukraine, analyze its tendencies and challenges, reveal the impact of energy security on sustainable development of a country. The state of the energy security of Ukraine was analyzed with the help of data collection, processing and analysis. Data was taken from State Statistics Service of Ukraine, Ministry of Energetics and Coal Industry of Ukraine, other sources, and analyzed with the help of tools of statistics and economic analysis. Ukraine, being a developing country and experiencing war, political and economic crisis, struggles for energy security support. The present state of energy availability and consumption in the country influences its sustainable development and political stability, and is a significant restraint in country's survival. Despite the fact that Ukraine has enough resources' deposits to provide itself with energy, it provides less than 50% of own demands and is dependent on Russia's resources. Production of energy in Ukraine is decreasing, but energy consumption remains high. Ukrainian industries are energy-wasteful and energy-inefficient; the country has the leading positions in energy intensity of GDP. The article shows the relation of energy sources and energy security of Ukraine to sustainable development, reveals the dependency of the Ukrainian energy security, and indicates its main threats and ways out.
O20|The Aid Policy Network in Pakistan: An Actor-Network Analysis|Despite an extensive debate on foreign aid, the voluminous literature mainly focuses on the evaluation of foreign aid outcomes (or aid effectiveness). The aid literature has rarely considered the aid policy process and the influence of aid policy networks on managing foreign aid decisions in an aid recipient country. Using an actor-network analysis, this study helps to understand the complexities, interdependencies, and constraints involved in managing aid policy process in Pakistan. The findings indicate that absence of an inclusive actionable development framework and limited capacity of the state provide opportunities for donors to dominate the policy debate and pursue their own priorities. Further, the provincial devolution of 2011 has made the aid delivery system in Pakistan even more fragmented and complex, operating at multiple levels.
O20|A New Entrepreneurial Decision-Making Support Framework for Assessing Business Line Correlations|Sustainability is probably the ultimate goal of any entrepreneur when initiating or developing a business. As it involves competitiveness, companies aim to produce differentiated economic offerings by reusing and sharing processes, components, information and knowledge ? many times from different domains. However, to be effective, this should be envisaged already when developing the entrepreneurial plan or when assessing the opportunity of extending the business – therefore the need for planning / implementing / integrating several business lines (from various domains). As many of them may look attractive, an effective decision of starting one business line or another should be supported by some tool that allows a systematic assessment of the opportunity of implementing them. This paper proposes an algorithm that supports entrepreneurs in this respect. The opportunity of developing new business lines is assessed by estimating the mutual impact between them and existing business lines, their impact on organizational performance, and additional indicators such as financial effort, the estimated return on investment, technical and organizational difficulty, risk level or domain financing opportunities. An application example is presented in which an SME in an interdisciplinary domain (covering IT and life-sciences) assesses the opportunity of opening two new business lines.
O20|The Impact of Entrepreneurship on Knowledge Economy in Africa|Purpose - The paper assesses how entrepreneurship affects knowledge economy (KE) in Africa. Design/methodology/approach – Entrepreneurship is measured by indicators of starting, doing and ending business. The four dimensions of the World Bank’s index of KE are employed. Instrumental variable panel fixed effects are applied on a sampled of 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. Findings –The following are some findings. First, creating an enabling environment for starting business can substantially boost most dimensions of KE. Second, doing business through mechanisms of trade globalisation has positive effects from sectors that are not ICT and High-tech oriented. Third, the time required to end business has negative effects on KE. Practical implications – Our findings confirm the narrative that the technology in African countries at the moment may be more imitative and adaptive for reverse-engineering in ICTs and high-tech products. Given the massive consumption of ICT and high-tech commodities in Africa, the continent has to start thinking of how to participate in the global value chain of producing what it consumes. Originality/value – This paper has a twofold motivation. First, given the ambitions of African countries of moving towards knowledge based economies, the line of inquiry is timely. Second, investigating the nexus may have substantial poverty mitigation and sustainable development implications. These entail inter alia: the development of technology with value-added services; enhancement of existing agricultural practices; promotion of conditions that are essential for competitiveness and adjustment of globalization challenges.
O20|The Role of Knowledge Economy in African Business|Abstract This paper assesses the role of knowledge economy (KE) in African business in 53 countries for the period 1996–2010. The four KE components of the World Bank are employed, notably: education, innovation, economic incentives and institutional regime, and information and communication technology. The business indicators are classified into starting, doing, and ending business. Principal component analysis and panel instrumental variable fixed effect approaches are employed as empirical strategies. The findings which are broadly consistent with intuition and the predictions of economic theory suggest that KE policies will substantially boost the starting and doing of business in Africa. This is relevant in fighting unemployment and improving African competitiveness in global value chains. Policy implications for the relevance of each specific KE dimension in African business are discussed with particular emphasis on the theoretical underpinnings of the study. The investigation is original in its contribution at the same time to the scarce literature on African KE and the growing challenges of improving the business climate of the continent by means of KE.
O20|Women and Agricultural Productivity: What Does the Evidence Tell Us?|Should agricultural development programs target women in order to increase productivity? This paper reviews the extensive literature on men’s and women’s relative productivity in agriculture, most of which concludes that controlling for access to inputs, plot and farmer characateristics, there are little or no gender gaps in productivity. In addition, the paper identifies the many challenges to disentangling individual level productivity. Most of the literature compares productivity on plots managed by women with those managed by men, ignoring the majority of agricultural households in which men and women are both involved in management and production. The empirical studies which have been done provide scant evidence for where the returns to project may be highest, in terms of who to target. Yet, programs that do not consider the gendered responsibilities, resources and constraints, are unlikely to succeed, either in terms of increasing productivity or benefitting men and women smallholder farmers.
O20|European Development Assistance Policy: A Diachronic Approach|As the world’s biggest donor, for the developing countries, the European Union is an example of how to solve complex problems in a more and more interconnected world. Article hypothesis is represented by the fact that European values and principles have been established and developed around the construction of a new action concept, designed to meet the challenges of the European space. This paper analysis the context in which were formed and developed EU values and principles, basic elements in construction and development of European Development Assistance Policy. Which were the philosophical, political, economic and social determinants that contributed to building the European values and principles? To what extent geopolitical context changes have influence the evolution of development cooperation policy of the European Union? What are the effects that development policy has produced, analyzed from a diachronic perspective? These are the questions we will answer during the work, critically analyzing the literature and empirical data from the field.
O20|Chinese Foreign Aid: Visions And Institutions|With the start of this new century China entered into a new phase of aid, after 3 decades of double digit growth China has become the world largest exporter and second largest economy today. In the light of these economic developments China has become strong enough to significantly increase its presence as a donor of official development aid (ODA). One of the main traits of Chinese aid is that economic co-operation is linked to development assistance and there is not a clear distinction between them. Economic co-operation is seen as the ultimate goal and development assistance plays a part in that. Analysing the evolution of foreign aid policies and its institutional framework would offer a better understanding on how China intends to achieve that goal and this article tries to provide that. A foundation needed for a further in depth study of its foreign aid policies.
O20|Big Data In Supply Chain Management: An Exploratory Study|The objective of this paper is to set a framework for examining the conditions under which the big data can create long-term profitability through developing dynamic operations and digital supply networks in supply chain. We investigate the extent to which big data analytics has the power to change the competitive landscape of industries that could offer operational, strategic and competitive advantages. This paper is based upon a qualitative study of the convergence of predictive analytics and big data in the field of supply chain management. Our findings indicate a need for manufacturers to introduce analytics tools, real-time data, and more flexible production techniques to improve their productivity in line with the new business model. By gathering and analysing vast volumes of data, analytics tools help companies to resource allocation and capital spends more effectively based on risk assessment. Finally, implications and directions for future research are discussed.
O20|Human Security – Building The Post-2015 Development Framework|This article approaches the post-2015 Millennium Development Goals agenda through the human security paradigm. It suggests that the human security paradigm represents “the missing link” from the development agenda. Therefore, this analysis explains the necessity for extending the development agenda by including the human security doctrine. The first part of the article discusses the relation between human security and development. The next section analyzes the values of the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals. The last part evaluates the improvements that the inclusion of the human security on the post-2015 development framework may bring. The results of this analysis present illustrate the opportunity of deepening the MDGs agenda with a more realistic and ethical approach, through the inclusion of the human security paradigm within the development agenda.
O20|Caracterización de y Vulnerabilidad a los Desastres Naturales en Colombia, 1970-2011|El número de desastres naturales como las inundaciones, los deslizamientos y los vendavales en Colombia han venido en ascenso desde 1990. Particularmente, en los años 2010 y 2011 se presentó un incremento sin precedentes en el número de desastres registrados, situación relacionada con el fenómeno natural de La Niña. Este documento busca determinar la relación entre las características geográficas de una zona - topografía u orografía - las características socio-económicas –pobreza- influyen en los de desastres que enfrenta una población, y sus daños asociados. Utilizando datos para Colombia en el periodo de 1970-2011 se realiza un análisis a nivel municipal y por desastre registrado, y se estima la probabilidad de que un desastre tenga impactos en términos de muertes, casas afectadas o que sea de tipo intensivo. Finalmente, se encuentra que las características geográficas de una región influyen tanto en la incidencia de los desastres como en la magnitud de su impacto y que la pobreza juega un papel fundamental en los desastres de gran intensidad.
O20|Pobreza y Desastres Naturales en Colombia, 1970-2011: Una Aproximación desde los Municipios y los Hogares|Este documento, analiza el impacto de los desastres sobre las dimensiones del Índice de Pobreza Multidimensional (IPM) a nivel municipal y del hogar en Colombia, con el objetivo de determinar la correlación y la posible relación causal entre estas variables. Tomando datos municipales de corte transversal del IPM, sus 15 variables de privación para el 2005, y un agregado de desastres ocurridos por municipio desde 1976 hasta 2005, se encuentran que los desastres naturales tienen un impacto significativo sobre la pobreza en Colombia. Adicionalmente, usando datos de las encuestas de calidad de vida (ECV) realizadas para los años 1997, 2003, 2008 y 2010 se replica el ejercicio utilizando los hogares como unidad de análisis. Particularmente el estudio da luces sobre la necesidad de tomar acciones específicas para minimizar el número de muertes, reducir la vulnerabilidad en sectores de educación y sobre la niñez y la juventud y atender de manera expedita los efectos negativos sobre las condiciones de los hogares más afectados por estos eventos.
O20|La Economía de la Paz|En el futuro cercano se debe poner en práctica una nueva teoría económica basada en los hechos recientes: la economía de la paz. La teoría económica de la paz propone que la interdependencia económica promueva la paz y prevenga los conflictos. La interdependencia económica es conducente a la paz porque la cooperación económica entre actores privados y públicos puede generar el interés nacional en diversos temas, entre ellos el económico.
O20|El crecimiento empresarial una herramienta fundamental para la reducción de la pobreza|En este documento se estudian las tendencias de pobreza y desigualdad en Colombia con el fin de establecer los factores determinantes en su variación; tanto la medición como la disminución de éste flagelo depende de innumerables factores. Tomando casos empresariales reales, la intervención privada a través de la responsabilidad social y observando estadísticas de gasto público social, se propone analizar la incidencia de este tipo de intervenciones en las variaciones positivas de las cifras de pobreza y desigualdad en Colombia.******This paper deals with poverty and inequality tendencies in Colombia in order to establish the decisive factors in their variation. Both measuring and decreasing of this problematic depends of many factors. Taking real enterprise cases, private intervention through social responsibility and checking statistics of social state expenditure, it is proposed to establish the incidence of these kinds of interventions in the positive variations of poverty and inequality figures in Colombia,
O20|Causal Interaction among Electricity Consumption, Financial Development, Exports and Economic Growth in Jordan: Dynamic Simultaneous Equation Models|The goal of this paper is to examine the empirical dynamic relationship among the electrical consumption (ELC) and economic growth (proxies by gross domestic product [GDP] per capita), export, and financial development (domestic credit to the private sector as a percentage of GDP) in Jordan over the 1976-2011 period. Annual time series data and the autoregressive distributed lag model are used. The augmented Dickey–Fuller, F-bound testing, Granger causality, GIRF, and cumulative sum of recursive residuals, cumulative sum of squares tests were applied to test the stationary, cointegration, causality and stability, respectively, among the variables. There is evidence of a long-term equilibrium relationship between electricity consumption and the economic growth, and a unidirectional relationship runs from real GDP to ELC. This is indicating that per capita increase in economic growth may cause a perpetual rise in the ELC in Jordan.
O20|Protecting child nutritional status in the aftermath of a financial crisis: Evidence from Indonesia|In response to concerns over the vulnerability of the young in the wake of Indonesia's 1997–1998 economic crises, the Government of Indonesia implemented a supplementary feeding program to support early childhood nutritional status. This paper exploits heterogeneity in duration of program exposure to evaluate the impact of the program on children aged 6 to 60months. By examining differences in nutritional status of treated younger children and a placebo group of older children, the analysis finds that the program improved the nutritional status of treated children, and most significantly, led to 7 and 15% declines in rates of moderate and severe stunting, respectively, for children aged 12 to 24months who were exposed to the program for at least 12months over two years.
O20|Insurance development and the finance-growth nexus: Evidence from 34 OECD countries|This paper examines causal relationships between insurance market development, financial development, and economic growth in 34 OECD countries for the period 1988–2012. Insurance market development is defined in terms of life, non-life, and total insurance pervasiveness, both by density and penetration. Financial development is a composite index constructed from eight financial development indicators relating to banking and stock markets. We use a panel vector auto-regression model to reveal the nature of Granger causality among the variables. Our results reveal that insurance market development specifically and financial market development overall seem both to be long-run causative factors of economic growth. On the other hand, our short-run causality results show a diverse pattern of short-run adjustment dynamics between the variables, including the possibility of feedback between them in several instances.
O20|Women and Agricultural Productivity: What Does the Evidence Tell Us?| Should agricultural development programs target women in order to increase productivity? This paper reviews the extensive literature on men’s and women’s relative productivity in agriculture, most of which concludes that controlling for access to inputs, plot and farmer characateristics, there are little or no gender gaps in productivity. In addition, the paper identifies the many challenges to disentangling individual level productivity.

O20|After Ricardo â€“ after Marx â€“ after Keynes: comparative advantage, mutual advantage and implications for global governance|This paper submits that one of the most fallacious paradigms in economic thought and policy, stemming from Ricardo, has been that of comparative advantage, as it has assumed no capital mobility whereas it has been mainly foreign direct investment that has driven global trade since World War II and has confirmed Marx's claims for uneven development. The paper outlines that this has meant asymmetric outcomes compromising the post-war Bretton Woods system and suggests that this needs both a post-Ricardian and a post-Keynesian conceptual framework for global governance.
O20|Moral Capital in the Twenty-First Century|This paper recasts Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century in light of Acs’ Why Philanthropy Matters: How the Wealthy Give and What It Means for Our Economic Well-Being. Philanthropy matters in this debate because, as moral capital, philanthropy offers an alternative solution to the Piketty conundrum, and it does so without relying exclusively on a wealth tax and government intervention. Moral capital over the centuries strengthened both capitalism and democracy by investing in opportunity (slavery, suffrage and civil rights), which in turn leads to long-term economic growth and greater equality. By focusing on university research—which is critical in promoting technological innovation, economic equality, and economic security—that creates a large, well-functioning middle class (The Economist, March 2015), moral capital represents the missing link in the theory of capitalism development.
O20|Resource Windfalls and Local Government Behaviour: Evidence From a Policy Reform in Indonesia|"We analyze the impact of a natural experiment in Indonesia that allocated certain district governments with a windfall revenue from natural resource production. Our identification is based on a comparison between bordering districts in provinces that received the windfall with those that did not receive it, before and after the fiscal reform in 1999. We study the impact on a range of outcome variables such as regional GDP, infrastructure quality, employment, education, and household consumption. Our results demonstrate a ""flypaper effect"" in the sense that the increased revenue led to higher spending without any lowering of local taxes. We argue that the large relative increases in spending on public services contributed to a very strong increase in local GDP levels, led by the agricultural sector. A 100-dollar windfall further increased literacy by about 2 percent and non-food consumption by 67 USD. The strong general tendency of positive effects from the reform stands in contrast to the negative effects emphasized in the resource curse literature."
O20|Innovation Bureaucracy: Does the organization of government matter when promoting innovation?|Current research on how to organize the role of government in innovation – both how governments support innovation in markets and how governments achieve innovations within public organizations for improving its market supporting activities – converges around a rather simplified single-organization explanations: innovations are driven by either (Weberian) elite expert organizations or (Schumpeterian) fluid peripheral organizations. We show that looking at history of innovation bureaucracy, a more complex picture emerges: historically we find a rich organizational variety for implementing diverse innovation policy goals. We show that historically the organizational variety is, first, driven by highly diverse public-private relationships; and second, the variety itself is an important factor in success and failure of innovation policies. Combining analytical lenses created by Weber and Mintzberg we build analytical framework based on routines and capacities to analyze organizational variety in innovation bureaucracy. We show how different kinds of public organizations are successful at delivering different kinds of innovation policy goals and impacts. Particularly important is the distinction between organizations capable of innovations in policies (instrumental performance) vs organizations supporting innovations in private sector (substantive performance). We finish with discussing the importance of organizational variety for the concept of entrepreneurial state.
O20|The role of clusters and public policy in new regional economic path development|This chapter deals with the role of clusters and public policy in new regional economic path development. New path development is analysed from an institutional perspective by focusing on changes in the wider regional innovation system (RIS), including firms, universities and governmental agencies, and by placing emphasis on the role that public policy can play. We argue that new regional economic path development requires a broad-based policy approach that stimulates cross-fertilizing effects between different industrial activities within and beyond the region. While cluster policies are well-suited to support the growth and sustainment of existing industries, policies for new path development should aim at regional diversification and variety creation, preferably based on existing strengths and expertise in the region. These ideas are central to the Constructing Regional Advantage (CRA) approach. Empirically, the chapter draws on case study research on two new regional economic growth paths in Sweden and Norway, namely the new media cluster in Southern Sweden and the Oslo Cancer cluster. While the first is an example of path renewal through combining knowledge bases, the latter is an example for new path creation based on scientific knowledge. The empirical analysis underlines the role that public policy can play in facilitating new regional economic path development.
O20|From Research Project to Research Portfolio: Meeting Scale and Complexity|The article considers how the past and present tendency to focus on selecting the best projects based on the sole criterion of meritorious science may result in a sub-optimal portfolio. The authors argue that scientists need to proactively engage in the discussion over the need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of societal investments to ensure that the next generation of the management and decision-making process for our science, technology and innovation system is rooted in sound principles. The classic peer review process tends to provide unintended overlap and allows for an ill fit between some of the pieces and unwanted gaps to occur. Areas of high risk and high return can be missed due to their controversial nature and split decisions typically resulting in negative funding decisions. In general, high risk and a high frequency of split decisions tend to be replaced with lower risk initiatives. The authors propose herein supplementing peer review with research portfolio evaluation approaches and decision-making tools that can better assess research uncertainties and other special features of the transformation of the resulting knowledge into improved social well-being. A coupling of research quality review by peers with more systematic portfolio meta-analysis of recommended projects is both possible and essential.
O20|Foresight for Science and Technology Priority Setting in Korea|The main purpose of Technology Foresight (TF) in Korea is to predict the development of S&T and use the results in developing S&T policies. However, informing the public about what the future holds based on the development of S&T is an equally important role of TF. Since the introduction of the first TF in 1994, Korea has conducted four such studies. TF in Korea has become a key process in setting S&T policy, such as the Science and Technology Basic Plan (S&T Basic Plan). The S&T Basic Plan determines the national strategic technologies by reflecting on future technology. The S&T Basic Plan is a mandatory legal planning process established every five years by the Korean government. It is the top-level policy document affecting S&T-related policy making in Korea. TF in Korea primarily utilizes the Delphi method. The third and fourth TFs have strengthened the links between S&T and society by determining future technologies capable of solving future needs. The fourth TF presented scenarios and special illustrations to show members of the public the future technologies and their implications for society. Additionally, the fourth round of TF analyzed the potential negative impacts of future technologies.
O20|Priorities Setting with Foresight in South Africa|South Africa has only irregularly undertaken exercises to identify priority technology areas, despite government recognition of their importance. Moreover this activity has no institutional frameworks. This article reviews past efforts in this field in South Africa. In the end of 1990s, the Department of Arts Culture, Science and Technology announced the results of the National Research and Technology Foresight. One of the key implications of these results was that, in contrast to the rest of the world, South African stakeholders fail to recognize the importance of emerging technologies such as nanotechnology, micro-production as well as simulation technologies as cost-effective components of new product and process development. These results appear to have permeated through the STI policy and as a result, the country appears to be lagging in terms of research in emerging technologies. The main focus of the authors is on the findings of the most recent effort supported by the Department of Trade and Industry to identify changes in industrialists’ opinions related to technology priorities. The recent results indicate that the country is integrating into the global economy, as national priorities are converging with priorities elsewhere.
O20|25 Years of the Transition Strategy Debate: Radicalism versus Gradualism|In this paper, we trace the academic debate on the transition strategies that former socialist countries have adopted and implemented in evolving towards a market-oriented economy through a comprehensive review of the preceding literature. The debate has developed as an argument between two conflicting reform philosophies, namely, radicalism and gradualism. Despite that a quarter century that has passed since the fall of the Berlin Wall, we found that academic discussion regarding these two reform alternatives has continued, and there is no sign of convergence. We also found a close relationship between the debate attitudes and the literature attributes, such as authorship, research contents and publication media.
O20|Mobile Network Big Data for Development: Demystifying the Uses and Challenges|Given the volumes of data that are now generated by mobile networks due to the almost ubiquitous use of mobile phones by the majority of the population, this data can be considered as big data. Spurred by the exponential growth of mobile connectivity, the attendant large volumes of mobile network big data (MNBD), offer the possibility to obtain rich behavioral insights at a scale that was never possible before. MNBD is also one of the few sources of information on low-income groups. The focus of this paper is to illuminate both academics as well as policy makers on the potential uses of MNBD for public purposes, as well as to articulate the challenges that need to be addressed if such work is to be mainstreamed. This paper also provides a literature review of existing work that has leveraged MNBD to produce insights to inform a host of public policy domains including Transport, Economic Development and Health.
O20|Exploring the Role of ICT-enabled Social Innovation for the Active Inclusion of Young People|This Report presents the final results of the study ‘ICT-enabled social innovation services for active inclusion of young people’ (IESI-Youth) which has been commissioned by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS) and implemented by Arcola Research in 2014. The overall objective of the study was to review the state of the art in the domain of active inclusion services for young people, with a specific focus on how ICTs can support active inclusion of disadvantaged youth to strengthen their skills and capacities and support them to participate fully in employment and social life. The study was conducted as preparatory activity contributing to the development of the broader research project on 'ICT enabled Social Innovation in support of the Implementation of the Social Investment Package (IESI) being implemented by JRC-IPTS in collaboration with DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL).
O20|"""A Flop or a Success?"" An Evaluation of the Welfare Impacts of the 6-3-3-4 Education System in Nigeria"|The need for graduates who would be productive citizens able to contribute significantly to the Nigerian economy led to the overhaul of the old education system 6-5-4 and the implementation of the 6-3-3-4 system, with its first set of graduates from secondary schools in 1988. The main objective of the 6-3-3- 4 system was to produce self-reliant graduates with better labor market skills and earning potential. In this paper, we investigate to what extent this goal was achieved. Using a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design, we examine if graduates from the 6-3-3-4 system experienced an improvement in welfare compared to those from the old system. We measure welfare improvement using several indicators such as a decline in poverty likelihood and poverty gap, an increase in the probability of employment and an increase in wages. Our results provide some evidence that the new system led to a decrease in the likelihood of being poor compared to those who passed through the old system. We also provide evidence of higher wages for select participants. We do not find any consistent evidence that the 6-3-3-4 system increased the probability of being employed when we compare participants from both systems. Our results suggest that while the system change may not have met some of its critical objectives, it cannot be viewed as totally ineffective.
O20|A model of dynamic conflict in ethnocracies| We model an infinitely repeated Tullock contest, over the sharing of some given resource, between two ethnic groups. The resource is allocated by a composite state institution according to relative ethnic control; hence the ethnic groups contest the extent of institutional ethnic bias. The contest yields the per-period relative influence over institutions, which partly spills over into the next period, by affecting relative conflict efficiency. Our model generates non-monotone evolution of both conflict and distribution. Results suggest that external interventions, when effective in reducing current conflict and protecting weaker groups, may end up sowing the seeds of greater future conflict.
O20|Women empowerment and antenatal care utilization in Bangladesh|This study attempts to examine the role of women empowerment in the utilization of antenatal care in Bangladesh. Four dimensions are considered to measure the women empowerment: the highest level of education, freedom of choice/movement, power in the household decision making process and involvement in economic activities. Factor analysis technique is employed to construct the last three dimensions. The probit and the zero-inflated negative binomial regression models are specified and estimated using the 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data. Results show that all four dimensions of women empowerment contribute positively and significantly to the decision and intensity of utilization of antenatal care in Bangladesh. Findings of the study have a number of policy implications on this issue for a developing country like Bangladesh.
O20|The effect of Market structure on the integration of rice prices with paddy prices and its impact on farmers family income in the Kroya district, indramayu regency, Indonesia|One way to increase the paddy farmers family incomes is to increase the rice price. This is based on the assumption that the increase in the rice price will subsequently increase the paddy price, which, in turn, will increase the family incomes of paddy farmers. This assumption is valid when there is integration between the rice and paddy prices; such integration occurs within a free and competitive market structure. This study aims to find evidence that the market for farmers with small areas of land is not a “free and competitive market” but a “monopsony”, in which increases in rice prices will not increase the farmers family incomes. This is an important scientific finding for suggestion in food policy. The research method is survey, with proportional stratified random sampling. The objects research is small farmers, medium farmers and large farmers in Kroya subdistrict, Indramayu Regency, Indonesia. The reason for choosing this area is this area is ultimate producers paddy in Indonesia. After calculation from minimum number sample formula, then number sample for small farmers is 48, for medium farmers is 39, and large farmers is 16 farmers. The analysis for rice price integration with paddy price is regression analysis, if regression estimate is significant it can be concluded the paddy price is influenced by rice price. Paddy price to farmers family income impact Analysis is done by a difference test, between the rice prices, before and after the increases in the prices. If farmers income is different it be concluded the rice price have an impact to farmers family income. The research finding is, for the small farmers, their paddy price is not influenced by the market rice price. The market structure for small farmer is a near monopsony. The paddy price influenced by the rice price is only for middle and large farmers. The free and competitive market structure is only for the large farmers. It is only large and middle farmers feels the impact of rice price to farmers family income; In another hand, the increase of rice price do not have such an impact for family incomes of the small farmers. The reason for it, is because revenue from the increasing paddy price do not cover the increasing of family expediture from the increasing rice price. The policy implication from this research sugest is, the policy of increasing rice price to increasing farmer’s family income is a bad policy. This is because the policy increasing rice don’t affect for small farmer’s family income. The increasing rice price only affect for middle and larger farmer’s [End Page 217] family income. According BPS (2014), 57 percent farmer’s in Indonesia is a small farmers, that mean increasing rice price only increasing less a half number of farmer’s family income income in Indonesia.
O20|Innovation in Eastern Europe : a case study of Czech Republic|In this study we evaluate innovative performance of the economies of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) based on the available statistics of innovation processes. We compare such country-level indicators as educational levels, investments in R&D, FDI, trade and licensing flows, patents and scientific articles, and find that the most developed CEE economies are also the most innovative. At the same time, as supported by the results of the interviews in Czech Republic, one of the top performers in the CEE region, its economy is facing a number of challenges that are similar to other middle-income countries around the world. We suggest addressing these challenges from the prospective of the Middle Income Trap, when a middle-income economy to sustain growth must learn to compete with advanced economies in high-skill innovation. Development of effective innovation policy should be a priority for the CEE countries to escape from the middle income trap.
O20|Hasan Gürak, Economic Growth and Development: Theories, Criticisms and an Alternative Growth Model|The book that consists of 240 pages including the bibliography and contains the following sections and chapters; The Foreword: This contains a few brief remarks regarding the philosophy of science and philosophy of economics. The remarks are, in principle, both relevant and appropriate in terms of the “general principles” with regard to science, the science of economics, the nature of science as well as the duties of a scientist. The author’s remarks underline that “neoclassical economics” which is widely acknowledged as the school that economics seems to represent, is, in fact, a more “ideological model” than a true scientific and realistic basis for economics and, in fact, favors the “dominant classes” in the society.
O20|Labor-Capital Conflict: From Eurocentric Capitalism Towards. A Humanistic World Order|What Wells summarized in the first quote above was Eurocentric capitalism. It has now become the principal source of instability and inequality in the world. Speculation, not profit, is its driver; profit has taken a back-seat. Capital market, the arena for speculation, is disconnected from the real economy, particularly the labor market which rewards less and less the workers and producers. Rewards, as private wealth are increasingly in speculative capital gains which accrue to the top 1% elite, made up of stock market players and financial institutions, while the rest [workers, middle class and those in lower segments of the socio-economic pyramid] fall behind.
O20|Indonesiaâ€™s Dynamic Electricity Power Sector: Investigating Need and Supply Performance|This paper analyzes the development and problems of electricity sector in Indonesia. After the economic crisis of 1997/98, investment in power sector has been decreasing. Minimizing transmission and distribution loss can increase reliability and quality of power supply, improve financial capacity, and reduce electricity subsidy. Electrification ratio and electric power consumption per capita need to be improved equally among provinces. Promoting public private partnership (PPP) can boost investment. Main policy challenges need to be addressed are that government needs to (1) provide information on the investment prospects; (2) solve social aspect of the project; and (3) provide practical guide in land acquisition.

O20|Identifying and addressing gaps in the UNFCCC reporting framework|There are many reasons why the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reporting framework requests information from countries. These include understanding and tracking progress with individual or collective commitments or pledges, providing confidence and enhancing accountability in quantified information measured and reported, and providing background information on the scope and ambition of national climate responses. This paper highlights the gaps, inconsistencies and uncertainties in the current reporting framework, which was developed for both long-standing obligations and mitigation pledges for the period to 2020. The paper also identifies possible improvements in the UNFCCC reporting framework in the context of the post-2020 transparency framework and nationally determined contributions (NDCs) for the post-2020 period. Recenser et combler les lacunes du cadre de notification d'informations de la CCNUCC La Convention-cadre des Nations Unies sur les changements climatiques (CCNUCC), qui invite les pays à lui communiquer des informations, vise plusieurs objectifs : mieux cerner les progrès accomplis dans la mise en oeuvre des engagements individuels ou collectifs et en assurer le suivi ; accroître la confiance dans les informations chiffrées communiquées par les pays et renforcer la transparence ; et fournir des renseignements sur le champ d’application et le niveau d’ambition des mesures climatiques nationales. Ce document met en évidence les lacunes, incohérences et incertitudes de l’actuel cadre de notification qui a été élaboré pour rendre compte à la fois des obligations de longue date des pays et de leurs engagements d’atténuation jusqu’en 2020. Il identifie aussi les améliorations qui pourraient être apportées au système de notification de la CCNUCC en ce qui concerne le cadre de transparence et les contributions déterminées au niveau national pour la période de l’après-2020.
O20|Victory in War and Defeat in Peace: Politics and Economics of Post-Conflict Sri Lanka|This paper examines causes and implications of Sri Lanka's political regime shift in February 2015, which has been widely hailed a victory for democracy, against the backdrop of the country's political and economic development in the post-independence era. The regime shift vividly demonstrates that voters, given the chance, turn against leaders they perceive to be corrupt, nepotistic, or needlessly divisive, even if they deliver handsome growth figures; there are limits to gaining political legitimacy in a multi-ethnic state simply by creating cleavages between majority and minority communities. For the first time, the minority communities in Sri Lanka appear to have felt themselves part of, and potentially an important influence on, the national political scene. It is, however, difficult at this stage to predict whether the regime change would usher in an era of ethnic harmony and robust economic growth. One hope is that war-weariness and discontent with the previous regime seem to have led to a greater willingness to accommodate diverse perspectives and demands within the political system.
O20|The Role Of The State In Creating A Green Economy|"Starting from the crisis on the real economy in 2008 it has been developed an intense discussion, supported by a number of declarations on the global scale, about the need for changes in the economy. A huge impact on this state of affairs was the analysis of the causes and effects of the economic downturn and the challenges of the future. As a result, some states have taken action to remedy the situation. Many of them were aimed at structural changes in production, consumption and environmental friendly investment. At the same time gained in importance the concept of ""low carbon economy"" and ""green economy"". The aim of this paper is to present the role of the state in the economy in terms of creating conditions for a green economy. The thesis of publication is: implementation of structural changes connected with creating a green economy requires the involvement of the state."
O20|Energy security of Ukraine in the context of its sustainable development|Energy security is an important issue for Ukraine's sustainable development. The main goal of the article is to show the state of energy security of Ukraine, analyze its tendencies and challenges, reveal the impact of energy security on sustainable development of a country. The state of the energy security of Ukraine was analyzed with the help of data collection, processing and analysis. Data was taken from State Statistics Service of Ukraine, Ministry of Energetics and Coal Industry of Ukraine, other sources, and analyzed with the help of tools of statistics and economic analysis. Ukraine, being a developing country and experiencing war, political and economic crisis, struggles for energy security support. The present state of energy availability and consumption in the country influences its sustainable development and political stability, and is a significant restraint in country's survival. Despite the fact, that Ukraine has enough resources' deposits to provide itself with energy, it provides less than 50% of own demands and is dependent on Russia's resources. Production of energy in Ukraine is decreasing, but energy consumption remains high. Ukrainian industries are energywasteful and energy inefficient; the country has the leading positions in energy intensity of GDP. The article shows relation of energy sources and energy security of Ukraine to sustainable development, reveals dependency of Ukrainian energy security and indicates its main threats and ways out.
O20|How Could the South Respond to Secular Stagnation in the North?|Developed countries face the risk of a sustained lack of aggregate demand, i.e. secular stagnation. Demand-oriented growth models emphasizing the balance-of-payments constraint raise concerns about attendant adverse growth impacts on developing countries from reduced export growth. These concerns are well-founded, albeit less serious than the simplest versions of these models would imply. Relaxing their assumptions and emphasizing cumulative causation forces from domestic-demand growth and relative price effects indicates how developing countries can combine export and domestic demand-based strategies and how changed policies can maintain rapid growth while reducing the income elasticity of import demand. Crucial is investment that reduces gaps between the composition of domestic production and domestic demand and emphasizes sectors with cumulative-causation effects, combined with incomes policy and capital-account management. Drawing down excessive foreign-exchange reserves and obtaining concessionary loans from development banks can finance required capital-goods imports, especially in countries with insufficient innovation capacity. Enhanced South-South integration may be an important complement for small countries.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O20|Institutional Laws, and Mergers and Acquisitions in India: A Review/Recommendation|The paper intends to review, summarize and discuss various institutional laws refer to mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in India, and thereby recommend fruitful policy guidelines for institutions and managers participating in foreign investment and acquisition deals. Further, we also show the market for value of foreign inbound and outbound deals representing India for the period 2004 through 2013. The major observations include, higher valuation inbound-deals had delayed or failed due to weak financial infrastructure, erratic nature of government officials and political intervention, and the newly elected government has aimed to attract higher inflow of investment from other developed and emerging markets by easing investment rules and offering tax holidays. The study eventually would help policy makers, M&A advisors, legal consultants and investment bankers in assorted issues, and private equity firms and multinational firms intending to invest in Indian business.
O20|Issues and barriers in economic development (Last stage of economic development)|The research study is to determine the barriers within overall economic development which diversify the issues and problems in growth. Pakistan is a well-sustainable economy in current world. This research investigated the factor affecting issues which are unrealistic. The most common issues are financial issues, negative human resource policies, micro inflation and corruption in public and private projects.
O20|Conditions of diffusion of competitiveness clusters' technologies: A brief theoretical note|Competitiveness clusters (or innovation clusters) are the focal point of French new industrial policy. They are based on classical cluster model and its well-known agglomeration positive externalities and on benefits of cooperation. After a brief literature review of cluster theory, we focus on the theoretical conditions under which French innovation clusters can foster production and diffusion of technological innovations. Our short critical analysis points out three non-exhaustive conditions: (i) the capacity to coordinate and to incitate cooperation in R&D; (ii) the capacity to favor production and technological knowledge transfer; (iii) the capacity to promote and to keep R&D appropriation by cooperating innovators.
O20|Out of Equilibrium: Bases, Basics, Policies, and Accounts|New regulation of EU cohesion policy prescribes ex ante impact eval- uations. These imply a vision of the working of a process of economic change. A theory of change based on the concept of equilibrium (which is a situation in which by definition change is not liable to occur) being paradoxical, the present article aims at presenting bases and basics of Amendola’s out-of-equilibrium approach in a perspective that is instru- mental in the above-referred concrete policy issue. Accordingly, after reviewing the essentials of John Hicks’ concern with the construction of an out-of-equilibrium approach, the key concepts at play in Amendola and Gaffard’s out-of-equilibrium model are summarized and, after considering the resulting perspective on policy making, and touching on EU o�cial framework for institutional accounts, the sequence of ac- counts implicit in the out-of-equilibrium model is eventually derived.
O20|Culinary Tourism in Greece: Can the past define the future? A comparative analysis by using 10 case studies|This paper examines the possibility that gastronomy, based on ancient Greek values, could be part of the answer for economic prosperity through the development of food tourism in a country with harsh economic environment such as Greece. We examine if local food, culture and tourism could become great fields of new entrepreneurial and thus regional development when paired with knowledge, innovation and quality. We shall examine what the historical background on ideas such as gastronomy, entrepreneurship, and innovation in ancient Greek culture; in order prove that the answer to contemporary business practicing might be hidden in the history of the country. Real examples of innovative entrepreneurship related to gastronomy will be presented as case studies. By analyzing them, we will prove that there is an answer for potential business growth, when tailor-made solutions are applied that take into account the unique characteristics of a place while utilizing its competitive advantages.
