N45|Education and Conflict: Evidence from a Policy Experiment in Indonesia|This paper studies the impact of school construction on the likelihood of conflict, drawing on a policy experiment in Indonesia, and collecting our own novel dataset on political violence for 289 districts in Indonesia over the period 1955-1994. We find that education has a strong, robust and quantitatively sizeable conflict-reducing impact. It is shown that the channels of transmission are both related to economic factors as well as to an increase in inter-religious trust and tolerance. Interestingly, while societal mechanisms are found to have an immediate impact, economic channels only gain importance after some years. We also show that school construction results in a shift away from violent means of expression (armed conflict) towards non-violent ones (peaceful protests).
N45|Taxing Identity: Theory and Evidence from Early Islam|A ruler who does not identify with a social group, whether on religious, ethnic, cultural or socioeconomic grounds, is confronted with a trade-off between taking advantage of the out-group population's eagerness to maintain its identity and inducing it to ``comply'' (conversion, quit, exodus or any other way of accommodating the ruler's own identity). This paper first analyzes the ruler's optimal mix of discriminatory and non-discriminatory taxation, both in a static and an evolving environment. The paper then uses novel data sources to test the theory in the context of Egypt's conversion to Islam between 641 and 1200. The evidence is broadly consistent with the theoretical predictions.
N45|Economic experiences of Japanese civilian repatriates in Hiroshima prefecture, 1945-1956|After World War II, more than six million people returned to Japan from various parts of the former Japanese empire. Most studies of Japanese postwar repatriation have focused on the repatriation policies of the Allied powers and the Japanese government, the repatriation process between 1945 and 1956, and postwar memories of repatriates. In contrast, the economic experiences of repatriates in the postwar era have yet to be studied. This paper uses a large-scale national survey of repatriates’ postwar lives conducted by the Japanese government in 1956, focussing more specifically on approximately 110,000 civilian repatriates living in Hiroshima prefecture in 1956. The findings of this research contrast with prevailing suggestions that repatriates were totally neglected by the Japanese government and society. Instead, this research demonstrates that in Hiroshima prefecture, repatriates’ postwar job placement was facilitated by employment in agriculture, public sector employment, and the transferable skills possessed by some repatriates. The information from the 1956 government survey shows that approximately 60 per cent of repatriates fell in these categories, while the remaining 40 per cent found employment in new areas or became unemployed. Research on repatriates in other prefectures (Ibaraki, Osaka, and Kanagawa) shows a similar trend. As a result, despite the scale of the repatriation, the settlement was broadly successful. It can be argued that this type of transition helped to bring political and economic stability, which became a foundation of Japan’s postwar economic recovery.
N45|Central Asia Oil and Gas Industry - The External Powers’ Energy Interests in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan|After the Soviet breakup, Central Asia has gained importance for several States because of its geographical location and abundance of hydrocarbon reserves. These hydrocarbon reserves are located mainly in three countries: Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Each of them has taken different path regarding its foreign policy and the regulation of investments and participation of external companies and States in its energy sector. Through the development, production and export of their oil and gas reserves, they have pursued a ‘multi-vector’ policy, consolidating differently their relations with other countries. The main States involved – at different levels and for different reasons – in the oil and gas sector of the Central Asian countries are: Russia, China, United States, European countries, Iran, India and Turkey. Among these players, Russia considers Central Asia still part of its sphere of influence for historical reasons, while it has to deal an increasing presence of Beijing. The Western countries has gained influence particularly in Kazakhstan, but they have no political leverage in Turkmenistan. This working paper provides an overview of the current situation of external players’ interests in the oil and gas industry of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The working paper is structured into four different sections. In the first section, the paper gives an overview of the main interests and pillars of external involvement in Central Asia as a region. The other three sections are devoted to provide separately the current status of energy relations between each Central Asian country and external players, starting from the closest countries (Russia and China) to the regional ones (Iran, Turkey and India) until non-regional countries (United States and European countries). During these analysis, investments in the oil and gas sector as well as energy export routes and volumes are highlighted in order to understand the current situation of the energy relations. At the end of each country section, the main trends and interests of the countries in the regional oil and gas sector are outlined.
N45|Japan and the Asian Divergence: Market Integration, Climate Anomalies and Famines during the 18th and 19th Centuries|This paper asks whether better integration of rice markets in Japan during the 19th and 20th centuries compared to China and India explains the ‘Little Divergence’ in Asia and Japan’s role in the ‘Great Divergence’. It analyses rice prices for 13 markets across Japan during 1720-1857 and finds that Japan had relatively well-integrated rice markets, particularly western Japan. In eastern Japan market integration was partially impeded by distance to Osaka, which was the core market, and the greater ecological vulnerability of rice in northeast Japan to lower temperatures during the ‘little ice age’ that lasted until the mid-19th century. Relatively well-integrated markets did not prevent major famines during 1732-1733, 1783-1786, and 1833-1838, because stocks and supplies were insufficient to withstand the consequences of sequences of crop failures. Better integration of rice markets is indicative of higher allocative efficiency of markets in Japan which is a likely reason that ‘shrinking’ episodes caused fewer setbacks in long-term economic growth compared to in China and India.
N45|The persistent institutional effect of liberal colonialism: Evidence from China's financial policies|The effect of liberal colonialism on the allocation of capital persists to this day. As Lange et al. (Colonialism and development: A comparative analysis of Spanish and British colonies. 2006) define and suggest, the authors exploit the colonial history of China during 1896-1911 with qualitative evidence to measure liberal colonialism. They document that liberal colonialism promotes the subsequent efficiency of financial policies on capital allocation in 2004 through the quality of economic institutions.
N45|Stakeholder Views on Interactions between Low-carbon Policies and Carbon Markets in China: Lessons from the Guangdong ETS|China set up pilot Emission Trading Schemes (ETS) in seven cities and provinces from 2013 as a new instrument to incentivise carbon dioxide emission reduction and to reach its 40-45% carbon intensity reduction target by 2020. Using a two-stage survey (a closed-form questionnaire followed by open interviews), we elicit views of stakeholders from Guangdong province on carbon markets, with an emphasis on how ETS would interact with other existing or proposed low-carbon and clean energy policies. Our survey shows that academic stakeholders viewed the interactions between the carbon market and other lowcarbon policies as a significant potential problem but there was less awareness by stakeholders from other sectors. There is a positive correlation between recognising such policy interactions may pose a problem and the time spent working on energy saving and emission reduction policies. Whereas both increasing renewable targets and imposing a carbon tax in addition to an existing ETS would be expected to depress prices in the ETS, relatively few respondents identified this effect correctly. Apart from government respondents, all other stakeholders lacked confidence in China's carbon markets, which is associated with both their lack of knowledge and information about the market and concerns regarding uncertainties and government policy design. The need for learning from the pilot schemes particularly on monitoring, reporting and verification was seen as vital but challenging given the speed of rolling out a national ETS.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N45|Culture and Colonial Legacy: Evidence from Public Goods Games|We conduct a public goods game in three small towns in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Due to historical military conquest, until 1947 these towns were on (barely) opposite sides of a colonial border separating British India from the Princely States. Our research design offers a treatment comparison between the towns of (British) Kekri and (Princely) Sarwar, and a control comparison between (Princely) Sarwar and (Princely) Shahpura. We find no significant difference in contributions to home town groups, but a significant difference in contributions to mixed town groups. Participants in (British) Kekri are more co-operative (i.e., contribute more) in mixed town groups compared to those in (Princely) Sarwar. We find the differences are driven by individuals with family ties to the towns, and we find no differences in the control comparison. Our results highlight the enduring effects of colonial rule on social norms of co-operation
N45|Economic Shocks and Temple Desecrations in Medieval India|Economic downturns can create conditions for mass uprisings that threaten an authoritarian ruler. Religious authority can provide the ideological force needed to solve the collective action problem that hinders a revolution. When co-option is infeasible, the ruler can respond to economic shocks by suppressing the religious authority of the popular religion. In this paper we provide empirical evidence of this response in medieval India. Using centuries of geo-referenced data we document a positive relationship between weather fluctuations and the destruction of Hindu temples under Muslim rule. Specifically, during periods of large weather fluctuations the likelihood of a Muslim State desecrating a Hindu temple increases by about 1 percentage point (relative to the baseline of 0.7%). We explore various mechanisms that could drive the ruler’s response and show that regime stability is the likely explanation for this relationship. The paper contributes to our understanding of the behaviour of authoritarian regimes in diverse societies.

N45|Leniency, Asymmetric Punishment and Corruption: Evidence from China|Leniency policies and asymmetric punishment are regarded as potentially powerful anticorruption tools, also in the light of their success in busting price-fixing cartels. It has been argued, however, that the introduction of these policies in China in 1997 has not helped fighting corruption. Following up on this view, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party passed, in November 2015, a reform introducing heavier penalties, but also restrictions to leniency. Properly designing and correctly evaluating these policies is difficult. Corruption is only observed if detected, and an increase in convictions is consistent with both reduced deterrence or improved detection. We map the evolution of the Chinese anti-corruption legislation, collect data on corruption cases for the period 1986-2010, and apply a new method to identify deterrence effects from changes in detected cases developed for cartels by Miller (2009). We document a large and stable fall in corruption cases starting immediately after the 1997 reform, consistent with a negative effect of the reform on corruption detection, but under specific assumptions also with increased deterrence. To resolve this ambiguity, we collect and analyze a random sample of case files from corruption trials. Results point to a negative effect of the 1997 reform, linked to the increased leniency also for bribe-takers cooperating after being denounced. This likely enhanced their ability to retaliate against reporting bribe-givers – chilling detection through whistleblowing – as predicted by theories on how these programs should (not) be designed.
N45|The Silver Standard as a discipline on money over-issuance: The mechanism of paper money in Yuan China|"""The Yuan was the first dynasty both in Chinese and world history to use paper money as its sole medium of circulation, and also established the earliest silver standard. This paper explores the impact of paper money in Yuan China. We find that: (1) At the beginning of its regime, due to the strict constraints of the silver standard on money issuances, the value of paper money was stable. (2) Since the middle stage of the dynasty, the central government had to finance fiscal deficits by issuing more paper money, and inflation was thus unavoidable. Our empirical results also demonstrate that fiscal pressure from multiple provincial rebellions was the most important factor driving the government to issue more paper money; however, the emperor’s largesse, which had been viewed as another source of fiscal deficits by most traditional historians, had no significant effect on the over-issuance of paper money. (3) When the monetary standard switched from silver to paper money, the impact of fiscal deficits, which were driving more paper money issuances, became much more severe. Based on these findings, we argue that the experience of Yuan China verified that metal standards could serve as a discipline on paper money over-issuances. This episode in Yuan China predates the money over-issuances observed during the era of the classic gold standard found in western countries by six centuries."""
N45|The Migration of Fear: An Analysis of Migration Choices of Syrian Refugees|The current literature on forced migration offers only limited knowledge of how each of the different consequences of war, such as damage to property and casualties to family members, and the services provided to the refugees in the host country, affect the difficult choices that refugees subsequently must make as to when and where to migrate once again. This paper contributes to the literature on forced migration by studying the effects of armed violence in the country that has given rise to the largest number of refugees in the world in the last decade, namely Syria, on those various migration-related decisions. The study is based on all three waves (2013, 2014 and 2015) of a survey conducted of Syrian refugees in Turkey, the country with the largest number of Syrian refugees. The study first examines the various impacts of war (property damage, casualties, sleeping disorders) on the refugees by gender, age, education, income and other characteristics. More importantly, it then investigates the consequences of these different impacts of war as well as the duration of the refugee’s stay in Turkey, the quality of services provided to these refugees and the individual characteristics of the refugees on various alternative choices about the timing and destination of future migration by refugees using a logit model. The results show that (1) the longer and greater the level of violence in the country of origin, and the longer the time spent outside of Syria, the lower the likelihood of the choice to return to the country of origin; (2). the longer the time the refugee has spent in Turkey, the higher is the probability of permanent settlement in another European country; and (3) the more and higher quality of services provided to the refugees, the more likely they are to remain in Turkey While females are more likely to want to return to Syria, men and especially those with greater education, higher income and personal networks are more likely to want to relocate somewhere in Europe or elsewhere.

N45|Le mode de production asiatique et la Chine. Retour sur la pertinence d'un concept biaisé|Proposed in 1859 by Karl Marx in onder to characterize India, the concept of an Asiatic mode of production was widened to explain the whole Asia stagnation in the 19th century. Severely criticized for political reasons during the 20th century, its economic relevance was rarely put into question. Indeed, in China's case, economic growth is frequently impeded by local governments actions, what could, at least in part, rehabilitate Marx's analysis.
N45|Signaling Dissent: Political Behavior in the Arab World|What explains the variety of political behavior observed across the Arab world in recent years? We model political participation as a continuum from non-violent to violent activities where the chief purpose of political action is to signal discontent. The credibility of those signals, however, depends on the personal cost of political engagement, with the result being that individuals from both extreme high-cost and low-cost groups may self-exclude even when highly discontent. We show, further, that political violence constitutes a credible alternative for those for whom peaceful protest carries little signaling value. Using data from three nationally representative surveys of the Middle East and North Africa conducted over the past decade we find that socioeconomic status is generally, positively associated with non-violent political behavior of all types. Semi-parametric analysis reveals that political action, in keeping with our signaling framework, exhibits strong non-linear properties: the likelihood of participation in peaceful protests and strikes is highest among the upper-middle class, while support for violence is concentrated among the lower-middle class.
N45|Black Market Prices during World War II in Japan: An Estimate Using the Hedonic Approach|This paper constructs a time series of data related to black- market prices of five goods (rice, sweet potatoes, potatoes, chicken eggs and sugar) during World War II (WWII) in Japan. It is the first attempt to capture the actual price fluctuation trends for individual products throughout the period during and after WWII. To this end, I have employed the hedonic approach, which is a methodology used to adjust for the quality of goods including the characteristics of counterparties and places of transaction in constructing the price data, to obtain estimates that are as unbiased as possible. The data reveals that 1) black-market prices of these goods soared during WWII to post 40-80 percent inflation on a quarterly basis toward the end of the war, 2) by the end of the war, black-market prices had already increased by over 50 times (in the case of sweet potatoes) or 700 times (in the case of sugar) compared with 1934 levels, prior to wartime inflation, indicating more severe inflation during the war than after the war, 3) the most severe period of inflation varied by product, peaking during the war for rice and sugar and after the war for sweet potatoes, potatoes and chicken eggs, and 4) black- market prices were generally higher in urban areas than in rural areas.
N45|Political participation of the muslim brotherhood in Kuwait : the impacts of electoral reforms and the arab uprising|This paper examines the impacts of electoral reforms and the Arab Spring on the activities of the Muslim Brotherhood in Kuwait. The Islamic Constitutional Movement (ICM), its political wing, has been participating in parliamentary elections since 1991. As a result of electoral reforms in 2006, the ICM lost some of its seats. However, it gained seats in the February 2012 election. Focusing on the structure of political competition in Kuwait, we analyse the reasons for this volatility.
N45|Hamas's ascension and its international relations : literature review|This paper focuses on a literature review and summarizes the international relations in which Hamas or its preceding Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine has been situated. Its relations with Israel, the U.S., Russia, Iran, and other Arab countries are overviewed based on previous studies. The diplomatic policy of Hamas is also investigated regarding its own approach and relations with other countries.
N45|Hamas and the Gaza war of 2014 : developments since the arab spring in Palestine|This paper demonstrates the impacts of the Arab Spring on Palestine's internal and international politics. It also indicates their links with the subsequent Gaza War in the summer of 2014. A special focus is on Hamas, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was already in power before 2011, though under pressure because of economic sanctions and denial of recognition. Considering such pressure, the associated developments can be explained as a natural consequence.
N45|Security, Trade, and Political Violence|To address security concerns, governments often implement trade barriers and re- strictions on the movement of goods and people. These restrictions have negative economic consequences, possibly increasing the supply of political violence. To test this hypothesis, we exploit the restrictions imposed by Israel on imports to the West Bank as a quasi-experiment. In 2008 Israel started enforcing severe restric- tions on the import of selected dual-use goods and materials, de facto banning a number of production inputs from entering the West Bank. We show that after 2008 (i) output and wages decrease in those manufacturing sectors that use those materials more intensively as production inputs, (ii) wages decrease in those local- ities where employment is more concentrated in these sectors, and (iii) episodes of political violence are more likely to occur in these localities. Our calculations suggest these effects account for 18% of the violent political events that occurred in the West Bank from 2008 to 2014.
N45|Autocratic Rule and Social Capital: Evidence from Imperial China|This paper explores the impact of autocratic rule on social capital—defined as the beliefs, attitudes, norms and perceptions that support cooperation. Political repression is a distinguishing characteristic of autocratic regimes. Between 1660–1788, individuals in imperial China were persecuted if they were suspected of holding subversive attitudes towards the state. A difference-in-differences approach suggests that in an average prefecture, exposure to those literary inquisitions led to a decline of 38% in local charities—a key proxy of social capital. Consistent with the historical panel results, we find that in affected prefectures, individuals have lower levels of generalized trust in modern China. Taking advantage of institutional variation in 20th c. China, and two instrumental variables, we provide further evidence that political repression permanently reduced social capital. Furthermore, we find that individuals in prefectures with a legacy of literary inquisitions ar are more politically apathetic. These results indicate a potential vicious cycle in which autocratic rule becomes self-reinforcing through causing a permanent decline in social capital.
N45|Internal Conflict, Elite Action, and State Failure: Evidence from China, 1000-1911|This paper analyzes the long-run dynamics of internal conflict, elite action over privately- versus publicly-provided security, and state development outcomes in China. We construct new county-level data that span nearly one millennium. We find that, traditionally, elites turned away from clans and toward the imperial government for safety in times of internal conflict. After the new globalizing Western influence took hold in the mid-1800s, however, threatening the imperial government's viability, we find that elites turned back toward clans for protection, particularly during the Taiping Rebellion. Finally, we find a positive link between renewed clan activity and the eventual failure of the imperial Qing state. Our analysis provides a new perspective on the political origins of the Great Divergence, by which Europe took off economically, but China fell behind.
N45|Education is Forbidden: The Effect of the Boko Haram Conflict on Education in North-East Nigeria|TThis paper quantifies the microeconomic impact of the Boko Haram conflict on various educational outcomes of children living in North-East Nigeria during the period 2009- 2016. Using an individual panel fixed-effects regression and exploiting both over-time and within-district variation in household-level conflict exposure, we show that conflict reduces school enrollment and increases the probability of school dropout. In addition, using a standard difference-in-difference estimation strategy, we show that conflict reduces the years of education completed. As for the mechanisms explaining the decision to abandon school, we document that conflict increases the child's probability of working in the household's non-farm enterprise, a choice likely to be motivated by the conflict -induced worsening in the quality of the school supply. Finally, we find that conflict also worsen the general health conditions of the students.
N45|American Radical Economists in Maoâ€™s China: From Hopes to Disillusionment|American radical economists in the 1960s perceived China under Maoism as an important experiment in creating a new society, aspects of which they hoped could serve as a model for the developing world. But the knowledge of â€˜actually existing Maoismâ€™ was very limited due to the mutual isolation between China and the US. This paper analyses the First Friendship Delegation of American Radical Political Economists (FFDARPE) to the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in 1972, consisting mainly of Union for Radical Political Economics (URPE) members, which was the first visit of a group of American economists to China since 1949. Based on interviews with trip participants as well as archival and published material, this paper studies what we can learn about the engagement with Maoism by American radical economists from their dialogues with Chinese hosts, from their on-the-ground observations, and their reflection upon return. We show how the visitorsâ€™ own ideas conflicted and intersected with their perception of the Maoist practice on gender relations; workersâ€™ management and life in the communes. We also shed light on the diverging conceptions of the role for economic expertise between URPE and late Maoism. As the first in-depth study on the FFDARPE we provide rich empirical insights into an ice-breaking event in the larger process of normalization in the Sino- U.S relations, that ultimately led to the disillusionment of the Left with China.
N45|The formalization of banking supervision: A comparison between Japan and Sweden|This study examines the formalization of banking supervision in Japan and Sweden that occurred in the decades around 1900. Using an incremental change approach, the respective cases are traced and examined from three dimensions: 1) the legal framework, 2) the banking supervisory agency, and 3) bank supervisory activities. As a result of the comparative analysis, we find several similarities and differences. The most important finding is that the two cases are similar, in that financial crises - generally considered to be a primary driver for major regulatory and supervisory reforms - did not play the main role in the formalization of supervision in either Japan or Sweden. Rather, the formalization was an incremental adjustment to the organic development of the banking sector, the general public's increasing exposure to the banks as deposit holders and borrowers, and the increased need for professionalization of the banking sector.
N45|Holy Wars? Temple desecrations in Medieval India|We construct a unique geocoded dataset on temples, dynasties and battles in medieval India and propose a test to identify the motive for observed temple desecrations in that period. We test two competing historical narratives of temple desecrations. The first focuses on the idea of iconoclasm, i.e. destruction of religious sites and imagery deemed heretical, as embedded in Islamic theology. The second suggests that desecrations were driven by political considerations and hence occurred mainly during military battles. We use a novel instrument of Muslim ruler assassinations to address the potential endogeneity in our battles related variable. The results show that Muslim states did not desecrate temples because they were there, but only during the course of battle, probably to diminish the authority of the rival Hindu state. The battle events are crucial, the probability of temple desecration increases by over 30% when the Hindu-Muslim battle outcome is in favour of a Muslim state. Whether a temple was within the territory of a Muslim state does not impact the likelihood of its desecration. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that political tactics were the main stimulus of temple desecrations by medieval Muslim states.
N45|The Rise of a Financial Revolution in Republican China in 1900-1937: an Institutional Narrative|This paper surveys the phenomenal transformation of banking and finance, public debt and monetary regimes during 1900-1937, a period of great political instability in Chinese history. To understand why sectors which are often most vulnerable to the security of property rights and contract enforcement, have become the vanguard of growth in such an era of uncertainty, I highlight the role of institutions as seen in the form of a business dominated quasi-political structure that grew outside the formal political sphere. This structure rested on the institutional nexus of Western treaty ports (with Shanghai being the most important) and China Maritime Customs service, a relatively autonomous tax bureaucracy. By ensuring the credibility of repayment of government bonds, this financial-fiscal mechanism laid the institutional foundation for the rise of modern Chinese banks, a viable market for public debt and increasing supply of reputable convertible bank notes. My survey sheds new light on some of the most important and controversial issues related to Chinese and global economic history.
N45|The Paradox of Power: Understanding Fiscal Capacity in Imperial China and Absolutist Regimes|Tax extraction in Qing China was low relative to Western Europe. It is not obvious why: China was much more absolutist and had stronger rights over property and people. Why did the Chinese not convert their absolute power into revenue? We propose a model, supported by historical evidence, which suggests that i) the center could not ask its tax collecting agents to levy high taxes because it would incentivize agents to overtax the peasantry; ii) the center could not pay agents high wages in return for high taxes because the center had no mechanism to commit to refrain from confiscating the agent’s resources in times of crisis. A solution to this problem was to offer agents a low wage and ask for low taxes while allowing agents to take extra, unmonitored taxes from the peasantry. This solution only worked because of China’s weak administrative capacity due its size and poor monitoring technology. This analysis suggests that low investment in administrative capacity can be an optimal solution for an absolutist ruler since it substitutes for a credible commitment to refrain from confiscation. Our study carries implications for state capacity beyond Imperial China.

N45|Friends from afar: The Taiping Rebellion, cultural proximity and primary schooling in the Lower Yangzi, 1850–1949|This paper tests the hypothesis that the cultural distance between migrants and natives impedes the provision of public goods. The Taiping Rebellion was a shock that caused groups without a history of shared governance to be relocated to the same region. We use a unique historical dataset of surnames in the Lower Yangzi of China to construct a measure of the cultural distance between migrants and natives (MNCD). We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the MNCD is associated with a decrease of over 0.19 public primary schools per 10,000 persons in the early twentieth century. The results survive various robustness checks and an instrumental variable analysis that exploits the pre-existing cultural distances between the native and the nearby population. Evidence from the timing of when the MNCD takes effect suggests that the primary mechanism runs from migrant-native cultural distance through quality of collective decision-making to modern primary education.

N45|China's Growing Ties with Middle East: Goals and Objectives|"""Objective –This study evaluates China's rapid growth of economic, trade and investment ties with key Middle Eastern countries and its long term economic, geo-political and strategic goals and objectives, as well as opportunities and limitations in the light of the relative decline of US power and influence in the region. Methodology/Technique – A qualitative research methodology is applied in the study and wide range of secondary sources including articles, papers and online resources are used, analyzed and consulted. Data on trade and investment statistics between China and major Middle Eastern countries are also tabulated and used. Findings – The study concludes that economic and trade interests as well as stable and regular oil and gas supply are the primary consideration in this burgeoning relationship. The study also finds that strategic factors like geopolitical locations, large territories with huge natural resources, rising consumer markets and potential areas of military cooperation and arms sales make the Middle East a more lucrative and attractive partner to China. Novelty –The study looks at the relationship between China and the Middle East."""
N45|Between war and peace: The Ottoman economy and foreign exchange trading at the Istanbul bourse|Between 1914 and 1918, the Ottoman Empire was involved in the First World War, which caused economic disruptions, huge budget deficits, surmounted inflation rates and excessive devaluation of Lira, the Ottoman currency. Based on the value of Lira against the currencies of three selected countries that were not in the war, we focus on the effects of news about the war on the foreign exchange rates at the Istanbul bourse from 1918 to 1919. Our results signify some dates, which match the official announcements of the war events and/or the official treaties.

To deal with these inefficiencies, reforms were implemented, as supervisory organizations were established during the default period. We ask how investors traded at the Istanbul bourse evaluated the outcomes of these reforms and organizations. We manually collect data on price of the General Debt bond from 1873 to 1883. Using the GARCH methodology, we examine the volatility jumps in return of the bond due to the reforms and supervisory organization in the Ottoman Empire. The volatility changes are indicators for risk perceptions of the investors. Our empirical results support that investors positively responded to foundation of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration and the acceptance of gold standard, heralding the persistent decrease in the risk premia over time. The Ottoman case is instructive for the understanding of today’s economic situation in emerging markets such as Greece, while we could argue that long-lived and comprehensive measures with foreign creditors’ supervision on fiscal and monetary systems matter more for investors’ perceptions. No empirical research studies the impacts of the reforms and supervisory organizations on the Istanbul bourse, as this large dataset has never been used before.
N45|The Origins of Cultural Divergence: Evidence from a Developing Country|Cultural norms diverge substantially across societies, even within the same country. The present paper examines the voluntary settlement hypothesis, proposing that individualistic people tend to self-select into migrating out from collectivist societies toward the frontier areas, and that such patterns of historical migration are reflected even in the current distribution of norms. Gaining independence in 939 CE after 1000 years of Chinese colonization, historical Vietnam occupied the region that is now north Vietnam with a collectivist social organization. From the 11th to the 18th centuries, historical Vietnam gradually expanded its territory southward to the Mekong River Delta through various waves of conquest and migration. Combining findings from household survey and lab-in-the-field experiment, we demonstrate that areas annexed earlier to historical Vietnam are currently more prone to a collectivist culture. Relying on many historical accounts, together with various checks and tests, we show that the dominant mechanism behind this finding is the southward out-migration of individualistic people during the territorial expansion.
N45|Revenue Nodes in South India and Central Java|Studies of relations binding ruled and ruler over the form and content of revenue assessment during the colonial era are not lacking. Rather, the intellectual challenge lies in ascertaining the degree to which the relevant economic institutions of the subjected regions in southern Asia constituted continuity of tradition, modifications thereof, or completely alien constructs. Meeting that challenge is hindered by inequality of information revealing ‘before’ and ‘after’ conditions; an embarrassment of riches in information on the latter contrasts to poverty of the former. The present paper aims at least partially filling that gap by ascertaining in comparative perspective the basis of the revenue assessment systems prevailing in South India (Karnataka) and Central Java (Yogyakarta) during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. What makes such an undertaking not only desirable from a scholarly point of view but also possible in practice is the near unique finds of virtually untapped original source materials deriving from the respective institutions’ function.
N45|Geopolitics and Asia’s little divergence: State building in China and Japan after 1850|We provide a new framework to account for the diverging paths of political development in China and Japan during the late nineteenth century. The arrival of Western powers not only brought opportunities to adopt new technologies, but also fundamentally threatened the sovereignty of both countries. These threats and opportunities produce an unambiguous impetus toward centralization and modernization for small states, but place conflicting demands on larger states. We use our theory to study why China, which had been centralized for much of its history, experienced gradual disintegration upon the Western arrival, and how Japan rapidly unified and modernized.
N45|Child Discipline in Times of Conflict|Using a unique pairing of household survey data and geolocational conflict data, we investigate the relationship between local conflict intensity and the disciplinary methods employed by Iraqi households. We find that parents in high-conflict areas are more likely to use both moderate and severe corporal punishment, and are less likely to use constructive parenting techniques like redirection. While there is a general sense that war has profound long-term impacts on the psychological health of children, research on transmission mechanisms is very limited. These are among the first results that rigorously document an association between violent conflict and child maltreatment and, to our knowledge, the first that document changes in child discipline practices even across a mainstream parenting spectrum. Given the persistence of early childhood outcomes into adulthood, these results are potentially an important piece of assessing and mitigating the long-term costs of war on the civilian population.
N45|The presidents of the Bank of Taiwan and their times : background, management and business development : 1899-1925|This paper is the brief history of the Bank of Taiwan (BOT, 台湾銀行) from 1899 to 1925, especially focusing on the first to the fourth presidents who represent the era of the rise and fall of the BOT. The BOT was established by the Japanese government in 1899 as colonial development bank in Taiwan, however they changed the business model to that of an international bank covering mainland China and Southeast Asia in 1910s. This rapid expansionism failed in the early 1920s and the BOT temporarily closed its doors in 1927. The question is how and when these problems occurred and spread in the organization as a result of mismanagement. Through the analysis of their achievements and personal background along with corporate performance and macro history, we are better able to understand the rise and fall of the BOT.
N45|Regulatory policy in India: Moving towards regulatory governance|This paper provides an analysis of India’s existing regulatory regime and its evolution over the last 25 years, and the efforts to improve the regulatory framework as India has transitioned towards a market economy. The paper argues that while India has implemented many sector specific regulatory reforms, the absence of a government wide initiative to improve regulatory quality, or implement a whole of government regulatory policy, has prevented India from creating a consistent and coherent regulatory environment and has undermined trust and integrity in the regulatory system. As a result, outcomes of regulatory governance have so far been quite mixed. In many cases they have fallen far short of expectations. The paper therefore identifies some of the constraints that have challenged India’s regulatory governance, the dominant presence of state owned enterprises, the multi-level government structures and regulatory independence of agencies and institutions. Meanwhile, effective regulatory governance has distinctly evolved in the securities market and it highlights the reasons behind the success of the securities market regulator. The positive example of the Securities Exchange Board of India is outlined to showcase the potential for implementing good regulatory practice through regulatory oversight, better governance of regulators, stakeholder engagement and regulatory impact assessments. The paper also looks at issues related to Regulatory Impact Assessments in the Indian context.
N45|Confucianism and the Legalism: A Model of the National Strategy of Governance in Ancient China|The Confucian school emphasizes family value, moral persuasions, and personal relations. Under Confucianism, there is a free-rider issue in the provision of efforts. Since national officials are chosen through personal relations, they may not be the most capable. The Legalist school emphasizes the usage of incentives and formal institutions. Under the Legalism, the ruler provides strong incentives to local officials which may lead to side effects because some activities are noncontractible. The cold-blood image of the Legalism may alien citizens. By exploiting the paternalistic relationship between the ruler and the ruled under Confucianism and the strength of institution-building under the Legalism, the ruler may benefit from a combination of Confucianism approach and the Legalism approach as the national strategy of governance. As each strategy has its pros and cons, which strategy of is optimal depends on factors such as the minimum enforceable level of public service and the level of institution building costs.

N45|Internal Rebellions and External Threats: A Model of Government Organizational Forms in Ancient China|In ancient China, a ruler needed to handle both internal rebellions and external threats. To decrease the possibility of internal rebellions, a ruler could organize the government to establish the division of power among ministers. While effective in preventing internal rebellions, this approach could make the defense of the country against external threats less effective. The trade-off between preventing internal rebellions and dealing with external threats in a ruler's choice of government organizational form is affected by factors such as the size of the population, the level of coordination efficiency, and the degree of increasing returns to the military sector. If the magnitude of external threats increases, regardless of the type of equilibrium organizational form, the equilibrium level of the concentration of power among division heads increases.
N45|Political Reforms vs. Undemocratic Institutional Arrangements in Hong Kong|This essay examines the recent political developments in Hong Kong. Specifically, it examines the problem of political accountability and unresponsive governance. The essay argues that lack of accountability is a byproduct of existing institutional arrangements – i.e., limited functional franchise, veto powers and institutional backdoors – which promote rent-seeking behavior among tycoons and undermine the economic freedoms of ordinary Hongkongers, who, dissatisfied with the current state of affairs, demand political reforms.
N45|Ottoman stock returns during the Turco-Italian and Balkan Wars of 1910-1914|In this paper, we use new historical data on the most popular stocks traded at the Istanbul bourse between 1910 and 1914, to examine the effect of wars on stock market prices. During this period, the Ottoman Empire was involved in the Turco-Italian and the Balkan wars, leading to massive land losses before the First World War. The data are manually collected from the available volumes of two daily Ottoman newspapers, Tercüman-ı Hakikat and Tanin. Our findings are quite surprising, as we observe only a temporary and small drop of prices, indicating little perceived risk by stock investors of the Istanbul bourse.
N45|Colonial adventures in tropical agriculture: new estimates of returns to investment in the Netherlands Indies, 1919–1938|How profitable were foreign investments in plantation agriculture in the Netherlands Indies during the late colonial era? We use a new dataset of monthly quoted stock prices and dividends of international companies at the Brussels stock exchange to estimate the returns to investment in tropical agriculture (1919–1938). We adopt the Dimson–March–Staunton method to compute real geometric annual average rates of return and assess our estimates in an international comparative perspective. We find that returns to colonial FDI in the Netherlands Indies during 1919–1928 were impressive (14.3 %), being almost 3 percentage points higher than the world average. In the following decade 1929–1938 fortunes reversed, with a rate of return of −2.8 % compared to a world average of 2.2 %. Over the entire period the returns to colonial FDI (5.4 % in 1919–1938) were about a factor 2.5 higher than returns to investment in the Dutch domestic economy (2.1 % in 1920–1939). We argue that these returns should be interpreted in a colonial context of systematic labour repression, but that they may also partly reflect a higher risk-premium of investments in colonial commodities.
N45|The impact of Syrian refugees on the labor market in neighboring countries: empirical evidence from Jordan| This paper analyzes time-sensitive data on a humanitarian crisis in the Middle East. It aims to assess the impact of the steep influx of Syrian refugees into Jordan on the country’s labor market since the onset of the conflict in Syria (March 2011). As of August 2014, nearly three million registered Syrians have sought refuge in neighboring countries (Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Turkey), according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Jordan and Lebanon are hosting the majority of them. This paper utilizes data regarding unemployment rates, employment rates, labor force participation, the number of refugees, and economic activity at the level of governorates. The vector autoregressive methodology is used to examine time series data from the most affected governorates in Jordan. The empirical results of Granger causality tests and impulse response functions show that there is no relationship between the influx of Syrian refugees and the Jordanian labor market. Our results are verified through a set of robustness checks.
N45|"""Get rid of the four olds"": the long-lasting impact of the Chinese Cultural Revolution on Chinese society"|This paper studies the long-term impact of the Chinese Cultural Revolution on interpersonal trust, mental health and perceived equality. The Cultural Revolution was a social upheaval in China between 1966 and 1976 initiated by China’s leader Mao Zedong that resulted in a period of anarchy, violence and chaos as well as a large number of deaths, injuries and much persecution across China and was in particular targeted at intellectuals and the wealthy. The Cultural Revolution is likely to have had a long-lasting impact on social capital and preferences as well as on mental well-being. Using data from the Chinese General Social Survey as well as county level data on the number of abnormal deaths and victims of political persecution between 1966 and 1971 from Walder and Su (2003), I use a difference-in-difference strategy comparing individuals born before the Cultural Revolution with those born thereafter as well as across different counties to estimate the impact of Cultural Revolution intensity measured by victims and abnormal deaths on interpersonal trust, depression and perceived equality. To control for potential endogeneity due to unobservables as well as for measurement error, I instrument Cultural Revolution Intensity with the number of universities in a county at the time of the Cultural Revolution. I find that the Cultural Revolution is associated with lower levels of interpersonal trust, perceived equality and depression for more educated individuals born before the Cultural Revolution. These results are largely robust to a battery of tests. This shows that violence and conflict can have long-lasting effects on societies and that the consequences of the Cultural Revolution persist in China up to today.

N45|The rise of a financial revolution in Republican China in 1900-1937: an institutional narrative|This paper surveys the phenomenal transformation of banking and finance, public debt and monetary regimes during 1900-1937, a period of great political instability in Chinese history. To understand why sectors which are often most vulnerable to the security of property rights and contract enforcement, have become the vanguard of growth in such an era of uncertainty, I highlight the role of institutions as seen in the form of a business dominated quasi-political structure that grew outside the formal political sphere. This structure rested on the institutional nexus of Western treaty ports (with Shanghai being the important) and China Maritime Customs service, a relatively autonomous tax bureaucracy. By ensuring the credibility of repayment of government bonds, this financial-fiscal mechanism laid the institutional foundation for the rise of modern Chinese banks, a viable market for public debt and increasing supply of reputable convertible bank notes during this era of national dis-integration. Our narrative carries far-reaching implications on the ongoing great divergence debate.

N45|Price shocks in disaster: the Great Kantō Earthquake in Japan,1923|This paper tests the operation of markets in the wake of a sudden exogenous shock in prewar Japan, the Great Kantō Earthquake of 1923. Using a unique monthly wholesale price dataset of provincial cities, we found that the earthquake had a positive impact on the price of rice and timber in the sample cities. Our results also indicate that the wholesale price of rice in cities in the northeast of Japan, which were more closely integrated with the affected region, experienced more significant price rises than those in western Japan. Nevertheless, although further research using retail as opposed to wholesale prices of goods is needed, these preliminary findings suggest that the diffusion of price instability outwards from the affected region was on a lesser scale than might have been expected.
N45|О некоторых свойствах наблюдаемого экономического роста в Китае (On Some Features of the Observed Economic Growth in China)|Экономический рост современного Китая впечатляет многих. Эта страна предлагается в качестве модели для подражания экономистами с совершенно противоположными взглядами: от либертарианских до этатистских. Авторы попытались показать, что: - китайский экономический рост менее устойчив, чем кажется; - власти страны, особенно в последние годы, совершают действия, подрывающие стабильность роста; Феномен быстрого экономического роста с огромным притоком иностранных инвестиций и бурным ростом экспортоориентированного сектора. Ключевую роль для Китая сыграло прекращение массовых репрессий при легализации бизнеса, создании индивидуальных неформальных гарантий для отечественных и иностранных предпринимателей. То есть предприниматель не лишался свободы и имущества только из-за воли властей, которая была не ограничена законом или какой-либо внутренней или внешней силой. Изменение политической ситуации вместе с накопленным запасом финансовой прочности создали соблазн усилить контроль над экономикой путем отказа от гарантий сначала для отечественного бизнеса, а затем и для иностранного. Именно это и происходит сейчас: когда начались аресты не только предпринимателей – граждан Китая, но и предпринимателей-нерезидентов. In this article authors focused on factors of Chinese economic miracle. Majority of economists are deeply impressed by high rate of China's economic growth. They are going to search for explanations of the coming new successes of this country. The missed point of these assessments is lack of attention to the new trend of poor formalized China institutions' development. Clearly observable in the modern Peoples Republic of China deterioration of entrepreneur's personal immunity informal guaranties means broken guaranties for private property. The government failure to defend (at least not make a threat) to private property could cause negative influence on China's economic growth in very Long Run.
N45|Asymmetric Information under the Kafala Sponsorship System: Impacts on Foreign Domestic Workers' Income and Employment Status in the GCC Countries|This paper examines the legal and policy implications of information asymmetry on foreign domestic workers employed under the Kafala sponsorship system in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Drawing from ethnographic and field-based observations in large GCC migrant destinations – including Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – we investigate the information flows and market uncertainties between five key stakeholders: labor-receiving governments, labor-sending governments, recruitment agencies (subagents), sponsors (employers), and social networks. Several factors contribute to asymmetric information: the lack of bilateral labor agreements and government policy coordination, programs between and among government entities, the absence of labor law for domestic workers, and the laissez faire approach of the labor-receiving government. These sources of asymmetric information create serious market vulnerabilities for the domestic worker population, often resulting in loss of employment and early deportation. The concluding section further outlines policy implications and areas of methodological research on GCC migration.
N45|Households in Times of War : Adaptation Strategies during the Nepal Civil War|This paper analyses short and medium term consequences of the Nepalese civil war on rural households livelihoods and on the inter-group distribution of income. Conclusions rely on two very rich datasets: the Nepal Living Standards Survey collected before, during and after the war and data on the number of killings by month and village during the eleven years of the conflict. Using the survey timing as a quasi-natural experiment, results indicate that in the short-run all households loose, but high castes by a larger extent. Short-term coping strategies determine medium term diverging recovery paths. Non-high castes allocate more labour in agriculture and loose more in the medium term. High castes diversify their income sources, notably by relying on migration, which allows them to recover.
N45|Islamic conscious capitalism: a ‘Third Way’ in light of classical scripture|"The economic paradigm and framework advocated for in Islam is one that entails a unique combination of various socio–economic philosophies. This article advances the notion that Islam promotes a capitalistic economic model wrapped in its own garment of understanding—fashioned with threads of equity and stitched in patterns of benevolence and justice. This article examines the Islamic theological framework relating to the profit incentive and its spiritually–conscious methodology of capital procurement. The Qur’an contains around 370 references in regard to commerce, from which much of Islamic law relating to lending, banking and trading originates (Heck in Muhammad and the Arab roots of capitalism (Studien zur Geschichte und Kultur des Islamichen Orients)—Band 18. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, p 5, 85, 2006 ). This article intends to explore the potential that these teachings have for an Islamic ‘Third Way’ (i.e. an Islamic contribution to economic philosophy and discourse that is in-between of, or an alternative to, both the purely individualistic primary concerns on prices, profits, and private property inherent in ""pure"" capitalism, and the purely communal command economics of communism, which often negates or discourages the promotion of self-interests). Part I of this paper intends to introduce the reader to the various sources of Islamic ‘law’ and its scope. In doing so, the philosophical nature and objectives of the Shariah will become evident, through the exploration of specific theological economic teachings. Part II intends to study Islam’s theological attitude toward entrepreneurship and the profit incentive, as well as the concept of the potential for salvation through ethical profits. Part III explores, in light of classical Islamic scripture, the various prohibitions within the Islamic concept of the economy. In doing so, the paper shall explore how values and theories found in classical Islamic scripture have found contemporary application within the growing modern Islamic finance industry, for example, through Shariah ‘screens’ applied on market indicies, such as the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index. Part III shall also explore Islamic edicts with regards to business practices, as well as environmental ethics. In doing so, Part IV concludes that there can indeed be such an Islamic ‘Third Way’, drawn along similar shared values found amongst other world religions.

N45|The role of financial elites in banking supervision in Japan from 1927 to 1998|"Following the collapse of the bubble economy in Japan, banking supervisors and bank examiners were severely criticized by the media as human capital had long been viewed the key element of Japanese banking supervision. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the bank supervisors´ career paths over the long term, including ""amakudari"" appointments from among the Directors of the Financial Inspection Department of the Ministry of Finance, and the Director-Generals of the Bank Examination Department of the Bank of Japan. The paper analyzes the performance of several regional banks that accepted the appointment of an ex-Director or an ex-Director-General as their president in order to examine whether such an amakudari relationship worsened such banks´ management. The majority of ex-Directors and ex-Director-Generals entered a regional bank or a regional bank II, many of which were already experiencing problems. Regarding the regional banks, lower growth rates of loans were observed in all cases, and lower loan/deposit ratios or higher capital/asset ratios were observed in most. These findings suggest that the link between the amakudari relationship and the bubble economy in the late 1980s was not as straightforwardly negative as is generally considered."
N45|Do we have proportionate gender in policy making? a study based on key government institutions of saarc region|Women empowerment has remained a long standing issue for practitioners and policy makers at all levels even in the present modern known era of modernization. The basic objective of this study is to assess gender equality in the top sphere of the SAARC key governmental institutions from the recruitment and selection perspective. This study has used secondary data collected from the official websites of the governments and its affiliated key institutions. The unique feature of this study is that it analyzes gender inequality phenomena form the recruitment and selection perspective. An extensive gap has been identified between male and female top executives serving in key government institutions, which is not only a serious challenge for the global gender equality policy but also a serious question on government gender selection polices in the region. The notion of male dominance clearly prevails in the current scenario of the gender representation in government institutions, which remains a serious challenge for the gender equality. It has been concluded that a special focus is needed to prioritize the selection mechanism for females in top power structure of these governments especially in SAARC region.
N45|Identity-Based Policies and Identity Manipulation: Evidence from Colonial Punjab|I study identity-marker based policies and demonstrate the existence of identity manipulation. I analyze the impact of the Punjab Alienation of Land Act (1901), a caste-based legislation, on identity manipulation. Using data from the colonial census, I show that a movement of identity manipulation took place in response to the law. I estimate that in 20 years, 7.5 percent of the population that had an incentive to do so manipulated its identity. I then use an accounting exercise to estimate that the amount of mistargeting caused by this manipulation is between 3.9 percent and 8.2 percent of the land distributed.

N45|Moving to Shanghai: The massive internal migration to the first Chinese megacity (1927-1937)|As a result of the massive rural-urban migration, Shanghai transformed from a small costal city into the largest metropolis in China. During Nanjing Government Era (1927-1937), more than one million immigrants flocked into Shanghai and formed almost 80% of its population. Relying on the official statistics published by Nanjing Government and the historical archives and surveys, this article is one of the first attempts to quantify the population of Shanghai and the internal migration during the Republican China, and to analyze the characteristics of the immigrants to Shanghai. The study shows that the majority of the immigrants were young males from nearby rural areas. There was a high geographical concentration of the immigrants and existed the segmentation in the labour market and social status. The Great Depression had a late influence to China’s economy, and after 1932 large number of rural workers lost jobs, and the rate of immigration to Shanghai reduced. The industrial development and employment opportunities brought by migrants are the most important reason to attract people to Shanghai.
N45|Climate Shocks, State Capacity and Peasant Uprisings in North China during 25–1911 ce|" type=""main"" xml:id=""ecca12114-abs-0001""> China provides an interesting case study of civil conflict because of her long history and rich records. Using a unique dynastic panel dataset for north China during 25–1911 ce, this study finds that severe famines and dynastic age were positively correlated with peasant uprisings, whereas government disaster relief as a proxy for state capacity played a significant mitigating role. Negative climate shocks (e.g. severe drought, locust plagues) affected peasant uprisings primarily through the channel of severe famines. The effects of population density, temperature and other climate shocks (e.g. flood, levee breaches, snow disasters) were either not robust or insignificant."
N45|War-related risks and the Ýstanbul bourse on the eve of the First World War|The lack of well-documented information in the historical literature on the relationship between war-related expectations and their effects on the bond market in the Ottoman Empire motivates this paper's three contributions. First, this paper is the first empirical study to investigate the break points in the volatility of Ottoman bond prices from a historical point of view. Second, we use the econometric technique developed by Inclan and Tiao (1994) to identify the structural breaks. Last, we use a manually collected dataset from the daily newspapers of the time on daily Ottoman bond prices from 1910 to 1914. Subsequently, we identify five structural break dates, each of them corresponding to important war-related events. When we investigate the commentaries in the Ottoman newspapers, we see that the outbreak of several wars might not have been a surprise for investors in the Ottoman Empire, as reflected by government bond prices.
N45|Jordan and the Middle-Income Growth Trap: Arab Springs and Institutional Changes|Although Jordan reached middle-income status more than three decades ago, the country has not made the additional leap, like most developing countries in the Middle East, to become a high-income economy. In this paper, we argue that institutions, namely formal rules (constitution, judiciary, political system) as well as “personality-based” informal rules (tribalism, wasta) might explain the middle-income growth trap. More precisely, we highlight that informal institutions, as well as the distorted use of formal institutions, are a by-product of the process of state formation. They play a part in the preservation of personal/anonymous relationships between the state and society and in the persistence of the rentier system. Jordanian Spring events reveal that a demand for reforming the power structure prevails over the overthrow of the Monarchy. Finally, to assess the undergoing transition process in Jordan, we resort to the social orders conceptual framework (North et al. (2009, 2012)) with an emphasis on impersonality (Wallis (2011)). The “Arab Springs” events have put pressure on the power structure to advance the rule of law (impersonal relationships among elites), and on the Monarchy in Jordan to create a “perpetual” state.
N45|Myanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges|Since 2010, Myanmar has been in the midst of a multifaceted transition, involving economic reforms, the resolution of multiple long-standing civil conflicts, and a nascent transition to democratic rule. These transitions are coinciding with a resource-led economic boom. The paper assesses the current status of governance institutions, as well as their performance, in comparison to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and selected other countries. Specifically, the paper discusses outstanding problem areas related to economic governance, particularly in the legal system, the business regulatory framework, and in bureaucratic capacity as well as the potential use of external policy anchors, particularly in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) process, to strengthen Myanmar’s ongoing reform effort.

N45|Tunneling or Not? The Change of Legal Environment on the Effect of Post-Privatization Performance|Motivated by Hoff and Stiglitz’s (Am Econ Rev 94(3):753–763, 2004 ) theory, we examine empirically how the creation of “rules of the game” affect the behavior of economic agents in a transition economy. Using a sample of Chinese state-owned enterprises in which controlling ownership was transferred to private acquirers between 1994 and 2006, we find that the post-privatization performance (PPP) of firms depends on institutional factors. Before 2003, we observe severe post-privatization tunneling behaviors by acquirers and worse PPP. However, from 2003, when the State issued regulations against tunneling and strengthened enforcement, the incidence of tunneling behaviors declined, and PPP improved. We find that better implementation of ownership transfer and longer prior experience of private acquirers are key factors that contribute to the improvement.

N45|The Literary Inquisition: The Persecution of Intellectuals and Human Capital Accumulation in China|Imperial China used an empire-wide system of examinations to select civil servants. Using a semiparametric matching-based difference-in-differences estimator, we show that the persecution of scholar-officials led to a decline in the number of examinees at the provincial and prefectural level. To explore the long-run impact of literary inquisitions we employ a model to show that persecutions could reduce the provision of basic education and have a lasting effect on human capital accumulation. Using the 1982 census we find that literary inquisitions reduced literacy by between 2.25 and 4 percentage points at a prefectural level in the early 20th century. This corresponds to a 69% increase in the probability of an individual being illiterate. Prefectures affected by the literary inquisition had a higher proportion of workers in agriculture until the 1990s.
N45|Political economy of the Indonesian mass killing of 1965-1966|This chapter sketches the build up to the mass killing (politicide) of communists and communist sympathisers in Indonesia, during 1965 to 1966. Our key contribution is to explain why ordinary individuals, not belonging to the elite, might wish to participate in the act of murder. The mass murder aided the consolidation of the new order autocratic regime of Suharto, but his ascension to power cannot be separated from the cold war politics of the time. Over three decades of authoritarian rule did bring about broad based economic progress. In time, the authoritarian contract sustaining the regime became untenable and the contract lacked credible commitment in the absence of the transfer of some political power to the new middle class. This mirrors the modernization theory of endogenous democracy, which states that at higher level of income, the pressure for democracy becomes inexorable.
N45|Islamic Consumer Model, Fairness Behavior and Asymptotic Utility|Islamic faith and the ethical dimensions of the individual and the community play a significant role in guiding economic behavior by connecting the worldly life to the hereafter. The Shariah-compliant faith and ethical values generate specific behavior that requires Halal earning, fairness in spending and Halal utility leading to materialistic satisfaction and metaphysic reward. To analyze the Muslim consumer utility, in addition to the Islamic economics heritage, we rely on the instruments and prevailing assumptions in economics. Shaibani’s (750-805 AD) analysis of earning/spending/utility is based on three successive layers of earning/spending/utility; namely, the imperative, recommended, and the permissible. In this paper, we firstly contribute to developing a measure of the overspending and underspending. Secondly, based on the social solidarity, we show that the marginal earning has an effect on the macro MPC and depends mostly on the first differences between the MPC of the lower and upper social groups. Thirdly, according to the social welfare function, the permissible marginal utility is related to the faith interaction driving to an efficient transfer of purchasing capabilities to the targeted group. The optimal faithful behavior of affluent group leads, in the worldly life, to an elasticity of marginal utility less than or equal to one. The belief holding produces a hidden support in the worldly life but also engenders hereafter rewards through a steady eternal utility function, which generates an optimum of the marginal utility with elasticity greater than one.
N45|Malaysia NAP: More Shadows than Lights|After World War II, and in particular during the 1960s and the 1970s, many developing countries began their industrial revolution path. In particular, most of them followed a path of government-led industrial development, with central planning at the heart of the industrial policy. Such a model is not new in economic history and it is typical of many ‘second-comers’ in the industrialization process. The most famous one is the case of Prussia/Germany: with the Zollverein (1833-34) and after the unification in 1870, it was the government which stimulated the development of a powerful heavy industrial system, following what was preached at the time by Friedrich List. In particular, the key point of List preaching was that second-comers countries need to protect their industrialization process (characterized by infant industries) from foreign competition. According to List, once the protected industries reach an adequate competitive level, protection should be removed and the national companies should face competition in the market, in order to stimulate further technological development. Many second-comers countries embraced this model; however, in most cases they failed to follow the second part of List’s recommendations: opening to the market in a second stage.
N45|Un régime monétaire traditionnel contesté par la monnaie d’État : l’histoire du kip au Nord-Laos de 1975 à 2000|Le gouvernement de la République démocratique populaire lao impose un nouveau modèle économique en 1986. Les réformes engagées cherchent à promouvoir une « économie de marché » et à diffuser la monnaie nationale, le kip. Monétiser l’économie constitue un objectif de premier ordre et, en même temps, un moyen pour mettre en œuvre les processus de marchandisation. Cependant, imposer une nouvelle monnaie ne va pas de soi dans la mesure où elle conteste directement l’ordre monétaire antérieur et les pratiques sociales correspondantes. À Phongsaly, province isolée au nord de la République, l’État s’appuie sur la fiscalité et sur les transferts pour diffuser sa monnaie dans un environnement où elle occupait, au départ, une place ténue. Le kip s’impose, il transforme les représentations monétaires et les monnaies traditionnelles ; les biens dotés d’attributs monétaires sont relégués au niveau de la marchandise. L’action de l’État impulse un nouveau paysage monétaire au sommet duquel se trouve une monnaie idoine au développement des échanges marchands. Ainsi, les mutations sociales recherchées s’enclenchent et le programme politique voté en 1986 se réalise.
N45|Pharaohs of the deep state: Social capital in an obstinate regime|The paper aims to analyse the process of 'democratisation' or lack thereof after the 2011 Egyptian Arab Spring uprisings in the context of 'social capital'. While popular demand for reform toppled Hosni Mubarak in 2011, the transition period that followed showed the determination of regime remnants and the deep state, to preserve the underlying institutional structures of an entrenched authoritarian system. Mubarak's power base was grounded in a complicated system of interwoven relationships which entailed economic, social and political benefits. This social structure is analysed under the umbrella term 'social capital' to give an account of which network(s) pulled the cart in the pursuit of a contra democratic political agenda. A critical analysis of literature, relevant to the aim of the paper, is provided. Social capital is defined as the generalisation of norms and reciprocity which results from individuals' engagement in social networks. A general account on the most important social networks in Egypt is provided in the context of a military dominated social contract established after the 1952 military coup. This analysis concludes that the existing social capital network structure fostered and continues to foster the preservation of the authoritarian status quo. The transition period after the ousting of Mubarak presents a clear illustration of this. The well-embeddedness and the interdisciplinary nature of the deep in state in Egypt's power institutional structure were never eradicated, since the deep state restricted the interference of any 'non-conforming' entities in politics. The Egyptian deep state can be seen as self-sufficient, their penetration in every realm of society enables them to balance off adversaries when needed. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it attempts to show that authoritarianism is preserved when an elitists power network is established which thrives as a direct consequence of the underlying institutional structure. Secondly, it argues that social capital structures can produce an environment which is unfavourable to democratic development.
N45|From Divergence to Convergence: Reevaluating the History behind China's Economic Boom|China's long-term economic dynamics pose a formidable challenge to economic historians. The Qing Empire (1644-1911), the world's largest national economy before 1800, experienced a tripling of population during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries with no signs of diminishing per capita income. While the timing remains in dispute, a vast gap emerged between newly rich industrial nations and China's lagging economy in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. Only with an unprecedented growth spurt beginning in the late 1970s did this great divergence separating China from the global leaders substantially diminish, allowing China to regain its former standing among the world's largest economies. This essay develops an integrated framework for understanding that entire history, including both the divergence and the recent convergent trend. We explain how deeply embedded political and economic institutions that contributed to a long process of extensive growth before 1800 subsequently prevented China from capturing the benefits associated with the Industrial Revolution. During the twentieth century, the gradual erosion of these historic constraints and of new obstacles erected by socialist planning eventually opened the door to China's current boom. Our analysis links China's recent development to important elements of its past, while using recent success to provide fresh perspectives on the critical obstacles undermining earlier modernization efforts, and their eventual removal.
N45|The economic costs of sleaze or how replacing samurai with bureaucrats boosted regional growth in Meiji Japan|The notion that professional, efficient and non-corrupt bureaucracies foster economic growth is virtually uncontested. In spite of this wide consensus, central questions remain unanswered. Thus, while the harmful effects of dysfunctional administrations are extensively covered in the theoretical literature, little is known about the empirical relevance and the expected costs of insufficient administrative rationalization. And while efficient bureaucracies are considered a key ingredient to institutional performance, the existing research rarely investigates how desirable administrative structures have been implemented in history or which concrete policy measures constitute feasible reform strategies for present-day development countries. The present paper therefore aims at providing empirical evidence to dose this lacuna; to do so, it relies on the case of administrative reforms in the last three decades of the nineteenth century in Meiji Japan. Building on an exceptionally detailed set of official statistics and documentary sources, it constructs a panel of 45 Japanese prefectures and assesses the impact of heterogeneous reform implementation on canonical indicators of economic performance including measures of regional GDP, business activity and financial market development. The central results of the econometric analysis are that delayed administrative rationalization came along with a statistically significant and robust penalty on all development indicators. Moreover, this effect was remarkably persistent over time, as the data show that late-reforming prefectures performed systematically worse than the administrative forerunners until well into the twentieth century.
N45|Opium after the Manila Galleon: The Spanish involvement in the opium economy in East Asia (1815-1830)|This paper identifies the Spaniards’ involvement in the opium trade in China at the beginning of the 19th century. Several sources have been consulted, mainly the Jardine Matheson Archive at the University of Cambridge and the Archivo General de Indias in Seville. These activities took place from the end of the Manila Galleon until 1830, and were undertaken by some employees of the Spanish Royal Philippine Company in Calcutta and Canton in their private businesses. These houses collaborated closely with the British firms during the opium boom, and Manila private financial support was provided. Thus, Spaniards undoubtedly made a fundamental contribution during a key stage of development of the opium economy and evolution of modern Chinese history, being a precedent of what became the prestigious British company Jardine, Matheson & Co.

Based on this literature, we discuss the factors driving China’s development process. We provide a historical account of China’s rise, fall, and resurgence. We then discuss the stylized facts associated with China’s growth process and review a comprehensive theory of its economic transition. Finally, we discuss China’s future. In particular, we review some recent studies about technological and politico-economic factors that may foster or hinder its future economic performance.

N45|Lições do processo de desenvolvimento japonês: catch up completo e forging ahead bloqueado|The Japanese catch up between 1868 and 1974 holds important lessons for underdeveloped countries. This paper evaluates the Japanese experience including strategic and geopolitical considerations. Successful industrial policies implemented might have been shaped under the influence of those strategic considerations. The industrial policies described by Ohkawa and Kohama (1989) are integrated with the military mobilization of the 1930s and 1940s and with the Occupation policies (1945-1952). The institutional result is a new variety of capitalism that will feed the high growth era (1955-1974). Therefore a new challenge arises: how implement a catch up process in peace and democracy?
N45|Size and dynastic decline: The principal-agent problem in late imperial China, 1700–1850|This paper argues that China's size was one reason behind its relative decline in the nineteenth century. A ruler governing a large country faces severe agency problems. Given his monitoring difficulties, his agents have strong incentives to extort the taxpayers. This forces him to keep taxes low to prevent revolts. Economic expansion could aggravate corruption and cause further fiscal weakening. To support the model's predictions, I show that the Chinese state taxed and administered sparingly, especially in regions far from Beijing. Furthermore, its fiscal capacity contracted steadily during the prosperous eighteenth century, sowing the seeds for the nineteenth-century crises.
N45|The political economy of Byzantium: transaction costs and the decentralisation of the Byzantine Empire in the twelfth century|This thesis aims to contribute to an explanation of how the development of political institutions is influenced by the costs of information and exchange across society in a pre-modern context. The Byzantine Empire in the twelfth century presents an apparent paradox of an expanding economy alongside a weakening central state. Application of a dynamic transaction-cost framework can illustrate how political and economic decentralisation can rationally occur as non-state actors begin to gain a comparative transaction-cost advantage over the state. Geopolitical and economic developments of the late-eleventh and twelfth century empowered non-state provincial interests in the Byzantine Empire to the detriment of the central state apparatus, including the imperial bureaucracy. Economic growth, an increasingly fluid provincial political environment, and the decline of the imperial navy simultaneously raised the transaction costs of the state and lowered the transaction costs of local interests. This shift prompted the decentralisation of power that ultimately contributed to the destruction of the Byzantine state in 1204. The state faced increasing relative costs of information acquisition, security provision, and tax collection as provincial transaction costs declined and state networks were allowed to degrade. Decentralisation of political and economic power became first possible, then practical, and finally unavoidable in a process that fatally undermined the cohesion of the empire. This thesis uses a transaction cost framework to provide an economically informed explanation of political decline that complements the traditional politically focused narrative and begins to address the contradiction apparent in a state ruling over increasingly prosperous territory, yet proving so fragile by the closing years of the twelfth century.
N45|Paying the price for spiritual enlightenment: tax pressure and living standards in Kofun and Asuka-Nara, Japan (c.300-794 AD)|"""Did the twin processes of political centralization and urbanization in ancient economies affect the wellbeing of commoners? We propose a cost-benefit analysis based on institutional and quantitative information on public revenues (poll tax, land tax, and corvée labour) and expenditures during the Kofun period (ca 300-538) and the Asuka-Nara period (538-794). Our findings indicate that the tax pressure increased sharply during the Asuka-Nara period, which corresponds to the introduction a new Chinese-style political system based on economic and religious institutions legitimized by Buddhism. It appears nevertheless that the new social order was well accepted. The willingness to accept a higher tax pressure could be explained by the role played by Buddhism as pacification device reducing the exposure of commoners to warfare-related risks, while improving social stability, property rights, and contract enforcement. In the meantime, the introduction of the new Chinese-style institutional framework resulted in a decline in the nutritional status of the rural population in the core Kinai region and in surrounding provinces."""
N45|Unified China And Divided Europe|This article studies the causes and consequences of political centralization and fragmentation in China and Europe. We argue that a severe and unidirectional threat of external invasion fostered centralization in China, whereas Europe faced a wider variety of smaller external threats and remained fragmented. Political centralization in China led to lower taxation and hence faster population growth during peacetime compared to Europe. But it also meant that China was more vulnerable to occasional negative population shocks. Our results are consistent with historical evidence of warfare, capital city location, tax levels, and population growth in both China and Europe.

N45|Making Do with What You Have: Conflict, Firm Performance and Input Misallocation in Palestine|This paper investigates the effect of conflict on firms' output value and input misallocation in the context of Palestine during the Second Intifada. Using a unique establishment-level dataset, we compare firms' outcomes and input usage over time across districts experiencing differential changes in conflict intensity. We show how conflict diminishes the total and per-worker value of firms' output through the distortions it generates in firms' access to input markets. In particular, lack of access to the market for imported material inputs leads firms to adjust input usage accordingly, substituting domestically produced materials for imported ones. We also empirically identify the relative amount of conflict-induced input distortions. Furthermore, we find that conflict affects dis-proportionally more those sectors which were more intensive in imported materials and had higher average output value in pre-conflict years. Conflict is thus shown to be particularly harmful for the most productive sectors of the economy.
N45|Colonial legacy, linguistic disenfranchisement and the civil conflict in Sri Lanka|Polarization measures, that are used in examining the empirical relationship between ethnic divisions and violent conflict, heavily rely on mechanisms of group identification and often use somewhat arbitrary divisions of a society into ethnic groups. In this paper we construct two new measures of polarization, one that accounts for differences in linguistic policies across localities during the colonial era and one that accounts for the differences over time and across localities in the experience of violence throughout the conflict episode. By examining the protracted war in Sri Lanka and applying these indices (and their combination) to a data set describing victims of the civil conflict by district and year, we are able to better identify the effect of ethnolinguistic polarization on the civil conflict in the country. We find that, for each of our polarization indices, there is a positive effect on the conflict. The historical underpinnings of our indices allow us to demonstrate in a quantitative and concrete way the relevance of historical processes for understanding episodes of civil conflict.

Doing so will highlight the contradictory U.S. attitude that contributed to the crisis and weakened its ability to control Chiang. Section 3 focuses on Chiang Kai-shek's strategic vision toward East Asia. In particular, this section focuses on his strategic thinking and tries to assess whether or not he was a ""reckless"" or ""irrational"" leader as often described in the previous research on his personality."
N45|Impact of terrorism on FDI flows to Pakistan|This study explores the adverse impacts of terrorism on the net Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows to Pakistan. Since 2003, terrorist violence has killed over 52,000 individuals in Pakistan. The unrelenting violence has substantially increased investment and security risks. This study uses time series econometrics to develop theoretically and empirically sound estimates for the impact of terrorism on FDI flows. This study has found that an increase in terrorist violence reduces FDI. Furthermore, the disaggregated analysis by individual sectors explores the nuances in considerations for FDI, where some sectors are affected while others remain immune to terrorism-related risks.
N45|Unified China; Divided Europe|This paper studies the causes and consequences of political centralization and fragmentation in China and Europe. We argue that the severe and unidirectional threat of external invasion fostered political centralization in China while Europe faced a wider variety of smaller external threats and remained politically fragmented. We test our hypothesis using data on the frequency of nomadic attacks and the number of regimes in China. Our model allows us to explore the economic consequences of political centralization and fragmentation. Political centralization in China led to lower taxation and hence faster population growth during peacetime than in Europe. But it also meant that China was relatively fragile in the event of an external invasion. Our results are consistent with historical evidence of warfare, capital city location, tax levels, and population growth in both China and Europe.
N45|Economic and Political Transitions from Premodern to Modern States in the Meiji Restoration and Xinhai Revolution: A Strategic Approach|Economists often identify a reduction in the share of agricultural employment as a quantitative indication of the economic growth of nations. But this process did not occur in earnest in the People’s Republic of China until the 1980s and to some extent in Japan until well into the mid-20th century. Were extractive political regimes, commonly regarded as the primary drivers of economic performance, solely responsible for the lateness of these developments? This paper deals with this question from a strategic perspective by examining the interactions between the polity and the economy in both countries. It begins by characterizing the complementary nature of the peasant-based economy and the agrarian-tax state in premodern China and Japan. It then describes how endogenous strategic forces evolved from among the intermediate organizations in each country to challenge the incumbent dynastic ruler in response to the commercialization of the peasant-based economy on one hand and the fiscal and military weakening of the agrarian-tax state on the other. The paper then introduces a three-person game model between a ruler and two challenging organizations, and derives conditions for multiple equilbria and their comparative static. The analytical results help to identify the endogenous strategic forces that led the Meiji Restoration and the Xinhai Revolution to move from a premodern state of play to nation-state building and modern economic regimes in each country.
N45|Natural Disasters, Ethnic Diversity, and the Size of Nations: Two Thousand Years of Unification and Division in Historical China|The size of nations matters, but the literature on the subject is long on theory and short on direct econometric testing. Using a unique time series data set spanning the past two millennia, we study the process of unification and division in historical China. The empirical results are consistent with the theory on the size and number of nations. First, frequent famines reduced the number of nations in China because a larger nation could more efficiently ensure the provision of public goods as the cost of such public goods (e.g., disaster relief) rose. Second,increased ethnic diversity was associated with an increased number of nations because smaller nations could better serve a heterogeneous population. Using both annual and decadal data, these results survive a variety of robustness checks after controlling for nomadic attacks and a rich set of climate variables.
N45|Taxation under Autocracy: Theory and Evidence from Late Imperial China|We model a game to show that the taxation level in an autocracy reflects the state¡¯s coercive power relative to people¡¯s capacity for violence. The model also specifies the mechanisms through which various factors affect relative state power. The model predicts that taxation level increases with state coercion level, efficiency of coercion technology, cost of rebelling, and likely labor incomes. Data from late imperial China are used to test the hypotheses, and the findings are entirely consistent with the predictions of the theory.
N45|Immigrant Skill Selection and Utilization: A Comparative Analysis of Australia, Canada, and the United States|We compare literacy test scores and relative wage and employment outcomes of Australian, Canadian and U.S. immigrants using the 2003/2006 Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey (ALLS). We find substantially higher immigrant skill levels at the lower end of the distribution in Australia, especially among recent arrivals, but little difference across countries at the top. In addition, we identify substantially larger wage returns to immigrant skill in the U.S., which we argue reflects language-skill complementarities, as opposed to more efficient skill utilization or unobserved productivity characteristics. Our results suggest that the benefit of a point system for the U.S. lies in its potential to limit unskilled immigration flows, rather than in raising skills at the top end of the distribution where the economic growth potential of immigration is likely greatest.
N45|Superpower, China?:Historicizing Beijing's New Narratives of Leadership and East Asia's Response Thereto|This book sets out to answer how China's rise can best be understood from both East Asian and Western perspectives. It also assesses the prospect of realignment away from the US hegemony in East Asia in light of persistent regional rivalries. Throughout the book, the authors show that for China's neighbours, as well as for its own intellectuals, historicizing the country's rise provides one way of understanding its current ascendant trajectory, on the one hand, and acute social problems, on the other.To which historical precedent should one turn? Did Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo get it right when he recently likened the contemporary Sino-Japanese relationship to that of Germany and Britain on the eve of World War I? Is Harvard Law School's Noah Feldman correct in his assertion that China and the United States are on the verge not of a Cold War but of a ¡°Cool War,¡± in which a ¡°classic struggle for power is unfolding at the same time as economic cooperation is becoming deeper? The authors examine these questions and also focus on other observations that becloud China's rise.
N45|Assessment of German-Pakistani relations in trade, investment and strategic cooperation|German-Pakistani relations cannot be analyzed in isolation of the larger domestic and international trajectories, economic and political, on both sides of the partnership. After a recent democratic power transfer in 2013, Pakistan continues to face complex challenges. The instable security situation in the region exerts pressure on the Pakistani state, multiplying domestic challenges like macroeconomic and trade instability, societal conflicts and crises in energy supply and infrastructure. In light of these aspects, this paper explores the magnitude and development of German-Pakistani relations, focusing especially on trade, economic cooperation and strategic interests on both sides. The analysis of the German-Pakistani trade and investment relations over the last decade show only very moderate volumes with room for expansion. These dynamics are mirrored in private trade business relations with German SME's active on the Pakistani market (mostly through agents) and a lack of internationalization and economic diversification among Pakistan's private businesses. A related structural reason for these predicaments is the lack of a dedicated and clearly-defined policy infrastructure among both states, resembling the long-standing and amicable, though unenthusiastic German-Pakistani relationship. The recent EU-Waiver assignment, the adoption of the EU's GSP+ and related trade diversification programs signify the most significant parts of the EU-Pakistani partnership, and mirror an integral part of the discourse in German-Pakistani relations. Pakistan should attempt to reap the benefits of these developments. Strategic relationships between Germany and Pakistan need to be developed further and strengthened. The content of a recent bilateral signing of a multifaceted roadmap for strategic dialogue among Germany and Pakistan has to be implemented effectively.
N45|Zwiazki ekonomii i etyki w pogladach Mohandasa Gandhiego/Relations of Economics and Ethics in the Thought of Mohandas Gandhi|The aim of the article is to present the economic thought of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi with respect to ethical aspects. There are lots of statements and remarks about the relations of ethics and economics in Gandhi’s writings. In his opinion, both areas should be treated as integrated. That is why it is worth analysing Gandhi’s views on various economic matters. Only a selected presentation was possible because it was difficult to find cohesion in his socio-economic system. One of the hypothesis underlined is that it is even risky to write about Gandhi’s united system. Generally his economic thought was not a part of economics as a discipline. Nevertheless it is not a reason to relinquish studies of it. Because of the fact that many remarks linked with micro- and macroeconomics are of considerable value, they can be used to research economic changes in India in 20th century or to study the attitude of Indian society towards those changes. The main source of the paper was the autobiography ‘The Story of My Experiments with Truth’ published in 1925. More of Gandhi’s economic thought can also be found in the work ‘Hind Swaraj’ from 1909 and in the lecture ‘Does Economic Progress Clash with Real Progress?’ from 1916.
N45|Financing Japan's World War II Occupation of Southeast Asia|This paper analyzes how Japan financed its World War II occupation of Southeast Asia, the transfer of resources to Japan, and the monetary and inflation consequences of Japanese policies. In Malaya, Burma, Indonesia and the Philippines, the issue of military scrip to pay for resources and occupying armies greatly increased money supply. Despite high inflation, hyperinflation hardly occurred because of a sustained transactions demand for money, because of Japan's strong enforcement of monetary monopoly, and because of declining Japanese military capability to ship resources home. In Thailand and Indochina, occupation costs and bilateral clearing arrangements created near open-ended Japanese purchasing power and allowed the transfer to Japan of as much as a third of Indochina's annual GDP. Although the Thai and Indochinese governments financed Japanese demands mainly by printing large quantities of money, inflation rose only in line with monetary expansion due to money's continued use as a store of value in rice-surplus areas.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

Dle některých odborníků je hlavním zdrojem konfliktů zasahování velmocí do blízkovýchodní politiky. Analýza vlivů v novodobé historii Blízkého východu je předmětem této studie, se zaměřením na Sýrii, která působila od svého vzniku v r. 1944 jako významný ovlivňovatel blízkovýchodní politiky, avšak v posledních dvou letech se ocitla spíše v průsečíku těchto vlivů. Tato studie si klade za cíl prozkoumat působení Sýrie jako jednoho z hlavních aktérů blízkovýchodní politiky, jejího zasahování do politik a vývoje okolních států, zejména Libanonu, a to z pohledu mladé teorie mezinárodních vztahů – neorealismu.

Po rozhodnutiach urobených v Paríži a v San Reme sa stalo súčasťou palestínskeho mandátu a tvorilo pozemné spojenie medzi Britmi ovládanou Palestínou a Irakom. Začiatkom roku 1921 sa v Londýne rozhodli, že zväčša púštne územie na východ od rieky Jordán bude – ako gesto plnenia vojnových sľubov Arabom – vyňaté z oblasti židovského osídľovania a že emir cAbdallāh, syn kráľa Husajna z al-Hidžāzu, bude postavený na čelo Britmi ovládanej zajordánskej správy.

N45|Religious identity and the provision of public goods: Evidence from the Indian Princely States|This paper describes a simple model of how a ruler’s religious identity affects public goods provision. Our primary insight is that rulers reduce public goods expenditures to a greater degree when there are privately-provided substitutes excludable by religion.The basic idea is that if the good is provided privately to the ruler’s co-religionists, the ruler faces weaker incentives to provide this public good because his co-religionists receive lower marginal utility from its provision. Testing such a conjecture is an empirical challenge, however, since the religious identity of rulers rarely varies over time and place. We address this problem by exploiting variation in the religion of rulers in the Indian Princely States. Using data from the 1911 and 1931 Indian censuses, we find that Muslim-ruled states had lower Hindu literacy but had no significant impact on Muslim literacy. This result is consistent with our model, as Muslim religious schools provided a substitute for public schools that served both Hindus and Muslims. The model is further substantiated by the fact that the religion of the ruler had no statistically significant impact on railroad ownership or post office provision, neither of which had privately-provided substitutes.

Since the 1980s the most prevalent ideology has changed from condemning commerce and profit as anti-social, to tolerating—even applauding—commercial success. The paper reports on a content analysis of the most popular Hindi film each year since 1955, and finds that characters of rich merchants have changed from being portrayed as villains to being portrayed as heroes.
N45|Regulation, trust, and cronyism in Middle Eastern societies: The simple economics of “wasta”|Despite being a fixture of everyday life in the Arab world, wasta, which may be thought of as special influence by members of the same group or tribe, has received little attention from social scientists. Our casual empiricism suggests that wasta is an important determinant of how economic activities are organized and resources are allocated in Middle Eastern societies, yet economists, even those who specialize in work related to the Middle East, have not addressed the issue of wasta. With this paper we provide a modest beginning to filling that void. Specifically, we use the history of wasta, Hayek's concept of extended order and Coase's work on the nature of the firm to draw inferences regarding the existence of wasta and its persistence in Arab societies.
N45|Atomic bombs and the long-run effect on trust: Experiences in Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan are the only cities in the world that have experienced an atomic bomb attack. This paper explores how this devastating experience affected victims’ tendency to trust others. Individual-level data were used to examine the long-term influence of experiencing an atomic bomb on individuals’ trust. After controlling for individual characteristics, I obtained the following key findings. Individuals who experienced the attack were more likely to trust others. Furthermore, estimation based on a subsample revealed that victims of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb were more likely to trust others than those born in other areas of Japan before World War II. This implies that experiencing an historically traumatic event in 1945 strongly influenced individuals’ trust in others even at the beginning of the 21st century. It follows from this that the effect of this devastating experience was enduring and had a long-term influence on individuals’ values.
N45|China’s Economic Diplomacy and Sino-EU Relations|Economic cooperation and trade relations are the cornerstones in EU-China relations. For several decades, their cooperation in economy and trade developed much more rapidly than their political relations. Dialogue at different levels covering a broad range of issues help institutionalize bilateral ties, regularize bilateral exchange and strengthen communication and mutual understanding. The EU stays as China’s largest trading partner and China the EU’s second largest trading partner. Economic diplomacy serves as an important part in Sino-EU relations. Yet, in recent years, along with China’s rise and the euro crisis, there are new challenges to bilateral economic and trade relations. China’s economic diplomacy needs to be revised in order to deal with the changes and meet the challenges. This paper will be composed of the following parts: after a review of EU-China relations, it will define China’s economic diplomacy and its features and analyse four cases of China’s economic diplomacy in its relations with the EU. In the conclusion, it will examine the challenges for the partnership.

N45|Research review : searching for a new framework for Thailand's foreign policy in the post-cold war era|Thai foreign policy in the 1990s has been said to be contingent on the government in power, which changes between (or within) these groups and vacillates between pro-democratic reformists/principle-pursuers and the conservatives/profit-seekers. In these studies, Thailand’s Indochinese policy has often been referred to as a typical consequence of politics between the pragmatists and the reformists. However, whether or not domestic oppositional politics is the key determinant of foreign policy in the post-Cold War era still requires further examination, precisely because the model is now facing serious challenges between theory and reality. In this paper, I review the existing arguments concerning Thailand’s foreign policy in the post-Cold War Era and point out their limitations and questions for future study.
N45|Distributive consideration in institutional change: the case of Zia’s Islamization policy in Pakistan|Institutional change is an interactive process that results from the social interactions of economic actors. Several perspectives like ideology, efficiency, or distribution etc. are relevant in studying institutional change. In this paper, the distributive consideration is analyzed and an argument is made in favor of this approach by providing evidence from Pakistan’s Islamization policy. Our analysis shows that Zia’s Islamization program was motivated by his search for legitimacy, and his rent-seeking interests. Domestic legitimacy was achieved through the introduction of Islamic clauses in the constitution as it was a popular demand in a state which was already established through a religious rhetoric. The Islamization program also helped in attaining international legitimacy as the religious circles informally initiated Jihad against Soviet Union in Afghanistan. The Islamization policy and Jihad, in turn, resulted in windfall gains in the form of US economic and military assistance that led to a voracious rent-seeking in the Pakistani society. After the detailed descriptive analysis, we model this situation in two-stage rent-seeking activities. We show how the rent-seeking contest among various interest groups results in institutional change as an equilibrium outcome. Our results indicate that Pakistan’s Islamization program is associated with the parameter shifts in our model. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013
N45|The economic value of military connections in Turkey|Can financial connections to the military provide economic value in democratic environments? We address this question by studying whether firms in which the Turkish military had a controlling financial interest earned abnormally high stock returns on the Istanbul stock exchange. Our findings from event studies are that this is indeed the case. We infer that militaries can retain substantial power to influence economic policy from behind the scenes even after formally transferring it to democratically elected leaders. The paper contributes to the literature in public choice by demonstrating econometrically that the military can be a major rent seeking actor even in democratic environments.

N45|The South Manchuria Railway Company and its Interactions with the Military: An Accounting and Financial History|This study examines aspects of the accounting and financial history of the South Manchuria Railway Company (SMR) from its formation in 1906. In particular we focus on the 1930s, a period in which the activities of the SMR became increasingly dominated by the demands of the Kwantung Army which effectively controlled Manchuria. As a special company, the SMR had always faced the dilemma of pursuing the private interest of shareholders as a business enterprise against the backdrop of the requirement to serve the national interest. Following the formation of the State of Manchuria in 1932, the Kwantung Army placed significant and growing financial demands on the SMR while at the same time wishing to alter the juridical personality of the company. Such demands were repelled by the SMR's management for fear that the change in its legal status would cause problems in obtaining the finance necessary to carry out the army's requirements for new lines and improvements to the existing railway network in Manchuria. This problem, and its eventual resolution through the State of Manchuria taking an equity stake in the company in 1940, provides important insights into the impact of military power and wartime conditions on the operation of special companies. In this way, this study contributes to filling a gap in Japanese accounting and financial history research by examining the motives, commitments and (inter)actions of the various parties concerned - the company's management, the Japanese government, the Kwantung Army and the State of Manchuria - and the interaction of such factors with the social, political and economic conditions surrounding the SMR's operations in Manchuria.
N45|Challenges for Japan fs Fiscal Consolidation|This paper describes Japan fs past and current fiscal situations and discusses necessary actions for future fiscal consolidation. Since 1990s, the government expenditure has steadily increased due to growing social security benefits along with aging society, but the level of government revenue has little changed. Despite the increase in government debt, actions for fiscal consolidation have been delayed due to lax monetary condition and lack of continuous commitment with public support. Since political support for fiscal policies are asymmetric between gausterity h and gexpansion f, it is vital for achieving fiscal consolidation to set up legislative fiscal rules with concrete targets and tractable measures, in addition to basic Public Finance Law.
N45|Modest, Secure, and Informed: Successful Development in Conflict Zones|"Most interpretations of prevalent counterinsurgency theory imply that increasing government services reduces rebel violence. Empirically, however, development programs and economic activity sometimes increase violence. Using new panel data on development spending in Iraq, we show that violence-reducing effects of development assistance are greater when: (i) projects are small; (ii) troop strength is high; and (iii) professional development expertise is available. These findings are consistent with an information-centric (""hearts and minds"") model, which implies that violence-reduction is greatest when projects are secure, valued by community members, and services derived are conditional on government control of the territory."
N45|"""Unfinished Business"": Ethnic Complementarities and the Political Contagion of Peace and Conflict in Gujarat"|I examine how the historical legacies of inter-ethnic complementarity and competition influence contemporary electoral competition and its effects on patterns of ethnic violence. Using local comparisons within Gujarat, a single Indian state known for its non-violent local traditions yet also for widespread ethnic pogroms in 2002, I provide evidence that while towns with close votes in the preceding state elections do predict an increased incidence of ethnic riots, these effects are diminished in medieval port towns that historically enjoyed exogenous inter-ethnic complementarities. Furthermore, unlike other towns where pre-riot electoral competitiveness coincided with historic inter-ethnic competition and where the ruling party reaped well-targeted electoral dividends from the riots, medieval port constituencies exhibited a relative vote swing of more than seven percentage points against that party. These rendered medieval port constituencies marginal constituencies in future elections, which also saw less ethnic violence. I interpret these results as consistent with the existence of a fundamentally conditional, yet magnifying interaction between electoral competition and local institutions in generating incentives for ethnic violence. Where marginal electoral constituencies coincide with or reflect pre-existing inter-ethnic economic competition, politicians have both enhanced local and state-wide incentives to foster ethnic mobilization and violence. On the other hand, when the focus of electoral competition shifts to constituencies enjoying complementary norms and organizations supporting local inter-ethnic tolerance, this can reduce state-wide incentives for ethnic violence.
N45|Developing Economies with Industrial Policy: Towards a Toolbox for Economic Growth. With Case Studies of Jordan and Egypt|During the past two decades, the “Washington Consensus” has been the dominant recipe for unleashing economic growth in developing countries. In view of the strong criticism mounted against it, it seems to have lost prominence recently. The success of the East Asian newly industrialized economies and recently of China is often seen as an alternative way towards economic development. However, most instruments stipulated in the Washington Consensus can be reconciled with successful measures employed by industrialized or fastly industrializing Asian economies. Most likely, the stability and market orientation of the Washington Consensus as a recommendation for developing countries is not wrong in itself but rather incomplete. In order to give developing countries a perspective for durable and preferably inclusive growth, it must be complemented by a modern and market-oriented industrial policy aimed at upgrading the economy's competitiveness. Such a “newer” industrial policy offers a host of instruments that can enhance economic growth in a generally favorable macroeconomic framework that can be achieved through the Washington Consensus. This article undertakes to integrate industrial policy in a comprehensive toolbox for economic growth and takes Jordan and Egypt as examples for how industrial policy measures are employed in practice.
N45|Understanding the South China Sea: An explorative cultural analysis|"The South China Sea has attracted considerable attention among politicians, journalists and scholars since it has become a contested maritime space. Most works concentrate on conflicts and negotiations to resolve the ensuing issues. In this paper, a cultural theory will be applied to stress the importance of conceptions of space found in different cultures. The South China Sea is defined as ""Mediterranean."" By comparing it to other maritime spaces, like the Baltic and the Mediterranean Sea, lessons will be drawn from the ""longue durée"" of history, as analysed by French historian Fernand Braudel and from concepts of the cultural theory of Oswald Spengler. The paper will look at the South China Sea from two perspectives. The political perspective will discuss various events that have happened due to political tensions because of territorial demarcations, fishing rights and access to natural resources. Comparing three ""Mediterranean seas,"" I shall argue that Mediterranean seas share certain properties that give rise to tensions and even armed conflict, but also solutions to its problems. The second perspective uses macro-sociology and cultural anthropology to classify and understand actions of the general population as well as political leaders when they ascertain property rights to Mediterranean seas."
N45|A Model of Institutional Complementarities in Ancient China|Abstract In ancient China, the county system and feudalism were the possible government organizational forms. Government officials might be selected through recommendations and examinations. The centralization of authority in the hands of emperors was achieved through a group of institutions such as the county system, the Imperial Examination System, and the division of authority among government officials. This paper provides a systematic interpretation of the interrelationship among this group of institutions and studies institutional complementarities in a model. It is shown that an increase in the degree of increasing returns in the military sector will increase the ruler’s incentive to adopt the county system. Institutional complementarities between the adoption of the Imperial Examination System and the division of authority among officials under the county system are established. A decrease in the level of coordination costs of elite increases the ruler’s incentive to choose a higher degree of the division of authority.

N45|Losing wealth or restricting the poison? Changing opium policies in early republican Turkey, 1923-1945|This article examines the shifting opium policies of early republican Turkey and their political consequences. By the turn of the 20th century, the mind-set behind the opium policies had turned towards restriction and selective prohibition, resulting in binding international conventions. The new opium regime framed by these conventions directly affected the young Turkish Republic, one of the foremost opium producing and exporting countries in the world. Due to international political pressure and the economic downturn in the opium market, Turkey radically changed its opium policies in 1933 by enacting a series of laws compatible with international conventions. Although designed as the final solution to the on-going opium problem, execution of this legislation created new tensions. Contrary to the dominant perception among early republican historiographers that the Kemalist state elites functioned as a homogenous entity with few inner conflicts, this article argues that implementation of the opium laws revealed a significant degree of disagreement and controversy among Turkish ruling elites. They were split along policy lines privileging export revenue derived from opium versus adherence to the conventional obligations. While the interwar era witnessed continuous struggles between these two groups and their policy formulations, the outbreak of World War II favoured the economic priorities due to an increased demand for opium to obtain morphine, along with the erosion of the international regulatory basis.
N45|Regulation, Ownership, and Costs: A Historical Perspective from Indian Railways|This paper studies the relationship between operational costs and state ownership in Indian railways between 1874 and 1912. We find the move to state ownership significantly decreased working expenses. The cost declines are not driven by anticipation effects, changes in reporting standards, or long run trends. Rather, the evidence suggests the colonial Government of India reduced operational costs by cutting labor costs. Our surprising results can be explained by the undemocratic colonial nature of the Government of India, a fiscal system heavily reliant on railways for revenues, and a regulatory environment under private ownership that weakened incentives to lower costs.

N45|Myopia or strategic behavior? Indian regimes and the East India Company in late eighteenth century India|The East India Company's conquest of India was facilitated by the behavior of its Indian rivals who not only did not ally against it, but often supported it militarily. Historians have typically attributed this to myopia, the failure to understand the long-term threat represented by the Company. We examine the negotiations leading up to a key conflict, the Third Mysore War, and find that the Company's allies were not myopic. The British parliament had, in 1784, passed Pitt's India Act, which limited the scope for unprovoked military aggression by the Company in India. This had changed the behavior of the Company, making its promises more credible. This enhanced credibility made it possible for the Company to secure as allies Indian regimes that were acting strategically in their self-interest. This is a new explanation for an old puzzle.
N45|The effect of rules shifting supreme court jurisdiction from mandatory to discretionary—An empirical lesson from Taiwan|Theoretical works suggest that granting a supreme court discretion in choosing the cases to be decided on the merits could shift dockets away from traditional case-based adjudication and towards issue-based adjudication. According to this prediction, legislatures can recast supreme courts’ roles in society by modifying jurisdictional rules. This study tests this prediction empirically. Using a newly assembled data set on appeals terminated by the Taiwan Supreme Court for the period 1996–2008, we study the effect of jurisdictional-source procedural reform, a switch from mandatory jurisdiction to discretionary jurisdiction in 2003, on the Taiwan Supreme Court's performance. Our study shows that the 2003 reform failed to transform the function of the Court from correcting error to a greater role in leading the development of legal doctrine as intended by the legislature. Our findings suggest that a supreme court can adjust the way it conducts business according to its own preference and the role it defines for itself, which are influenced both by the background against which it operates and the inertia of its members’ working habits. Our study informs policy-makers that merely amending procedural rules, without more, is unlikely to change the function of a supreme court. Our findings also suggest that statutorily dictated mandatory jurisdiction may not be implemented by a high court faced with caseload pressure.
N45|The political economy of mass printing: Legitimacy and technological change in the Ottoman Empire|New technologies have not always been greeted with full enthusiasm. Although the Ottomans were quick to adopt advancements in military technology, they waited almost three centuries to sanction printing in Ottoman Turkish (in Arabic characters). Printing spread relatively rapidly throughout Europe following the invention of the printing press in 1450 despite resistance by interest groups and temporary restrictions in some countries. We explain differential reaction to technology through a political economy approach centered on the legitimizing relationships between rulers and their agents (e.g., military, religious, or secular authorities). The Ottomans regulated the printing press heavily to prevent the loss it would have caused to the ruler’s net revenue by undermining the legitimacy provided by religious authorities. On the other hand, the legitimizing relationship between European religious and political authorities was undermined over a century prior to the invention of the press. European rulers thus had little reason to stop the spread of printing as public policy, nor could the Church have stopped it had it wanted to. The Ottomans eventually sanctioned printing in Arabic script in the 18th century after alternative sources of legitimacy emerged.
N45|Cartels in the Kautiliya Arthasastra|This paper examines the legal-economic dimension of collusive manipulation of prices from the perspective of the Kautiliya Arthasastra, an ancient Indian treatise on law and statecraft, which is among the oldest sources of information about cartels. It identifies cartels in the treatise, shows that cartels were treated more severely than individuals who manipulated prices, assesses the efficacy of penalties from the perspective of deterrence, and discusses the evolution of relevant laws. The economic analysis presented in the paper throws new light on the controversy surrounding the internal consistency of the Arthasastra. The paper also highlights the need to take note of the moral-legal environment within which pre-modern markets operated before studying them with the help of models developed for modern markets.
N45|Unobserved State Fragility and the Political Transfer Problem|Autocrats experiencing a windfall in unearned income may find it optimal to donate to other countries some of the windfall in order to make the state a less attractive prize to potential insurgents. We put forward a model that makes that prediction, as well as the additional predictions that the recipients of the aid may themselves become more repressive with high levels of aid and experience conflict with medium levels of aid. We call these joint phenomena the political transfer problem, and argue that the largest windfall of the 20th century, the period from 1973-85 during which oil prices were at all-time highs, produced long-run political dynamics consistent with the model. In particular, major oil exporters have been politically repressive, generous with foreign aid when oil prices are high, and free of civil war; in contrast, the recipients of petro aid were relatively repressive (and peaceful) during the period of high oil prices, but subject to civil war when oil prices fell and aid was reduced. Surprisingly, the political transfer problem did not seem to materialize when oil prices again began to creep up in the 21st century; this nonexistence of the problem can be explained by the model against the backdrop of evolving geopolitics and economics.
N45|Sovereignty And The Senkaku/Diaoyu Territorial Dispute|This paper examines the East China Sea territorial and maritime dispute between Japan and China, from the re-emergence of the dispute in the 1990s until the 2010 collision between the Japan Coast Guard and Chinese fishing trawler. In the absence of the use of force, the paper provides an understanding of how both states seek to improve their position in the dispute. Utilising a constructivist understanding of sovereignty, the paper shows how both sides have sought to maintain or improve their position in the dispute’s sovereignty status quo by effecting exercises of sovereignty over the disputed islands and associated waters, and preventing the other state from doing the same. This approach enables the paper to highlight the change in Japan’s dispute policy, from a ‘hands off’ approach which prioritised positive bilateral relations throughout the 1990s, to a more assertive policy from the Koizumi administration onwards. It also demonstrates how China has successfully improved and consolidated its position in the dispute through a policy of preventing Japan’s effective exercise of sovereignty, and provides an alternative explanation of the 2010 collision incident: a successful prosecution of a Chinese citizen in the disputed area would have considerably altered the sovereignty status quo in Japan’s favour, leaving China had no choice but to react strongly to prevent it.
N45|Competition among movie theaters: an empirical investigation of the Toho–Subaru antitrust case|This study assesses the 1951 Toho–Subaru antitrust merger case in the Japanese movie theater market. Using information regarding the location of theaters in the Tokyo metropolitan area, I examined the relationship between the number of attendees and the structure of the local market competition: a regression equation relating to the number of attendees and the local market structure was derived from a model of product differentiation, which incorporated the features of a movie theater market. The results revealed that nearby rival theaters had negative effects on other theaters’ attendance numbers, and these effects did not dissipate even where there was 10 km between each theater. Based on empirical results, it appears that the Tokyo High Court and the competition agency defined the geographic movie theater market as being smaller than it actually was. The results of this study suggest that the application of econometric analysis, combining geographic information, is useful in merger reviews of retail industries, such as movie theaters.

The analysis starts from the long term effects of the legal reforms, particularly the Ottoman Land Code, on the performance of these markets. Such effects are evident in the evolution of bay-wafa, salam and muzaraah contracts, typical of the rural credit markets, that are recorded in the acts of the Public Notary of Haifa during the years 1890-1915. These contracts show an emerging network of interlinked credit markets, managed by the local notables, at the core of the agricultural growth of late Ottoman Palestine.
N45|Dual Landownership as Tax Shelter: How Did the Chinese Solve Ricardo's Problem?|A conventional theme of the literature on customary land tenure is that multiple ownership and complex tenure systems are obstacles to agricultural development. By studying the persistence of dual landownership in preindustrial China, I hypothesize that complex property norms could be the endogenous outcome of collective choice under institutional constraints, thus may not be inefficient per se. Dual ownership acted as a tax shelter for heavily taxed peasants who colluded with lightly taxed gentry to maximize the value of land. I show empirically that as gentry's tax privilege declined after the tax reform, peasants started to consolidate landownership.The dual owner system provided a solution to the land-use- inefficiency problem emphasized by David Ricardo: Under unequal taxation, land would end up owned by those with stronger political influence and preferential tax rates rather than by those best able to use it.
N45|Multilateral Engagement in North Korea's Economic Rehabilitation and Possible Establishment of Trust Funds|This paper explores multilateral engagement in North Korea's economic rehabilitation, with particular focus on the establishment of special Trust Funds. North Korea's economic recovery in the 2000s has been stagnant, the socialist regime seemingly lacking the capacity to resolve food shortages and economic problems. Moreover, due to the recurrence of the nuclear issue and subsequent imposition of tighter sanctions against Pyongyang, not only has the scale of foreign aid for North Korea deceased sharply, but the engagement of international donors in humanitarian assistance has also been greatly reduced. Thus, a feasible institutional instrument for the amelioration of the regional instability caused by North Korea's economic problems and nuclear standoff would be the establishment of a multilateral framework that would involve bilateral donors and international financial institutions. The setting up of special Trust Funds is a possible option for resource mobi-lization for and aid coordination in providing development assistance to North Korea. Given the potential benefits of such a mechanism, creating multi-donor Trust Funds (MDTFs) for North Korea as denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula progresses could help strengthen relations between Pyongyang and the international donor community. Moreover, the joint funding mechanism of the special Trust Fund would help to ease the political burden currently shouldered by South Korea and neighboring countries directly involved in providing development assistance to North Korea. This paper endeavors to articulate the establishment of MDTFs in the early stages of denuclearization, which would facilitate the dismantling (or abandoning) of North Korea's nuclear programs, as well as the construction of an international aid coordination mechanism. It also explores the potential roles that Trust Funds could play in resource mobilization and policy dialogue. The paper also considers areas of support and procedure in the operation of MDTFs for North Korea. By drawing attention to issues around the administrative structure of the MDTF, it proposes that international donors establish the ‘North Korea Development Assistance Group' (NKDAG) as the principal special Trust Fund governing body. The NKDAG could provide a forum for policy dialogue in the coordination of development assistance to North Korea. Effective fund-raisings, and the successful implementation and management of the Trust Funds would serve as an impetus for enhancing the roles the NKDAG would have to play in the coordination of providing development assistance to North Korea and for the country's economic recovery. This, in turn, would help to placate the donor community in respect of the transparency and effectiveness of its funding contributions, which could attract more foreign assistnance to Trust Fund activities.
N45|All Foreign Direct Investment Is Local: Indian Provincial Politics and the Attraction of FDI|This study focuses on the differences between Indian states in terms of banking infrastructure, size of the economic market and most importantly provincial-level political capacity that creates the pull of foreign direct investment (FDI). While the majority of the extant empirical literature examines national-level data, few studies analyze international capital formation at the provincial level and the dynamics of sub-national political capacityâ€”that is, where allocations are made and policies are implemented. This study corrects for this deficiency. Using data at the provincial level in India over the period 2000â€“2005, we find an inverted-U-shaped relationship between provincial capacity and FDI, suggesting the presence of a critical point at which additional extractive capabilities have negative implications for foreign capital accumulation. The results suggest a number of important policy implications, allowing researchers to identify specific regions in which capacity is likely to facilitate investment, while also providing a politicalâ€“economic model to better-forecast changes in investment at the sub-national level in India.JEL: R50, R12, P16, O16, N45, H70, H81, H11

For a quantitative analysis of how these courts resolved disputes, we use data from the court records (sicils) of the Ottoman town of Kastamonu and examine whether the judges’ decision followed systematic patterns and whether the patterns were logical. The results show that the trial outcome was influenced by the gender, elite status, religion, and religious markers of litigants. Using the tools and concepts of modern scholarship on dispute resolution, we argue that in resolving disputes Kastamonu courts displayed logical patterns that are consistent with those identified by quantitative analysis of court outcomes in modern societies.

N45|China’s Foreign Trade: Perspectives From the Past 150 Years|This paper studies the trade of China in the past 150 years, starting from the first opening of China after the Opium War. The main purpose of the paper is to identify what is (and was) China's 'normal' level of foreign trade, and how these levels changed under different trade regimes, from 1840 to the present. We present new evidence on China's foreign trade during the treaty port era (1842-1948), drawn from disaggregated trade data collected by the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, that yields important findings for current research. First, although the volume of foreign trade remained limited initially, there was a notable expansion in the diversity of products, with many new goods being imported into China. Second, the regional diffusion of foreign goods through China was greatly facilitated by the expansions of the port system. Third, the importance of Hong Kong as an intermediary in China's trade has undergone long-term fluctuations suggestive of learning effects. China's recent wave of liberalization has led by the early 1990s to a trade level comparable to the high of the 1920s. While much of China's recent growth in world trade is in line with her income growth, there is no doubt that China's trade openness today, comparable by some measures to Denmark's, is a stunning reversal relative to the pre-1978 and also the pre-1840 period.

N45|The Evolution of Grain Policy Beyond Europe: Ottoman Grain Administration in the Late Eighteenth Century|During the second half of the eighteenth century, the Ottoman policy-makers adopted a more liberal attitude towards price formation in the Ottoman grain markets. This was accompanied by the fiscal and administrative centralization of the grain trade. These seemingly contradictory policy changes could, in part, be explained in the context of conjectural changes in grain demand and supply, which rendered pre-emptive privileges and price controls less effective. The policy change, however, was not only a practical response to the strains on the pre-existing supply network but also reflected a new concern with the state of agricultural production along with the emergence of emulation as a development strategy.
N45|The Role of the Courts in Economic Development: The Case of Prewar Japan|In this paper, we explore the role of the legal system in economic development, focusing on its relationship to the role of private mechanisms in contract enforcement. We use long-term prefecture-level panel data that cover the early stages of industrialization and urbanization in Japan. We found that industrialization increased the demand for civil lawsuits, but that this was conditional on urbanization. In other words, increased demand for civil suits occurred only where industrialization and urbanization simultaneously progressed. At the same time, the inefficiency of the legal system impeded industrial growth, but only conditional on urbanization. That is, the inefficiency of the legal system impeded industrialization only in urban areas. These findings suggest that community-based contract enforcement mechanisms worked in rural areas and that these mechanisms were replaced by the formal legal system as urbanization progressed and community ties declined.
N45|貿易自由化の政治経済学：戦後日本のケース|This paper investigates the sequence of trade liberalization in postwar Japan and its determinants. As the Japanese government utilized the foreign exchange allocation system as a tool for the industrial policy, especially for protecting domestic industries, in the 1950s, trade liberalization was considered to give a serious impact on those industries, and designing the sequence of trade liberalization was an important policy issue. We indentified the timing of liberalization of each commodity using original official documents, and examined what factors affected on the timing. It was found that in designing the sequence of trade liberalization, the government took into account of competitiveness of domestic industries and survivability of small and medium-sized firms.
N45|Statistical Analysis of Landmine Fatalities in Kurdistan|This study analyzes mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) victim data in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq during the period of the 1960s to 2005. In addition to descriptive analysis of the data, we use regression analysis to identify the determinants of the probability of getting killed by a mine or UXO and to estimate the determinants impacts. The rates of killed and injured victims are explained using a set of socioeconomic variables. Since the data is repeated cross sections in which individuals are observed when they are subjected to accident and in order to account for the dynamic aspect of the process and heterogeneity by location, we create pseudo panel data where districts are observed over the entire study period forming almost a balanced panel data. This allows for analysis of both heterogeneity and dynamics across locations and over time, as well as to control for unobserved location and time effects. The result can be useful in planning, monitoring, and resource allocation for mine action and labor market programmes and rehabilitation activities.

We show how in this period, coinciding with the first era of globalization, of discord within the Spanish Empire and of incipient prosperity in the archipelago, the economic and social foundations were laid for Rizal and his contemporaries to conceive of and demand greater autonomy and, ultimately, independence.
N45|Rizal’s Morga and insights into pre-Hispanic institutions and trade|This essay demonstrates how Rizal’s annotations of Morga’s Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas can be used even today to derive insights useful for investigating pre-Hispanic economic and political institutions. This is done through a close reading of three broad topics treated by Rizal: first, the notion of a “confederation” of chiefs and the complexity of polities; second, the character of precolonial law and enforcement; and third, the engagement of pre-Hispanic polities in international trade. Finally the role of indigenously produced goods in the dynamics of chiefly rulership and foreign trade is discussed. The essay provides an analysis of the potential of pre-Hispanic research and possible directions for future efforts.
N45|La Liga Filipina: Rizal and institutional change|A long-standing tradition in economics contends that “institutions matter “for long-run growth. Whether defined as “rules of the game” or a “system of social factors,” institutions ultimately affect the cost of exchange and production that, in turn, influences economic performance. This paper shows that Rizal, by establishing La Liga Filipina, endeavored to create the conditions toward institutional change. It shows that through the Liga’s aims—(a) to unite the whole archipelago;(b) mutual protection in case of trouble and need; (c) defense against every violence and injustice; (d) development of education, agriculture, and commerce; and (e) study and implementation of reforms—Rizal sought to subvert the most important antidevelopment institutions of his day.
N45|Corruption and the moral imperative, through the lens of Rizal|Rizal wrote at length about corruption in the 19th century, a malaise that ailed the country, and described it in terms of its perpetrators: friars, whose ubiquitous presence made them a fixture in daily life; Spanish secular officials at the top of the colony’s hierarchy; and local officials, Filipinos among them. Beyond rich descriptions of corruption, Rizal’s works and his correspondence with family, friends, and adversaries offer a rich panoply of meaning about colonial life, the nature of power within the Spanish patrimonial order, and Rizal’s understanding of the nation. The paper argues that his crusade against corruption was not simply a rejection of official waywardness but was central to the project of building the Filipino nation.
N45|Indolence, incentives, and institutions|Rizal’s economic ideas are among the least studied aspects of his work. A careful reading of his writing, however, particularly his 1890 essay “On the indolence of the Filipinos,” suggests that Rizal’s economic views were in general agreement with those of Enlightenment thinkers regarding the basis of progress, which was to be found in freedom of commerce and a government that was effective in its inherently limited sphere. The apparent absence of specific recommendations or hints of economic policy did not reflect a lacuna in Rizal’s thought but a proper concern for the prior and more important issues of specifying the minimal institutional foundations of a functioning economy—namely, the maintenance of peace, security of property rights, and facilitating the free movement of people and goods. Rizal went beyond Smithian minimalism, however, since he viewed the Spanish colonization as having not only severely undermined incentives but also destroyed hitherto promising and sound informal institutions that would have supported material progress among the subject Filipinos. As a result, Rizal viewed the reform of formal institutions as a necessary but insufficient condition for promoting the country’s economic progress. This was another important reason for his insistence on the need for mass education.
N45|Reason and responsibility:?reading Rizal’s letter to his Maloleña compatriots using the capabilities approach|Rizal’s letter to the women of Malolos emphasized reason and supported the education of women so that they may be enlightened, religiousness required reason, without reason there was only religiosity. Rizal’s letter argued that women’s value was contingent on their contribution to the Filipino identity, stressing how the character of motherhood reflected the character of motherland. Sen and Nussbaum’s capabilities approach is a broad framework within the liberal tradition followed by Rizal that allows for a better appreciation of Rizal’s messages in the context of modern-day understandings of development. In particular, reason and affiliation are central to the capabilities approach, which regards women (and men) as bearers of intrinsic value, helping identify not only the potential but also the limits of Rizal’s arguments. Current debates pertaining to individual rights and choice, including those on reproductive rights, provide a platform on which the relevance of Rizal’s messages may be tested. It is shown that the capabilities approach enhances Rizal’s messages for human development.
N45|Controlling Corruption in Law Enforcement: Incentives, Safeguards, and Institutional Change in the Ottoman Empire|Until the seventeenth century, the Ottomans used fines extensively for law enforcement and employed agents to collect the fines. Fines can be costly to implement because of agency problems and corruption. To solve the problem of corruption, the Ottomans implemented a variety of mechanisms, including periodic rotation of officials, separation of adjudication from punishment, and compensation for law enforcers through a two-part scheme consisting of fines and taxes. The system underwent a significant transformation after the seventeenth century, following a period of high inflation that raised the agency cost of a fixed fine system. Imperial decentralization in the provinces and the institution of long-term taxfarming also altered the government’s relationship with local law enforcement agents and reduced the effectiveness of control mechanisms. Consequently, the Ottomans relied less on fines for punishment. Using insights from the law and economics literature, we examine how the earlier mechanisms helped to combat corruption in law enforcement and why they were less effective in later periods.
N45|BEYOND IRAQ:The Future of World Order|How does the Iraq War affect the future world order? What kinds of problems has this war brought about, and what is needed to remedy these problems, so as to reconstruct an order in Iraq and beyond? The present volume is a collection of essays exploring these issues, written by leading scholars in their respective fields. Importantly, the Iraq War has caused numerous long-term security and economic problems in Iraq (Chapter 1) and in the Middle East (Chapter 2). In addition, this war represents a failure of the Western liberals' project of establishing a liberal market democracy, and these liberals are likely to repeat the same error elsewhere in the future (Chapter 3). Moreover, the war underlines the crisis in global governance today, but the idea of reforming the United Nations has some serious limitations (Chapter 4). With regard to the issue of terrorism, ¡°Al-Qaeda in Iraq¡± has been operating in the field for some time, and thus Iraq will likely remain an important global center of terrorism in the foreseeable future (Chapter 5).
N45|Political Parties, Party Systems And Democratization In East Asia|Some fledging democracies in the world have encountered setbacks due to political parties trying to grapple with the expectations of sophisticated electorates and introducing gradual political reforms over the years.This book describes how democracy is evolving in East Asia and how it assumes different forms in different countries, with political parties adapting and evolving alongside. It has a two-fold intent. First, it contends that the existing variety of party systems in East Asia will endure and may even flourish, rather than converge as liberal democracies. Second, it highlights the seeming political durability of one party systems â€” unlike two-part or multi-party systems in the US and Europe â€” and their enduring predominance in countries such as Cambodia, China, Singapore and Vietnam.

N45|Is Democratization Compatible with China's One-Party System?|AbstractThe Chinese Communist Party (hereafter the CCP) has been criticized for failing to meet rising expectations for greater democracy. It will thus become obsolete and eventually collapse. This paper argues instead that the CCP has proactively initiated various democratizing measures to improve its governance and enhance its legitimacy. They show a CCP open to democratization. However, the final political product is likely to be different from what it is commonly understood as liberal democracy.
N45|The Vietnamese Communist Party and Renovation (Doi Moi) in Vietnam|AbstractThroughout history, the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) has ardently represented the interests of the people from all strata of the Vietnamese nation. The VCP has a nationwide organizational structure, from the central to grassroots levels, and in various political-social organizations and economic entities. It has led the Vietnamese people from one victory to another including introducing Doi Moi, which literally means change and newness. Doi Moi was launched at the VCP Sixth Congress in 1986 and re-affirmed in the 1992 and 2001 Constitutions. With this change, Vietnam has transformed from an isolated anachronistic communism to an internationally integrated socialism that is increasingly market-oriented. Besides the economy, reforms have also been introduced in the political, legislative, administrative and legal arenas. These changes show that the VCP is attuned to current needs and is determined to remain at the helm of the one-party system in Vietnam.
N45|Cambodia: A Hegemonic Party System in the Making|AbstractAlmost 20 years after the democratic transition first began on 23 October 1991 (when four armed factions and 18 other foreign states finally signed the Paris Peace Agreements), Cambodia's democracy has still not consolidated. The country held its first national elections in May 1993, based on a competitive multi-party system, after which a coalition government was formed and a fairly liberal constitution was adopted. However, the more recent political regime led by Prime Minister Hun Sen of the ruling party (the Cambodian People's Party or CPP) has become more and more authoritarian, thus giving rise to a hegemonic party system. The political opposition has grown weak, unable to compete in the electoral process and win enough votes to form a new government. The CPP has dominated the electoral system. The CPP also has increasingly dominated both the legislature and the judicial/legal system. Institutional checks and balances are virtually non-existent within the system of government.
N45|The People's Action Party and Political Liberalization in Singapore|AbstractIn formal terms, Singapore seems to have all the trappings of modern representative democracy. And yet in practice, politics in Singapore appears to fall short of democratic ideals. In particular, the People's Action Party (PAP) has been in power since 1959, having within legal means secured advantage and dominance over other political parties, resulting in a stable one-party dominant state. To understand the nature of political competition in Singapore, this essay's analysis focuses on electoral resources, system, and strategy, the performance and relevance of the political opposition, and the culture of fear. In particular, the essay argues that several political innovations introduced over the last two or three decades — officially justified in terms that are supportive of democracy — have in reality made it even harder for opposition parties to succeed. These seemingly democratic changes must therefore be understood in terms of how they create and obscure new opportunities and resources for political control, increasing the PAP government's capacity and legitimacy to control more widely and deeply.
N45|The End of One-Party Dominance and Japan's Emergence as a “Common Democracy”|AbstractHow do we account for the LDP's fall from power after 54 years of dominance? This outcome can be viewed from the following perspectives: Maurice Duverger's life cycle theory of the inevitable rise and fall of a dominant party; the long-term structural changes in the international system and Japanese society; the weakening of party and support organizations; the emergence of a more competitive and credible opposition party; and a string of poor LDP leadership and policy blunders which acted as a trigger or catalyst to the LDP's fall from power.
N45|Thai Political Parties in the Age of the Great Divide|AbstractThailand's current political party system is best understood in the context of a protracted political crisis which has seen the struggle for power between those who represent the interests of the royalists, the military and the Bangkok elite, and those who work for the rural poor in remote regions of Thailand. Many analysts tend to cast a negative outlook for the future of Thai political parties, seeing them as marginalized political entities whose existence has only been made possible by the whims of the ruling power of the day. But the rise of Thaksin Shinawatra's Thai Rak Thai Party has set a new precedent in Thai politics as it willingly challenged the power of the traditional elite, and lent its mode of operation and its ideology to a new generation of political parties. The ongoing battle between two political factions has encouraged a new trend in Thai politics; that is, a gradual move toward a two-party system. This trend is increasingly clearer with the birth of the New Politics Party, led by the yellow-clad royalists previously known as the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), and the highly organized red-shirted movement with its pro-poor agenda and the potential to be transformed soon into a legitimate political party.
N45|Last Chapter of an Uneasy Partnership: The Loss of Jusuf Kalla in the 2009 Presidential Election|AbstractThis chapter analyzes the failure of Jusuf Kalla to win the Indonesian presidential election held in July 2009. It highlights the political background and dynamics that placed Kalla and his Golkar Party in a difficult position in the election, while, at the same time, providing Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) and his Democratic Party with a huge political advantage to win the race. Kalla was notably unsuccessful in convincing the voters that the country needed a more decisive and strong leader, in contrast to the SBY leadership style that heavily emphasized image-building rather than actual performance.
N45|Political Parties and Party System in Korea After Democratization: Cartelized Party System and Oscillations Between Two Models|AbstractThe purpose of this paper is to introduce the political parties and party system in Korea and provide a basic analysis for comparative study among the Asian countries. First, I would explain the distinguishing characteristics of the political parties and party system in Korea. I will then show how this system evolved by using the concept of the cartel party and cartelized party system. Finally, the kind of measures that have been introduced to improve democracy and party politics will be discussed. Whether these efforts are working or not will be addressed from the perspectives of the two different party models.The nature of the political system in Korea can be gleaned by examining three main aspects of the cartelized party system, namely, national subsidies, electoral system, and entry barriers against new or minor parties. After an examination of some of the institutions of the cartelized party system in Korea, the Korean party system may be deemed, by and large, to be moving towards a plural competitive system, one that is more accommodating of new or minor parties.
N45|Priorities for Philippine Political Parties: Mass Membership, Political Education, and Party Development Law|AbstractThis paper offers highlights of a 2006 nationwide random scientific survey on the perceptions of Philippine voters toward political parties in the country. That survey was the most comprehensive done on the subject, and the author of this paper helped to formulate and approve the survey questions in the English and Filipino languages. The paper touches on the degree of voter satisfaction, party leaning, party membership, and awareness of the association of prominent politicians with their parties. It also shows how voters perceived party switching, the importance of candidates in relation to their parties, and the degree to which the parties possessed certain favorable characteristics and capabilities. On the basis of the survey, the paper provides insights into priorities for strengthening democracy and the party system.
N45|Taiwan's Democratization and the Freezing of the Party System|AbstractTaiwan, a newly democratized society, has twice experienced peaceful alternation of power: first in 2000, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) assumed power by replacing the long-ruling incumbent party, the Nationalists or Kuomintang (KMT); then in 2008, the KMT regained power by ousting the DPP. Taiwan's party system has undergone changes with elections and democratization, from one-party dominance to multi-party politics, and finally to the two-party dominant system. This paper aims to delineate how Taiwan's party system has been shaped, transformed, and “frozen” into a two-party dominant mode in response to sociopolitical settings and the newly adopted electoral system. I follow Lipset and Rokkan's thesis of the “freezing” party system, with an analysis of Taiwan's electoral survey data, to detect party dealignment-realignment trends and show changes in both parties and the party system with ongoing elections and democratization. I conclude that Taiwan's parties are frozen in a converged deadlock of sociopolitical cleavage around “unification with China versus Taiwan independence,” and therefore becoming a two-party dominant system after the adaptation of a mixed-member majoritarian electoral system.
N45|Two Key Stumbling Blocks for Hong Kong's Democratization: Personal Vote and Beijing's Policies|AbstractHong Kong has a high standard of socioeconomic development with an effective government system and a solid foundation of rule of law. However, the democratization process in Hong Kong remains dull. This paper suggests that there are two key stumbling blocks for Hong Kong's democratization. First, many political parties in Hong Kong have been focusing on providing constituency services in order to build up personal relations with voters, often resulting in votes for the candidate rather than for the party. This phenomenon not only undermines the proper role of the Legislative Council (Legco), but also the process of democratization. Second, Beijing's economic, institutional and cultural policies have offered Hong Kongers great materialistic support, especially during economic downturns. By easing the general discontent among Hong Kongers and creating a stable and harmonious political climate, Beijing plays an important role in diluting the demand for democratization in Hong Kong.
N45|Service Delivery and Corruption in Public Services: How Does History Matter?|This paper provides microlevel evidence of how past institutions impact present economic outcomes. It looks at the impact of colonial land tenure institutions on local governance and education outcomes in northern India. Outcomes are worse in villages that belong to areas with a history of concentration of power with the elites. Such areas continue to retain a greater political presence of socially and economically dominant classes. Future research should examine the success of policies that attempt to break such persistence through empowerment of nonelite groups. (JEL D02, H70, I20, N35, N45, O15, O18)

N45|Happiness and financial satisfaction in Israel: Effects of religiosity, ethnicity, and war|We analyze individual satisfaction with life as a whole and satisfaction with the personal financial situation for Israeli citizens of Jewish and Arab descent. Our data set is the Israeli Social Survey (2006). We are especially interested in the impact of the religions Judaism, Islam and Christianity, where we are able to differentiate between individuals who vary in religiosity between secular and ultra-orthodox. We find a significant effect of religiosity on happiness. With respect to Jewish families it is most striking that the impact of family size on both life and financial satisfaction seems to vary with religiosity. This might be a reason for differentiation in family equivalence scales. For Arab families we did not find this effect. First-generation immigrants are less happy than second-generation immigrants, while there is no significant difference between second-generation families and native families. The effect of the Lebanon war is much less than expected.
N45|The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959-61|This paper investigates the institutional causes of China's Great Famine. It presents two empirical findings: 1) in 1959, when the famine began, food production was almost three times more than population subsistence needs; and 2) regions with higher per capita food production that year suffered higher famine mortality rates, a surprising reversal of a typically negative correlation. A simple model based on historical institutional details shows that these patterns are consistent with the policy outcomes in a centrally planned economy in which the government is unable to easily collect and respond to new information in the presence of an aggregate shock to production.
N45|Liberalization, globalization and the dynamics of democracy in India|In the closing decades of the twentieth century there has been an almost complete intellectual triumph of the twin principles of marketization (understood here as referring to the liberalization of domestic markets and freer international mobility of goods, services, financial capital and perhaps, more arguably, labour) and democratization . A paradigm shift of this extent and magnitude would not have occurred in the absence of some broad consensus among policymakers and (sections of) intellectuals around the globe on the desirability of such a change. There seems to be a two-fold causal nexus between marketization and democracy. The first is more direct, stemming from the fact of both systems sharing certain values and attitudes in common. But there is also a second more indirect chain from marketization to democracy, which is predicated via three sub-chains (i) from marketization to growth, (ii) from growth to overall material development welfare and (iii) from material development to social welfare and democracy. We examine each of these sub-links in detail with a view to obtaining a greater understanding of the hypothesized role of free markets in promoting democracies. In the later part of the paper we examine the socio-economic outcomes governing the quality of democracy in a specifically Indian context.

This paper reviews the US experience in Korea following the Second World War and the Korean War; addresses the political economy of establishing institutions of governance in post-conflict situations; considers the issue of “portability”: the extent to which the South Korean experience may reflect unique and irreproducible conditions; and then applies these ideas by comparing the South Korean experience to the contemporary case of Afghanistan. Some conclusions and policy recommendations are contained in the final section.
N45|New Co-operatives in China: An Indigenous Model of Social Enterprises|This paper aims to fill the academic gaps in the study of the new co-operative movement in China and its innovative mechanisms, and to get a more comprehensive idea of new co-operatives operating as home-grown Chinese social enterprises, by exploring the dynamic process of co-operative practice and social innovation in rural China. As an alternative to the popularly ideal-co-operative perspective, the paper develops a conceptual model from the perspective of a real-type co-operative concept, by employing a historical neo-institutional perspective combined with power-and-resource-related theory. Using this model it shows how institutional legacies from the past as well as resources and environments in the present can influence and shape co-operative development in rural China. By providing a consistent, systematic analysis with an emphasis on the bottom-up institutional innovation process, the paper helps to explain some of the conceptual and practical difficulties that hamper the understanding of new co-operative development in China.

N45|Challenges and Developments in the Financial Systems of the Southeast Asian Economies|This paper discusses the economies and financial systems of Southeast Asia (SEA) and focuses on challenges and developments in the region. Despite the diversity of SEA economies and some important exceptions, most of them are relatively small but growing strongly. Financial deepening differs among SEA economies. Yet in general, equity markets have grown rapidly and bond markets slowly. The main vulnerabilities of the SEA economies stem from volatile capital flows as well as from decreases in export demand. As a result of national and regional policy responses to the Asian Crisis of 1997/98, the soundness of banking systems has improved, and frameworks to deal with foreign currency liquidity problems and to develop bond markets have been established. Due to these efforts, SEA economies have shown considerable resilience during the current global financial and economic crisis. In some economies, macro-prudential measures may have contributed to this resilience. Capital flows during the current crisis have reminded regional authorities of the risks inherent in these flows. Remaining issues for policy makers to consider are the risks presented by the expanding business activities of banks in the capital and real estate markets, and increasing the participation of SMEs and households in the financial system.

N45|Technology transfer with requisitioned material from Germany: The impact of gPB reports h on Japanese postwar technological development|Toward the end of World War 2, British and U.S. governments created a joint program to investigate German technology and requisitioned numerous technical documentations, some of which were opened to public as technical reports. Japanese industries, refereeing them to as the gPB reports h, tried to obtain and utilize them for their postwar recovery until they started enthusiastic technology introduction by technology licensing in 1950 fs. This study describes the dissemination process of PB reports in Japan and evaluates their impact. A few engineers mainly in chemical industry who were belonged to companies, universities and national research institutes recognized the great value of PB reports, and then pressed Japanese government to introduce them with a State budged. Not only the individuals, but also the governmental organs established in the postwar democratization process of science and technology played important roles for policy making of package purchase of PB reports from U.S. government in 1952. In the case of dyestuff and caustic soda, some joint R&D groups were organized in academic circles and industrial associations to share the information from PB reports which contained classified factory data of IG Farben, Bayer and so on. Japanese companies utilized them to domesticate German chemical products and develop their original technologies. On the other hand, the case of electronics parts shows that small companies which could not afford to introduce technology from foreign companies by their own received benefit by the reports and got an opportunity for their development. As a result, a technology gap between Japan and advanced countries which had widened during the war were reduced till the end of 1950 fs.

N45|Neoliberalism as Liberation: The Statehood Program and the Remaking of the Palestinian National Movement|The Palestinian statehood-by-2011 program, framed through neoliberal institution building, redefines and diverts the Palestinian liberation struggle. Focusing on its economic aspects, and in particular the underlying neoliberal thought that goes beyond narrow economic policy applications, this essay argues that the program cannot succeed either as the midwife of independence or as a strategy for Palestinian economic development. Its weaknesses, the authors contend, derive not only from neoliberalism’s inability to deliver sustainable and equitable economic growth worldwide, but also because neoliberal “governance” under occupation, however “good,” cannot substitute for the broader struggle for national rights nor ensure the Palestinian right to development.
N45|The Effects of the 16th Century Price Revolution and the Ottoman-Iran Wars on the Ottoman Silk Industry|In this study we investigated the two basic issues affected the Ottoman silk industry. The first one is the global Price Revolution; the second is the wars between Ottoman and Iran. The silk industry in Bursa which was the most important silk center of Ottoman had been affected negatively from these events. The non-tariff barriers had been created by the Iran wars also weakened the relations borne from the silk trade among these two countries. The diminished trade volume decreased the tax revenues; consequently both countries had been affected unfavorably.
N45|Direct versus Indirect Colonial Rule in India: Long-Term Consequences| This paper compares economic outcomes across areas in India that were under direct British colonial rule with areas that were under indirect colonial rule. Controlling for selective annexation using a specific policy rule, I find that areas that experienced direct rule have significantly lower levels of access to schools, health centers, and roads in the postcolonial period. I find evidence that the quality of governance in the colonial period has a significant and persistent effect on postcolonial outcomes.

N45|Commitment and Conquest: The Case of British Rule in India|Contemporary historians usually attribute the East India Company's military success in India to its military strength. In contrast, we argue that, on its own, military strength was a mixed blessing: it could have led to the formation of coalitions against the Company. This did not happen because the Company's commitments to Indian regimes were more credible than their commitments to each other. In this sense, commitment was the key to conquest.
N45|Tax Preferences for Higher Education and Adult College Enrollment|The federal government delivers substantial college aid through the tax code. The designs of the Lifetime Learning tax credit and the tuition deduction may make them particularly useful to older students. This paper investigates how these provisions affect college attendance of individuals in their 30s and 40s. Using panel data and fixed effects instrumental variable estimation, I find no effect on adult college attendance or degree completion. There is a positive effect on college attendance among a subsample, those whose 1998 educational attainment fell short of earlier expectations. Overall, these results suggest that tax-based aid subsidizes inframarginal college attendance among adults.
