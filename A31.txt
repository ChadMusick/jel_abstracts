A31|The Public Policy process: A conceptual framework for understanding policy processes and opportunities for influencing policy outcomes|The ideal policy model is often presented as a neat linear process starting from problem identification, setting policy objectives, creative alternative options, gathering information on options, applying analysis and implementing policy choices. In real life, it isn’t always this neat and linear. Real world policy making happens in a world of constraints. Many of these “constraints” eventually are the objectives of policy making. This article presents the murky waters of governance and policy formulation processes in real life. It briefly highlights four analytical lenses for looking at the policy process and offers critical insights into influencing policy outcomes having an understanding of the complex constraints and non-linear dynamics that goes into the process.
A31|?We Want the World and We Want It Now?: Jim Morrison as ?Guiding Spirit? of the Youth Counterculture|As he achieved growing recognition and fame as a singer-songwriter and lead vocalist of the rock band The Doors, Jim Morrison came to embody, in the assessment of his bandmate Ray Manzarek, the spirit of ?hippie counterculture rebellion? during the second half of the decade of the 1960s. In part that is because, with his revolutionary spirit and personal views pertaining to radical potentialities, Morrison began to serve as an impressive icon of the generation gap that existed between young people who hoped to change the world and older individuals, including conventional authority figures, who seemed set in their ways. Accordingly, this presentation examines Morrison?s status as a desirable leader of the youth counterculture in the United States during the 1960s. It demonstrates how Morrison?s outspoken views, bohemian lifestyle, rebellious personality, unpredictable performing style, experiences with psychedelic drugs and alcohol, extensive literary knowledge (which ranged from the works of Beat poets and writers to French existentialist philosophers), and intentional attempts to spark riots effectively combined to position him as an appealing 'guiding spirit' and source of solidarity to countless members of the youth counterculture of his day. It further demonstrates the substantial personal toll this cultural status took on Morrison as his career progressed toward the early 1970s, when he endeavored to take his métier in new directions yet found himself trapped in a celebrity persona he no longer wished to call his own, even though it was very much of his own making.

A31|A Manual for Selecting Sampling Techniques in Research|The Manual for Sampling Techniques used in Social Sciences is an effort to describe various types of sampling methodologies that are used in researches of social sciences in an easy and understandable way. Characteristics, benefits, crucial issues/ draw backs, and examples of each sampling type are provided separately. The manual begins by describing What is Sampling and its Purposes then it moves forward discussing the two broader types: probability sampling and non-probability sampling. Later in the text various types of each of the broader category are discussed. Reading the manual from beginning to the end you will find some points are repeated under various headings. This is done to make each topic exclusively a complete whole so that there might not remain any requirement to read other topics for understanding the one. Also, similar examples with a little modification are used in the description of different sampling techniques. The purpose behind doing this is to clarify the minor distinction in the applicability and usage of different types of sampling techniques. I have also included a section Comparison of some Resembling Sampling Techniques, the purpose of which is to eliminate confusions among the techniques that look somewhat similar to each other. Both types of characteristics are described: that make the techniques resembling, and that create the difference between them. In the section Which Sampling Technique to use in your Research, it has been tried to describe what techniques are most suitable for the various sorts of researches. So one may easily decide which particular technique is applicable and most suitable of his or her research project. There are three appendices in the manual which are giving a concise view of all the techniques discussed in the text. Appendix I is giving a comparison of two broader categories of sampling methods: probability, and non probability. Appendix II is portraying a brief summary of various types of probability sampling technique. Appendix III is presenting a brief summary of various types of non-probability sampling technique. A glossary is also provided in the manual. The words that are used as synonyms to one another are mentioned. Moreover, definitions of the terms that are repetitively used throughout the manual are provided. The words defined in the glossary are written with italic letters in the text.
A31|The Efficiency Of Differentiated Learning - Independent Learning Situations Versus Collaborative Learning|Current Romanian education emphasizes pupil group action in learning situations frontal organized, independently or in micro-groups. Thus, differentiated learning suffers, because it requires an individualized learning, and not just individual; there is necessary to alternate the organizing forms of learning situations, so they to produce progress in pupils’ learning. Using the method of the experiment, the undertaken research project has studied the impact of organizing individual learning situations compared to harmonizing the organizing forms of cooperative learning on pupil achievement in primary education. The experiential research sample consisted of 2 teachers and 56 pupils of class II. The control group comprised a class of 27 pupils, who have carried on an individual learning activity. The experiential group comprised 29 pupils who have carried out an activity based on the harmonizing different organizing forms of collaborationlearning. In the final assessment test, the results obtained by pupils confirmed the research hypothesis, demonstrating that in order to efficiently achieve the differentiated learning there is required a combination of organizing forms of learning and a stimulus for pupils’ collaborationwhich to increase their motivation for learning.
A31|Code of Conduct for MNCs in relation to Environment Issues|?Meeting environmental objectives are part of a dynamic and integrated process in which economic, social and environmental objectives are closely intertwined?. This declaration made at the Rio+20 Declaration on Justice, Governance and Law for Environmental Sustainability encapsulates the basis of legal framework governing and regulating Multinational Corporations. Globalisation has benefited MNCs largely and the world has noticed that countries often undervalue their natural resources in order to attract investments from such gigantic corporations. Regulating and controlling MNCs is a complex task since they have become global actors with great economic power and political influence. Therefore, the international community, comprising of global and civil society organizations, expressed concerns about environmental degradation caused by industrial activities and demanded greater awareness with respect to business decisions that might have a prospective impact on the environment. Resultantly, considerable number of international instruments and multilateral agreements providing for environmental protection were adopted. However, what concerns us is the skewed debate on the role such MNCs play in ensuring sustainable development.So, what is the real threat that is posed by MNCs? The authors, through this paper, have highlighted the major affects of operations of MNCs on environment and the role played by governments at national level, in trying to reduce the negative impacts. International law does not provide easy solutions to the social and environmental issues posed by the activities of MNCs, since it is addressed to state parties and therefore, does not impose obligations directly upon such corporations. This trend led to the proliferation of international as well as domestic codes of conduct for MNCs. The authors seek to establish the nexus between MNCs and the environmental issues, highlighting the incidents of Ecuador, India, Bougainville, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea. The sanctity of these codes of conduct for MNCs, in promoting standards of ethical business practices, is marked well through case analysis and changing legal systems of different nations.This paper dwells upon the aspects of state sovereignty, sustainable development; polluter pays principle, precautionary principle, and principle of preventive action, co-operation, and principle of common but differential responsibility. In review of some of the most significant codes of conduct at international level, we have tried to propose a socially desirable standard which the MNCs could unhesitatingly self-apply in their business plans. Lastly, the paper summarizes the role of MNCs in imparting environment friendly technology and ideas in developing states through foreign investment.
A31|Importance of Psychological Effects in Life|"The word psychology derives from Greek roots meaning study of the psyche, or soul (???? psukh?, ""breath, spirit, soul"" and -????? -logia, ""study of"" or ""research""). The Latin word psychologia was first used by the Croatian humanist and LatinistMarko Maruli? in his book, Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae in the late 15th century or early 16th century. The earliest known reference to the word psychology in English was by Steven Blankaart in 1694 in The Physical Dictionary which refers to ""Anatomy, which treats the Body, and Psychology, which treats of the Soul."" In 1890, William James defined psychology as ""the science of mental life, both of its phenomena and their conditions"". This definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades. However, this meaning was contested, notably by radical behaviorists such as John Watson, who in his 1913 manifesto defined the discipline of psychology as the acquisition of information useful to the control of behavior. Also since James defined it, the term more strongly connotes techniques of scientific experimentation. Folk psychology refers to the understanding of ordinary people, as contrasted with that of psychology professionals. Through this paper, we study effects of psychological factors in life."
A31|Effects of Psychological Factors in Life|"Psychologists explore concepts such as perception, cognition, attention, emotion,intelligence, phenomenology, motivation, brain functioning, personality, behavior, and interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind.[5] Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causaland correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or inopposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, some?especiallyclinical and counseling psychologists?at times rely upon symbolic interpretationand other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a ""hub science"", with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy. While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatmentof mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Many do scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior, and typically work in university psychology departments or teach in other academic settings (e.g., medical schools, hospitals). Some are employed in industrial and organizational settings, or in other areas[9] such as human development and aging, sports, health, and the media, as well as in forensic investigation and other aspects of law. We will consider social factors of psychological problems in life through this paper."
A31|Promoting A Learner-Friendly Language Classroom in Nigeria:Challenges and Strategies|In spite of the fact that methods abound to teach English language effectively and even to make the language class more friendly and interesting, the ill- qualified teachers do not employ the right method to make the English lessons learner-friendly. This paper therefore assesses the English language in Nigeria, the common challenges in the language classes, classroom environment for language teaching and learning, and a learner-friendly language class. Specifically, the paper looks at teachers? leadership style in language class, concept of Teaching Knowledge Test (TKT) and strategies for promoting a learner-friendly language class in Nigeria. Finally, the paper x-rays the presentation techniques for promoting a learner-friendly language class with useful recommendations to language teachers.
A31|Impact of Literature (Literary texts) as Instructional Strategy on developing Reading and Writing Skills among Senior Secondary School II ESL Students in Lagos State|This paper presented some research based opinions on the use of literature in language classroom especially for reading and writing skills development. It also sought to determine the impact of literature (literacy texts) as instructional strategy on developing reading and writing skills of students in Senior Secondary School, class II in ESL Classroom. The paper also attempted to establish various arguments in support of literature as authentic materials to be used in language classroom, especially in teaching the language skills of reading and writing. With stratified randomized sampling technique, 60 S.S II Students were selected from a Senior Secondary School, FCE(T), Akoka. The study used Descriptive survey and Quasi Experimental Method. A literary text titled ?A Women in Her Prime? which is among the prescribed text for WAEC (West African Examination Council) was given to the students to read. There are two groups of respondents in this work, i.e the controlled (30) and experimental group (30). The experimental group was given a kind of guide or intervention on how to read and respond to questions in writing form. The students in these two groups were observed and accessed. In reading, students reading interest, speed, comprehension, word recognition and right pronunciation were measured using the scale of insufficient, average reading, good reading and excellent reading. In writing, students were asked to write on topics such as summary of ideas presented in the text, themes and subject matter, character etc. A random picking was done on which of the written essays to be used for analysis. The data gathered were analyzed using a paired sample t-test to compare the significant different between the performance of the controlled group and experimental group. The performance of those who were not exposed to the intervention /literary skills and instructional guide is (X = 19.28; SD = 3.680) while those in experimental group is (X = 35.67; SD = 5.299). This is shown in the calculated value (t-cal) of 13.127 which is greater than the critical value (t-crit) of 1.98 with 99 degree of freedom at 0.05 level of significance. It is recommended that the literature of the targeted language should be used, taking into consideration the objective. Relevant classroom activities and techniques should be considered by teachers. The paper concluded by affirming that the use of literature is an adequate instructional strategy in ESL classroom, hence, should be employed by ESL teachers.
A31|Education, Care and Wellbeing of Children in pre-schools as a Correlate for Empowerment and Change in the Nigerian Society|Learning is closely intertwined with wellbeing. The school environment, as a context of learning, has been found to play an important role in children?s social, emotional and behavioral development (Gutman and Feinstein, 2008). It has been observed by many scholars that ?high-quality early education produces long-lasting benefits? (Schweinhart & Weikart 1997; National Research Council & Institute of Medicine 2000; Peisner- Feinberg et al. 2000; National Research Council 2001; Reynolds et al. 2001; Campbell et al. 2002). With this evidence, the Nigerian federal, state, and local decision makers are asking critical questions about young children?s education. What should children be taught in the early years from birth through age eight? How would we know if they are developing well and learning what we want them to learn? And how can we decide whether programs for children from infancy through the primary grades are doing a good job? Are the school environment and feeding culture addressing children?s wellbeing in school? Answers to these questions about early childhood education curriculum, child assessment, and program evaluation? are the foundation statement of this paper which adopted the descriptive survey design. This paper is therefore interested in investigating the Effect of Early Childhood Care Education and Wellbeing as a Correlate for Empowerment and Change in the Nigerian Society. The study amongst other things recommends that victimization and bullying should not be encouraged in pre- school; schools should be well funded and teachers should be appropriately trained. Equally, schools should provide balanced mid-day meals to children to cater for malnourishment wherever applicable. This study is noteworthy because it advocates spending on children?s education as an economic investment in a society's future.

A31|Trends in curricular issues and teacher education in Nigeria: Retrospect and Prospects|Education in Nigeria in the past was centered on recitation, use of conversation, lecture, and questioning method to teach students new information and concepts. Traditionally, the emphasis on our curricula has been on defined knowledge to be acquired with less attention on the development of skills, conscious articulation of the other remaining areas of learning -behaviours, attitudes and values and finally learning to learn. This paper therefore examines the trends in curricular issues of teacher education programmes in Nigeria. It investigates the nature of teacher education, its impacts, problems, directions as well as prospects for future development of the curricular issues.
A31|Role Of Vocational Training Education In Promoting Women Empowerment Opporunities In Lagos State Nigeria|The present political dispensation in Nigeria requires that women should contribute to decision making in government. According to the Beijing Conference requirement every country that participated in the conference should reserve 30 percent of positions and office to women, but Nigeria, is yet to have 10 percent of women constitute a key resource whose ideas and ability can help bring about political economic and social transformation. This study therefore investigated the role of vocational training programmes in promoting women empowerment opportunities in Lagos State, Nigeria. The study adopted the survey research design with the population of 150 women who were about to graduate from various vocational training centres established by Lagos State Government. The major instrument used to collect data from the respondents was the questionnaire. Three research questions and one hypothesis were formulated to generate answers while chi-square (x2) statistical tool 'was used to test the null hypothesis stated for the study at 0.05 level of significance. The major findings of the study were that vocational training for women has helped in raising their economic status and has also given them the opportunity of contributing financially to their families? needs. It was recommended among others that organizers of training programmes for women should include skill training in planning decision making and management of resources in their programmes.

A31|Ways to Detect Plagiarism in Academic Research|Present environment seems to increase scientific production due to the fact thatquantity is more important than quality. Therefore, researchers, professors and PhD students areobliged to proceed with the dissemination of individual or collective researches in order toquantify the number of published papers in various journals. As result, we are witnessing a boomof scientific papers, sometimes of dubious quality. In fact the excess number of publications led usthink â€¦ How many of these papers are plagiarized and how it can be detected in any researchpaper? When a paper is considered plagiarized? How can we verify the originality of a researchpaper? Who can detect plagiarism? Can plagiarism be prevented? In order to respond to thesequestions we proceeded to a participant observation of specialty research papers registered at thelevel of higher education institutions within two years. At the same time, we analyzed the flow ofinformation available online about the current trend and associated interpretations in mass mediaof plagiarism phenomenon. Thus, we will use regional research methods, especially socialsciences to analyze the paradigm and to allow discussions on a wide range that goes from completerefusal to validate the paradigm. To be able to formulate answers to the stated questions, weprovided a case study on the results of original scientific papers accumulated at an educationalinstitution, taking into account the range and level of education of paper‘s author.
A31|Da MEGA à MEGA2: breve história da edição crítica das obras de Karl Marx|This paper discusses the attempts to publish a historical-critical edition of the works of Karl Marx, the Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe (MEGA): the first one, which was led by David Riazanov in the 1920's and 1930's, and the second one, the MEGA2 project which begun in the 1970's and is still in course of publication. The paper presents these two editions and discusses their impact on the interpretation of Marx's economic and philosophical thought.

A31|Using Collective Adaptive Networks to Solve Education Problems in Poor Countries|Can education problems in poor countries be successfully addressed using knowledge economics? The old development model posits that poor countries must follow the route of richer countries, progressing up a scale of development. But an emerging theory of development and collective adaptive applications applied to new learning theory suggests new possibilities. This paper outlines a pilot project underway in Zambia. The idea is based on a global network, which supports collective adaptive knowledge construction and local learning, representing a substantial deviation from standard foreign aid. Using the small pilot school in Zambia local knowledge is gathered and combined with global knowledge, to generate content that has, heretofore, been unavailable on the Web. This approach is fundamentally different from e-learning, which delivered lectures from afar. It builds a knowledge base that is relevant to poor countries, enabling them to advance their local economy.
A31|Karl Marx: Herakles oder Sisyphos?Eine philosophische und ökonomische Untersuchung|Die Diskussion um Karl Marx ist lange Zeit nur ideologisch positionell geführt worden. Wer sich nicht als Gegner oder Befürworter der Marxschen Lehre erklärte, hatte es schwer, in dieser Diskussion Gehör zu finden. Im letzten Viertel des vorigen Jahrhunderts hat jedoch sowohl in philosophischer als auch wirtschaftswissenschaftlicher Hinsicht eine neue Art der Auseinandersetzung mit den Werken von Karl Marx begonnen. Dabei haben die Kontrahenten sowohl auf marxistischer als auch auf nichtmarxistischer Seite viel ideologischen Ballast beiseite geräumt, und in manchen Positionen hat man sich auch in inhaltlicher Hinsicht angenähert. Trotzdem ist die Diskussion in einem wichtigen Aspekt fragmentarisch geblieben. Auch wenn marxistische und nichtmarxistische Ökonomen nun eine gemeinsame Sprache gefunden haben, so gilt das weit weniger für Philosophen und Ökonomen. Charakteristischerweise zeigt sich das an der Rolle Hegels. Während viele Philosophen dazu neigen, Marx von Hegel her zu verstehen, tendieren Ökonomen und auch der Ökonomik nahestehende Philosophen dazu, Hegel zu vernachlässigen oder ihm allenfalls eine verwirrende oder störende Rolle im Marxschen Denken zuzugestehen. In unserem Essay wollen wir daher herausarbeiten, dass der Bezug zu Hegel und zu der Tradition der Philosophie überhaupt ein konstitutiver Bestandteil der Marxschen Theorie und gerade auch ihres ökonomischen Teils ist. Dabei versuchen wir nichts weniger als eine Gesamteinschätzung der Marxschen Lehre und ihrer oft verwirrenden Vielschichtigkeit zu geben. Im Einzelnen werden wir auf Marx’ Hegelbezug und den historischen Materialismus mit seinen Grundbegriffen, den Produktivkräften und Produktionsverhältnissen eingehen. Von daher werden wir eine Einschätzung von Marx’ Analyse der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise geben und dabei versuchen, ihre qualitativen und quantitativen Aspekte gesondert herauszuarbeiten. Zentrale Aussagen der Marxschen Ökonomik wie die Arbeitswertlehre und das Gesetz vom tendenziellen Fall der Profitrate werden wir im Licht der modernen Wirtschaftswissenschaften diskutieren. Dabei werden auch wichtige Einsichten von Marx hinsichtlich der Umwelt- und Rohstoffprobleme, vor denen wir heute stehen, zur Sprache kommen. Nicht zuletzt gehen wir auf die Konsequenzen ein, die sich aus Marx’ Ansatz für das Problem der Gerechtigkeit und der Einkommensverteilung ergeben. Und schließlich wollen wir erklären, woher bei Marx das notorische Defizit einer politischen Theorie rührt.
A31|How Collective Intelligence Redefines Education|While collective intelligence systems become ubiquitous for learning in knowledge industries, civic life and personal lives, they have yet to be embraced into formal schooling systems. Still, learning, knowledge and assessment protocols still abide, in large part, to the educational systems logic of the industrial era. The temptation is to view schooling as falling behind with teacher retraining and curriculum revision leading the way. This article examines the underlying logic of both collective intelligence and formal education systems and traces education¡¯s reluctance to it roots in an industrial era and the incentives prevailing in its structures. Embracing collective intelligence, then, will require a redefinition of schooling rather than a mere retooling.

Volumes 6 and 7 gather the Nobel Laureate’s final writings. Samuelson declined suggestions that he write an autobiography. Yet the texts in these volumes (selected by Samuelson with the help of his longtime assistant, Janice Murray) have a somewhat autobiographical cast, with tributes to friends and colleagues and speeches and interviews of both personal and historic interest. Volume 6 offers essays on classical economics; neoclassical, Marxian, and Sraffian economics; modern macroeconomics; welfare and efficiency economics; and economic and scientific theories. Volume 7 covers stochastic theory; modern economic policy; biographical essays; and autobiographical writings.

We provide details of the social and technological challenges for its construction as well as the evolution of its governance. The development of NEP provides an illustrative example for the kind of new business models that have emerged as the Internet has been used by creative minds to provide existing services in a new way.
A31|The Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) and the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) Region- The Case for South Africa|EPAs between the EU and ACP countries can be viewed as being anti mercantilist and there has been a lot of speculations about their outcome. The aim of the study is to determine the effects of the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) between the European Union (EU) and the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) members using Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) version 7. Two scenarios are analysed: first when the other SACU member states sign the EPAs with the EU excluding South Africa and secondly when the entire SACU member states including South Africa sign a full EPA with the EU. Results show that South Africa does stand to lose when the other member states sign. However, signing of the EPA of the SACU as a bloc, including South Africa result in welfare gain in the region. Significantly, there is an increased export of livestock and processed foods to the EU from SACU region meaning that the region stands to gain in promoting these industries after an EPA. Besides these two sectors, most of the other sectors tend to lose out. It should be noted that full benefits of trade liberalisation agreements depend on speed of industry reform and therefore can only be realised in the long run.
A31|The Squam Lake Report: Fifteen economists in search of financial reform|The Squam Lake Report is a volume by economists for economists. It offers the fruits of the labors of 15 top economists who met at Squam Lake, New Hampshire, to discuss financial reform. While somewhat disjointed, and avoiding many important issues, the book is nonetheless a tour du force. Its many recommendations derive from two basic principles: that reformers need to think systemically, and that third-party costs stemming from systemic risk need to be internalized. And its approach is just what you would expect from a group of academic economists. It asks (and answers) questions like: Where did incentives go wrong? What were the sources of market failure? How can we better protect society against negative externalities?.

A31|David Riazanov e a Edição das Obras de Marx e Engels|Este artigo apresenta um esboço da biografia de David Riazanov, discutindo sua participação na vida política e intelectual russa e, em especial, seu papel na descoberta e publicação do legado literário de Karl Marx e Friedrich Engels, que culminou na primeira tentativa de editar as obras completas destes autores, a Marx Engels Gesamtausgabe (MEGA).
A31|Editing Jeremy Bentham's Selected Economic Writings: Boundaries and Methodological Issues|This article deals with a French edition of Jeremy Bentham’s Selected Economic Writings. It aims at explaining the editorial choices that will be made, and underlining the difficulties faced by such an edition. Two kinds of difficulties are stressed: on the one hand, the singularity of Bentham’s conception of political economy implies questioning the status of this science in his utilitarianism (section I – Question of boundaries); on the other hand, I raise some more general methodological issues which confront each editor of texts from the past (Section II – Methodological Issues).
A31|Some Preliminaries Options on Clément Juglar’s Economic Writings First Editorial Project|The team which has proposed three years ago a critical revival of Clément Juglar contribution and nowadays the edition of his texts, has been led rather quickly to admit that if there is no doubt that Juglar contributed to modern business cycles theory, his reputation clearly surpassed his effective scientific influence on this specific field. In general, the conception our contemporaries can have about Juglar’s approach is misleading that they consider on the one side that his contribution is one of the major ones for modern business cycles theory, or on the other side, that they focus on the papers dealing with periodicity of crises and then ignoring the greatest part of his work and then having very limited knowledge and comprehension of the nature of his general approach. Understanding Juglar’s approach implies to take into account his training as a physician, the context in which he initiated the use of statistics via his analysis of population growth, his interest for monetary theory, essential for the understanding as well as the identification of the cycles, and finally, the role of his religious faith in his view of the nature of the economic and social movement. Our worry to resituate the fundamental nature of Juglar’s contribution did not prevent us to operate few choices. It is the determinants of those choices about the edition we are working on which are examined and justified in this article.
A31|To Read Walras - From Archives Funds to Edition and Reinterpretation of the Complete Economic Writings of Auguste and Léon Walras|Are surveyed here the confronted problems and the choices accomplished by a team of economists of the University Lyon 2 to accomplish the edition of the complete economic writings of Auguste and Léon Walras. One remind here the theoretical and practical reasons of their decision, their confrontation with scarrered funds of archives, their editorial choices and of characteristics of the critical apparatus. Also are underlined various difficulties that they met with, particularly those linked in search of means over long period, but also possibilities opened for the interpretation of a great work. Finally, wins and disappointments of a heavy editorial enterprise.
A31|Introduction: Editing Economists, what Content and what Form?|Like any other scientific editor, the economist who intends to spread the writings of his predecessors is faced with constant problems, beyond the question of who he will publish: what he should publish and how he should publish it. In the field of our discipline, the difficulties raised by these questions are not radically different from those which occur in other disciplines, including literature. Of course, in many respects dealing with these difficulties implies skills which are not usually the prerogative of the historian of economic thought. Nevertheless it also requires analytical abilities that the latter is in the habit of regarding as being his own. The fact remains that editing is a scholarly practice to which the historian of economic thought usually pays little attention. However, since the primary source materials that continue to be the foundation for research in our academic discipline are here at stake, its institutional recognition and spread depend on such a practice.
A31|Darimon, bancos e crédito: notas sobre os Grundrisse e a transição para o socialismo|Darimon’s book - De la réforme des banques – is the starting point of Grundrisse. This paper presents its structure and discusses how Marx’s critiques are part of his elaboration on the role of credit in capitalism and in the transition towards socialism. Marx’s trajectory from Grundrisse to Das Kapital is summarized: initially there is the critique to Darimon, finally there is a strong but very open statement: credit is a “powerful lever” in the transition towards socialism. This statement is a key topic of a research agenda on the transition to socialism.
A31|By Force of Thought: Irregular Memoirs of an Intellectual Journey|Janos Kornai, a distinguished Hungarian economist, began his adult life as an ardent believer in socialism and then became a critic of the communist political and economic system. He lost family members in the Holocaust, contributed to the ideological preparation for the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, and became an influential theorist of the post-Soviet economic transition. He has been a journalist, a researcher prohibited from teaching in his home country, and a tenured professor at Harvard. By Force of Thought traces Kornai's lifelong intellectual journey and offers a subjective complement to his academic research. Disenchanted with communism, Kornai published Overcentralization (1956), the first book written by someone living behind the Iron Curtain to be openly critical of Soviet-style economics. Although it was attacked in Hungary, it was hailed by Western economists. The Kornai-Lipták theory on two-level planning captured the attention of mathematical economists. Kornai went on to publish the controversial Anti-Equilibrium (1971), a critique of the general equilibrium theory underpinning mainstream economic analyses of markets, Economics of Shortage (1980), The Road to a Free Economy (1990), and the summary of his lifetime research, The Socialist System (1992). An intellectual emissary between East and West, Kornai commuted between Harvard and Budapest for many years. Kornai's memoir describes his research—including his present-day evaluation of his past work—as well as the social and political environments in which he did his work. The difficulties faced by a critic of central planning in a communist country are made especially vivid by material from newly opened secret police files and informers' reports on his activities. By Force of Thought will be an essential resource for students of economic thought, socialist systems, and postsocialist transition, and for readers interested in Eastern European intellectual life before, during, and after communism.

A31|The Headscarf Controversy in Turkey|This article is based on a monographic field study, which was conducted in October 2007. In addition, the results of other studies on the headscarf issue conducted at different times between 2003 and 2007 have also been used to follow the development over the course of time. The study found that the headscarf prohibition has no strong social basis. As it would be a mistake to see the headscarf prohibition as an element of the secularism project, defining an ideology on the basis of the headscarf, an important religious symbol in Turkey, presents a risk to the progress of democracy, and only serves to increase political polarization. Formulating public policies on the basis of the headscarf prohibition will only help destroy social peace. Social engineering projects which aim to change or destroy political, religious and ethnic positions of citizens are not permitted in Western-type contemporary democracies. There is no headscarf problem in Turkey in a sociological sense, the real problem lies in the totalitarian/authoritarian approach which stems from groundless fears and/or ideological choices of the social elite or economic power centers.
A31|Status of Women in the Rural Khasi Society of Meghalaya|The issue of empowerment of women has been much discussed at various levels to find out the solution to age-old problem of gender discrimination, exploitation of women and to uplift their status and position in the society. However, in most of the tribal societies even if poor, women always have an instilled special position and role they play in different spheres with great responsibility vis a vis their counterpart men. The Khasi society of Meghalaya is such a society, commonly known as matrilineal where authority, title, inheritance, residence after marriage and succession are traced through female line. So it is presumed that they do not require any special effort to make them aware and get social, economic, political or psychological understanding and knowledge to establish their rights along with men in their society as they are automatically placed on an esteemed level. They are presumed to have access to education, ownership of property, authority in their family and society; they are the heads of their families and decide what to be done or not etc. But a recent survey by us in the rural areas of Meghalaya shows that about one-third of the families are headed by the male. Also many of the families headed by females who are either widow or deserted. Also in the political sphere, hardly anybody is there who is female and even in the Dorbar; females are not allowed to take part in the meeting or decision-making. But in most of the socio-economic activities, still now dominance on female is observed even though they are assumed to be physically weak. Also, even though some families are headed by males it may be that they are just to carry out activities with the guidance of their female counterpart who has better control over assets and therefore no fear of loosing anything even if they are deserted by their husbands. Therefore, a question may arise whether in Khasi tribe the status of women is ascribed or prescribed by the society. Also it is pertinent to enquire about the direction to which the position and status of women are moving with the development of the society. This paper is thus an attempt to examine the dynamics of status and role of tribal women in Meghalaya, especially of Khasi women. It is examined through a number of social, economic, political, cultural, psychological and attitudinal indicators on the basis of the primary data on such factors collected from two villages in East Khasi Hills District of Meghalaya.
A31|Theoretische Grundlagen demokratischer Wirtschafts- und Gesellschaftspolitik - Der Beitrag Jon Elsters|Jon Elster gehört zu den profiliertesten Sozialwissenschaftlern der internationalen ‚scientific community'. Der vorliegende Beitrag entwickelt eine Lesart für sein bisher vorliegendes Gesamtwerk: In einem ersten Schritt wird Elsters Kritik an funktionalistischen Fehlschlüssen in den Sozialwissenschaften marxistischen und nicht-marxistischer Provenienz rekonstruiert. In einem zweiten Schritt wird nachgezeichnet, mit welchen Argumenten Elster die Verwendung des Rational-Choice-Ansatzes in der Ökonomik – insbesondere im ökonomischen Forschungsprogramms Gary S. Beckers – kritisiert. In einem dritten Schritt schließlich wird Elsters eigener Ansatz vorgestellt, gesellschaftliche Ereignisse mit Hilfe sozialer Mechanismen zu verstehen. Zugrunde liegt die Interpretation, dass Elster mit seinem Rationalitätskonzept das klassische Vernunftideal autonomer Selbstbestimmung auszubuchstabieren versucht. Sein Rational-Choice-Ansatz ist nicht primär explanativ, sondern vielmehr hermeneutisch ausgerichtet. In erklärender Hinsicht hat er nicht viel mehr zu bieten als eine possibilistisch psychologisierende Rational- Choice-Kasuistik.
A31|The Empirics of Social Capital and Economic Development: A Critical Perspective|" This paper provides an introduction to the concept of social capital, and carries out a critical review of the empirical literature on social capital and economic development. The survey points out six main weaknesses affecting the empirics of social capital. Identified weaknesses are then used to analyze, in a critical perspective, some prominent empirical studies and new interesting researches published in the last two years. The need emerges to acknowledge, also within the empirical research, the multidimensional, context-dependent and dynamic nature of social capital. The survey also underlines that, although it has gained a certain popularity in the empirical research, the use of ""indirect"" indicators may be misleading. Such measures do not represent social capital's key components identified by the theoretical literature, and their use causes a considerable confusion about what social capital is, as distinct from its outcomes, and what the relationship between social capital and its outcomes may be. Research reliant upon an outcome of social capital as an indicator of it will necessarily find social capital to be related to that outcome. This paper suggests to focus the empirical research firstly on the ""structural"" aspects of the concept, therefore excluding by the measurement toolbox all indicators referring to social capital's supposed outcomes."

A31|Money, Exchange Rates, and Output|"Guillermo Calvo, who foresaw the financial crisis that followed the devaluation of Mexico's peso, has spent much of his career thinking beyond the conventional wisdom. In a quiet and understated way, Calvo has made seminal contributions to several major research areas in macroeconomics, particularly monetary policy, exchange rates, public debt, and stabilization in Latin America and post-communist countries. Money, Exchange Rates, and Output brings together these contributions in a broad selection of the author's work over the past two decades. There are introductions to each section, and an introduction to the entire collection that outlines the connections throughout and surveys the current state of macroeconomic theory. Calvo, an advocate of the ""Chicago school"" of rational expectations, uses elements of this approach to understand economic development. While he is a top macroeconomics theorist, his models are always intertwined with policy discussion. He pushes readers to combine knowledge of real world facts—of institutions, traditions, and culture, in addition to statistics - with theory. One focus of this collection is on the role of credibility in policy-making. Calvo analyzes the origins and macroeconomic consequences of credibility problems. He also shows how monetary and trade theory can fail when the public does not fully believe in policy announcements. A second focus is on equilibrium multiplicity. Calvo uses models with multiple equilibria to identify factors that cause anomalous behavior. He discusses multiple equilibria in abstract terms as well as in terms of its relevance to understanding domestic public debt. Specific issues covered are predetermined exchange rates, currency substitution, domestic public debt and seigniorage, and stabilizing transition economies."

A31|Possibilities to Improve the Complex Assessment of the Quality of Economic Research|"There are identified and analyzed some major aspects of the quality of economic research. An attempt is made at outlining the possible directions for improvement of its complex assessment. The achievement of that objective involves the performing of the following tasks: summarizing the main points in the nature and the mechanism of assessment; assessment of the content-related aspect of the research; assessment of the relation ""analysis-results"" of the research process; analysis of the formed traditional negative features of research work."
A31|Jurnalistii si factorul politic in anul 2004<BR>[The romanian journalists and political factor in 2004]|This study attempts to identify some characteristics of the relationship between journalists and politicians. The methodology of the research is based on the analysis of responses to interviews in depth applied to a sample of 50 print and audiovisual journalists from Bucharest, Suceava, Pitesti, Galati and Zalau. The central points of interest have focused on tracking the degree of the journalists'independence from the political and consequently economic factors. The results of the analysis found that often political interference in editorial media agenda materialized through print and audiovisual media owners. One of the ways used by the political parties in influencing journalists consist in the providing of economic benefits as state advertising to obedient publications. Precariousness of the professional organizations and associations of journalists from Romania explains in some degree the problems revealed by journalists interviewed.
A31|Alternatives for Refinement of the Complex Assessment of the Quality of Economic Research|The article identifies and analyses the main aspects of the quality of the scientific economic research, trying to draw alternative directions for the refinement of its assessment.

A31|Magison-ison: A parallel reality construction of war among Joloano Muslim Survivors in Sulu, Philippines|The Mindanao conflict in Southern Philippines is a long-standing controversy that has eluded comprehensive solutions. Despite efforts of the Government of the Philippines (GRP) and the representatives from the peoples of Mindanao in undertaking peace initiatives, “the war:” continues. The establishment of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) as embodied in an organic law provided in the 1986 Philippine Constitution has not seemed to bring about the much-anticipated progress. Even with the so-called “autonomy” already in place to substantiate the clamor of the Muslims for self-rule in the Tripoli Agreement, conflict has escalated signifying unrest among the people. Instead of dealing with the problem from the standpoint of an “outsider” who may know about the Mindanao conflict from what they hear, the study attempted to get a glimpse of “the war” from the “insiders” who have survived and lived to tell their own stories. From the perspectives of two distinct peoples of Sulu- the Christian and Muslim Joloanos, the study was able to penetrate the heart of conflict in Mindanao. The study was able to visualize “the 1974 war” and the on-going conflicts from two cultural lenses and in the process was able to demonstrate a “parallel reality construction” among the war survivors who provided interesting insights of “the war” from their “fantasy themes”. The research has not only surfaced conflicting notions in their revelations of “the war” as experienced (subjective realities) but has generated elements of “convergence” as their experiences were correlated with the institutionalized beliefs of war (objective realities) or the war as told. Despite distinct subjective realities, they have shown proclivity towards parallel perceptions. The Joloano war survivors’ subjective realities as applied in the study include their psycho-social trauma of the war and their portrayal of the role of “the other” culture as co-survivors of war. Among the elderly, descriptions of their fears and negative emotions have strongly echoed “old prejudices”. Among the middle-aged, “prudence” and tact in their narratives revealed a tendency to rationalize and to show sympathy towards “the other” culture. From the young war survivors a propensity towards confronting their dilemma suggested optimism and resilience in their perceptions. Transitions in the subjective realities of the war survivors are apparent across culture and age. Opposing views are very strong among the elderly except for one Christian and a Muslim who are associated with “the other” culture by reason of marriage with them. The older Christian Joloanos for instance believe that the war was “unnecessary” while the older Muslims were convinced it was “inevitable”. The study has strongly shown that “shifts” in perceptions could be anchored on the participants’ religious beliefs and changing circumstances that come with age, political set-up, economic climate and inter-marriage among others. Their reactions towards the prevailing issues of war (media war issues, other concepts and beliefs of war) which constitute the institutionalized-objective realities as defined in the study are “convergent” despite distinct experiences and personal circumstances. They have for example generally shown disagreement towards the commonly held concept that the mass media function to crystallize relevant issues, like the war in Mindanao. The majority of the co-authors furthermore negated the belief of the general public that “Christians and Muslims can never co-exist peacefully, and that the 1974 war was a form of “jihad” or a religious war among Muslims. In the study therefore, communication has been proven once again to play a vital role in clarifying issues of the Mindanao conflict. It performed an emancipatory role in ways that provided rhetorical and psychological relief by allowing an occasion for war survivors to deconstruct their realities through their narratives. And to reconstruct their meaning of war by actively taking part in correcting prevailing notions of war to bring about the much needed change in a war-torn community like Sulu.
A31|Adam Smith's Invisible Hands|William Gramppâ€™s JPE article on Adam Smith is creative and provocative. It errs, however, by disparaging the invisible handâ€™s importance as a symbol of various economic processes that help societies prosper in ways that individuals neither intend nor comprehend. Four specific problems stand out. First, Grampp unsoundly tries to limit the relevance of the invisible hand within the Wealth of Nations to situations in which a merchant increases domestic capital and strengthens national defense. Second, Grampp presents an oversimplified account of WNâ€™s treatment of international relations. Third he conspicuously misinterprets the trickle-down process of The Theory of Moral Sentiments, where Smith argues that an invisible hand promotes the welfare of the poor despite the greed of the rich. Fourth, by failing to plumb the connection between these two invisible handsâ€”and by dismissing the relevance of a third invisible hand, which Smith elsewhere invokes to illustrate the superstitious outlook that pervades â€œprimitiveâ€ societiesâ€”Grampp overlooks the complex interrelationships between Smithâ€™s two books. Whereas WN presents the invisible hand in an atheistic context, the TMS version seems to be the hand of God; this religious contrast mirrors TMSâ€™s more optimistic perspective on the poor and its more ambivalent evaluation of â€œriches and power.â€ Grampp is wise to stress the inconsistencies, puzzles, and exaggerations that Smith bequeathed to his readers. But some of Gramppâ€™s criticisms are glib, and he deserves blame for trivializing the invisible hand. The three invisible hands, I argue, not only illuminate the rhetorical strategies that helped Smith influence institutions and public policies; they also signal his commitment to promoting curiosity and inquiry.
A31|The Economic Consequences of Terror: A Brief Survey|This brief survey reviews the economic consequences of terrorism. It is argued that the indirect effects of terrorism are likely to outweigh the direct effects. The former include changes in risk, transaction costs, demand, public finances and growth. We also address the nature of anti-terrorist policy and of policies reducing the negative impact of terrorism. The former can change the incentives for terrorists to break with social conventions or maximize the costs of conducting terrorism. The latter is particularly important as badly designed policies could enhance the negative economic effects of terrorist actions.
A31|The Evaluation Of The Economic Research Works. A Relevance Indicator|Many works dealing with the transition to the market economy in both the world and national literature has formed the area of concern of many Romanian researchers over the period 1990 – 2003. This working paper is dealing with scientometrics and the scientific evaluation of the theoretical works in the economic research field. The paper reviews the national economic academic publications, specialized publications and newspapers including important economic pages, describes the citation analysis method and makes an attempt to set a relevance indicator of the national works in our research field. The indicator (in absolute and relative form) is based on the method of giving marks to the publications in which the study appears and includes a multiplier (internationality coefficient) for calculating compound scores.
A31|Preference, Belief, and Similarity: Selected Writings|Amos Tversky (1937-1996), a towering figure in cognitive and mathematical psychology, devoted his professional life to the study of similarity, judgment, and decision making. He had a unique ability to master the technicalities of normative ideals and then to intuit and demonstrate experimentally their systematic violation due to the vagaries and consequences of human information processing. He created new areas of study and helped transform disciplines as varied as economics, law, medicine, political science, philosophy, and statistics. This book collects forty of Tversky's articles, selected by him in collaboration with the editor during the last months of Tversky's life. It is divided into three sections: Similarity, Judgment, and Preferences. The Preferences section is subdivided into Probabilistic Models of Choice, Choice under Risk and Uncertainty, and Contingent Preferences. Included are several articles written with his frequent collaborator, Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman.
A31|Crossing Boundaries: Selected Writings|"During the last half century, Albert O. Hirschman has single-handedly redefined the scope and limits of political economy, in theory and in practice. His contributions as both a scholar and an economic advisor have definitively shaped an innovative program for social change and economic development. Gathered here for the first time in one volume are recent writings of interdisciplinary range, erudite sophistication, and limitless curiosity. In two essays on commensality and the ""invention"" of democracy in classical Greece, and on the workings and making of the Marshall Plan, Hirschman shows how his personal and political experience allow him to forge new connections between the past and the present, between intellectual life and lived experience. The third piece, ""Trespassing,"" is an interview Hirschman gave in Italian in 1993, which he has translated and edited for this volume. Although in the past Hirschman has resisted autobiographical meditation, here he recounts—with frankness, humor, and insight—some of the most compelling and formative moments of his life divided between the ""European"" and the ""American"" years. Not only does he discuss how his personal experiences have shaped and influenced his thinking about economic and social development, democracy and capitalism, he also reveals the ""key terms"" of his scholarship—concepts he is constantly rethinking, subverting, and reinventing."
A31|Hemispheric dominance and language proficiency levels in the four macro skills of Western Mindanao State university college students|This study was conducted to determine the relationship between the hemispheric dominance (HD) and the English proficiency (EP) scores in the four macro skills of the Western Mindanao State University college students. It hypothesized that students’ HD would have a significant correlation a) with their EP scores in listening, speaking, reading and writing, b) with their global EP score, c) with both the macro and global scores when respondents would be grouped according to age, gender and area of specialization. In this study, there were 240 respondents selected through purposive, stratified, and random sampling techniques from the 5,096 students of the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Education. Using the standardized HD Test, the standardized Listening and Reading Comprehension Tests, the researcher-made Speaking and Writing Skill Tests and Cloze Test and employing mainly the Pearson r for the statistical analysis, the study concluded: 1) that most of the students of the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Education of Western Mindanao State University were left-brained (74.6%); 2) that the students were “good” in speaking, “fair” in listening and writing skills but “ poor” in reading and in global English; 3) that there was no significant relationship between the students’ hemisphericity and their EP scores in listening, speaking, reading, writing and global proficiency tests; and 4) that a significant relationship was shown between HD and EP scores when respondents were grouped according to age and area of specialization only.

A31|Political Economy And International Economics: Jagdish Bhagwati|Political Economy and International Economics is the fifth volume of collected essays by the noted economist Jagdish Bhagwati. Following Essays in International Economic Theory (edited by Robert Feenstra) and Essays in Development Economics (edited by Gene Grossman), it reflects Bhagwati's wide range of interests and his rare ability to combine economic theory and political analysis. Jagdish Bhagwati is Arthur Lehman Professor of Economics and Professor of Political Science at Columbia University. Five volumes of his scientific essays as well as his Ohlin Lectures on Protectionism have been published by The MIT Press. He is the founding editor of the Journal of International Economics and Economics and Politics. He is a Fellow of the Econometric Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
A31|Returns to Schooling: A Peculiar Deviation from Linearity|Results reported in this paper indicate that the returns-to-schooling profile exhibits a peculiar departure from log-linearity. In particular, for white males, the return to the 15th year of schooling (the third year of college) seems to be much smaller than that predicted by log-linearity. That is, people with 15 years of schooling do not appear to earn any more than those with 14 years of schooling. I discuss several theories and evidence that may explain the peculiarity. Amongst them, measurement error in schooling seems the most plausible.
A31|Economic Analysis of Markets and Games: Essays in Honor of Frank Hahn|These original essays focus on a wide range of topics related to Frank Hahn's distinguished work in economics. Ranging from market analysis and game theory to the microeconomic foundations of macroeconomics and from equilibrium and optimality with missing markets to economics and society, they reflect the diversity of modern research in economic theory. What distinguishes Hahn's work and many of the essays in this book is that the motivation often comes from practical concerns about unemployment, savings and investment, poverty, or the stability of markets.
A31|Microtheory: Applications and Origins|This volume of seventeen previously published essays by William J. Baumol brings together work on the theory of contestable markets, welfare theory, antitrust, pricing, and the history of economic thought. Written between 1971 and 1983, they have sparked productive extensions and criticism in microeconomic theory and provide an engaging intellectual history of one of the leading figures in the field of economics. Baumol introduces each of the book's four parts, presenting his subsequent views on the subjects covered in the reprinted articles, including some important amendments. The book opens with an autobiographical essay that presents the intellectual climate of economics in the 1940s in which Kenneth Arrow, Frank Hahn, Martin Shubik, Otto Eckstein, and Gary Becker were beginning their careers. Baumol's introductory essays to the book's major sections take up the threads from this autobiographical piece and follow them to the development of concepts central to economic theory, applications, and methodology. Three essays in the first part provide an underpinning for the theory of contestable markets. In the second part five essays explore issues in welfare economics such as the role of diminishing and increasing returns may play the role of symmetric obstacles to Pareto optimality. Essays in the third part range from regulation and antitrust to urban economics to the Phillips curve and the pitfalls of using, in the analysis of real issues, dual values derived from linear models when the underlying reality is nonlinear. Those in the concluding part focus on the history of economic ideas such as the Smithian versus Marxian view of business morality and the social interest, the Marxian concept of value transformation, the iron law of wages, and Say's law.
A31|Multinational Excursions|Charles P. Kindleberger is widely regarded as among the most accessible and intelligent practitioners of the economist's craft. This collection of his papers and lectures, articles and reviews, prepared over the past decade, focuses on the role of multinational corporations in the international economy, their relationships with home and host countries (both developed and less developed), the determinants of their size, the impetus to their investment behavior, their history, the literature about them, and their regulation. Chapters relate the phenomenon of the multinational corporation to the body of economic theory. They discuss multinational corporations in world affairs, size of firm and size of nation, the clash of economics and sociology and politics in the internationalization of business, restrictions on direct investment in host countries, direct investment in less developed countries and in militant developing nations, ownership and contract in international business, and multinationals and the small open economy. The origins of United States direct investment in France, and international banks and international business are taken up, followed by Kindleberger's reviews of major books on the multinational corporation and including his criticisms of such popular writing as Barnet and Moller's Global Reach, and Magdoff's Age of Imperialism. Kindleberger's policy statements before various national and international governments, in which he proposes the creation of a loose framework among national authorities to harmonize policies toward the multinational corporation are also included.
A31|Economics for Policymaking: Selected Essays of Arthur M. Okun|Arthur Okun - teacher at Yale in the 1950s, member and later Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors in the 1960s, and Fellow of the Brookings Institution throughout the 1970s - was one of the three or four most important macroeconomists of the past twenty years. He was perhaps unique in having the respect and admiration of both academic economists and practical politicians. Okun was an effective mediator between the realms of economic theory and analysis and the making and implementation of public policy. These thirty-one essays, whether they first appeared in the American Economic Review or in the New York Times Magazine, are all marked by a lucid and readable style of writing and by a willingness to grapple with real economic, social, and political problems. They are grouped under eight headings: Inflation: Causes and Cures; Implicit Contracts; Output, Employment, and Unemployment; Fiscal and Monetary Policy; Economic Performance, 1960-1980; Economic Forecasting; Economic Policy Formulation; and Equality and Efficiency.
A31|Theory for Economic Efficiency: Essays in Honor of Abba P. Lerner|"Paul Samuelson once noted that ""Abba Lerner has been a great theoretical economist in a vintage epoch for theorists. This last third of a century he has poured out one brilliant paper after another-in micro theory and macro, in pure thought, and in the realms of policy."" Lerner's colleagues at Queens College have assembled these essays on issues of considerable importance in the world economy, particularly in areas of social welfare, as ""a tribute to a great economist who has made significant and long-lasting contributions to many fields of economic theory and policy."""
A31|Trade, Tariffs, and Growth|Professor Bhagwati has brought together in this volume his most important theoretical writings on international economics through 1969. A major contribution to the pure theory of international trade -- his Economic Journal survey of the subject -- is reprinted with an addendum which brings it up to date. In addition, there are papers on propositions relating to gains from trade, and papers on tariffs, quotas and subsides, which cover both 'positive' and welfare aspects of trade theory. Reprinted here are his well-known papers on immiserizing growth, including a recent generalization, and on the theory of optimal policy intervention under domestic distortions. Four important essays on growth and development round out the volume. The fifteen essays reprinted in this collection comprise all the most original contributions and surveys which have established Professor Bhagwati as a leading theorist of international trade. The wide range of topics covered makes the whole book invaluable to all students of international economics.
