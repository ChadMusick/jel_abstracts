F37|Forecast Performance in Times of Terrorism|Governments, central banks, and private companies make extensive use of expert and market-based forecasts in their decision-making processes. These forecasts can be affected by terrorism, which should be considered by decision makers. We focus on terrorism, as a mostly endogenously driven form of political uncertainty, and use new econometric tests to assess the forecasting performance of market and professional inflation and exchange-rate forecasts in Israel. We show that expert forecasts are better than market-based forecasts, particularly during periods of terrorism. However, forecasting performance and abilities of both market-based and expert forecasts are significantly reduced during such periods. Thus, policymakers should be particularly attentive to terrorism when considering inflation and exchange-rate forecasts.
F37|Exchange Rate Reconnect|The failure to find fundamentals that co-move with exchange rates or forecasting models with even mild predictive power – facts broadly referred to as “exchange rate disconnect” – stands among the most disappointing, but robust, facts in all of international macroeconomics. In this paper, we demonstrate that U.S. purchases of foreign bonds, which did not co-move with exchange rates prior to 2007, have provided significant in-sample, and even some out-of-sample, explanatory power for currencies since then. We show that several proxies for global risk factors also start to co-move strongly with the dollar and with U.S. purchases of foreign bonds around 2007, suggesting that risk plays a key role in this finding. We use security-level data on U.S. portfolios to demonstrate that the reconnect of U.S. foreign bond purchases to exchange rates is largely driven by investment in dollar-denominated assets rather than by foreign currency exposure alone. Our results support the narrative emerging from an active recent literature that the US dollar’s role as an international and safe-haven currency has surged since the global financial crisis.
F37|The Jolly Ride of International Reserves and Commodity Prices: Evidence from Predictive Models|This study offers new insight into the dynamics of international reserves (IR). We argue that commodity prices play importance role in the accumulation of IR. We test this hypothesis by specifying a predictive model, in which commodity prices serve as predictors of IR. We essentially examine the extent to which the former predicts the later. Building a dataset for the BRICS nations, we found that a number of interesting results were obtained: first, commodity prices resoundingly predict the level of IR. Second, accounting for asymmetry helps improve the level of predictability.
F37|Revisiting the accuracy of inflation forecasts in Nigeria: the oil price â€“exchange rate perspectives|Motivated by the dual characteristic of the Nigeria economy as exporter and importer of oil, we extend the Tule et al. (2018) oil price â€“based predictive model to include the role of exchange rates in the predictability of inflation in Nigeria. Using the FQGLS estimator developed by Westerlund and Narayan (2012, 2015), we account for endogeneity, persistence and conditional heterosecedatcity effects in the forecasting analyses of inflation in Nigeria. We use both the single and pairwise measures to compare the forecast results of oil prices and/or exchange rates based augmented Phillips curve with the variant that contain them both simultaneously. The result suggests that augmenting the Phillips curve with oil prices and exchange rates in the same model set up is the more accurate to forecasting inflation in Nigeria relative to having them individually in a predictive model. More so, the augmented Phillips curve with oil prices and exchange rate consistently outperforms time series models such as ARMA and ARFIMA. However, we find that accounting for structural breaks will largely improve the accuracy of CMB-APC for forecasting inflation in Nigeria. We find the robustness of these findings evident for in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts.
F37|Statistical Learning and Exchange Rate Forecasting|his study uses the most innovative tools recently proposed in the statistical learning literature to assess the ability of standard exchange rate models to predict the exchange rate in the short and long run. Our results show that statistical learning methods display impressive performances, consistently outperforming the random walk in forecasting the exchange rate at different forecasting horizons, with the exception of the very short term (a period of 1-2 months). We use these tools to compare the predictive ability of different exchange rate models and model specifications. We find that sticky price versions of the monetary model with the error correction specification exhibit the best performance. We also explore the functioning of statistical learning models by developing measures of variable importance and by analyzing the kind of relationship that links each variable with the outcome. This allows us to improve our understanding of the relationship between the exchange rate and economic fundamentals, which appears complex and characterized by strong non-linearities.
F37|Housing Cycle and Exchange Rates|This paper documents that U.S. housing capital investment is a strong negative predictor of U.S. dollar changes and excess returns over the next six months to five years. Other advanced economies exhibit similar patterns. Moreover, positive housing supply shocks predict lower prices of housing services and nontradables relative to that of tradables, as well as higher output growth and macroeconomic volatility. An analytical model shows that these channels generate the exchange rate predictability under incomplete and complete markets, respectively. Cross-sectionally, currencies with higher loadings on the U.S. housing cycle carry higher average currency premia, compensating the U.S. investor for bearing the U.S. long-run consumption risk.

F37|Forecasting realized volatility of bitcoin returns: Tail events and asymmetric loss|We use intra-day data to construct measures of the realized volatility of bitcoin returns. We then use the heterogeneous autoregressive realized volatility (HAR-RV) model to study whether indices which capture the tail behaviour (heavy-tailedness and asymmetry) of the daily returns distribution help to forecast subsequent realized volatility. We find that mainly forecasters who suffer a higher loss in case of an underprediction of realized volatility than in case of an overprediction of the same absolute size benefit from using the tail indices as predictors of realized volatility at intermediate forecast horizons. This result is robust to controlling for realized skewness and realized kurtosis, and it also applies to “bad” and “good” realized volatility.
F37|Commodity Price Uncertainty as a Leading Indicator of Economic Activity|In this paper we examine the impact of commodity price uncertainty on US economic activity. Our empirical analysis indicates that uncertainty in agricultural, metals and energy markets depresses US economic activity and acts as an early warning signal for US recessions with a forecasting horizon ranging from one to twelve months. The results reveal that uncertainty shocks in agricultural and metals markets are more significant for the US macroeconomy when compared to oil price uncertainty shocks. Finally, we show that when accounting for the effects of macroeconomic and monetary factors, the negative dynamic response of economic activity to agricultural and metals price uncertainty shocks remains unaltered, while the response to energy uncertainty shocks is significantly reduced due to either systematic policy reactions or random shocks in monetary policy.
F37|Time-Series Momentum: A Monte-Carlo Approach|This paper develops a Monte-Carlo backtesting procedure for risk premia strategies and employs it to study Time-Series Momentum (TSM). Relying on time-series models, empirical residual distributions and copulas we overcome two key drawbacks of conventional backtesting procedures. We create 10,000 paths of different TSM strategies based on the S&P 500 and a cross-asset class futures portfolio. The simulations reveal a probability distribution which shows that strategies that outperform Buy-and-Hold in-sample using historical backtests may out-of-sample i) exhibit sizeable tail risks ii) underperform or outperform. Our results are robust to using different time-series models, time periods, asset classes, and risk measures.
F37|Cross-Border Financial Effects of Global Warming In a Two-Area Ecological SFC Model|We develop an ecological open-economy SFC model that enables testing cross-area interactions among productive sectors, financial markets and the ecosystem. We show that the unequal technical progress across areas, coupled with rising ecological awareness, can force governments of less ecologically efficient areas to move further away from low-carbon assets. We argue that ‘green’ monetary and fiscal policies can be used to tackle climate change and financial instability. However, their effectiveness depends crucially on the impact of cross-border financial flows and growth rate differentials on exchange rates. Without a cross-area policy coordination plan, currency fluctuations can bring about unintended consequences, undermining green policies’ effects.
F37|Monetary policy transmission to Russia & Eastern Europe|In this paper, we argue that the ECB's unconventional monetary policy announcements have generated significant spillover effects in Russia and Eastern Europe. The hypothesis is tested using OLS estimations of event-based regressions on monetary policy event dummies and seven financial variables in eleven East European countries including Russia. Overall, the empirical results associate the ECB's unconventional policy announcements with the appreciation of East European currencies, rising stock market indices as well as falling long-term government bond yields and lower sovereign CDS spreads in Eastern Europe and Russia. Notably, bilateral integration with the eurozone is a key determinant of the strength of spillovers, with spillovers strongest in non-euro EU countries and weakest in non-EU East European countries. Interestingly, we find differentiated strength of spillovers to Russia compared to other non-EU East European countries, which we attribute to its fixed exchange rate regime. Lastly, we test for the presence of the portfolio rebalancing and confidence transmission channels.
F37|Monitoring Bank Failures in a Data-Rich Environment| This paper develops a monitoring and forecasting model for the aggregate monthly number of commercial bank failures in the U.S. We extract key sectoral predictors from the large set of macroeconomic variables proposed by McCracken and Ng (2016) and incorporate them in a hurdle negative binomial model to predict the number of monthly commercial bank failures. We uncover a strong and robust relationship between the predictor synthesizing housing industry variables and bank failures. This relationship suggests the existence of a link between developments in the housing sector and the vulnerability of commercial banks to non-performing loans increases and asset deterioration. We assess different specifications
F37|The effects of conventional and unconventional monetary policy on exchange rates|What are the effects of monetary policy on exchange rates? And have unconventional monetary policies changed the way monetary policy is transmitted to international financial markets? According to conventional wisdom, expansionary monetary policy shocks in a country lead to that country's currency depreciation. We revisit the conventional wisdom during both conventional and unconventional monetary policy periods in the US by using a novel identification procedure that defines monetary policy shocks as changes in the whole yield curve due to unanticipated monetary policy moves and allows monetary policy shocks to differ depending on how they affect agents' expectations about the future path of interest rates as well as their perceived effects on the riskiness/uncertainty in the economy. Our empirical results show that: (i) a monetary policy easing leads to a depreciation of the country's spot nominal exchange rate in both conventional and unconventional periods; (ii) however, there is substantial heterogeneity in monetary policy shocks over time and their effects depend on the way they affect agents' expectations; (iii) we find favorable evidence to Dornbusch's (1976) overshooting hypothesis; (iv) changes in expected real interest rates play an important role in the transmission of monetary policy shocks.

F37|Saving, investment, capital stock and current account projections in long-term scenarios|The paper describes the framework used in long-term economic scenarios for the projection of the saving rate, investment, capital stock and current account. The saving rate is determined according to an estimated equation which suggests that demographics, captured by the old-age dependency rate and life expectancy, is a major driver, with additional effects from the fiscal balance, labour productivity growth, the net oil trade balance, the availability of credit and the level of social protection. The evolution of the business sector capital stock depends on the economy’s cyclical position, product market regulation, employment protection legislation and the user cost of capital, and may be constrained by current account deficits depending on the degree of capital account openness. Business sector investment is derived from the capital stock projection via the usual stock-flow identity. The public sector capital stock-to-output ratio is assumed to be constant in the baseline scenario, but a public investment shock can be simulated in alternative scenarios. The current account balance is obtained as the difference between national investment and saving, and in turn determines the evolution of the net international investment position. A global interest rate premium helps to bring global saving and investment into balance.
F37|Can the interaction between a single long-term attractor and heterogeneous trading explain exchange rate behaviour? A nonlinear econometric investigation|Abstract Over the last 15 years, exchange rate movements have been smoother and slower than expected, given the entity of the sharp shifts in the fundamental variables brought about by the international financial crisis. Since the beginning of the ’90s researchers have explored different approaches in order to understand high frequency exchange rate dynamics. Among them the model that assumes heterogeneous trading strategies, where ‘fundamentalists’ coexist with ‘chartists’ in nonlinear transitional specifications, plays an increasingly relevant if puzzling role. We study the US dollar, the British pound and the Japanese yen vs the euro over the period 2002 to 2016 using weekly data. The most important contribution of this paper is that we find empirical evidence that both types of agent react to the same transition variable, viz. the absolute distance of the actual exchange rate to its relative PPP value. The spot foreign currency demand of fundamentalists is driven by the size of the misalignment both directly and through a transition function, which models the adoption of fundamental strategies by newcomers. The number of chartists also varies according to the absolute distance of the exchange rate change from its fundamental value. Evidence supports the existence of stabilizing and destabilizing behaviour not only by chartists but also by fundamentalists.
F37|Modeling and Forecasting Naira / USD Exchange Rate In Nigeria: a Box - Jenkins ARIMA approach|In the financial as well as managerial decision making process, forecasting is a crucial element (Majhi et al, 2009). Most research have been made on forecasting of financial and economic variables through the help of researchers in the last decades using series of fundamental and technical approaches yielding different results (Musa et al, 2014). The theory of forecasting exchange rate has been in existence for many centuries where different models yield different forecasting results either in the sample or out of sample (Onasanya & Adeniji, 2013). A country’s exchange rate is one of the most closely monitored indicators, as fluctuations in exchange rates can have far reaching economic consequences (Ribeiro, 2016). The recent financial turmoil all over the world demonstrates the urgency of perfect information of the exchange rates (Shim, 2000). Understanding the forecasting of exchange rate behaviour is important to monetary policy (Simwaka, 2007). One of the important variables that have considerable influence on other socio – economic variables in Nigeria is the Nigerian naira / dollar exchange rate (Ismail, 2009). Owing to the critical role played by exchange rate dynamics in international trade and overall economic performance of all countries in general, the need for a good forecasting tool cannot be ruled out. In this study, we model and forecast the Naira / USD exchange rates over the period 1960 – 2017. Our diagnostic tests such as the ADF test indicate that EXC time series data is I (1). Based on the minimum AIC value, the study presents the ARIMA (1, 1, 1) model as the optimal model. The ADF test further indicates that the residuals of the ARIMA (1, 1, 1) model are stationary and thus bear the characteristics of a white noise process. It is also important to note that our forecast evaluation statistics, namely ME, RMSE, MAE, MPE, MAPE and Theil’s U absolutely show that our forecast accuracy is quite good. Our forecast actually indicates that the Naira will continue to depreciate. The main policy implication from this study is that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), should devalue the Naira in order to not only restore exchange rate stability but also encourage local manufacturing and promote foreign capital inflows.
F37|Is Renminbi a (Truly) International Currency? An Evaluation Based on Offshore Foreign Exchange Market Trading Patterns|This article provides a new framework to evaluate the status of Renminbi internationalization. It proposes that the trading patterns of a currency in global foreign exchange market embody the currency’s position in the international monetary system. Based on foreign exchange trading data provided by CLS Group, the article constructs a ranking of major international currencies including Renminbi. It finds that Renminbi shares more similarities in foreign exchange trading patterns with the established global currencies like US dollar and Euro than with those regional currencies. The article also explores the policy implications that the new evaluation approach provides.
F37|The predictive relationship between exchange rate expectations and base metal prices|In this paper we show that survey-based-expectations about the future evolution of the Chilean exchange rate have the ability to predict the returns of the six primary non-ferrous metals: aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc. Predictability is also found for returns of the London Metal Exchange Index. Previous studies have shown that the Chilean exchange rate has the ability to predict copper returns, a world commodity index and base metal prices. Nevertheless, our results indicate that expectations about the Chilean peso have stronger predictive ability relative to the Chilean currency. This is shown both in-sample and out-of-sample. By focusing on expectations of a commodity currency, and not on the currency itself, our paper provides indirect but new and strong evidence of the ability that commodity currencies have to forecast commodity prices. Our results are also consistent with the present-value-model for exchange rate determination.
F37|Forecast ranked tailored equity portfolios|We use a dynamic model averaging (DMA) approach to construct forecasts of individual equity returns for a large cross-section of stocks contained in the SP500, FTSE100, DAX30, CAC40 and SPX30 headline indices, taking value, momentum, and quality factors as predictor variables. Fixing the set of ‘forgetting factors’ in the DMA prediction framework, we show that highly significant return forecasts relative to the historic average benchmark are obtained for 173 (281) individual equities at the 1% (5%) level, from a total of 895 stocks. These statistical forecast improvements also translate into considerable economic gains, producing out-of-sample R 2 values above 5% (10%) for 283 (166) of the 895 individual stocks. Equally weighted long only portfolios constructed from a ranking of the best 25% forecasts in each headline index can generate sizable returns in excess of a passive investment strategy in that index itself, even when transaction costs and risk taking are accounted for.
F37|Can we beat the Random Walk? The case of survey-based exchange rate forecasts in Chile|We examine the accuracy of survey-based expectations of the Chilean exchange rate relative to the US dollar. Our out-of-sample analysis reveals that survey-based forecasts outperform the Driftless Random Walk (DRW) in terms of Mean Squared Prediction Error at several forecasting horizons. This result holds true even when comparing the survey to a more competitive benchmark based on a refined information set. A similar result is found when precision is measured in terms of Directional Accuracy: survey-based forecasts outperform a “pure luck” benchmark at several forecasting horizons. Differing from the traditional “no predictability” result reported in the literature for many exchange rates, our findings suggest that the Chilean peso is indeed predictable.
F37|Forecasting (Good and Bad) Realized Exchange-Rate Volatility: Is there a Role for Realized Skewness and Kurtosis?|This study investigates U.S. political cycles and the impact, thereof on stock market volatility in advanced economies (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland and the U.K.) using monthly data over the period January 1921 to December 2017. Overall, the results indicate that the type (Democratic or Republican) of presidential administration does play a role in the behaviour of stock returns, and volatility, but the results and direction of the impact are sample specific. In general, the results tend to suggest an increase in returns and volatility of other stock markets when there is a democratic government in the U.S. This study suggests that there is a need for market participants to start analysing the trajectory of a certain election, beginning at the proposed event window, in order to manage their risks and be at a stable position during these periods of uncertainties.
F37|The Fama 3 and Fama 5 factor models under a machine learning framework|We examine four empirical models which are popular in money and stock markets world. These models are Fama – French 3 & 5 factors model, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) model. These tools are intensively used by investors and market professionals as an important part of the investment decision process and for the evaluation of the applied investment strategies. The last years, several surveys and studies have done, and various methodologies were implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of these four models. The methodological approach of the current thesis focuses on the Support Vector Regression (SVR). This method is running in comparison with the Ordinary Least Squares linear regression.
F37|Explaining Exchange Rate Movements Using Yield Curves in Emerging Countries|Economic agents and policymakers need to understand the factors that determine the exchange rates in order to make decisions to maximize individual and collective wealth respectively. This paper attempts to explain the movements of major emerging country exchange rates adopting a theory based approach. This approach is based on two major concepts of financial economics, the Uncovered Interest Parity condition and the yield curve. Instead of estimating a UIP regression using some interest rate differential at a specific maturity, we use information from the whole term structure. Using Nelson-Siegel parameters extracted from the yield curve differentials as explanatory variables, we estimate GARCH(1,1) models to predict exchange rate movements of 7 major emerging countries. Our findings indicate that yield curves are useful in explaining exchange rate movements. Rising local interest rates lead to local currency appreciation contrary to the UIP condition. Steeper yield curve causes local currency appreciation in some emerging countries and depreciation in others. Effects of the yield curve parameters are generally stronger at longer horizons implying that UIP does not become valid even in the long run. Finally several robustness checks indicate that these results are robust to data frequency, sample period and yield curve characterization methodology.
F37|Financial Cycles Around the World|The study analyses ﬁnancial cycles based on a global sample of 34 advanced and developing countries over the period 1960Q1 to 2015Q4. We use dynamic factor models and state-space techniques to estimate ﬁnancial cycles in credit, housing, bond and equity markets, as well as aggregate ﬁnancial cycles for each country in the sample using a large number of variables conveying price, quantity and risk characteristics of respective markets. The analysis reveals the highly persistent and recurring nature of ﬁnancial cycles, which tend to ﬂuctuate at frequencies much lower than business cycles, 9‑15 years on average, and are indicative of major ﬁnancial distress episodes. Our results point to notable intra-regional synchronisation, as well as nontrivial co-movement tendencies between European, American and Asian ﬁnancial cycles. We also extract global and regional ﬁnancial cycles, the former closely associated with the dynamics of the US T-bill rate and the VIX index, conﬁrming the existence of common supranational factors governing the boom-bust dynamics of ﬁnancial market activity around the world.
F37|Information Rigidities and Exchange Rate Expectations|Sluggish adjustment of expectations to new information is rational in an environment characterized by information costs and signal-to-noise problems. This paper investigates the role of such information rigidities for exchange rate expectations using data from Consensus Economics for eight emerging and industrial economies from 1999 until 2015. Our results provide strong support for this view showing that the inclusion of forecast updates largely accounts for otherwise detected biases in expectation errors. Moreover, we detect little evidence for a systematic effect of fundamentals or uncertainty measures on exchange rate disagreement. Structural shocks do not appear to lead to any systematic increase in disagreement which illustrates the importance of noisy information models.
F37|Asset price volatility in EU-6 economies: how large is the role played by the ECB?|In this paper we provide evidence that the effects of the different waves of asset purchase programmes implemented by the ECB from 2009 onwards have spilled over into asset price volatility developments of a group of six Central and Eastern European economies belonging to the EU but not to the euro area. This has partly shielded their financial markets from the negative shocks that have influenced international investors’ degree of risk aversion in recent years. By means of a dynamic conditional correlation multivariate GARCH model, and by resorting to three different proxies to describe the functioning and measure the impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes, we show that such non-standard monetary measures have played a significant role in dampening volatility spikes in the financial markets of the countries at stake. This probably reflects how both a ‘risk taking’ and a ‘liquidity’ channel of transmission actually work. The results are generally robust to an extensive series of tests, and to changes made in the estimation methodology.
F37|Could this be a fiction? Bitcoin forecasts most tradable currency pairs better than ARFIMA|In this paper, we attempt to exploit any inherent useful information in Bitcoin to predict the future path of the most tradable currency pairs in the world. We also verify whether the forecast outcomes can compare favourably with the time series model such as the fractionally integrated autoregressive moving average (ARFIMA) model. We follow the Lewellen (2004) and Westerlund and Narayan (2102, 2015) approaches that account for any statistical effect that could bias the regression estimates. Our results suggest that Bitcoin is a good predictor of the selected currency pairs and more importantly, its forecast results outperform the time series model judging by the Diebold and Mariano test regardless of the data sample and forecast horizon. Although, recent evidence in the literature seems to suggest that the Bitcoin bubble will soon burst, its connection with the considered currency pairs may be exploited while it lasts.
F37|Predicting exchange rate with commodity prices: The role of structural breaks and asymmetries|In this paper, we offer new evidence on the predictability of exchange rate with commodity prices by accounting for the role of asymmetries and structural breaks. In particular, we evaluate whether such considerations matter for the forecast performance of the predictive model for exchange rate. We further account for any possible bias in estimation due to the presence of persistence, endogeneity and conditional heteroscedasticity effects in our predictors. Monthly data of five major tradable currency pairs in the world and disaggregated commodity price indices over the period of 1960 to 2017 are utilized. We find significant improvements in both the in-sample and out-of-sample forecast performance of the predictive model for exchange rate when asymmetries and structural breaks are accommodated. In addition, all the economic models considered with and without asymmetries and structural breaks offer superior forecast performance over the ARFIMA model. Our results are robust to alternative exchange rates and commodity price indices and different breaks, data samples and forecast horizons.
F37|Estimating a Latent Risk Premium in Exchange Rate Futures|Using exchange rates futures instead of forwards completes the maturity spectrum of the correlation between the spot return and the premium. The correlation decreases with increasing maturity, presumably due to a latent risk premium. We hypothesize that the influence of the unobserved risk factor has a contract-specific risk component. Our main contribution is to control for the omitted variable bias by using a modified version of the CCE panel estimator in combination with futures data. This renders the coefficient on the futures premium insignificantly different from one. Subsequently, the contract-specific part is related to conventional proxies of risk.
F37|Exchange rate forecasting on a napkin|This paper shows that there are two regularities in foreign exchange markets in advanced countries with flexible regimes. First, real exchange rates are mean-reverting, as implied by the Purchasing Power Parity model. Second, the adjustment takes place via nominal exchange rates. These features of the data can be exploited, even on the back of a napkin, to generate nominal exchange rate forecasts that outperform the random walk. The secret is to avoid estimating the pace of mean reversion and assume that relative prices are unchanged. Direct forecasting or panel data techniques are better than the random walk but fail to beat this simple calibrated model.
F37|Cross-country linkages and spill-overs in early warning models for financial crises|This paper uses data on bilateral foreign exposures of domestic banking systems in order to construct early warning models for financial crises that take into account cross-country spill-overs of vulnerabilities. The empirical results show that incorporating cross-country financial linkages can improve the signalling performance of early warning models. The relative usefulness increases from 65% to 87% and the AUROC from 0.89 to 0.97 when weighted foreign variables are added to domestic variables in a multivariate logit early warning model. The findings of the paper also suggest that global variables still play a role in predicting financial crises, even when foreign variables are controlled for, which could suggest that both cross-country spill-overs and contagion are important factors for driving financial crises. A parsimonious model with nine variables that combines domestic, foreign and global variables yields an out-of-sample relative usefulness of 0.82 with Type I and Type II errors of 0.11 and 0.07.

F37|The Quanto Theory of Exchange Rates|We present a new identity that relates expected exchange rate appreciation to a risk-neutral covariance term, and use it to motivate a currency forecasting variable based on the prices of quanto index contracts. We show via panel regressions that the quanto forecast variable is an economically and statistically significant predictor of currency appreciation and of excess returns on currency trades. Out of sample, the quanto variable outperforms predictions based on uncovered interest parity, on purchasing power parity, and on a random walk as a forecaster of differential (dollar-neutral) currency appreciation.
F37|Reputational risks, value of losses and financial sustainability of commercial banks|Currently, under the conditions of permanent financial risks that hamper the sustainable economic growth in the financial sector, the development of evaluation and risk management methods both regulated by Basel II and III and others seem to be of special importance. The reputation risk is one of significant risks affecting reliability and credibility of commercial banks. The importance of reputation risk management and the quality of their assessment remain relevant as the probability of decrease in or loss of business reputation influences the financial results and the degree of customersâ€™, partnersâ€™ and stakeholdersâ€™ confidence. By means of imitating modeling based on Bayesian Networks and the fuzzy data analysis, the article characterizes the mechanism of reputation risk assessment and possible losses evaluation in banks by plotting normal and lognormal distribution functions. Monte-Carlo simulation is used to calculate the probability of losses caused by reputation risks. The degree of standardized histogram similarity is determined on the basis of the fuzzy data analysis applying Hamming distance method. The tree-like hierarchy based on the OWA-operator is used to aggregate the data with Fishburne's coefficients as the convolution scales. The mechanism takes into account the impact of criteria, such as return on equity, goodwill value, the risk assets ratio, the share of the productive assets in net assets, the efficiency ratio of interest bearing liabilities, the risk ratio of credit operations, the funding ratio and reliability index on the business reputation of the bank. The suggested methods and recommendations might be applied to develop the decision-making mechanism targeted at the implementation of reputation risk management system in commercial banks as well as to optimize risk management technologies.
F37|Optimal vs satisfactory transparency: The impact of global macroeconomic fluctuations on corporate competitiveness|Being able to separate temporary global macroeconomic influences – caused by fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and inflation – from intrinsic performance – related to a superior product, production process or management – is crucial to assessing the development of a firm’s competiveness. Against that background, this paper analyzes institutions’ role in making firms supply outside shareholders with relevant information corresponding to satisfactory transparency from the shareholder perspective. Based on a sample of the 100 largest public European firms, it is found that no firm provided information to a level deemed satisfactory by the outside shareholder. One explanation may be that optimal transparency for the firm does not equal satisfactory transparency for the outside shareholder. However, the implementation of IFRS/IAS 1 in the EU as of 2005 and a company’s international cross-listing activities exhibit associations with a better supply of information and a narrowing of the gap. Shareholders in the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance system are provided with more relevant information than those in other corporate governance systems. The paper adds to the literature on the role of institutions in international corporate governance, with a particular focus on information asymmetries in an international business context.
F37|Volatility risk premia and future commodity returns|This paper extends the empirical literature on volatility risk premium (VRP) and future returns by analyzing the predictive ability of commodity currency VRP and commodity VRP. The empirical evidence throughout this paper provides support for a positive relationship of commodity currencies VRP and future commodity returns, but only for the period after the 2008 global financial crisis. This predictability survives the inclusion of control variables like equity VRP and past currency returns. Furthermore, gold VRP also has the ability to predict future commodity returns. However, this predictability is restricted to precious metals when control variables are considered.
F37|What drives gross flows in equity and investment fund shares in Luxembourg?|The paper analyses gross portfolio investment flows in equity and investment fund shares (EIFS) in Luxembourg - a small open economy with a financial center - over the period 2002Q1- 2016Q3. The statistical analysis shows that gross EIFS flows exhibit similar patterns over time amongst resident investors and non-resident investors. However, the volatility of EIFS flows instigated by non-resident investors is larger than the volatility of EIFS flows initiated by resident investors. The graphical analysis provides evidence that gross EIFS flows switch between positive and negative growth cycles whose durations vary over time, depending on macroeconomic, financial and geopolitical shocks at the global level. In particular, gross EIFS flows correlate positively with stock returns and negatively with risk/uncertainty measures at the global level. Sudden and sharp increases (decreases) in gross EIFS flows concur with periods of bullish (bearish) equity markets and low (heightened) risk aversion. Econometric tests show that gross EIFS flows (including extreme movements) are driven by macroeconomic and financial variables at the global level. Eventually, a prediction exercise suggests that it is difficult to forecast extreme movements in gross EIFS flows based on global macroeconomic and financial variables.
F37|The discontinuation of the EUR/CHF minimum exchange rate in January 2015: was it expected?|We derive risk-neutral probability densities for future euro/Swiss franc exchange rates as implied by option prices. We find that the credibility of the Swiss franc floor somewhat decreased as the spot exchange rate approached the lower bound of 1.20 CHF per euro. We also compare the forecasting performance of a random walk benchmark model with an error-correction model (ECM) augmented with option-implied break probabilities of breaching the currency floor. We find some evidence that the augmented ECM has an informational advantage over the random walk when using one-month break probabilities. But we find that one-month option-implied densities cannot predict the entire range of exchange rate realizations.
F37|The October 2016 sterling flash episode: when liquidity disappeared from one of the world’s most liquid markets|This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the evolution of liquidity during the flash episode in sterling during the early hours of 7 October 2016. It examines a number of estimates both of the cost of trading, and the price impact of executed transactions. These include a variant of the ‘volatility over volume’ measure of liquidity based on transaction data, which provides a better proxy of illiquidity — as given by measures based on high-frequency limit order book data — than other summary measures of price impact. The paper also shows that the fall in the value of sterling during the initial part of the flash episode was consistent with the estimated impact on prices of a large number of individually small — but in aggregate large — volume of orders to sell sterling during a normally quiet period of the trading day. However, the subsequent change in price was larger than that consistent with the estimated impact on prices of observed orders to sell sterling. This might support the suggestion, which was included in the report on the episode provided by the Bank for International Settlements, that the move in sterling may have been amplified by the pause in trading on the CME futures exchange.
F37|The information content in the offshore Renminbi foreign-exchange option market : Analytics and implied USD/CNH densities|In line with the deepening of the derivative foreign-exchange market in Hong Kong, we recover risk-neutral probability densities for future US dollar/offshore renminbi exchange rates as implied by exchange rate option prices. The risk-neutral densities (RND) approach is shown to be useful in analyzing market sentiment and risk aversion in the renminbi market. We include a forecasting exercise that confirms market participants were able to forecast the shape of the actual densities correctly for short horizons, even if their exact location could not be determined.
F37|On corporate borrowing, credit spreads and economic activity in emerging economies: An empirical investigation|We document a considerable increase in foreign financing by the corporate sector in emerging economies (EMEs) since the early 2000s, mainly in the form of bond issuance, and claim that it has opened up an important channel by which external financial factors can drive economic activity in these economies. Such claim is substantiated by a strong negative relationship between economic activity and an external financial indicator that we construct for several EMEs using micro-level data on spreads of bonds issued by EMEs' corporations in foreign capital markets. Three salient features characterize such a negative relationship. First, the financial indicator has considerable predictive power on future economic activity in these economies, even after controlling for other potential drivers of business cycles such as movements in sovereign spreads and global financial risk, among others. Second, on average, an identified adverse shock to the financial indicator generates a large and protracted fall of real output growth in these economies, and up to 14% of its forecast error variance is associated to this shock. Lastly, fluctuations in this indicator also respond strongly to shocks in global financial risk emanating from world capital markets, thereby implying that changes in corporate spreads also serve as a powerful propagating mechanism of the effect of changes in global investors' risk appetite in emerging markets.
F37|A semiparametric nonlinear quantile regression model for financial returns|Accurately measuring and forecasting value-at-risk (VaR) remains a challenging task at the heart of financial economic theory. Recently, quantile regression models have been used successfully to capture the conditional quantiles of returns and to forecast VaR accurately. In this paper, we further explore nonlinearities in data and propose to couple realized measures with the nonlinear quantile regression framework to explain and forecast the conditional quantiles of financial returns. The nonlinear quantile regression models are implied by the copula specifications and allow us to capture possible nonlinearities, tail dependence, and asymmetries in the conditional quantiles of financial returns. Using high frequency data that covers most liquid US stocks in seven sectors, we provide ample evidence of asymmetric conditional dependence with different levels of dependence, which are characteristic for each industry. The backtesting results of estimated VaR favour our approach.
F37|A dynamic IS-LM-X model of exchange rate adjustments and movements|This paper contributes to the literature through developing a model of exchange rate adjustments in a dynamic IS-LM-X analytical framework. Our new model, in particular, a) makes the IS-LM model dynamic; b) endogenizes the exchange rate and price variables and; c) extends the dynamic IS and LM components into the external sector in an open economy that evolves over time. The effect of a change in monetary policy on the exchange rate is evaluated and the trajectory towards its new long-run equilibrium level is projected. These are in contrast to the traditional monetary models of exchange rate determination and adjustments that play primarily with the LM component of the IS-LM framework in discrete steps. Effects of interest rate parity and purchasing power parity are then scrutinized, ranging from the short-term to the long-run continuously. The study has profound policy implications, especially in an era of quantitative easing.
F37|¿Hubo contagio financiero en las crisis financieras recientes? Una aplicación DCC-M-GARCH para Argentina, Brasil, Colombia y Estados Unidos|El presente trabajo estudia la hipótesis de contagio financiero para las economías de Argentina, Brasil, Colombia y Estados Unidos durante el 16 de enero de 2008 hasta el 26 de octubre de 2016. Para modelar las interrelaciones entre los índices bursátiles de estos países se utilizó un modelo DCC M-GARCH (1,1). Los resultados muestran evidencia estadística a favor de la hipótesis de contagio financiero en la crisis sub-prime del 2008 y la crisis de la deuda soberana europea de 2011, mientras que, se rechaza para la crisis de la deuda soberana argentina de 2014.
F37|Estructura de varianzas entre el mercado financiero mundial y de Colombia|Este trabajo tiene como objetivo analizar, a través de un análisis econométrico de las series de tiempo de los índices de Morgan Stanley en los últimos 5 años, las variaciones de los precios de los títulos de valor que cotizan en el mercado bursátil de Colombia y su comportamiento con respecto al resto del mundo. Con este propósito, se estimará un modelo DCC GARCH y se realizará una inspección en las cuentas de la balanza de pagos para explicar sus fluctuaciones. Los resultados obtenidos apuntan hacia una baja integración del país al mercado financiero mundial como resultado de la disminución en la entrada de capitales durante el periodo observado.
F37|Forecasting the return volatility of European equity markets under different market conditions:A GARCH-MIDAS approach|In this paper, we employ the GARCH-MIDAS modelling framework to forecast the return volatility of the European equity markets on the basis of the predictive powers of such macroeconomic information as realised volatility, the level of economic activities and macroeconomic uncertainty. We distinctly evaluate the behaviour of the return volatilities under different market conditions designated as â€žPre Euro Regime,â€Ÿ â€žEuro /Pre-GFC Regime,â€Ÿ and â€žEuro/Post-GFC Regimeâ€Ÿ. Our findings show that the macroeconomic information considered in the model are good predictors of the return volatility of the European equity markets. Also, the in-sample and out-of-sample forecast results of these predictors are sensitive to data sample and the market conditions.
F37|How are Africa's emerging stock markets related to advanced markets? Evidence from copulas|The finance literature provides ample evidence that diversification benefits hinges on dependence between assets returns. A notable feature of the recent financial crisis is the extent to which assets that had hitherto moved mostly independently suddenly moved together resulting in joint losses in most advanced markets. This provides grounds to uncover the relative potential of African markets to provide diversification benefits by means of their correlation with advanced markets. Therefore, we examine the dependence structure between advanced and emerging African stock markets using copulas. Several findings are documented. First, dependence is time-varying and weak for most African markets, except South Africa. Second, we find evidence of asymmetric dependence, suggesting that stock return comovement varies in bearish and bullish markets. Third, extreme downward stock price movements in the advanced markets do not have significant spillover effects on Africa’s emerging stock markets. Our results, implying that African markets, with the exception of South Africa, are immune to risk spillover from advanced markets, improves the extant literature and have implications for portfolio diversification and risk management.
F37|Asset price targeting in an open economy with cognitive limitations: The best for macroeconomic and financial stability?|The choices of policy targets and the formation of agent expectations have been critical issues addressed by monetary policy management since the financial crisis of 2008. This paper evaluates macroeconomic stability in a new Keynesian open economy in which agents experience both cognitive limitations and asset market volatility. The (im)perfect credibility of various monetary policies (e.g., a Taylor-type rule with- or without asset price targeting, strict domestic inflation targeting, strict CPI inflation targeting, and exchange rate peg) may lead agents to react according to their expectation rules, and thus create various degrees of booms and busts in output and inflation. Simulations confirm that a Taylor-type CPI inflation targeting including an asset price target is the best choice. In contrast, the business cycles induced by Keynesian “animal spirits” are enhanced by strict inflation targeting. Furthermore, a credible exchange rate pegging system with an international reserve pooling arrangement can improve social welfare and stability in an open economy, even though its absolute value of the loss function is slightly lower than a Taylor-type CPI inflation targeting including an asset price target.
F37|Assessing contagion risk from energy and non-energy commodity markets|The aim of this study is to investigate contagion risk from commodity markets towards the whole economy and across sectors. Indeed, the financialization and integration of commodity markets expose the economy to potential contagion risks i.e., adverse shocks hitting one or more commodity markets spread to the entire economic system. To this purpose, we use the delta Conditional Value-at-Risk (ΔCoVaR) approach based on quantile regression to identify a measure of contagion risk for energy, food and metals commodity markets. This novel methodology allows us to detect whether the risk contribution for a given market is significant, while distinguishing between tail events driven by financial factors, economic fundamentals or both. Furthermore, it permits us to assess whether the contagion risk of one market is significantly larger than the one of another market. The results show that commodity markets generate contagion risks which are mainly triggered by financial factors for energy and metal markets and by financial and economic fundamentals for food markets. Oil market contributes more to contagion than metal and food markets. Moreover, it emerges that there are spillovers from energy to food markets and oil is also more important than biofuel in affecting food markets.
F37|Predicting sovereign debt crises: An Early Warning System approach|In light of the renewed challenge to construct effective “Early Warning Systems” for sovereign debt crises, we empirically evaluate the predictive power of econometric models developed so far across developed and emerging country regions. We propose a different specification of the crisis variable that allows for the prediction of new crisis onsets as well as duration, and develop a more powerful dynamic-recursive forecasting technique to generate more accurate out-of-sample warning signals of sovereign debt crises. Our results are shown to be more accurate compared to the ones found in the existing literature.
F37|A dynamic IS-LM-X model of exchange rate adjustments and movements|This paper contributes to the literature through developing a model of exchange rate adjustments in a dynamic IS-LM-X analytical framework. Our new model, in particular, a) makes the IS-LM model dynamic; b) endogenizes the exchange rate and price variables and; c) extends the dynamic IS and LM components into the external sector in an open economy that evolves over time. The effect of a change in monetary policy on the exchange rate is evaluated and the trajectory towards its new long-run equilibrium level is projected. These are in contrast to the traditional monetary models of exchange rate determination and adjustments that play primarily with the LM component of the IS-LM framework in discrete steps. Effects of interest rate parity and purchasing power parity are then scrutinized, ranging from the short-term to the long-run continuously. The study has profound policy implications, especially in an era of quantitative easing.
F37|Modeling systemic risk and dependence structure between oil and stock markets using a variational mode decomposition-based copula method|This study combines the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method and static and time-varying symmetric and asymmetric copula functions to examine the dependence structure between crude oil prices and major regional developed stock markets (S&P500, stoxx600, DJPI and TSX indexes) during bear, normal and bull markets under different investment horizons. Furthermore, it analyzes the upside and downside short- and long-run risk spillovers between oil and stock markets by quantifying three market risk measures, namely the value at risk (VaR), conditional VaR (CoVaR) and the delta CoVaR (∆CoVaR). The results show that there is a tail dependence between oil and all stock markets for the raw return series. By considering time horizons, we show that there is an average dependence between the considered markets for the short-run horizons. However, the tail dependence is also found for the long-run horizons between the oil and stock markets, with the exception of the S&P500 index which exhibits average dependence with the oil market. Moreover, we find strong evidence of up and down risk asymmetric spillovers from oil to stock markets and vice versa in the short-and long run horizons. Finally, the market risk spillovers are asymmetric over the time and investment horizons.
F37|Dynamic information spillovers in intraregionally-focused spot and forward currency markets|This paper proposes an intraregionally-focused tri-currency modeling framework to investigate dynamic information spillovers across spot and forward exchange rate markets in frontier and emerging country currencies, for both price levels and volatilities. Empirical estimates of structural parameters were obtained using an MGARCH–MSKST model that incorporated the term structure of non-deliverable forward (NDF) and deliverable forward (DF) markets, the dominance of regional currencies, and the influence of differing forward contract maturities (1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months). The currencies for nine countries were grouped into three regions: Northeast Asia (China, Korea and Taiwan); South/Southeast Asia (India, Indonesia and Philippines); and Latin America (Brazil, Chile and Columbia). The currency for each selected country was evaluated within the regionally determined tri-currency system. We found that NDF markets play a dominant role over DF markets with regard to price discovery during periods of tranquility. During periods of crisis, both NDF and DF markets exhibit a more balanced impact on currency market price discovery mechanisms. In addition, distinct differences were observed across regions: currencies in Northeast Asia were shown to be affected by the Chinese renminbi during periods of crisis and the Indian rupee could be regarded as the dominant currency in South/Southeast Asia. No robust results were obtained with regard to the dominance of currencies in Latin America. Finally, our results also suggest important distinctions between the effect of various instrument maturities on NDF and DF market returns – with DF returns being more responsive to longer maturities (6-months and 12-months). During tranquil periods NDF returns are more responsive to shorter maturities, but during crisis periods this effect is diminished.
F37|The impact of uncertainty on professional exchange rate forecasts|This paper analyzes the role of uncertainty on both exchange rate expectations and forecast errors of professionals for four major currencies based on survey data provided by FX4casts. We consider economic policy, macroeconomic, and financial uncertainty as well as disagreement among CPI inflation forecasters to account for different dimensions of uncertainty. Based on a Bayesian VAR approach, we observe that uncertainty effects on forecast errors of professionals turn out to be more significant compared to the adjustment of exchange rate expectations. Our findings are robust to different forecasting horizons and point to an unpredictable link between exchange rates and fundamentals. Furthermore, we illustrate the importance of considering common unpredictable components for a large number of variables. We also focus on the post-crisis period and the relationship between uncertainty and disagreement among exchange rate forecasters and identify a strong relationship between them.
F37|Sudden stops of capital flows to emerging markets: A new prediction approach|In this paper, we propose a new prediction approach for forecasting sudden stop events of capital flows to emerging countries. The new approach is to combine conventional approaches (signal extraction and statistical regression approaches) to maintain their advantages. We apply the new approach as well as conventional approaches to actual data and conduct prediction performance comparisons. The empirical results show that the new approach significantly improves prediction ability. The new approach is proven to have some potential merit as an alternative approach to improving prediction ability and can also be applied to various types of financial crisis events.
F37|Money Demand in China: A Meta-Study|In this paper we reexamine the literature on money demand in China published both in English and Chinese language. Over the past 30 years - starting with the paper by Chow (1987) there has been a regular stream of papers assessing the Chinese money demand function. The literature is mostly focusing on income elasticity, stability, and - which is special for China - the adequate choice and quality of data. In particular regarding stability of money demand, we find a substantial publication bias towards rejecting stability. When controlling for publication bias, and focusing on longer time periods, our paper strongly suggests stable long run money demand in China.
F37|International Transmission of Japanese Monetary Shocks Under Low and Negative Interest Rates: A Global Favar Approach|We examine the implications of Japanese monetary shocks under recent very low and sometimes negative interest rates to the Japanese economy as well as three of its major trading partners: Korea, China and the United States. We follow the literature in using movements in 2-year Japanese government bond rates as proxies for changes in monetary conditions in the neighborhood of the zero lower bound. We examine the implications of shocks to the 2-year rate in a series of factor-augmented vector autoregressive—or FAVAR—models, in which both local and global conditions are proxied by latent factors generated from domestic economic indicators and weighted indicators of major trading partners, respectively. Our results suggest that shocks to 2-year Japanese rates do have substantive impacts on Japanese economic activity and inflation in conditions of low or even negative short-term rates. However, we find only modest global spillovers from Japanese monetary policy shocks, as their impact on the economic conditions of major Japanese trading partners is muted, particularly relative to the impact of innovations in 2-year U.S. Treasury yields over the same period.
F37|A Theory of Currency Unions and Equity Price Shocks|This paper investigates the effects of financial shocks on per capita national income of multiple currency unions in different geographic locations. Though exposure to financial market shock is hardly considered and not generally measured as an important convergence criterion for unionization, currency unions are generally formed to attain greater regional and global economic integration. As a general theory, this paper finds that shocks to equity prices have imprecise implications for the performance of currency unions with divergent sources of income, different currency arrangements, evolutionary trade alliances, and unequal financial exposure. Specifically, historical alliances, geographic proximity, or even union membership, may not provide sufficient explanation for income volatility in currency unions after an exposure to equity price shocks. By utilizing annual time series data without seasonal adjustments to decompose variances, this paper finds that changes in equity prices may not significantly account for the volatility in per capita income of currency unions with weak intra-union trading patterns and less stringent currency arrangements.
F37|Winning Investment Strategies Based on Financial Crisis Indicators|The aim of this work is to create systematic trading strategies built upon several financial crisis indicators based on the spectral properties of market dynamics. Within the limitations of our framework and data, we will demonstrate that our systematic trading strategies are able to make money, not as a result of pure luck but, in a reproducible way and while avoiding the pitfall of over fitting, as a result of the skill of the operators and their understanding and knowledge of the financial market. Using singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques in order to compute all spectra in an efficient way, we have built two kinds of financial crisis indicators with a demonstrable power of prediction. Firstly, there are those that compare at every date the distribution of the eigenvalues of a covariance or correlation matrix to a distribution of reference representing either a calm or agitated market reference. Secondly, we have those that merely compute at every date a chosen spectral property (trace, spectral radius or Frobenius norm) of a covariance or correlation matrix. Aggregating the signals provided by all the indicators in order to minimize false positive errors, we then build systematic trading strategies based on a discrete set of rules governing the investment decisions of the investor. Finally, we compare our active strategies to a passive reference as well as to random strategies in order to prove the usefulness of our approach and the added value provided by the out-of-sample predictive power of the financial crisis indicators upon which our systematic trading strategies are built
F37|Identifying Exchange Rate Common Factors|Using recently developed model selection procedures, we determine that exchange rate returns are driven by a two‐factor model. We identify them as a dollar factor and a euro factor. Exchange rates are thus driven by global, U.S., and euro‐zone stochastic discount factors. The identified factors can also be given a risk‐based interpretation. Identification motivates multilateral models for bilateral exchange rates. Out‐of‐sample forecast accuracy of empirically identified multilateral models dominates the random walk and a bilateral purchasing power parity fundamentals prediction model. Twenty‐four‐month‐ahead forecast accuracy of the multilateral model dominates those of a principal components forecasting model.
F37|Nowcasting Building Permits with Google Trends|We propose a useful way to predict building permits in the US, exploiting rich real-time data from web search queries. The time series on building permits is usually considered as a leading indicator of economic activity in the construction sector. Nevertheless, new data on building permits are released with a lag close to two months. Therefore, an accurate now-cast of this leading indicator is desirable. We show that models including Google search queries nowcast and forecast better than our good, not naïve, univariate benchmarks both in-sample and out-of-sample. We also show that our results are robust to different specifications, the use of rolling or recursive windows and, in some cases, to the forecasting horizon. Since Google queries information is free, our approach is a simple and inexpensive way to predict building permits in the United States.
F37|A Power Booster Factor for Out-of-Sample Tests of Predictability|In this paper we introduce a “power booster factor” for out-of-sample tests of predictability. The relevant econometric environment is one in which the econometrician wants to compare the population Mean Squared Prediction Errors (MSPE) of two models: one big nesting model, and another smaller nested model. Although our factor can be used to improve the power of many out-of-sample tests of predictability, in this paper we focus on boosting the power of the widely used test developed by Clark and West (2006, 2007). Our new test multiplies the Clark and West t-statistic by a factor that should be close to one under the null hypothesis that the short nested model is the true model, but that should be greater than one under the alternative hypothesis that the big nesting model is more adequate. We use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the size and power of our approach. Our simulations reveal that the new test is well sized and powerful. In particular, it tends to be less undersized and more powerful than the test by Clark and West (2006, 2007). Although most of the gains in power are associated to size improvements, we also obtain gains in size-adjusted power. Finally we present an empirical application in which more rejections of the null hypothesis are obtained with our new test.
F37|An Empirical Study of Japanese and South Korean Exchange Rates Using the Sticky-Price Monetary Theory|Researchers have studied connections between exchange rates and macroeconomic variables for developed and emerging market economies. However, few address whether relationships differ by market classification. This study examines the impact that macroeconomic variables in the sticky-price monetary theory has on exchange rates for Japan and South Korea. Results show money supply and inflation differentials constitute a significant impact for South Korea, whereas no macroeconomic variable within the model had a significant impact on Japan. In addition, the autoregressive error analyses yielded small coefficients for South Korea. Given those estimates and low error variance, the study suggest there may not be a significant difference in how the sticky-price monetary theory predicts exchange rates by market classification. Therefore, firms may use forecasting techniques similarly between developed and emerging market economies.
F37|Taxi, Takeoff and Landing: Behavioural Patterns of Capital Flows to Emerging Markets|This paper analyses volatility, persistence, predictability, correlation, comovement (or contagion risk) and sudden stop (reversibility) of capital flows (foreign direct investment (FDI), foreign portfolio equity investment, long-term and short-term debt flows) using time series econometric techniques for 24 emerging economies over 1970-2014. This is informative on the pattern and relationship between capital inflows, with implications for accommodating macroeconomic policies in countries receiving inflows. The paper also addresses the predictions of conventional theory, that differences are associated with the maturity of the capital (long-term vs. short-term), with the information based trade-off model of Goldstein and Razin (2006), that differences are associated with the structure of the capital (equity vs. debt). In line with the latter, equity flows (FDI and portfolio) are less volatile and persistent, more predictable and less susceptible to sudden stops than debt flows. Contrary to conventional theory, short-term flows are not more volatile, but there is evidence that correlations and risks of contagion are strong within all capital flow components.
F37|Exchange Market Pressure and Monetary Policies in ASEAN5|The aim of this research is to analyze the relationship between Exchange Market Pressure (EMP) and monetary policies in ASEAN5 (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore). This research applies Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) and monthly data for the periods January 2006 – December 2016 for individual country estimation. The results show that the ASEAN5 monetary authorities have responded the increase of EMP by contracting domestic credit in the non-crisis periods, and by providing more liquidity to the bank system in the crisis periods. In addition, in the case of ASEAN5 the increase in interest rate differential has reduced the EMP.
F37|The Programmable Economy: Envisaging an Entire Planned Economic System as a Single Computer through Blockchain Networks|Since the dawn of the concept of nation-states, many nations have been planning their economies to increase people’s prosperity and standard of living. All economies have a centralized feature where decisions are taken. But data collection and plan implementation has been cumbersome because of the manual nature of economic planning. Centralized systems, even when digitized, are prone to single point failures. Controlled Blockchains allow for an economic system to be decentralized, yet having central supervision i.e. quasi-decentralization. This paper deals with shifting a national economy to a network of Blockchains and creating a Programmable Economy (P.E) where the whole economic system behaves like a single computer, taking in certain inputs and providing the desired outputs. We discuss the various factors that are needed to bring about such a transformation. We also analyse the impact this will have on various aspects of the economy and people’s lives. Finally the paper concludes by summarizing the purpose, methodology and impact of a Programmable Economy (P.E).
F37|On the difficulty of interpreting market behaviour in an uncertain world: the case of oil futures pricing between 2003 and 2016|Our results show that over the two cycles that characterize the 2003-2016 period a significant change in the working of oil markets occurs. Our pricing investigation,based on a three-agent model (hedgers, fundamentalist speculators and chartists),find that from 2009 onwards traditional analysis of supply and demand forecasts, loses its explanatory power and hence its credibility. The sharp and unexpected fluctuations in oil prices, compounded by unpredictable political factors and technological break-troughs (e.g. tight sands/shale oil) strongly raises uncertainty and reduces the effectiveness of customary forecasting techniques.
F37|What Drives Gross Flows in Equity and Investment Fund Shares in Luxembourg?|The paper analyses gross portfolio investment flows in equity and investment fund shares (EIFS) in Luxembourg - a small open economy with a financial center - over the period 2002Q1-2016Q3. The statistical analysis shows that gross EIFS flows exhibit similar patterns over time amongst resident and non-resident investors. However, the volatility of EIFS flows instigated by non-resident investors is larger than the volatility of EIFS flows initiated by resident investors. The graphical analysis provides evidence that gross EIFS flows switch between positive and negative growth cycles whose durations vary over time, depending on macroeconomic, financial and geopolitical shocks at the global level. In particular, gross EIFS flows correlate positively with stock returns and negatively with risk/uncertainty measures at the global level. Sudden and sharp increases (decreases) in gross EIFS flows concur with periods of bullish (bearish) equity markets and low (heightened) risk aversion. Econometric tests show that gross EIFS flows (including extreme movements) are driven by macroeconomic and financial variables at the global level. Eventually, a prediction exercise suggests that it is difficult to forecast extreme movements in gross EIFS flows based on global macroeconomic and financial variables.
F37|Exchange rate volatility: A forecasting approach of using the ARCH family along with ARIMA SARIMA and semi-structural-SVAR in Turkey|The ability to predict the volatility of Exchange rate is an enormous challenge when it comes to economic and financial considerations. In this context, it is important to be able to predict the exchange rate volatility in financial markets and the world economy. This paper proposes a heightened approach to modeling and forecasting of exchange rate volatility in Turkey. For past recent years, Turkey experienced political turbulence that the possibility of effecting exchange rate, thus create uncertainty volatility of exchange rate. Therefore daily exchange rate data have been taken from 2005-2017 and applied autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity ARCH and GARCH families (EGARCH, IGARCH, and PARCH) to forecast exchange rate volatility. The proposed methodology able to calculate the breakpoint by including dummy variables. The result is more confined after including dummy that EGARCH (1,1) is best performing to forecast exchange rate volatility and successfully overcome the leverage effect on the exchange rate. Moreover, this paper also investigates the monthly data forecasting by applying ARIMA SARIMA along with SVAR technique for next few months. And Exchange rate pass-through also encounter it, which indicates the pass-through is more pronounced in PPI than CPI. The forecast result of SARIMA and SVAR distribute the same direction of fluctuation in the exchange rate that is declining of the current exchange rate in the future. However, ARIMA’s forecast tends to increase and different with two models.
F37|The Prediction of Earnings Movement Using Mandated XBRL data ? Industry Analysis|The immediate availability and easy accessibility of the XBRL filings will allow researchers and investors, especially small investors, to implement investment strategies based on this information. The objective of this study is to examine whether previous studies, predicting the direction of movement of earnings, are still relevant when using the newly SEC required, XBRL database (standardized financial reporting system). The study analyzes NYSE companies' XBRL quarterly data, from 2011 to 2015, using a two-step Logit regression model. The model is then used to arrive at the probability of the directional movement of earnings between current quarter and subsequent quarter, adjusted for a drift. Additional models are created by dividing the sample into industry membership (based on SIC codes).The results classified the companies as ones that would realize an increase in earnings or a decrease in earnings. The final model indicated a significant ability to predict subsequent earnings changes. The predictions appear to be correct on average about 70.7% of the time (higher than those of previous studies based on COMPUSTAT). The industry based models, although do not increase the accuracy of the model (an average of 68%) do increase the portfolio size. In other words, the model, based on industry, is able to classify more companies with a higher probability.These results suggest that XBRL data can be used as a means for forecasting movements in earnings, and creating a profitable investment strategy.
F37|Financial Cycles in Credit, Housing and Capital Markets: Evidence from Systemic Economies|The study estimates aggregate financial cycles and segment-specific cycles for credit, equity, bond and housing markets of the USA, the UK, Germany and Japan over the period 1960-2015 using dynamic factor models with state-space techniques based on a range of variables conveying market price, quantity and risk dynamics. The analysis reveals a highly persistent and recurring nature of financial cycles reflecting the build-up of financial imbalances in each segment with an estimated average cycle duration of about ten years. The significant co-movements and spillovers that we find among many of the segment-specific cycles suggest that well-diversified financial systems are prone to the risks associated with the mutual amplification of nominal shocks via linkages between financial market segments, which needs to be taken into account in the design of policies addressing asset bubbles and financial imbalances.
F37|Predicting exchange rates in Asia: New insights on the accuracy of survey forecasts|This paper evaluates aggregated survey forecasts with forecast horizons of 3, 12, and 24 months for the exchange rates of the Chinese yuan, the Hong Kong dollar, the Japanese yen, and the Singapore dollar vis-à-vis the US dollar using common forecast accuracy measures. Additionally, the rationality of the exchange rate predictions are assessed utilizing tests for unbiasedness and efficiency. All investigated forecasts are irrational in the sense that the predictions are biased. However, these results are inconsistent with an alternative measure of rationality based on methods of applied time series analysis. Investigating the order of integration of the time series and using cointegration analysis, empirical evidence supports the conclusion that the majority of forecasts are rational. Regarding forerunning properties of the predictions, the results are less convincing, with shorter term forecasts for the tightly managed USD/CNY FX regime being one exception. As one important evaluation result, it can be concluded, that the currency regime matters for the quality of exchange rate forecasts.
F37|The effectiveness of seasonal investments in European Share Portfolios|In this paper, calendar seasonality patterns are examined from day-of-the-week effect across weekly patterns, monthly analysis and whole-year seasonal strategies such as Sell in May and Halloween effect. The analysis is done across six indices, DAX, MDAX, SDAX, Eurostoxx 50, Stoxx Europe Mid 200 and Stoxx Europe Small 200. The observation period is from 1990 to 2015. The evidence found in this paper cannot support the Monday effect across all Indices. The Sell in May effect and Halloween effect were found to be existent over the whole observation period and being mostly influenced by the absence of investment in August and September.
F37|Forecasting exchange rates: The time-varying relationship between exchange rates and Taylor rule fundamentals|There is empirical evidence for a time-varying relationship between exchange rates and fundamentals. Such a relationship with time-varying coefficients can be estimated by a Kalman filter model. A Kalman filter estimates the coefficients recursively depending on the prediction error of the examined model. Using a Taylor rule based exchange rate model, which in the literature was found to have promising forecasting abilities, it is possible to further improve the performance if the utilization of information from the prediction error is restricted. This is necessary as classic exchange rate models do not perform badly solely because they neglect the time-varying relationship, but also due to missing explanatory information. So, if the Kalman filter uses the entire information from the prediction error, it would overestimate the need for coefficient adjustment. With this calibration of the Kalman filter model the short-term out-ofsample forecasting accuracy can be enhanced for 10 out of 12 exchange rates.
F37|Rent-seeking in elite networks|We employ a unique dataset on members of an elite service club in Germany to investigate how social connections in elite networks affect the allocation of resources. Specifically, we investigate credit allocation decisions of banks to firms inside the network. Using a quasi-experimental research design, we document misallocation of bank credit inside the network, with bankers with weakly aligned incentives engaging most actively in crony lending. Our findings, thus, resonate with existing theories of elite networks as rent extractive coalitions that stifle economic prosperity.
F37|Forecasting the nominal exchange rate movements in a changing world. The case of the U.S. and the U.K|Exchange rate forecasting has become an arena for many researchers the last decades while predictability depends heavily on several factors such as the choice of the fundamentals, the econometric model and the data form. The aim of this paper is to assess whether modelling time-variation and other forms of instabilities may improve the forecasting performance of the models. Paper begins with a brief critical review of the recently developed exchange rate forecasting models and continues with a real-time forecasting race between our fundamentals-based models, a DSGE model, estimated with Bayesian techniques and the benchmark random walk model without drift. Results suggest that models accounting for non-linearities may generate poor forecasts relative to more parsimonious and linear models.
F37|A Reconsideration of the Meese-Rogoff Puzzle: An Alternative Approach to Model Estimation and Forecast Evaluation|This study revisits the Meese-Rogoff puzzle by estimating the traditional monetary models of exchange rate determination in state-space form and comparing the accuracy of these forecasts against the naïve random walk model using a wide range of conventional and alternative measures of forecasting accuracy. The results demonstrate that incorporating stochastic movements in the parameters of exchange rate models does not enable the Meese-Rogoff puzzle to be overturned. However, estimating these models in state-space form substantially improves forecasting accuracy to the extent that the model and random walk produce an equivalent magnitude of error. Furthermore, the results prove that the Meese-Rogoff puzzle can be overturned if the forecasts are evaluated by alternative criteria. These criteria include direction accuracy, profitability, and measures that jointly take into account both magnitude and direction accuracy.
F37|The impact of financial sanctions on the Russian economy|The paper looks into the impact of the Western financial sanctions on the Russian economy. The results of modeling of capital flow components (taking into account the influence of other factors, including the fall in oil prices) demonstrate that, apart from the direct effect of constraints on foreign funding for sanctioned state-controlled banks, oil, gas and arms companies, there is also a significant indirect effect of lower inflows of foreign direct investment and worsening funding conditions for non-sanctioned companies. The overall negative effect on gross capital inflow in 2014—2017 is estimated at about $280bn. However, the effect on net capital inflow is significantly lower ($160—170bn) thanks to self-adjustment of Russian companies evident in utilization of foreign assets accumulated earlier for debt repayment and overall decrease in gross capital outflow. The estimated sanctions’ effect on GDP is significant (–2.4 p.p. by 2017 as compared to hypothetical scenario without sanctions) but 3.3 times lower than the estimated effect of oil price shock.
F37|The impact of financial sanctions on the Russian economy|This paper examines the impact of the current Western financial sanctions on the Russian economy. Modeling the capital flow components (accounting for the influence of other factors, including falling oil prices) reveals that sanctions have directly affected sanctioned state-controlled banks, oil, gas and arms companies by severely constraining foreign funding and have indirectly affected non-sanctioned companies by reducing inflows of foreign direct investment and causing funding conditions to deteriorate. The overall negative effect on gross capital inflow over 2014–2017 is estimated at approximately $280bn. However, the effect on net capital inflow is significantly lower ($160–170bn) due to Russian companies’ self-adjustment, which is evidenced by their utilization of foreign assets accumulated earlier for debt repayment and an overall decrease in gross capital outflow. The sanctions’ estimated effect on GDP is significant (–2.4 p.p. by 2017, compared with a hypothetical scenario with no sanctions) but 3.3 times lower than the estimated effects of the oil price shock.
F37|Currency Premia and Global Imbalances|We show that a global imbalance risk factor that captures the spread in countries’ external imbalances and their propensity to issue external liabilities in foreign currency explains the cross-sectional variation in currency excess returns. The economic intuition is simple: net debtor countries offer a currency risk premium to compensate investors willing to finance negative external imbalances because their currencies depreciate in bad times. This mechanism is consistent with exchange rate theory based on capital flows in imperfect financial markets. We also find that the global imbalance factor is priced in cross-sections of other major asset markets. Received February 11, 2014; accepted January 25, 2016 by Editor Geert Bekaert.
F37|Econometric-wavelet prediction in spatial aspect|The aim of this article is the prediction of GDP Polish and other selected European countries. For this purpose integrated into one algorithm econometric methods and wavelet analysis. Econometric methods and wavelet transform are combined goal of constructing a copyright model for predicting macroeconomic indicators. In the article, for estimating the macroeconomic indicators on the example of GDP proposed authorial algorithm that combines the following methods: a method trend creep method of alignment exponential and analysis multiresolution. Used econometric methods, this is a trend crawling and alignment exponential have been modified in several major stages. The aim of the merger of these methods is the construction of algorithm to predict short-term time series. In the copyright algorithm was applied wavelet continuous compactly supported. wavelet used Daubechies. The Daubechies wavelets, are a family of orthogonal wavelets and characterized by a maximal number of vanishing moments for some given support. With each wavelet type of this class, there is a scaling function which generates an orthogonal multiresolution analysis.
F37|Forecasting Daily Stock Volatility Using GARCH-CJ Type Models with Continuous and Jump Variation|In this paper we decompose the realized volatility of the GARCH-RV model into continuous sample path variation and discontinuous jump variation to provide a practical and robust framework for non-parametrically measuring the jump component in asset return volatility. By using 5-minute high-frequency data of MASI Index in Morocco for the period (January 15, 2010 - January 29, 2016), we estimate parameters of the constructed GARCH and EGARCH-type models (namely, GARCH, GARCH-RV, GARCH-CJ, EGARCH, EGARCH-RV, and EGARCH-CJ) and evaluate their predictive power to forecast future volatility. The results show that the realized volatility and the continuous sample path variation have certain predictive power for future volatility while the discontinuous jump variation contains relatively less information for forecasting volatility. More interestingly, the findings show that the GARCH-CJ-type models have stronger predictive power for future volatility than the other two types of models. These results have a major contribution in financial practices such as financial derivatives pricing, capital asset pricing, and risk measures.
F37|Nonlinear Trend and Purchasing Power Parity|After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the evidence on the purchasing power parity (PPP) in the long run is still a matter of debate. The difficulties of the problem are the possible nonstationarity of relative price indices and nominal exchange rates. The traditional ways to deal with nonstationarity such as unit root model and cointegration have some problems. In this paper, to deal with nonstationarity, we apply the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) trend-cycle filter in real business cycle literature (Hodrick and Prescott, 1981) which can give a nonlinear smooth-trend, and we find that after the 1970s float, the monthly HP trends of US dollar/UK sterling and Deutsche marks/US dollar have certain relevance with their corresponding HP trends of relative consumer price indices. This result indicates that there is no strong evidence to directly deny that the PPP is valid in the long run. In this sense, it is not reliable to directly deny the belief of monetary neutrality.
F37|International equity markets interdependence: bigger shocks or contagion in the 21st century?|Abstract We investigate the nature of shocks across international equity markets and evaluate the shifts in their comovements at business-cycle frequency. By using a parsimonious “identification through heteroskedasticity” methodology, we compute the impact exposures of index returns to common and country-specific shocks. We then establish some key results regarding comovement amongst international returns and macroeconomic fluctuations over the last decades. First, across all indices, persistent spells of high-volatility and high cross-market correlation always coincide with macroeconomic slowdowns and with measured shifts in macroeconomic and financial uncertainty. Second, there is a rise in the observed responses of international stock returns to common shocks during turbulent periods; however, such increase is largely attributable to bigger shocks (heteroskedasticity of fundamentals) rather than to breaks in the transmission mechanism or increased structural interdependence between markets. This holds for the Great Financial Crisis too. Third, since around the turn of the millennium, returns have more often experienced high volatility and comovement, likely because of larger and persistent macroeconomic disturbances.
F37|Econometric modeling of exchange rate determinants by market classification: An empirical analysis of Japan and South Korea using the sticky-price monetary theory|Numerous researchers have studied the connection between exchange rate fluctuations and macroeconomic variables for various market economies. Few studies, however, have addressed whether these relationships may differ based on the market classification of the given economy. This study examined the impact on exchange rates for Japan (a proxy for developed economies) and South Korea (a proxy for emerging economies) yielding from the macroeconomic variables of the sticky-price monetary model between February 1, 1989 and February 1, 2015. The results show that money supply and inflation constituted a significant, but small, influence on South Korean exchange rate movements, whereas no macroeconomic variable within the model had a significant impact on Japanese exchange rates fluctuations. The results of the autoregressive error analyses suggest small variances in the affect that macroeconomic variables may have on developed versus emerging market economies. This may provide evidence that firms may use similar forecasting techniques for emerging market currencies as used with developed market currencies.
F37|The depreciation of the pound post-Brexit: Could it have been predicted?|The decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union (Brexit) after 43 years caused turmoil in exchange rate and global stock markets. More specifically, the pound relative to the dollar has lost close to 15 percent of its value in the weeks after the Brexit decision. In this paper we attempt to examine whether this sudden depreciation of the (pound-dollar) exchange rate is the reaction of market participants to the Brexit or whether the exodus of UK from the EU had little impact on the exchange rate. In doing so, we train linear and nonlinear econometric and machine learning models and evaluate out-of-sample forecasts of the exchange rate and its realized volatility in the pre- and post-Brexit period. We quantify uncertainty caused by the Brexit according to an index based on news related to economic uncertainty. We argue that in daily forecasting horizon our models adhere closely to the evolution of the exchange rate and that most of the depreciation is based on the uncertainty caused by the Brexit.
F37|Exchange Rates Forecasting: Can Jump Models Combined with Macroeconomic Fundamentals Help?|Connection between macroeconomic variables and foreign exchange (FX) rates evaluated in the context of out-of-sample forecasting is a well-known problem in economics. We propose a method that utilizes stochastic models based on jump processes (namely the normal inverse Gaussian and Meixner models), combines them with macroeconomic fundamentals, and using a moving (rolling or recursive) regularized estimation procedure produces forecasts of FX rates. These are compared to benchmark models, namely the direct forecast and the Gauss model fore-cast. Empirical out-of-sample experiments are performed on EUR/USD and USD/DKK currencies.
F37|Shluková analýza skoků na kapitálových trzích<BR>[Cluster Analysis of Jumps on Capital Markets]|Cluster Analysis of Jumps on Capital Markets We analyze the behavior and performance of multiple price jump indicators across capital markets and over time. By using high-frequency we perform cluster analysis of price jump indicators that share similar properties in terms of their performance in that they minimize Type I and Type II errors. We show that clusters of price jump indicators do not exhibit equal size. Clusters are stable across stock market indices and time. Detected numbers of price jumps are also stable over time. The recent financial crisis does not seem to affect the overall jumpiness of mature or emerging stock markets. Our results support the stress testing approach of the Basel III. Accords in that the jump component of the volatility process does not need to be treated separately for the purpose of stress testing.
F37|Vliv korupčního prostředí na efektivitu firem v nových zemích Evropské unie<BR>[Corruption and Firm Efficiency in New EU Countries]|We study the effects of corruption on firm efficiency using a unique comprehensive dataset of private firms from 10 Central and Eastern European countries for the period from 2002 to 2013. We find that an environment characterized by a high level of corruption has an adverse effect on firm efficiency. This effect is amplified for firms with a lower propensity to behave corruptly, i.e. foreign-controlled firms, while domestically-owned firms are not penalized. At the same time, an environment characterized by considerable heterogeneity in perception of corruption is associated with an increase in fim efficiency.
F37|Portfolio Flows, Global Risk Aversion and Asset Prices in Emerging Markets|In recent years, portfolio flows to emerging markets have become increasingly large and volatile. Using weekly portfolio fund flows data, the paper finds that their short-run dynamics are driven mostly by global “push” factors. To what extent do these cross-border flows and global risk aversion drive asset volatility in emerging markets? We use a Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) Multivariate GARCH framework to estimate the impact of portfolio flows and the VIX index on three asset prices, namely equity returns, bond yields and exchange rates, in 17 emerging economies. The analysis shows that global risk aversion has a significant impact on the volatility of asset prices, while the magnitude of that impact correlates with country characteristics, including financial openness, the exchange rate regime, as well as macroeconomic fundamentals such as inflation and the current account balance. In line with earlier literature, portfolio flows to emerging markets are also found to affect the level of asset prices, as was the case in particular during the global financial crisis.
F37|Dynamic Capital Inflow Transmission Of Monetary Policy To Emerging Markets|"In this paper, I examine the effects of advanced economies' conventional monetary policy on gross foreign direct and portfolio investment inflows to emerging economies. I use structural vector autoregressions to analyse and compare the response of each inflow category to world interest rate and emerging economies' monetary and exchange rate shocks. Gross foreign direct inflows respond slowly to shocks while gross portfolio reacts on impact. Furthermore, the reaction of foreign direct investment to the shocks is not as high. These results suggest that monetary and exchange rate policies ofemerging economies influence portfolio inflows more than they impact foreign direct investment inows. These results also imply the existence of fundamental differences in capital flow categories beyond what we know to date. I address the ""push"" and ""pull"" debate in categories capital flows by quantitatively comparing the forecast error variance decomposition. I do not find evidence of ""push"" over ""pull"" factors in either class of inflows."
F37|Introducing an Early Warning System of Exchange Rate Volatility in Iranian Exchange Market: Markov Switching GARCH Method|Forecasting exchange rate volatility is important step in exchange market policy making to avoid high volatility of exchange rate. Exchange rate volatility is important because it is an index of investment uncertainty in each economy. The aim of this paper is introducing an Early Warning System (EWS) of high volatility of exchange rate in Iranian exchange market. Therefore, by estimation a Markov switching GARCH model, exchange rate volatility has been modeled. In this paper, the daily data of market exchange rate during 25thOrdibehesht 1385 until 21thTir 1394 has been used. With estimation of this model, transition matrix of probabilities of high and low volatility regimes has been calculated. By using this matrix, probabilities of high and low volatility regimes in Iranian Exchange Market have been calculated for future horizons so, it is possible to achieve a suitable model for forecasting high volatility of exchange rate regime in Iranian Exchange rate Market. The results of this system indicate that the probability of staying in high volatility exchange rate regime, the probability of transition from high to low volatility, the probability of transition from low to high volatility and the probability of staying in low volatility exchange rate regime are 0.14, 0.03, 0.86 and 0.97 respectively.
F37|The Markov-switching Granger Causality of Asia-Pacific Exchange Rates|This paper examines the Granger causality relationships of the Asia-Pacific exchange rates. We employ Markov-switching vector autoregressive model to capture the dynamic linkages between them. Empirical examination processes use the nominal and real exchange rates of Chinese Yuan, Japanese yen, New Taiwan dollar and South Korean Won. The results of Markov-switching Granger causalities differ remarkably from the conventional linear model and provide more accurate measurement. We find the Markov-switching Granger causalities between exchange rates, and they vary with respect to the sample lag period. The mutual relationships between Asia-Pacific exchange rates are profound and lasting. This is suggested that we should use the nonlinear model to recheck the Granger causalities of exchange rates, and capture the fluctuations of Asia-Pacific exchange rates.
F37|The Impact of Momentum Factors on Multi Asset Portfolio|This article examines a global momentum-based allocation strategy across a broad range of asset classes. It is necessary to break away from a fixed asset allocation because of these unusual and unforeseen market movements, like the tech bubble during the late 1990s and the financial market crisis in 2008. With the dramatic decline in value across all asset classes, the neoclassical capital market theory lost its reputation. This research shows that a dynamic asset allocation process offers an attractive risk-return profile. Furthermore, this work seeks to demonstrate that the classical diversification is not appropriate and in a multi-asset portfolio, asset classes should be managed dynamically. The predictive power of the factors, absolute and relative momentum, is evaluated and analysed in a multi asset context. The data history ranges from 1992 to 2015. The calculations are based on the momentum of various equity markets (World, Emerging Markets, REIT`s), government bonds (US- Treasuries), foreign currencies (JPY/USD, EUR/USD) and commodities (energy, industrial metals, precious metals, agricultural commodities and livestock). Absolute and relative momentum portfolios are constructed using those three asset classes (? ??? ) that present the highest relative or absolute monthly ex-post return within th entire investment universe (? ??? ). The research indicates that both absolute and relative momentum strategies are suitable approaches for constructing and managing high performing multi-asset portfolios, especially it was proved by the outperformance of the portfolios during “dot com” bubble, financial crises of 2008.
F37|The impact of macroeconomic performance on the stability of financial system in the EU countries|This study analyzes the relationship between macroeconomic performance and financial system stability in the theoretical and empirical perspective. The empirical part verifies the impact of a few macroeconomic variables on the financial system stability proxied by bank nonperforming loans to total gross loans, absolute change in the index of nominal effective exchange rate, the ROA and ROE indices for deposit takers. The analysis includes 28 EU countries and the 1996–2015 or 2006–2015 period. The results indicate that the increase in the GDP per capita level and the acceleration of economic growth as well as good fiscal stance all lead to greater stability of the financial sector.
F37|Comparing the Performance of Logit and Probit Early Warning Systems for Currency Crises in Emerging Market Economies|We compare how logit (fixed effects) and probit early warning systems (EWS) predict in-sample and out-of-sample currency crises in emerging markets (EMs). We look at episodes of currency crises that took place in 29 EMs between January 1995 and December 2012. Stronger real GDP growth rates and higher net foreign assets signifi cantly reduce the probability of experiencing a currency crisis, while high levels of credit to the private sector increase it. We find that the logit and probit EWS out-of-sample performances are broadly similar, and that the EWS performance can be very sensitive both to the size of the estimation sample, and to the crisis definition employed. For macroeconomic policy purposes, we conclude that a currency crisis definition identifying more rather than less crisis episodes should be used, even if this may lead to the risk of issuing false alarms.
F37|Spotting Bubbles: A Two-Pillar Framework for Policy Makers|In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the issue of how best to identify speculative bubbles remains in flux. This owes to the difficulty of disentangling irrational investor exuberance from the rational response to lower risk, based on price behavior alone. In response, I introduce a twopillar (price and quantity) approach for financial market surveillance. While asset pricing models comprise a valuable component of the surveillance toolkit, risk taking behavior, and financial vulnerabilities more generally, can also be reflected in subtler, non-price terms. Though policy makers will always encounter uncertainty when attempting to measure imbalances in financial markets, ‘perfect should not be the enemy of the good.’ In this spirit, the framework in this paper seems to capture some of the stylized facts of asset booms and busts, and thus could offer policy makers a practical guide as to when to consider leaning against the wind.
F37|Exchange Rate Predictability and State-of-the-Art Models|This paper empirically evaluates the predictive performance of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) exchange rate assessments with respect to future exchange rate movements. The assessments of real trade-weighted exchange rates were conducted from 2006 to 2011, and were based on three state-of-the-art exchange rate models with a medium-term focus which were developed by the IMF. The empirical analysis using 26 advanced and emerging market economy currencies reveals that the ‘diagnosis’ of undervalued or overvalued currencies based on these models has significant predictive power with respect to future exchange rate movements, with one model outperforming the other two. The models are better at predicting future exchange rate movements in advanced and open economies. Controlling for the exchange rate regime does not increase the predictive power of the assessments. Furthermore, the directional accuracy of the IMF assessments is found to be higher than market expectations.
F37|Great expectations? evidence from Colombia’s exchange rate survey|Abstract In this paper, we use the largest exchange rate survey in Colombia to test for the rational expectations hypothesis, the presence of a time-varying risk premium and the accuracy of exchange rate forecasts. Our findings indicate that episodes of exchange rate appreciation preceded expectations of further appreciation in the short run, but were marked by depreciations in the long run. This reversal largely explains the stabilizing pattern of expectations. Additionally, we find that the forward discount differed from future exchange rate changes due to the rejection of the unbiasedness condition and to the presence of a time-varying risk premium. Finally, we find that only short run expectations were able to outperform a random walk process as well as models of extrapolative, adaptive, and regressive expectations. Long-run expectations, on the other hand, behaved poorly in terms of forecasting accuracy.

F37|Interest rates, eurobonds and intra-European exchange rate misalignments: the challenge of sustainable adjustments in the eurozone|The euro zone crisis illustrates the deficiencies of adjustment mechanisms in a monetary union characterized by a large heterogeneity. Exchange rate adjustments being impossible, they are very few alternative mechanisms. At the level of the whole euro zone the euro is close to its equilibrium parity. But the euro is strongly overvalued for Southern European countries, France included, and largely undervalued for Northern European countries, especially Germany. The paper gives a new evaluation of these exchange rate misalignments inside the euro zone, using a FEER approach, and examines the evolution of competitiveness. In a second step, we use a two-country SFC model of a monetary union with endogenous interest rates and eurobonds issuance. Three main results are obtained. Facing a competitiveness loss in southern countries due to exchange rates misalignments, increasing intra-European financing by banks of northern countries or other institutions could contribute to reduce the debt burden and induce a partial recovery but public debt would increase. Implementation of eurobonds as a tool to partly mutualize European sovereign debt would have a rather similar positive impact, but with a public debt limited to 60% of GDP. Furthermore, eurobonds could also be used to finance large European projects which could impulse a stronger recovery in the entire euro zone with stabilized current account imbalances. However, the settlement of a European Debt Agency in charge of the issuance of the eurobonds would face strong political obstacles.
F37|Point, interval and density forecasts of exchange rates with time varying parameter models|We explore whether modelling parameter time variation improves the point, interval and density forecasts of nine major exchange rates visâ€ Ã â€ vis the US dollar over the period 1976â€“2015. We find that modelling parameter time variation is needed for an accurate calibration of forecast confidence intervals and is better suited at long horizons and in high volatility periods. The biggest forecast improvements are obtained by modelling time variation in the volatilities of the innovations, rather than in the slope parameters. We do not find evidence that parameter time variation helps to unravel exchange rate predictability by macroeconomic fundamentals. However, an economic evaluation of the various forecast models reveals that controlling for parameter time variation and macroeconomic fundamentals leads to higher portfolios returns, and to higher utility values for investors.
F37|Soft budget constraints, European Central Banking and the financial crisis|During the European financial crisis, the European Central Bank implemented a series of unconventional monetary policy measures. We argue that these unconventional monetary policy measures created soft budget constraints for the Eurozone countries by lowering their bond yield spreads. This hypothesis is tested using pooled OLS estimations and two different datasets: monetary policy event dummies and the purchase volumes of the Securities Markets Programme (SMP). We find significantly negative effects on bond yield spreads for both datasets, leading us to accept the hypothesis. The results are confirmed by robustness checks that directly estimate the effect of unconventional monetary policy on central government debt.
F37|A market-based indicator of currency risk: Evidence from American Depositary Receipts|We introduce a novel currency risk measure based on American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Using a multifactor pricing model, we exploit ADR investors’ exposure to potential devaluation losses to derive an indicator of currency risk. Using weekly data for a sample of 831 ADRs located in 23 emerging markets over the 1994-2014 period, we find that a deterioration in the fiscal and current account balance, as well as higher inflation, increases currency risk. Interaction models reveal that these macroeconomic fundamentals drive currency risk, particularly in countries with managed exchange rates, low levels of foreign exchange reserves and a poor sovereign credit rating.

F37|"Purchasing Power Parity for African Countries: The Impact of the 2007-2008 ""Great Recession"""|We investigate both the weak and strong forms of PPP between 33 African countries, the United States, Euro area, South Africa, and Nigeria. The study applies panel unit root tests, panel cointegration tests, panel granger causality test and the panel fully modified OLS models to quarterly CPI and nominal exchange rate data for the period 1995Q1-2014Q4. We find great support for the weak form of PPP and a persistent bi-causal relationship between the nominal exchange rates and the respective price differences between the African countires and reference countries. Support for a strong form of PPP occurs, however, in the post-recession era for the U.S. dollar and the British pound. When we break the data into pre and post-recession, we find a unidirectional causality for the South African rand, pound, and euro in some cases.
F37|Current account and real exchange rate changes: The impact of trade openness|This paper investigates the impact of trade openness on the relationship between current account and the real exchange rate, by focusing on event windows of significant balance of payments distress. We identify episodes of sudden stops in capital flows and of abrupt currency depreciations for a large sample of developed and emerging economies over the period 1970–2011, and we find that, during these episodes, currency depreciations are associated with larger improvements in the current account in countries that are more open to trade. Our results suggest that the magnitude of exchange rate depreciations over the adjustment process of current accounts is related to the degree of openness to trade.
F37|The Taylor Rule, Wealth Effects and the Exchange Rate|The aim of this study is to develop models of the Taylor rule and a Taylor rule based exchange rate model incorporating wealth effects, as represented by both asset prices and asset wealth. In addition these wealth effects are further divided into stock market and housing wealth. Using data for Australia, Sweden, UK and the US, the Taylor model is estimated and then used to forecast out-of-sample. The results suggest that the effects of the asset prices and wealth on the Taylor rule are mixed and depend on the country and the form the wealth takes. The outof-sample forecast performance of both the wealth augmented Taylor rule model and Taylor rule exchange rate model are then compared with the conventional Taylor Rule model and a random walk and overall the wealth augmented models outperform the conventional model and random walk in these countries.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F37|Spillovers from U.S. Unconventional Monetary Policy and Its Normalization to Emerging Markets: A Capital Flow Perspective|Policy makers employed unconventional monetary policy (UMP) tools to respond to the recent global financial crisis in the U.S. and other advanced economies, and the UMP is about to be normalized. In this paper, we try to quantitiatively assess the effects of the UMP and its normalization on capital flows to emerging market economies. We find that the UMP significantly affected capital flows on average. The effects of the normalization are closely related with the effects of the UMP. Importantly, the larger the capital inflows due to the UMP, the larger the capital outflows due to the normalization. Moreover, policy makers need to be careful of a potential risk of unexpected capital outflows (exceeding the expected ones) during an uncertain period whose size tends to be proportional to the size of the previous capital inflows.
F37|Implied Volatility Around the World : Geographical Markets and Asset Classes|This study analyzes the implied volatility-return relationship across asset classes, geographical regions, and time, which extends efforts documenting the instantaneous relation between implied volatility changes and index returns. Modeling the relationships as a GARCH process with lagged terms, we confirm that implied volatility depends on the immediate index changes. However, contemporaneous volatility changes are also explained by lagged index returns and past volatility moves. While this short-term volatility behavior is heavily asymmetric on the side of negative moves, in the long-term there is indifference between positive and negative moves. Volatility also appears to transfer from larger, primary markets to smaller, secondary markets, as price moves in larger markets explain a large portion of volatility in smaller markets. Volatility in larger markets also transfers to the commodity and currency markets.
F37|Commodity prices and related equity prices|This paper shows that commodity-sensitive stock price indices have strong power in predicting nominal and real commodity prices at short horizons (one-month-ahead predictions) using both in- and out-of-sample tests. The forecasts based on commodity-sensitive stock price indices are able to significantly outperform naïve no-change forecasts. For example, the one-month-ahead forecasts for nominal commodity prices reduce the mean squared prediction error by between 1.5% (for natural gas prices) and 20% (for copper prices). Moreover, the one-month-ahead directional forecast is found to perform significantly better than a 50:50 coin toss. As stock prices are not subject to revision, the proposed variable, which reflects timely and readily available market information, can potentially be a valuable predictor and thereby help to improve the accuracy of commodity price forecasts.
F37|An Analysis of the Relationship Between Foreign Direct Investment and Sociopolitical Factors via the Use of Panel Regression|Competitiveness has arisen between countries especially those that have inadequate internal resources because of the attention foreign direct investment has received in financing their development. Those developing countries that have been able to successfully create an environment which is attractive to the foreign investor have enjoyed a higher place among all other developing countries The foreign investor takes into account factors such as economic and political condition of the home country, its labor market and technological infrastructure to make the least costly and most profitable investment while taking as little risk as possible. Especially in the last five years sociopolitical factors have become important in the decision making process. The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between direct foreign investment (FDI) and sociopolitical factors such as political risks, indices of perceived corruption, humanitarian development, risk of terror and multidimensional poverty. The relationship will be brought forth and interpreted via panel regression analysis. The study conducted about developing countries over the years 2010-2014 has demonstrated that all the independent factors with the exception of the index of multidimensional poverty have had a statistically meaningful effect on FDI.
F37|Exchange rate forecasting with DSGE models|We run an exchange rate forecasting “horse race”, which highlights that three principles hold. First, forecasts should not replicate the high volatility of exchange rates observed in sample. Second, models should exploit the mean reversion of the real exchange rate over long horizons. Third, they should account for the international price co-movement seen in the data. Abiding by the first two principles an open-economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model performs well in forecasting the real but not the nominal exchange rate. Only approaches that conform to all three principles tend to outperform the random walk.
F37|An Empirical Research on Fragile Eight Countries|This study investigates the possible reasons of the financial fragility of 10 countries with examining the stability properties of current account balance, budget balance and unemployment rate. For this purpose, the stability process of current account balance of 10 countries is examined for the period from 2005 to 2014; the unemployment of 10 countries is investigated for the period from 2004 to 2013; the budget balance of 8 countries is searched for the period of 2004-2012. The stability properties are examined using with panel unit root test and it is concluded that the current account of Chile and Indonesia is found stationary. In case of unemployment, stationary process is confirmed in South Africa, India, Poland and Indonesia. Finally, the stationary of budget balance is only supported in Brazil
F37|Political risk and expected government bond returns|Political risk relates to both the ability and the willingness of governments to repay debts. We find that bond prices only slowly adapt to changes in political risk. The expected bond returns for countries whose political risk ratings have improved are higher than those for countries whose political risk ratings have deteriorated. This change in political risk premium cannot be explained by the risk factors default premium, term premium, and liquidity, or by momentum, changes in credit ratings, economic risk or financial risk. The risk-adjusted performance is 7.6% per annum for emerging bond markets and 0.8% per annum for euro government bonds.
F37|A melting pot — Gold price forecasts under model and parameter uncertainty|Gold is special as it is influenced by a wide range of factors such as commodity prices, interest rates, inflation expectations, exchange rate changes and stock market volatility. Hence, forecasting the price of gold is a difficult task and the main problem a researcher faces is to select the relevant regressors at each point in time. This model uncertainty in combination with parameter uncertainty is explicitly accounted for by Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA) which allows both the forecasting model and the coefficients to change over time. Based on this framework, we systematically evaluate a large set of possible gold price determinants and find that DMA (1) improves forecasts compared to other frameworks, (2) yields strong time-variation of gold price predictors and (3) favors parsimonious models. The results also show that typical in-sample features of gold such as its hedge property are weaker in an out-of-sample context.
F37|Dynamic spillovers between Shanghai and London nonferrous metal futures markets|This paper examines the dynamic return and volatility spillovers between the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SFE) and the London Metal Exchange (LME) from 2007 to 2016 using the new spillover index of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). Our results indicate that the LME nonferrous metal futures have a greater impact on SFE nonferrous metal futures. In particular, these trends are more pronounced in the aftermath of the recent financial crises, indicating the strength of spillovers during periods of turmoil. The direction of spillovers significantly depends on time variation.
F37|Macroprudential oversight, risk communication and visualization|This paper discusses the role of risk communication in macroprudential oversight and of visualization in risk communication. Beyond the increase in data availability and precision, the transition from firm-centric to system-wide supervision imposes vast data needs. Moreover, in addition to internal communication as in any organization, broad and effective external communication of timely information related to systemic risks is a key mandate of macroprudential supervisors. This further stresses the importance of simple representations of complex data. The present paper focuses on the background and theory of information visualization and visual analytics, as well as techniques within these fields, as potential means for risk communication. We define the task of visualization in risk communication, discuss the structure of macroprudential data, and review visualization techniques applied to systemic risk. We conclude that two essential, yet rare, features for supporting the analysis of big data and communication of risks are analytical visualizations and interactive interfaces. For visualizing the so-called macroprudential data cube, we provide the VisRisk platform with three modules: plots, maps and networks. While VisRisk is herein illustrated with five web-based interactive visualizations of systemic risk indicators and models, the platform enables and is open to the visualization of any data from the macroprudential data cube.
F37|Asymmetric loss and rationality of Chinese renminbi forecasts: An implication for the trade between China and the US|This study examines the asymmetry of the loss function in Chinese renminbi exchange rate forecasts and tests the rationality of the forecasts, assuming a possibly asymmetric loss function. The results indicate that the majority of forecasters have asymmetric loss adverse to US dollar appreciation and the direction of asymmetry is associated with institutional bases, in particular, those in the US. It is consistent with the facts that RMB is often said to be undervalued and there are political conflicts between China and its largest trade partner, the US. This study also finds evidence of rationality under an asymmetric loss function. It implies that those forecasters efficiently use the information in key exchange rate indicators.
F37|The predictive performance of commodity futures risk factors|This paper investigates the time-series predictability of commodity futures excess returns from factor models that exploit two risk factors – the equally weighted average excess return on long positions in a universe of futures contracts and the return difference between the high- and low-basis portfolios. Adopting a standard set of statistical evaluation metrics, we find weak evidence that the factor models provide out-of-sample forecasts of monthly excess returns significantly better than the benchmark of random walk with drift model. We also show, in a dynamic asset allocation environment, that the information contained in the commodity-based risk factors does not generate systematic economic value to risk-averse investors pursuing a commodity stand-alone strategy or a diversification strategy.
F37|Volatility risk premia and exchange rate predictability|We discover a new currency strategy with highly desirable return and diversification properties, which uses the predictive ability of currency volatility risk premia for currency returns. The volatility risk premium—the difference between expected realized volatility and model-free implied volatility—reflects the costs of insuring against currency volatility fluctuations. The strategy sells high insurance-cost currencies and buys low insurance-cost currencies. A distinctive feature of the strategy’s returns is that they are mainly generated by movements in spot exchange rates instead of interest rate differentials. We explore explanations for the profitability of the strategy, which cannot be understood using traditional risk factors.
F37|Market maturity and mispricing|Relying on the Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015) mispricing score and on 45 countries between 1994 and 2013, I document economically meaningful and statistically significant cross-sectional stock return predictability around the globe. In contrast to the widely held belief, mispricing associated with the 11 long/short anomalies underlying the composite ranking measure appears to be at least as prevalent in developed markets as in emerging markets. Additional support for this conjecture is obtained, among others, from tests for biased expectations based on the behavior of anomaly spreads surrounding earnings announcements as well as from within-country variation in development.
F37|Forecasting exchange rates under parameter and model uncertainty|We introduce a forecasting method that closely matches the econometric properties required by exchange rate theory. Our approach formally models (i) when (and if) predictor variables enter or leave a regression model, (ii) the degree of parameter instability, (iii) the (potentially) rapidly changing relevance of regressors, and (iv) the appropriate shrinkage intensity over time. We consider (short-term) forecasting of six major US dollar exchange rates using a standard set of macro fundamentals. Our results indicate the importance of shrinkage and flexible model selection/averaging criteria to avoid poor forecasting results.
F37|Exchange rate predictability in a changing world|An expanding literature articulates the view that Taylor rules are helpful in predicting exchange rates. In a changing world, however, Taylor rule parameters may be subject to structural instabilities, for example in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis. This paper forecasts exchange rates using Taylor rules with Time-Varying Parameters (TVP) estimated by Bayesian methods. Focusing on the data from the crisis, we improve upon the random walk for at least half, and for as many as seven out of 10, of the currencies considered. Results are stronger when we allow the TVP of the Taylor rules to differ between countries.
F37|On the effectiveness of exchange rate interventions in emerging markets|We analyze the effectiveness of exchange rate interventions for a panel of 18 emerging market economies during the period 2003–2011. Using an error-correction model approach, we find that on average, intervention is effective in moving the real exchange rate in the desired direction, controlling for deviations from the equilibrium and short-term changes in fundamentals and global financial variables. Our results are robust to different samples and estimation methods. We find little evidence of asymmetries in the effect of sales and purchases, but some evidence of more effective interventions for large deviations from the equilibrium. We also explore differences across countries according to the possible transmission channels and nature of some global shocks.
F37|A heterogeneous agent exchange rate model with speculators and non-speculators|This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent exchange rate model of speculators and non-speculators from a simple monetary framework. The model replaces rational expectations with an adaptive learning rule that forecasts future exchange rates with an econometric model, and assumes two types of market participants, speculators and non-speculators, that differ by their forecasting model. Speculators employ a correctly specified forecasting model, are relatively short-term oriented, and are subject to momentum and herding effects via an expectation shock; non-speculators utilize a simple forecasting model, have no incentive to be short-term oriented, and are not subject to herding effects. Parameters are calibrated and estimated using the method of simulated moments, and simulation results show that the model is able to replicate foreign exchange market stylized facts better than a model of representative agent rational expectations. Furthermore, the dynamics of the model are shown to derive from both agent heterogeneity and the expectation shock.
F37|Optimal capital controls and real exchange rate policies: A pecuniary externality perspective|A new literature studies the use of capital controls to prevent financial crises. Within this new framework, we show that when exchange rate policy is costless, there is no need for capital controls. However, if exchange rate policy entails efficiency costs, capital controls become part of the optimal policy mix. When exchange rate policy is costly, the optimal mix combines prudential capital controls in tranquil times with policies that limit exchange rate depreciation in crisis times. The optimal mix yields more borrowing, fewer and less severe financial crises, and much higher welfare than with capital controls alone.
F37|Gold, oil, and stocks: Dynamic correlations|We employ a wavelet approach and conduct a time-frequency analysis of dynamic correlations between pairs of key traded assets (gold, oil, and stocks) covering the period from 1987 to 2012. The analysis is performed on both intra-day and daily data. We show that heterogeneity in correlations across a number of investment horizons between pairs of assets is a dominant feature during times of economic downturn and financial turbulence for all three pairs of the assets under research. Heterogeneity prevails in correlations between gold and stocks. After the 2008 crisis, correlations among all three assets increase and become homogenous: the timing differs for the three pairs but coincides with the structural breaks that are identified in specific correlation dynamics. A strong implication emerges: during the period under research, and from a different-investment-horizons perspective, all three assets could be used in a well-diversified portfolio only during relatively short periods.
F37|The price of freedom: Idiosyncratic currency devaluations|Differences in economic institutions, as measured by an index of economic freedom, have been correlated to differences in cross-country investment levels, capital market development, and country-level equity index returns. Here, a country’s level of economic freedom is demonstrated to be a proxy measure for the likelihood of an idiosyncratic currency devaluation during periods of low global foreign exchange volatility. This observation makes economic freedom determinant of whether carry traders may be facing a ‘peso problem,’ giving currency speculators insights into a risk factor which the foreign exchange market may not be pricing or for which there is no historical evidence.
F37|Where does the wind blow? Green preferences and spatial misallocation in renewable energy sector|"Are ""greener"" investments less efficient? This paper looks at the location choices by wind power investors. I measures the efficiency loss in this sector due to wrong project location and explore the factors contributing to it. Using extensive information on wind resources, transmission, electricity price and other restrictions that might affect the siting of wind farms, I calculate the predicted profitability of wind power projects for all the possible places across the contiguous US, use it as a counterfactual for profit- maximizing wind power investment and compare it to the actual placement of wind farms. Average predicted profit of wind projects will raise by 47.1% had the 1770 current projects in the continental US been moved to the best 1770 sites. It is also shown that 80% and 42% of this observed deviation can be accounted for by within- state and within-county distortion. I show further evidence that a large proportion of the within-state and within-county spatial misallocation in wind farm siting can be attributable to green investors' “conspicuous generation” behaviour: wind farms in more environmental-friendly counties are more likely to be invested by local and non- profit investors, are closer to cities, are much less responsive to local fundamentals and have significant worse performance ex-post. Surprisingly, the implementation of state policies such as Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and price-based subsidies are related to better within-state locational choices by adding more capacities in the “brown” counties and attract more for-profit investments, leading to improved observed efficiency, while lump-sum subsidies have the opposite or no effects. These findings calls for the attention from policy makers to the non-monetary incentives of renewable investors when determining the allocative efficiency of policies."
F37|Financing Climate Policies Through Climate Bonds|The funding of climate mitigation and adaptation policies has become an essential issue in climate negotiations. Emissions trading schemes (ETS) and carbon tax policies are widely disccussed as viable mitigation strategies, the revenue from which might then be used for adaptation efforts. In most current models, the burden of enacting mitigation and adaptation policies falls on current generations. This paper expands on a recent article by Sachs (2014) that proposes intertemporal burden sharing, suggesting that implementation of climate policies would represent a Pareto improving strategy for both current and future generations. In particular, this paper proposes that green bonds (also referred to as climate bonds) represent an immediately implementable opportunity to initiate Sachs' plan; the issuance of green bonds could fund immediate investment in climate mitigation such that the debt might be repaid by future generations, those who benefit most from reduced environmental damages. The Sachs model is a discrete time overlapping generations model which we generalize and turn into a continuous time version exhibiting three major stages. We solve this three phase model by using a new numerical procedure called NPMC that allows for finite horizon solutions and phase changes. We show that the issued bonds can be repaid and the debt is sustainable within a finite time horizon. We also study econometrically whether the current macroeconomic environment is conducive to successfully phasing in such climate bonds.
F37|A Quantitative Assessment of the Role of Incomplete Asset Markets on the Dynamics of the Real Exchange Rate|Abstract I develop a two-country New Keynesian model with capital accumulation and incomplete international asset markets that provides novel insights on the effect that imperfect international risk-sharing has on international business cycles and RER dynamics. I find that business cycles appear similar whether international asset markets are complete or not when driven by a combination of non-persistent monetary shocks and persistent productivity (TFP) shocks. In turn, international asset market incompleteness has sizeable effects if (persistent) investment-specific technology (IST) shocks are a main driver of business cycles. I also show that the model with incomplete international asset markets can approximate the RER volatility and persistence observed in the data, for instance, if IST shocks are near-unit-root. Hence, I conclude that the nature of shocks, the extent of financial integration across countries and the existing limitations on asset trading are central to understand the dynamics of the real exchange rate and the endogenous international transmission over the business cycles.
F37|Measuring the effects of dollar appreciation on Asia: A FAVAR approach|Exchange rate shocks have mixed effects on economic activity in both theory and empirical VAR models. In this paper, we extend the empirical literature by considering the implications of a positive shock to the U.S. dollar in a factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) model for the U.S. and three large Asian economies: Korea, Japan and China. The FAVAR framework allows us to represent a country’s aggregate economic activity by a latent factor, generated from a broad set of underlying observable economic indicators. To control for global conditions, we also include in the FAVAR a “global conditions index,” which is another latent factor generated from the economic indicators of major trading partners. We find that a dollar appreciation shock reduces economic activity and inflation not only for the U.S. economy, but also for all three Asian economies. This result, which is robust to a number of alternative specifications, suggests that in spite of their disparate economic structures and policy regimes, the dollar appreciation shock affects the Asian economies primarily through its impact on U.S. aggregate demand; and this demand channel dominates the expenditure-switching channel that affects a country’s export competitiveness.
F37|Forecasting the USD/CNY Exchange Rate under Different Policy Regimes|The USD/CNY exchange rate exhibits very different pattern in different periods as it changes wildly from one period to another according to the economic reforms and policies. This paper compares the performance of six different forecasting models of USD/CNY exchange rate under three different forecast scenarios from 2005-2015. In particular, the paper focuses in answering the following questions. (i) Do models' forecast performance change when the marketization level changes? (ii) Which model has the best forecast when the regimes change? (iii) Can forecasting robustifications help? The forecast results show that models incorporates economic fundamentals perform better in less regulated periods when the exchange rate can oat more freely. For the forecast experiments with breaks in the forecast origin, the exchange rate CVAR model perform the best before robustifications. In most cases, the intercept-correction and doubledifference device improve the forecast performance in both dynamic forecast and one-step forecast. Different models seem to do well under different forecast scenario after applying the robust devices.
F37|Long-Run Purchasing Power Parity And Exchange Rates: Evidence From The Middle East|This paper examines the validity of Purchasing Power Parity and investigates the market integration between Jordan and its major trading partners, namely, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Unit root tests, Johansen co-integration test and a vector error correction model were employed to test data covering the period 2005Q1-2012Q4. The unit root tests demonstrated that all variables were integrated of order one. The results of co-integration tests showed that a co-integrating relationship existed between exchange rates, domestic and foreign price levels for four Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The two remaining countries, Oman and United Arab Emirates, do not have a cointegration relationship. For the vector error correction model, we found the error correction terms for Jordan with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries carried the expected sign. This suggests that whenever there is a deviation from the equilibrium co-integrating relationship, the exchange rate interacts in a dynamic fashion by adjusting to restore its long-run equilibrium. Finally, the models passed all the diagnostic checking. In conclusion, these results provide evidence that the Purchasing Power Parity model holds in the long run. The results also show the Jordanian economy is integrated with six trading countries.
F37|Carry Trade Strategies With Factor Augmented Macro Fundamentals: A Dynamic Markov-Switching Factor Model|This paper evaluates the performance of carry trade strategies with macro fundamentals in a Markov switching dynamic factor augmented regression framework and compares the performance statistics with the benchmark model of a random walk and momentum strategy. I make simulations with the Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc and US Dollar as funding currencies against six target currencies. Carry trade, a currency speculation strategy between the high-interest rate and low-interest rate currencies, generates high payoffs on average but has a possibility of crash risk. I argue that risk adjusted returns, mean returns and downside risk perform better when purchasing power parity model is used in a both regime switching and linear factor augmented regression framework for Franc trades and perform as good as benchmark model of momentum strategy for Dollar and Yen trades
F37|Are Exchange Rates Disconnected from Macroeconomic Variables? Evidence from the Factor Approach|We use factor-augmented predictive regression to analyze the relation between nominal exchange rates and macroeconomic variables. Using a panel of 127 US macroeconomic time series, we estimate eight factors through principal component analysis. Those estimated factors have significant predictive power and can substantially improve the predictive power of Purchasing Power Parity through both in-sample and out-of-sample analyses. The estimated macroeconomic factor, which comoves with US money supply measures, has strong predictive power for nominal exchange rate fluctuations in the short run, while estimated factors, comoving with interest rate spreads and employment variables, have strong predictive power in the long run. Moreover, optimal factors selected by the BIC in the out-of-sample analysis differ greatly depending on the time points when forecasts are made. Finally, we show that factors extracted from a panel of 127 US time series data and those extracted from a panel of 215 Korean macroeconomic series together can predict a substantial portion of movements in the Korea-US bilateral exchange rate.
F37|Exchange Rate Returns and External Adjustment: Evidence from Switzerland|Abstract This paper studies the predictive power of external imbalances for exchange rate returns. We focus on Switzerland, a very open economy where exchange rate movements have a strong effect on external imbalances through valuation effects and trade flows. Using a simple modification of the Gourinchas and Rey (J Polit Econ 115(4):665–703, 2007) approach to make their approximation applicable to Switzerland, we find that measures of deviations from trends in Swiss net foreign assets and net exports help to forecast Swiss franc nominal effective exchange rate movements, both in and out of sample.
F37|Real Exchange Rate Forecasting and PPP: This Time the Random Walk Loses|Abstract This paper brings four new insights into the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) debate. First, we show that a half-life PPP (HL) model is able to forecast real exchange rates better than the random walk (RW) model at both short and long-term horizons. Second, we find that this result holds if the speed of adjustment to the sample mean is calibrated at reasonable values rather than estimated. Third, we find that it is preferable to calibrate, rather than to elicit as a prior, the parameter determining the speed of adjustment to PPP. Fourth, for most currencies in our sample, the HL model outperforms the RW also in terms of nominal exchange rate forecasting.
F37|Forecasting Daily Stock Volatility Using GARCH-CJ Type Models with Continuous and Jump Variation|In this paper we decompose the realized volatility of the GARCH-RV model into continuous sample path variation and discontinuous jump variation to provide a practical and robust framework for non- parametrically measuring the jump component in asset return volatility. By using 5-minute high-frequency data of MASI Index in Morocco for the period (January 15, 2010 - January 29, 2016), we estimate parameters of the constructed GARCH and EGARCH-type models (namely, GARCH, GARCH-RV, GARCH-CJ, EGARCH, EGARCH-RV, and EGARCH-CJ) and evaluate their predictive power to forecast future volatility. The results show that the realized volatility and the continuous sample path variation have certain predictive power for future volatility while the discontinuous jump variation contains relatively less information for forecasting volatility. More interestingly, the findings show that the GARCH-CJ-type models have stronger predictive power for future volatility than the other two types of models. These results have a major contribution in financial practices such as financial derivatives pricing, capital asset pricing, and risk measures.
F37|Banking contagion under different exchange rate regimes in CEE|The global crisis of 2008 caused both liquidity shortage and increasing insolvency in the banking system. The study focuses on credit default contagion in the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region, which originated in bank runs generated by non-performing loans granted to non-financial clients. In terms of methodology, the paper relies on the one hand on review of the literature, and on the other hand on a data survey with comparative and regression analysis. To uncover credit default contagion, the research focuses on the combined impact of foreign exchange rates and foreign private indebtedness.
F37|Impact of Exchange Rate Volatility and Commodity Trade between U.S. and Singapore|The impact of exchange rate volatility on trade flows still continues to be of great interest. More recent studies have looked that the issue at commodity level. In this paper, we consider the trade between Singapore and her major trading partner, the U.S. and investigate the effects of exchange rate volatility on 141 U.S. exporting industries and 60 U.S. importing industries. We find that exchange rate uncertainty has short-run effects on the trade flows of most industries. However, the short-run effects last into the long run only in 59 exporting industries and in 27 importing industries.
F37|Systemic Risk, Aggregate Demand, and Commodity Prices|The paper presents a global model for analysis and projections. The model features a handful of elements that make it suitable for analyzing three broad sets of topics; first, systemic risk and its transmission to country risk premiums; second, the transmission from country risk premiums to demand-related variables such as the output gap, the trade balance, and unemployment; and third, the transmission from commodity prices to country inflation. The model incorporates one systemic risk channel and two foreign channels, specifically, a foreign aggregate demand channel and a foreign exchange rate channel. The model is estimated with Bayesian methods. In addition, the effect of risk on aggregate demand is calibrated with the aid of a VAR. Among the results are that the episodes of surges in systemic risk identified in the paper were transmitted to country risk premiums and aggregate demand--related variables; that the effect of systemic risk shocks on world economic activity is large, and that the busts in the world output gap correspond with the major financial events identified by the estimated time series for the unobserved systemic risk. In addition, systemic risk shocks are important drivers of output gaps while country risk premium shocks can have important effects on the trade balance. Surprisingly, commodity prices, in particular the price of oil, are shown to be demand driven; hence, demand related factors may play a nontrivial role in explaining noncore inflation. The model performed well at one- and four-quarter horizons compared to a survey of analysts' forecasts. In addition, systemic risk shocks were important at explaining the forecast variance of the world output gap, country output gaps, the price of oil, and country risk premiums. The breath of reach of systemic risk shocks back the efforts for financial surveillance with a systemic focus.
F37|The Sustainability Of Serbia`S External Position: The Impact Of Fiscal Adjustment And External Shocks|This paper studies the impact of fiscal policy and external shocks on the sustainability of Serbia’s external position. The key determinants of Serbia`s current account balance are identified using model averaging techniques and are compared with estimates obtained for other small open economies (Poland, Georgia, Morocco, Ukraine, and Estonia). The paper uses estimated influences of macrovariables on the current account balance to generate a rich set of possible outcomes for the external position of the country. The results suggest the importance of fiscal policy for the reduction of external imbalances in all countries in our sample. In particular, credible and sustained fiscal adjustment can reduce current account deficit and stabilize Serbia’s external position close to its current level over the medium term. The analysis also warns that lack of success in fiscal consolidation coupled with external shocks may easily push the external position onto an unsustainable path.
F37|Can oil prices forecast exchange rates?|This paper investigates whether oil prices have a reliable and stable out-of-sample relationship with the Canadian/U.S. dollar nominal exchange rate. Despite state-of-the-art methodologies, the authors find little systematic relation between oil prices and the exchange rate at the monthly and quarterly frequencies. In contrast, the main contribution is to show the existence of a very short-term relationship at the daily frequency, which is rather robust and holds no matter whether the authors use contemporaneous (realized) or lagged oil prices in their regression. However, in the latter case the predictive ability is ephemeral, mostly appearing after instabilities have been appropriately taken into account.
F37|Forecasting commodity currencies: the role of fundamentals with short-lived predictive content|Recent evidence highlights that commodity price changes exhibit a short-lived, yet robust contemporaneous effect on commodity currencies, which is mainly detectable in daily-frequency data. We use MIDAS models in a Bayesian setting to include mixed-frequency dynamics while accounting for time-variation in predictive ability. Using the random walk Metropolis-Hastings technique as a new tool to estimate our class of MIDAS regressions, we find that for most of the commodity currencies in our sample exploiting this short-lived relationship yields to statistically more precise out-of-sample exchange rate point and density forecasts relative to the no-change benchmark. Further, the usual low-frequency predictors, such as money supplies and interest rates differentials, typically receive little support from the data at monthly forecasting horizons. In contrast, models featuring daily commodity prices are highly likely.
F37|A new technique for estimating currency premiums|This paper extends the model of currency premiums developed by Clarida (2012, 2013). In our extended model, a currency premium consists of two disequilibrium factors: One is the interest rate gap, i.e., the deviation of real interest rates, domestic and foreign, from their equilibrium values; the other is the exchange rate misalignment, i.e., the deviation of real exchange rates from their equilibrium values. This paper calculates these disequilibrium factors included in the dollar, euro, and yen, and shows empirically the developments of the currency premiums from the mid-2000s. The result indicates that the euro was growing to become a world currency next to the US dollar toward the late 2000s, and then the yen was preferred as a safe haven while the US and European capital markets were under stresses.
F37|The Relation between National Stock Prices and Effective Exchange Rates: Does It Affect Exchange Rate Exposure?|There is twofold contribution in this paper. First, by using monthly data for 16 industrialized countries for the period 1973–2011 we find evidence of time-varying cointegration relationship between effective exchange rates and national stock market indices. Second, we present that the cointegration relationship affects exchange rate exposure. We propose that the exchange rate exposure effect changes when the connection between the exchange rate and stock market emerges. This is a new result and reflects importance of these markets’ joint role in international risk sharing.
F37|Crise de la zone euro, intégration financière et rationnement bancaire|A “stock flow consistent” model of a Monetary Union with two countries is proposed. Several results can be underlined. Intra-zone credit has no specific stabilisation effect if the central bank plays the role of lender of last resort. Rising interest rates due to banks’ reluctance to supply more credit or buy more Treasury bonds induces a cumulative slowdown. In this context, the use of intra-zone finance (European Stability Mechanism, bank financing or intervention by the central bank) can play a stabilizing role. However, if intra-zone finance is accompanied by fiscal austerity plans, the expected effects prove weak or negative. These results illustrate mechanisms operating in the actual crisis of Southern European countries. Classification JEL : F41, F37, E12
F37|Real-Time Prediction and Post-Mortem Analysis of the Shanghai 2015 Stock Market Bubble and Crash|The authors assess the performance of the real-time diagnostic, openly presented to the public on the website of the Financial Crisis Observatory (FCO) at ETH Zurich, of the bubble regime that developed in Chinese stock markets since mid-2014 and that started to burst in June 2015. The analysis is based on (i) the economic theory of rational expectation bubbles, (ii) behavioural mechanisms of imitation and herding of investors and traders and (iii) the mathematical formulation of the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) that describes the critical approach towards a tipping point in complex systems. The authors document how the real-time predictions were presented in the automated analysis of the FCO, as well as in our monthly FCO Cockpit report of June 2015. A complementary post-mortem analysis on the nature and value of the LPPLS methodology to diagnose the SSEC bubble and its termination is also given.

F37|Factors Affecting Current Account In The Republic Of Macedonia|Large and persistent current account deficit in most of the transition countries have attracted considerable attention, especially with the beginning of the world economic crisis. Even though common trends in the transition countries are included in the analysis, the main focus of this paper is to provide theoretical and empirical study of the main determinants of the current account in Macedonia. Multiple regression model with ordinary least squares estimator (OLS) was used for the analyzed period January 2003 â€“ September 2012. According to the results, the variables: budget deficit, foreign direct investments, ratio of export and import, new approved credits are statistically significant determinants of the current account in Macedonia. In general, these are structural factors that affect the external imbalance. Still, part of the deepening of current account deficit (especially during third quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2009) appears to be related to external shocks: global increase of the prices and world economic crisis. These cyclical factors reversed alongside the economic recovery during 2009, and the current account deficit was back to its average levels. This indicates the urgent need for structural changes in the Macedonian economy in order to decrease its external vulnerability in the future.

The model is estimated with Bayesian methods. In addition, the effect of risk on aggregate demand is calibrated with the aid of a VAR. Among the results are that the episodes of surges in systemic risk identified in the paper were transmitted to country risk premiums and aggregate demand--related variables; that the effect of systemic risk shocks on world economic activity is large, and that the busts in the world output gap correspond with the major financial events identified by the estimated time series for the unobserved systemic risk. In addition, systemic risk shocks are important drivers of output gaps while country risk premium shocks can have important effects on the trade balance. Surprisingly, commodity prices, in particular the price of oil, are shown to be demand driven; hence, demand related factors may play a nontrivial role in explaining noncore inflation. The model performed well at one- and four-quarter horizons compared to a survey of analysts' forecasts. In addition, systemic risk shocks were important at explaining the forecast variance of the world output gap, country output gaps, the price of oil, and country risk premiums. The breath of reach of systemic risk shocks back the efforts for financial surveillance with a systemic focus.
F37|Factores de riesgo en un mandato de inversión activo de renta fija|En este documento se aplica la metodología de Análisis de Componentes Principales (ACP) para explorar la existencia de factores de riesgo comunes en las estrategias de inversión activas implícitas en los lineamientos de inversión de los portafolios denominados en moneda extranjera de Fogafín. A partir de la identificación de estos factores se busca entender mejor la relación de las estrategias y el potencial de diversificación ofrecido por este conjunto de estrategias para lograr una mayor efectividad en el proceso de construcción de portafolios. Este análisis se realiza para un periodo de historia reciente (2010-2014) que representa el periodo del régimen de tasas bajas producto de las políticas monetarias expansivas después de la recesión económica del 2008. Adicionalmente, se realizan pruebas de estabilidad para evaluar la consistencia de los resultados del ACP en dos momentos históricos y se hacen pruebas de sensibilidad para estudiar los cambios en los factores ante variaciones en la muestra de estrategias elegibles. Se plantean dos aproximaciones para la aplicación del ACP en la administración de portafolios: top-down y bottom-up.
F37|Factores determinantes del salario del sector privado en el Ecuador para el año 2014: un caso de estudio en la ciudad de Guayaquil|En Ecuador, la remuneración salarial de los trabajadores del sector privado se ha convertido en un problema difícil de tratar y armonizar a lo largo de la historia. La actual Constitución del Ecuador, aprobada en Montecristi en 2008, protege los derechos laborales de los empleados; sin embargo, muchas empresas no actúan apegadas a la ley. El presente trabajo se desarrolla con la finalidad de encontrar las variables que están influyendo de manera significativa al salario de los trabajadores del sector privado en la ciudad de Guayaquil. Dada la revisión previa de literatura, y tomando como base los estudios realizados por Mincer (1974), las variables analizadas fueron: años de experiencia laboral, nivel de educación, sexo del empleado, tipo de cargo, antigüedad en la compañía y estado civil. Además, se incluyeron variables interactivas y cuadráticas. Por otro lado, la metodología de inferencia utilizada es la de mínimos cuadrados ordinarios con errores estándar robustos de White tomando en cuenta la corrección por sesgo muestral propuesta por Heckman (1979). Según los resultados obtenidos, la significación de las variables que conforma el capital humano depende del tipo de empresa en la que laboran los empleados y de su interacción con otras variables. Es así que se encontró evidencia empírica para afirmar que las compañías pequeñas no están remunerando a sus dependientes en función de su productividad, específicamente a los empleados nuevos.
F37|Analysis of the evolution of sovereign bond yields by wavelet techniques|The term “wavelets” covers a set of resources from the mathematical analysis that has proven their efficiency in system identification on areas such as hydrology, geology, glaciology, climatology and energy resources optimization. The methodology undergone on systems engineering could be extrapolated to everything conceptualized as “complex system” whatever its nature be. The wavelet techniques provide the description of non-stationary components and the evolution of macroeconomic variables in the frequency domain. The identification of predominant frequential scales and transient effects in time series highlights the multiresolutional analysis that would be more difficult to treat with traditional methods of econometrics. A review of the literature will show the potential problems that can be solved with these techniques, including prediction of benefits calculated on the evolution of the risk premium of a country, the extraction of symmetric macroeconomic shocks in country clusters, or detection of transient effects on the mutual influence of sovereign bonds between pairs of countries, among others. The dissertation will culminate in specific applications that show the power of wavelet techniques in identifying possible determinants and correlation of the evolution of sovereign bond yields in the euro area countries.
F37|Foreign Currency Returns and Systematic Risks|"The decomposition of the market return into its cash-flow and discount-rate news driven components reveals that excess returns on low forward discount currency portfolios load positively on ""good"" news about the stock market's discount rates while high forward discount currencies load negatively on this news. Average currency portfolio returns are hence explained by different sensitivities to discount-rate news. A two-beta version of the CAPM, distinguishing between cash-flow and discount-rate betas, is able to price both currency and stock portfolio returns at the same time. Finally, we find that the relation between stock market news and foreign currency returns varies across the two either discount-rate news or both discount-rate and cash-flow news driven stock market booms of the past two decades.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
F37|Banking Contagion under Different Exchange Rate Regimes in CEE|The global crisis of 2008 caused both liquidity shortage and increasing insolvency in the banking system. The study focuses on credit default contagion in the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region, which originated in bank runs generated by non-performing loans granted to non-financial clients. In terms of methodology, the paper relies on one hand on review of the literature, and on the other hand on a data survey with comparative and regression analysis. To uncover credit default contagion, the research focuses on the combined impact of foreign exchange rates and foreign private indebtedness.
F37|Macroprudential oversight, risk communication and visualization|This paper discusses the role of risk communication in macroprudential oversight and of visualization in risk communication. Beyond the soar in data availability and precision, the transition from firm-centric to system-wide supervision imposes vast data needs. Moreover, except for internal communication as in any organization, broad and effective external communication of timely information related to systemic risks is a key mandate of macroprudential supervisors, further stressing the importance of simple representations of complex data. This paper focuses on the background and theory of information visualization and visual analytics, as well as techniques within these fields, as potential means for risk communication. We define the task of visualization in risk communication, discuss the structure of macroprudential data, and review visualization techniques applied to systemic risk. We conclude that two essential, yet rare, features for supporting the analysis of big data and communication of risks are analytical visualizations and interactive interfaces. For visualizing the so-called macroprudential data cube, we provide the VisRisk platform with three modules: plots, maps and networks. While VisRisk is herein illustrated with five web-based interactive visualizations of systemic risk indicators and models, the platform enables and is open to the visualization of any data from the macroprudential data cube.
F37|Banking and Currency Crises: Differential Diagnostics for Developed Countries| We identify a set of ‘rules of thumb’ that characterize economic, financial and structural conditions preceding the onset of banking and currency crises in 36 advanced economies over 1970–2010. We use the classification and regression tree methodology and its random forest extension, which permits the detection of key variables driving binary crisis outcomes, allows for interactions among key variables and determines critical tipping points. We distinguish between basic country conditions, country structural characteristics and international developments. We find that crises are more varied than they are similar. For banking crises, we find that low net interest rate spreads in the banking sector and a shallow, or inverted, yield curve is their most important forerunners in the short term. In the longer term, it is high house price inflation. For currency crises, high domestic short‐term rates coupled with overvalued exchange rates are the most powerful short‐term predictors. We find that both country structural characteristics and international developments are relevant banking‐crisis predictors. Currency crises, however, seem to be driven more by country idiosyncratic, short‐term developments. We find that some variables, such as the domestic credit gap, provide important unconditional signals, but it is difficult to use them as conditional signals and, more importantly, to find relevant threshold values.

F37|An alternative view of exchange market pressure episodes in emerging Europe: an analysis using Extreme Value Theory (EVT)|Using extreme value theory tools, we demonstrate that the distributions of the exchange market pressure (EMP) series for most of twelve emerging Europe countries have heavy tails, and disregarding their tail properties may lead to substantial underestimation of the probability of tail events. Using an extreme-value-based EMP crisis definition leads to a different set of crisis determinants compared to a definition based on standard errors. The probability of extreme EMP periods in our sample is affected by global risk aversion, regional contagion, the level of international reserves, foreign direct investment, history of past crises and accumulated domestic credit and real exchange rate related imbalances.

F37|Long-run Overseas Portfolio Diversification Benefits and Opportunities of Asian Emerging Stock Markets and Developed Markets|The international portfolio diversification is a function of correlation of equity markets across countries and the amount of correlation one market has with another, decides the scope of portfolio diversification. The market having high correlation with other markets generally has less scope for portfolio diversification. This research study investigated the existence of long run portfolio diversification benefits and opportunities of eight emerging stock markets in Asia and three top, benchmark index of developed markets. Models such as factor analysis, principal component and maximum likelihood, correlation matrix and graphical price movement diagram were used for estimating the portfolio diversification opportunity and benefits. It is suggested from overseas portfolio diversification analysis that in Asian emerging stock markets (especially China, India, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia and Thailand), there are good opportunities for overseas portfolio diversification and the investors may earn high return.
F37|What’s news in exchange rate dynamics: A DSGE approach|This paper examines the medium and long-term impacts of economic news on exchange rate movements. We extend a standard new open economy macroeconomics model by allowing anticipated (news) shocks in purchasing power parity and real interest rates, and perform a structural Bayesian estimation. Using 20 years of quarterly data from the US and the euro area, we find that anticipated shocks account for more than 40 percent of exchange rate fluctuations.
F37|Are benefits from oil–stocks diversification gone? New evidence from a dynamic copula and high frequency data|Oil is perceived as a good diversification tool for stock markets. To fully understand this potential, we propose a new empirical methodology that combines generalized autoregressive score copula functions with high frequency data and allows us to capture and forecast the conditional time-varying joint distribution of the oil–stocks pair accurately. Our realized GARCH with time-varying copula yields statistically better forecasts of the dependence and quantiles of the distribution relative to competing models. Employing a recently proposed conditional diversification benefits measure that considers higher-order moments and nonlinear dependence from tail events, we document decreasing benefits from diversification over the past ten years. The diversification benefits implied by our empirical model are, moreover, strongly varied over time. These findings have important implications for asset allocation, as the benefits of including oil in stock portfolios may not be as large as perceived.
F37|Interactions between oil and financial markets — Do conditions of financial stress matter?|This study uses a structural threshold VAR model to study the nonlinear relationships between oil and financial variables. The threshold effect is robust across models having different structural orderings of shocks. Evidence shows that shocks associated with different financial stress regimes explain the asymmetric responses of the system. Shocks in the stressed regime usually have larger and longer effects than shocks in the normal regime. The inverse relationship between real interest rate and real oil price is conditioned on a number of factors, and is not robust across all manner of circumstances. The relationship between oil price and the US dollar is shock-dependent. A negative shock that depreciates the dollar may trigger an increase in oil price, yet a positive oil shock may lead to appreciation of the dollar. Finally, oil's ability to hedge against rising risk is limited to a market with normal stress conditions. It is the US dollar that generally serves as a safe haven when financial markets are enmeshed in considerable tension.
F37|On the stock market liquidity and the business cycle: A multi country approach|We provide original results on national and global stock market liquidity and its interaction with macro-economic variables for six of the G7 economies, namely: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and UK, building on the methodology and on the US evidence by Naes et al. (2011). Using a number of additional tests, we find that different markets do not behave in a uniform manner. National liquidity has diminished ability in Granger causing macroeconomic variables for our sample countries, and in additional tests the same holds for an extended US sample, contrary to Naes et al. As regards global liquidity there is a two-way causality with macroeconomic indicators for the six nations in our sample while for the US there is no causality in either direction. We also show that there is no superior information in small firm liquidity in Granger causing macroeconomic variables even for the US in contrast to the sample period employed by Naes et al. implying an unstable relationship over time for the US.
F37|Forecasting the price of gold using dynamic model averaging|We develop several models to examine possible predictors of the return of gold, which embrace six global factors (business cycle, nominal, interest rate, commodity, exchange rate and stock price) extracted from a recursive principal component analysis (PCA) and two uncertainty and stress indices (the Kansas City Fed's financial stress index and the U.S. economic policy uncertainty index). Specifically, by comparing alternative predictive models, we show that the dynamic model averaging (DMA) and dynamic model selection (DMS) models outperform linear models (such as the random walk) as well as the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) model. The DMS is the best predictive model overall across all forecast horizons. Generally, all the predictors show strong predictive power at one time or another though at varying magnitudes, while the exchange rate factor and the Kansas City Fed's financial stress index appear to be strong at almost all horizons and sub-periods. However, the forecasting prowess of the exchange rate is supreme.
F37|Third-country effects on the exchange rate|Predictive regressions for bilateral exchange rates are typically run on variables from the associated bilateral pairs of countries. These regressions characteristically have low explanatory power, which leaves room for an omitted variables interpretation. We test whether these omitted variables are from third-countries. When third-country macro factors are added to bilateral exchange rate regressions, they enter significantly and increase the adjusted R2. A three-country exchange rate model illustrates potential channels for third-country spillovers to affect the bilateral rate.
F37|Foreign exchange market inefficiency and exchange rate anomalies|This paper develops a perfectly general non-linear Uncovered Interest Parity, UIP, framework with foreign exchange (fx) market inefficiency. The latter means that there is always some “unexploited profit” which tends to generate a negative value for Fama's beta coefficient. However, as ID decays over time, this tends to generate a positive value for beta. The sign of beta is uncertain. It is shown that this result implies that the existence of fx market inefficiency is consistent with many puzzling facts about exchange rates, and that the model's implied values for beta are consistent with those obtained via actual data.
F37|Transmission channels of systemic risk and contagion in the European financial network|We investigate systemic risk and how financial contagion propagates within the euro area banking system by employing the Maximum Entropy method. The study captures multiple snapshots of a dynamic financial network and uses counterfactual simulations to propagate shocks emerging from three sources of systemic risk: interbank, asset price, and sovereign credit risk markets. As conditions deteriorate, these channels trigger severe direct and indirect losses and cascades of defaults, whilst the dominance of the sovereign credit risk channel amplifies, as the primary source of financial contagion in the banking network. Systemic risk within the northern euro area banking system is less apparent, while the southern euro area banking system is more prone and susceptible to bank failures provoked by financial contagion. By modelling the contagion path the results demonstrate that the euro area banking system insists to be markedly vulnerable and conducive to systemic risks.
F37|The illiquidity premium: International evidence|We examine the illiquidity premium in stock markets across 45 countries and present two findings. First, the average illiquidity return premium across countries is positive and significant, after controlling for other pricing factors. The premium is measured by monthly return series on illiquid-minus-liquid stocks or by the coefficient of stock illiquidity estimated from cross section Fama-MacBeth regressions. Second, a commonality exists across countries in the illiquidity return premium, controlling for common global return factors and variation in global illiquidity. This commonality is different from commonality in illiquidity itself and is greater in globally integrated markets.
F37|Exchange rate forecasts and expected fundamentals|Using a large panel of individual professionals' forecasts, this paper demonstrates that good exchange rate forecasts are related to a proper understanding of fundamentals, specifically good interest rate forecasts. This relationship is robust to individual fixed effects and further controls. Reassuringly, the relationship is stronger during phases when the impact from fundamentals is more obvious, e.g., when exchange rates substantially deviate from their PPP values. Finally, forecasters largely agree that an interest rate increase relates to a currency appreciation, but only good forecasters get expected interest rates right.
F37|Can oil prices forecast exchange rates? An empirical analysis of the relationship between commodity prices and exchange rates|We show the existence of a very short-term relationship at the daily frequency between changes in the price of a country's major commodity export and changes in its nominal exchange rate. The relationship appears to be robust and to hold when we use contemporaneous (realized) commodity price changes in our regression. However, when we use lagged commodity price changes, the predictive ability is ephemeral, mostly appearing after instabilities have been appropriately taken into account.
F37|Foreign activities of U.S. banks since 1997: The roles of regulations and market conditions in crises and normal times|Using a unique newly constructed dataset on U.S. banks' foreign activities since 1997, this paper examines how bank, market and regulatory conditions in the U.S. and host countries affect U.S. banks' choices of which foreign markets to enter and how much claims and liabilities to take on there. Using a two-stage structural estimation framework, the determinants of foreign market entry/exit, cross-border claims, and foreign affiliate claims and liabilities choices are examined in 107 host countries around the world. It is shown that (1) the health of the balance sheet is the primary driver of foreign market entry/exit choices (especially so during the Subprime crisis), while host market and regulatory conditions play important roles in the choice of claims/liabilities volumes; (2) banks choose their foreign activities during banking and market crises differently than they do in ‘normal’ times; and (3) in addition to bank size, previous experience with managing a global lending network significantly increases the intensity of banks' foreign involvement. Structural estimates of the costs of foreign market entry/exit and host market regulatory stringency are also derived.
F37|The law of one price revisited: How do goods market frictions generate large and volatile price deviations?|This paper analyzes the role of goods market frictions in accounting for the large and volatile deviations from the Law of One Price (LOP) in a framework of flexible prices. We draw a distinction between the goods market frictions that are required to consume tradable goods (e.g., distribution costs) and those that are necessary for international transactions (e.g., trade costs). We find that trade costs generate LOP deviations by introducing a no-arbitrage band, while distribution costs cause the price to deviate from the LOP by affecting the probability that trade will occur, given the band. We then conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to show that real exchange rate volatility is positively associated with trade costs, but negatively related to distribution costs. This effect depends on the interplay of trade costs and distribution costs, as they work in opposite directions when creating arbitrage opportunities.
F37|A multi-speed Europe: is it viable? A stock-flow consistent approach|Based on the hypothesis that states that the underlying cause of the crisis in the euro area is a combination of exchange-rate misalignments with uncoordinated wage policies, we explore different exchange-rate arrangements that may help to reduce imbalances between surplus and deficit countries. These alternative configurations of the eurozone, which imply abandoning the common currency to a greater or a lesser extent, are tested with a theoretical four-country stock-flow consistent model. We find that although the different alternatives of a multi-speed Europe vary in their stability and macroeconomic effects, in all cases they produce better results compared to the one that has been observed since the introduction of the euro.
F37|The Influence of Industry Financial Composition on the Exports from Pakistan|I determine the influence of the industry financial composition on the export flow between Pakistan and its trading partners. The importing countries are split according to their OECD membership status and their level of banking credit. The degree of financial dependence and asset tangibility of an industry can determine the ability of firms to obtain external finance and fund international trading activities. On the other hand, the level of financial development and exogenous shocks to the banking credit of the importing country is likely to impact the influence of the industry-level financial composition on the exports from Pakistan.
F37|Foreign exchange predictability during the financial crisis: implications for carry trade profitability|In this paper, we study the effectiveness of carry trade strategies during and after the financial crisis using a flexible approach to modeling currency returns. We decompose the currency returns into multiplicative sign and absolute return components, which exhibit much greater predictability than raw returns. We allow the two components to respond to currency-specific risk factors and use the joint conditional distribution of these components to obtain forecasts of future carry trade returns. Our results suggest that the decomposition model produces higher forecast and directional accuracy than any of the competing models. We show that the forecasting gains translate into economically and statistically significant (risk-adjusted) profitability when trading individual currencies or forming currency portfolios based on the predicted returns from the decomposition model.

F37|Google Trends and Forecasting Performance of Exchange Rate Models|In this paper, internet search data provided from Google Trends is utilized to nowcast the known variates of alternative exchange rate determination models. The sample covers 12 OECD countries’ exchange rates for the period from Jan 2004 to June 2014. The results indicate that inclusion of Google Trends-based nowcasting values of macro fundamentals to the current set of government released-macro-economic variables improve the out-of-sample forecast of Purchasing Power Parity model in seven currency pairs and of Monetary model in four currency pairs. In this paper we claim that, for proper testing of the structural models, since there is a lag in the release of official data on macro fundamentals, the literature should focus more on using ex ante variables on current macro fundamentals and nowcasting of these variables with utilization of Google Search Inquiries can be one alternative for this purpose.

F37|Economic resilience: A new set of vulnerability indicators for OECD countries|The high costs of crises underscore the need to strengthen the resilience of economies, notably by assessing early on potential vulnerabilities that can lead to such costly events. This paper first discusses the source and nature of potential vulnerabilities in OECD countries that can lead to costly economic crises. Based on the most recent evidence from the early warning literature and lessons learned from the global financial crisis, it then proposes a new dataset of more than 70 vulnerability indicators that could be monitored to assess country risks in OECD economies. The indicators are grouped into five domestic areas: i) financial sector imbalances, ii) non-financial sector imbalances, iii) asset market imbalances, iv) public sector imbalances and v) external sector imbalances. An additional international “spillovers, contagion and global risks” category aims at capturing vulnerabilities that could transmit from one country to another through financial, trade or confidence channels. Evidence in a companion paper (Hermansen and Röhn, 2015) shows that the majority of the proposed indicators for which sufficiently long time series exists is helpful in predicting severe recessions and crises in the 34 OECD economies and Latvia between 1970 and 2014. Résilience économique: Un nouvel ensemble d'indicateurs de vulnérabilité pour les pays OCDE Les coûts élevés des crises soulignent la nécessité de renforcer la résilience des économies, notamment en évaluant à temps les vulnérabilités potentielles qui peuvent causer de tels événements onéreux. Cette étude traite tout d'abord de l’origine et de la nature des vulnérabilités potentielles dans les pays de l'OCDE qui peuvent conduire à des crises économiques coûteuses. Sur la base des résultats documentés dans la littérature récente et des leçons tirées de la crise financière mondiale, l’étude propose ensuite un nouvel ensemble de données de plus de 70 indicateurs de vulnérabilité qui pourraient permettre d’évaluer les risques pays des économies de l'OCDE. Les indicateurs sont regroupés en cinq domaines domestique: i) les déséquilibres du secteur financier, ii) les déséquilibres du secteur non-financier, iii) les déséquilibres du marché des actifs, iv) les déséquilibres du secteur public et v) les déséquilibres du secteur externe. Une catégorie supplémentaire « retombées, contagion et risques globales » vise à capter les vulnérabilités qui pourraient se transmettre d'un pays à un autre par le canal de la finance, du commerce ou de la confiance. Les résultats présentés dans un document connexe (Hermansen et Röhn, 2015) montrent que la majorité des indicateurs proposés ici pour lesquels il existe des séries temporelles suffisamment longues sont utiles pour prévoir les récessions graves et les crises dans les 34 pays de l'OCDE et la Lettonie entre 1970 et 2014.

F37|The Tobin tax in a continuous-time non-linear dynamic model of the exchange rate|Starting from a new continuous-time non-linear dynamic model of the exchange rate, we formally show that the introduction of a Tobin tax reduces speculators’ profit and influences the dynamics of the system, making it more stable and less prone to chaotic motion.
F37|Predicting Exchange Rates Out of Sample: Can Economic Fundamentals Beat the Random Walk?|This article shows that economic fundamentals can generate reliable out-of-sample forecasts for exchange rates when prediction is based on a “kitchen-sink” regression that incorporates multiple predictors. The key to establishing predictability is estimating the kitchen-sink regression with the elastic-net shrinkage method, which improves performance by reducing the effect of less informative predictors in out-of-sample forecasting. Using statistical and economic measures of predictability, we show that our approach outperforms alternative models, including the random walk, individual exchange rate models, a kitchen-sink regression estimated with ordinary least squares, standard forecast combinations, and popular ad-hoc strategies such as momentum and the 1/N strategy.
F37|Re-estimation of Keynesian Model by Considering Critical Events and Multiple Cointegrating Vectors|This study employs the Mundell (1963) and Fleming (1962) traditional flow model of exchange rate to examine the long run behaviour of rupee/US $ exchange rate for Pakistan economy over the period 1982:Q1 to 2010:Q2. This study investigates the effect of output levels, interest rates and prices and different shocks on exchange rate. Hylleberg, Engle, Granger, and Yoo (HEGY) (1990) unit root test confirms the presence of non-seasonal unit root and finds no evidence of biannual and annual frequency unit root in the level of series. Johansen and Juselious (1988, 1992) likelihood ratio test indicates three long-run cointegrating vectors. Cointegrating vectors are uniquely identified by imposing structural economic restrictions on purchasing power parity (PPP), uncovered interest parity (UIP) and current account balance. Finally, the short-run dynamic error correction model is estimated on the basis of identified cointegrated vectors. The speed of adjustment coefficient indicates that 17 percent of divergence from long-run equilibrium exchange rate path is being corrected in each quarter. US war with Afghanistan has significant impact on rupee in short run because of high inflows of US aid to Pakistan after 9/11. Finally, the parsimonious short run dynamic error correction model is able to beat the naïve random walk model at out of sample forecasting horizons.
F37|Multifractal Random Walk Models: Application to the Algerian Dinar exchange rates|This paper deals with a special class of multifractal models called the Multifractal Random Walk which has been widely used in finance because of its parsimonious framework, featuring many properties of financial data not considered in traditional linear models. Using the log-normal version, results confirm the Algerian Dinar is a multifractal process and has a rich wider variation spectrum versus the US Dollar than the Euro.
F37|Exchange Rate Modeling: The Case of Ruble|The model of the equilibrium exchange rate of ruble is under construction on the basis of streams of the balance of payments of Russia taking into account trade conditions. Export-import transactions, factors of movement of the capital, a trade condition, indexes of the internal and export prices, and real gross domestic product, factors of elasticity of the foreign trade operations, decisions of microagents are used as base determinants in the model. In the process of creating the model it was justified a number of key internal dynamic functional dependencies were found that has allowed us to put the capital flows in the model on formal logical level, and, thus, to extend the model to the case of capital mobility. We discuss the relationship results from the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate in the framework of the author's conceptual approach to the assessment of the equilibrium exchange rate based on international flows (IFEER). The technique of adjustment of model internal parametres is offered with a view of macroeconomic regulation of the exchange rate of ruble. Based on the modeling results we built the analysis of the dynamics of the nominal exchange rate of ruble in 2013- 2015.
F37|Hedger Behaviour and Its Impact on Order Flow and Exchange Rate on Foreign Exchange Markets|The paper introduces the author’s original model which describes the main behavioural traits of the foreign exchange hedger who is trying to minimise her FX market risk exposure and secure foreign currency liquidity, in order to be able to settle her liabilities in a timely manner. This behaviour is then analysed in the context of several exogenous shocks to prices and exchange rates and implications of how order flow and exchange rates react to this behaviour are drawn based on the theoretical framework. In Chapter 2, the conclusions on expected patterns in exchange rate evolution reached in the theoretical part are tested using the fuzzy clustering technique. The hypotheses reached in the theoretical section were partially supported by the empirical analysis: some of the expected patterns were revealed by the data during shock periods of prices of Brent Oil, Dow Jones Industrial Index, Standard and Poor’s 500 and four currency pairs (EURUSD, USDJPY, USDCAD, EURCZK).
F37|Foreign Exchange Risk Premia and Goods Market Frictions|Fama's (1984) volatility relations show that the risk premium in foreign exchange markets is more volatile than, and is negatively correlated with the expected rate of depreciation. This paper studies these relations from the perspective of goods markets frictions. Using a sticky-price general equilibrium model, we show that near-random walk behaviors of both exchange rates and consumption, in response to monetary shocks, can be derived endogenously. Based on this approach, the paper provides quantitative results on Fama's volatility relations.
F37|Stimulating Intra-regional Investment in SAARC|Whilst unilateral liberalization of FDI policy regimes in South Asia have made significant headway and contributed to increased FDI inflows, as a region South Asiaâ€™s success in attracting FDI, compared to other more successful trading blocs remains limited. Notably, intra-regional investment volumes remain minuscule in comparison to the already dismal level of intra-regional trade. Despite a lapse of over a decade after the implementation of SAFTA, the recent past has witnessed renewed interest in a regional investment agreement in SAARC. This article evaluates how useful a regional investment framework would be for the SAARC. The article argues that whilst a regional investment framework is critical in spurring both intra- and extra-regional FDI, it is by no means the only determinant in attracting FDI. As the experience in ASEAN suggests, in addition to a regional framework, at the country level, each SAARC member state must strive to undertake broad-based reforms to improve their individual country investment climate if they aspire to attract greater volumes of both intra- and extra-regional FDI to support its trade expansion. The article also goes on to draw lessons and best practice from the ASEAN Investment Agreement in going about designing and implementing a Regional Investment Agreement in SAARC.
F37|Volatility Spillovers And Dynamic Correlations Between Emerging Economies In Foreign Exchange And Bond Markets|The global financial crisis reached its peak when Lehman Brothers declared its bankruptcy on 15th of September, 2008. To avoid the risk of a financial collapse, the Fed has taken steps to launch several quantitative easing (QE) programs. The Fed?s first exit signal from these QE programs was given by Chairman Bernanke on the 22nd of May, 2013 during a Congress hearing. Eventually, the Fed announced its tapering decision on 18th of December, 2013. These historical shocks (events and central banks? decisions) are well known to have had a huge impact on the foreign exchange, money and credit markets, especially in such emerging countries as Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey, recently referred to as the Fragile Five. In this paper, we have four goals. We examine how these three historical shocks mentioned above affect not only the size but also the persistence of the volatilities among 1) exchange rates and 2) ten-year bond rates of the Fragile Five. We also investigate separately the dynamic interactions between 3) exchange rates and 4) ten-year bond rates of the Fragile Five. To that end, we first estimate a multivariate GARCH model (VAR-BEKK model) and derive conditional variances and dynamic (time varying) conditional correlations with covariances. Then, we analyze the effects of these historical shocks on the volatilities of exchange rates and interest rates. We utilize volatility impulse response functions (VIRFs) developed by Hafner and Herwartz (2006) to achieve these objectives.Our results suggest that all three shocks have large and positive impacts on expected conditional variances of the exchange rate and bond rate returns of the Fragile Five. Specifically, Brazil seems to be the most responsive country among the Fragile Five to the shocks under investigation both in exchange rate and bond markets, while India appears to be the least sensitive one. Regarding the dynamic conditional correlations (DCCs) among the exchange rate and ten-year bond markets of the Fragile Five, we find that the DCC series of bond returns exhibit much lower correlations than those associated with exchange rate returns. This result indicates that ten-year bond markets provide a better diversification opportunity than foreign exchange markets in the Fragile Five. However, our results demonstrate that the correlations among the ten-year bond markets exhibit more volatility than the ones among exchange rate markets.
F37|ETFs performance Europe- a good start or not?|Under the premises that the U.S. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) hold over 70% of the ETFs? World market, it seems that the European ones have been either under-researched or less demanded. This study provides some insights into the performance of two ETFs hubs, holding over 80% of the European ETFs activity, namely those operating in Luxembourg and Ireland, due also to their tax similarities. Following an updated literature review on the topic, the paper compares these two ETFs hubs by using secondary data publicly available, interpreted under a framework of previously identified performance methods: Tracking Error, Jensen?s alpha and Modigliani- M2 measure of performance. This methodology completes the descriptive statistics analysis, while aiming at answering two hypotheses. The first hypothesis states that the Tracking Error of ETFs compared to their benchmark or market indexes equals zero, which is confirmed by the study. The second hypothesis suggests that these particular ETFs do not present significant alphas, which is partially confirmed. Moreover, the second hypothesis is tested not only against various features of these funds ?benchmarks, but also from risk measurement perspectives, while employing correlation significance between the two countries ETFs. Overall, it appears that from the risk adjusted performance perspective, the ETFs domiciled in Luxembourg outperform the Irish ones, leading also to potential M&As in this industry.
F37|Private information, capital flows, and exchange rates|Not all international capital flows influence exchange rates equally. Capital flows induced by foreign investors’ transactions in local stock markets have an impact on exchange rates that is economically significant and permanent, whereas capital flows induced by investors’ transactions in local government bond markets do not. The differences in price impacts are related to differences in the amounts of private information conveyed by these flows. Our findings are based on daily-frequency data on all transactions undertaken by foreign investors in the stock, bond, and onshore FX markets of Thailand over a period of nearly two years.
F37|Recurrent support vector regression for a non-linear ARMA model with applications to forecasting financial returns|Motivated by recurrent neural networks, this paper proposes a recurrent support vector regression (SVR) procedure to forecast nonlinear ARMA model based simulated data and real data of financial returns. The forecasting ability of the recurrent SVR based ARMA model is compared with five competing models (random walk, threshold ARMA model, MLE based ARMA model, recurrent artificial neural network based ARMA model and feed-forward SVR based ARMA model) by using two forecasting accuracy evaluation metrics (NSME and sign) and robust Diebold–Mariano test. The results reveal that for one-step-ahead forecasting, the recurrent SVR model is consistently better than the benchmark models in forecasting both the magnitude and turning points, and statistically improves the forecasting performance as opposed to the usual feed-forward SVR.
