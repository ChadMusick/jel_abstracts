L93|Airport charges and marginal costs for Spanish airports before the process of partial privatization|Airport pricing is considered as one of the most relevant issues for policymakers. According transport policy, pricing schemes should be at least partially based on marginal costs. This article aims at comparing the most relevant aeronautical airport charges with their corresponding marginal costs for the Spanish airports in the period before the partial privatization process. To that end, we have built very detailed airport charge variables, and then, have estimated a flexible short-run variable cost function system using a panel of thirty-five airports over a 6-year period. The results show that the evolution of aeronautical airport charges does not follow the trend of marginal costs. Moreover, these charges are set above the shortrun marginal costs with the exception of the smallest and insular airports. Finally, we find the existence of non-neutral technological change and excess of capacity for the Spanish airports.
L93|Increasing clicks through advanced targeting: Applying the third-party seal model to airline advertising|From five-star hotels and Michelin Star restaurants, few industries signal their quality and unique selling points through the use of third-party seals like tourism. However, despite using seals and certifications in advertising being widespread, little academic research has been conducted into their effectiveness. Through the running of campaigns on Facebook’s Ad Manager for Indian airline Jet Airways, this study applies the Third-Party Seal Model to optimise campaign audiences to target the right prospects with the most effective message. Findings and a practical framework for optimal campaign delivery for the airline industry are presented.
L93|A case study on Germany's aviation tax using the synthetic control approach|The German Aviation Tax (AT) is a tax levied on departing passengers from German airports. The synthetic control method is used to generate counterfactual passenger numbers for German airports. The synthetic control method is used to generate counterfactual passenger numbers for German airports, and for airports outside Germany but near the German border. The results presented are consistent with cross-border substitution of passenger demand in response to AT. Most AT exempt airports near the borders have made sizable, significant, gains in passenger numbers since Germany introduced AT. Within Germany, there appears to be a clear distinction in the impact on small/regional airports and that on larger hubs.
L93|International airline codesharing and consumer choice behavior: misconceptions vs. quality signals|We examine the impact of airline codesharing on consumer choice behavior in non-stop international route markets. Using stated preference data, we document that consumer valuation of flights by alien foreign carriers is significantly higher if these flights are offered as codeshare products by consumers' own national carrier or, to a lesser extent, a neighboring national carrier. We empirically rule out quality improvements and frequent flier programs as underlying drivers and explore two alternative explanations: misconceptions about codesharing and codesharing as a quality signal. We find that misconceptions are widespread, but that they do not cause higher valuation of codeshare products. Consistent with signaling, however, codeshare products are valued higher by more risk-averse consumers and on less familiar routes.
L93|Scale and (quasi) scope economies in airport technology. An application to UK airports|In this study we consider a sample of the largest UK airports in order to estimate, for the first time for this sector, a multiproduct cost function using a flexible technology that nests most of the specifications commonly employed in the empirical literature. Another novelty of this work is that we provide estimates of quasi- scope economies for the airport industry, defined as the cost advantage for a diversified firm of jointly providing a set of outputs/services with respect to the costs of their provision through a set of firms quasi-specialized in a single production. Our main results suggest the existence of quasi-scope economies that tend to decline with the size of the airport. This finding, coupled with the results of a set of cost complementarity tests, suggest that cost savings mainly arise from the joint provision of services for national and international passengers and, to a lesser extent, to the addition of cargo transport activities. In turn, pairs of outputs that include (a proxy of) commercial revenues seem to be characterized by anti-cost complementarities. Finally, global economies of scale seem to be exhausted at about five million passengers.
L93|Tourism demand, low cost carriers and European institutions: The case of Brussels|The flow of tourism to a region is highly dependent on its accessibility and the cost of travel represents the main economic factor explaining tourism demand. The arrival of low cost carriers (LCC), with cheaper air fares, greatly leveraged the tourist flow around the world. However, as argued by some authors, if the destination is unique the importance of accessibility could be less relevant. Using quarterly data from 2000 to 2015, the paper assesses the effect of LCC on tourism demand focusing on Brussels. The peculiarity of Brussels comes from the high concentration of European and International institutions located in the city, which makes it a very interesting and singular case of research. Results reveal that LCC per se have a smaller positive effect on tourism demand for business purpose than the specific characteristic of Brussels. Indeed, the presence of European institutions complements the higher availability of low air fares, especially for business travellers.
L93|Price Discrimination in International Airline Markets|We develop a model of inter-temporal and intra-temporal price discrimination by airlines to study the ability of different discriminatory mechanisms to remove sources of inefficiency and the associated distributional implications. To estimate the model’s multi-dimensional distribution of preference heterogeneity, we use unique data from international airline markets with flight-level variation in prices across time and cabins, and information on passengers’ reason for travel. We find that current pricing practices grant late-arriving business passengers substantial informational rents and yield 81% of first-best welfare, with stochastic demand and asymmetric information accounting for 65% and 35% of the gap, respectively.
L93|Airline Alliances and Service Quality|Convenient scheduling, characterized by adequate flight frequency, is the main quality attribute for airline services. However, the effect of airline alliances on this important dimension of service quality has received almost no attention in the literature. This paper fills this gap by providing such an analysis in a model where flight frequency affects schedule delay and connecting layover time. While an alliance raises service quality when layover time has zero cost, the reverse occurs when layover time is costly. The source of this surprising result is that costly layovers eliminate the additive structure of the full trip price, which consists of the sum of the subfares plus the weighted sum of the reciprocal flight frequencies when layover cost is zero. The paper also shows that nonaligned carriers adjust frequencies to suit passenger preferences in business and leisure markets, while an alliance is less responsive to such preference differences. With hub-airport congestion, greater internalization by allied carriers tends to reduce frequency, but this force is not enough to overturn the positive alliance effect in the low-cost layover case.
L93|Flying more efficiently: joint impacts of fuel prices, capital costs and fleet size on airline fleet fuel economy|We investigate the factors that affect airlines’ choice of fleet fuel economy using plane- level data for 1267 airlines in 174 countries. Larger and newer planes are usually more fuel- efficient. Controlling for the effect of aircraft size and age, we find that the technically achievable fleet fuel economy improves with the size of airlines and the price of fuel and worsens with higher capital costs. The elasticity of fuel economy with respect to the price of fuel is between -0.07 and -0.13. We find evidence for regional differences in fleet fuel economy that are attributable to the adoption of distinct groups of technologies.
L93|Impact of Decentralized Electrification Projects on Sustainable Development: A Meta-Analysis|This paper is the first product of a project which aims to build a Collaborative Smart Mapping of Mini-grid Action (CoSMMA), whose principal objective is to identify best practice in decentralized electrification projects. Using evaluations of 421 projects, from published research papers, we built a pilot CoSMMA which proves its feasibility. Its relevance is demonstrated by a meta-analysis, which reveals the principal characteristics of decentralized electrification projects which have positive impacts on sustainable development. Four main characteristics were considered: technology (source or energy), system size (power), decision level (from local to country level) geographic location. When searching for best practices, technology and system size must be considered together, because the chosen technology may constrain the power, which is provided by the system. We find that the most popular projects, which are based on Solar Home Systems (SHS) are not the most effective. The problem with SHS is not the use of solar energy, but the small system size often chosen for SHS. Mini-grids, of larger size, especially those which use hybrid renewable sources of energy, have more positive impacts, because these systems combine the benefits of sustainability and flexibility. In terms of decision level, we find that both top-down and bottom-up approaches have advantages, with the observation of a U-shaped curve for the influence of the decision level on the probability of obtaining positive impacts. Geographical location matters, as it is very often the key to system feasibility. We find that DEPs are more effective in Latin America than in Asia, and more effective in Asia than in Africa. We also attempted to study the type of effects resulting from DEPs. Descriptive data suggest that for some types of effects, positive impacts are more likely than for others. Decentralized electrification projects have a more positive impact on Lifestyle & NICT or Household agenda than on Economic transformation or Community life. However, this pilot CoSMMA does not contain enough information to study precisely the types of effects, because some types of effects have not been studied frequently in the existing literature. This is the case, for instance, for environmental effects, which have been rarely measured scientifically. Finally, we attempted to broaden our information set by including expert data, which was entered into the CoSMMA meta-analysis. We define expert data as data that are not supported by statistical tests with measures of significance, whereas the evaluations based on scientific data were supported by statistical tests of significance. The expert data may be valid, but our attempt to include it in the analysis failed at this stage. The determinants of unproven effects appear to be quite different from the determinants of proven effects in our meta-analysis, and using expert data would imply merging proven and unproven effects, which would totally blur the conclusions

L93|Endogenous and Selective Service Choices After Airline Mergers|We estimate a model of service choice and price competition in airline markets, allowing for the carriers that provide nonstop service to be a selected subset of the carriers competing in the market. Our model can be estimated without an excessive computational burden and we use the estimated model to illustrate the effects of selection on equilibrium market structure and to show how accounting for selection can change predictions about post-merger market power and repositioning, in ways that are consistent with what has been observed after actual mergers, and possible merger remedies.
L93|How Do Travel Costs Shape Collaboration?|We develop a simple theoretical framework for thinking about how geographic frictions, and in particular travel costs, shape scientists' collaboration decisions and the types of projects that are developed locally versus over distance. We then take advantage of a quasi-experiment — the introduction of new routes by a low-cost airline — to test the predictions of the theory. Results show that travel costs constitute an important friction to collaboration: after a low-cost airline enters, the number of collaborations increases between 0.3 and 1.1 times, a result that is robust to multiple falsification tests and causal in nature. The reduction in geographic frictions is particularly beneficial for high quality scientists that are otherwise embedded in worse local environments. Consistent with the theory, lower travel costs also endogenously change the types of projects scientists engage in at different levels of distance. After the shock, we observe an increase in higher quality and novel projects, as well as projects that take advantage of complementary knowledge and skills between sub-fields, and that rely on specialized equipment. We test the generalizability of our findings from chemistry to a broader dataset of scientific publications, and to a different field where specialized equipment is less likely to be relevant, mathematics. Last, we discuss implications for the formation of collaborative R&D teams over distance.
L93|Air passengers during the economic crisis: The Spanish case|This paper examines whether there is a relationship between the recent economic and financial crisis and air passengers in Spain. Static and dynamic models are estimated using data for the period 2004-2016. Initially, no relationship can be discerned between the variables; however, the estimates also show a possible dynamic relationship between the economic crisis and the number of passengers using Spanish airports, depending on the proportion of low-cost airlines at each airport.
L93|Dynamic Price Discrimination in Airlines|Prices for the same flight change substantially depending on the time of purchase. Labeling this time-variation as discriminatory is misleading because the cost of an unsold airline seat changes with inventory, days before departure and aggregate demand expectations. This paper uses a unique dataset with round-the-clock posted fares to identify a dynamic price discrimination component. Consistent with agents forming expectations of future prices, we find higher prices during office hours (when business travelers are likely to buy tickets) and lower prices in the evening (when leisure travelers are more likely to purchase). As the proportion of business travelers increases closer to departure, both price dispersion and price discrimination become larger. We also find that price discrimination is more pronounced for low cost carriers than for legacy carriers.
L93|An Analysis of Dynamic Price Discrimination in Airlines|Prices for the same flight change substantially depending on the time of purchase. This article uses a unique data set with round‐the‐clock posted fares to document significant within‐day price variation. Labeling time‐variation as discriminatory is difficult because the cost of an unsold airline seat changes with inventory, days before departure, and aggregate demand expectations. After controlling for these factors and aggregating hourly fares to have a framework with two consumer types, we are able to identify a component that is largely consistent with dynamic price discrimination. We find higher prices during office hours (when business travelers are likely to buy) and lower prices in the evening (when leisure travelers are more likely to purchase). As the proportion of business travelers increases closer to departure, both price dispersion and price discrimination become larger. We provide an alternative explanation for the observed within‐day price differentials which is related to Edgeworth price cycles.

L93|Firms’ Markup, Cost, and Price Changes when Policymakers Permit Collusion: Does Antitrust Immunity Matter?|Airlines wanting to cooperatively set prices for their international air travel service must apply to the relevant authorities for antitrust immunity (ATI). Whether consumers, on net, benefit from a grant of ATI to partner airlines has caused much public debate. This paper investigates the impact of granting ATI to oneworld alliance members on their price, markup, and various measures of cost. The evidence suggests that implementation of the oneworld alliance without ATI did not have a statistically significant impact on the markup of products offered by the members, and there is no evidence that the subsequent grant of ATI to various members resulted in higher markups on their products. We find evidence suggesting that the grant of ATI facilitated a decrease in partner carriers’ marginal and fixed costs. Furthermore, member carriers’ price did not increase (decreased) in markets where their services do (do not) overlap, implying that consumers, on net, benefit from the grant of ATI in terms of price changes.
L93|The Aerospace Cluster in Washington State, Microeconomics of Competitiveness Study Case|The paper analyzes the development of the Washington cluster in the aeronautics industry and the factors that contributed to this continuous and substantial growth. In the first section of the text it is described the profile of the country as well as the region and the city, in order to understand the exogenous factors that made possible the enrichment of the aerospace cluster in that particular area. Moving further with the analysis, the paper identifies the main competition from rival clusters, emphasizing the strengths of each rival cluster in comparison with the aeronautics cluster from Washington. A cluster map is provided later in the study, for explaining the intertwined relation between many supporting industries that help sustain the aerospace cluster. Additionally, the text explores the performance of the cluster and the overall competitiveness in the business environment. In the end, the paper seeks to answer the question: What are the key issues that the cluster is facing?
L93|Network Structure and Consolidation in the U.S. Airline Industry, 1990–2015|Abstract We study the effect of consolidation on airline network connectivity using three measures of centrality from graph theory: Degree; Closeness; and Betweenness. Changes in these measures from 1990 to 2015 imply: (i) the average airport services a greater proportion of possible routes; (ii) the average origin airport is fewer stops away from any given destination; and (iii) the average hub is less often along the shortest route between two other airports. Yet, we find the trend toward greater connectivity in the national network structure is largely unaffected by consolidation—in the form of mergers and codeshare agreements—during this period.
L93|Dynamic Airline Pricing and Seat Availability|Airfares are determined by both intertemporal price discrimination and dynamic adjustment to stochastic demand. I estimate a model of dynamic airline pricing accounting for both forces with new flight-level data. With model estimates, I disentangle key interactions between the arrival pattern of consumer types and remaining capacity under stochastic demand. I show that the forces are complements in airline markets and lead to significantly higher revenues, as well as increased consumer surplus, compared to a more restrictive pricing regime. Finally, I show that abstracting from stochastic demand leads to a systematic bias in estimating demand elasticities.
L93|Fly and trade: Evidence from the Italian manufacturing industry|This paper offers an empirical investigation of the relationship between air transport service and trade, using a panel of 20 Italian regions and 24 European countries observed, half-yearly, over the period 1998–2010. We apply a Newey-West two-step GMM estimator to produce estimates which are robust to the presence of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. Our findings suggest that air transport service positively affects the export of Italian manufacturers and that full-service carriers are mainly responsible for this result.
L93|Low natural gas prices and the financial cost of ramp rate restrictions at hydroelectric dams|Peaking hydroelectric dams that employ variable, stop-start reservoir releases can have adverse impacts on downstream river ecosystems. Efforts to mitigate these impacts have relied predominantly on the use of ramp rate restrictions, which limit the magnitude of hour-to-hour changes in reservoir discharge. Ramp rate restrictions shift hydropower production towards less valuable off-peak hours, imposing a financial penalty on dam owners that is a function of the “spread” (difference) between peak and off-peak electricity prices. This study examines how low natural gas prices in the U.S. have reduced the cost of implementing ramp rate restrictions at dams by narrowing the peak/off-peak price spread. Significantly lower costs of ramp rate restrictions could open new opportunities for improving environmental flows at dams, including the “purchase” of more natural streamflow patterns by downstream stakeholders, a type of arrangement for which there is growing precedent. We also explore the role that uncertainty in the cost of ramp rate restrictions could play in precluding downstream stakeholders from forming these types of agreements with dam owners. Results suggest that financial “collar” contracts could mostly eliminate inter-annual variability in the net cost of restrictions and provide those purchasing more natural flows with greater certainty.
L93|Airline code-sharing and its effects on on-time performance|Although airline on-time performance has always received much attention, we are unaware of any empirical research that measures the on-time performance effects of domestic airline alliances. In this study, we empirically investigate the on-time performance effects of the largest domestic allianceâ€”between Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and Continental Airlines. We find evidence that code-sharing improves alliance partners' on-time performance and that the size of the codeshare effect on on-time performance depends on pre-alliance competition in a market, with the effect being larger in markets where the partners competed in prior to the alliance.
L93|Leasing and profitability: Empirical evidence from the airline industry|In this paper, we empirically measure the impact of aircraft leasing choices on airlines financial performance. We use public data on 73 airlines operating worldwide over the period 1996–2011. In estimating the impact of leasing on profitability, we control for potential endogeneity by applying robust instrumental variables estimation, while introducing a set of individual and macroeconomic factors. Our results are threefold. First, we identify a non-monotonic and concave effect of leasing on an airline’s profit margin, suggesting decreasing marginal returns to leasing in this sector. This is an original finding for the industry. We also derive a confidence interval for the optimal level of leasing. Second, we show that the impact of leasing on an airline’s operating profit is stronger for Low Cost Carriers than for Full Cost Carriers: deviating from the optimal level of leasing might be more harmful for a LCC than for a legacy carrier. Finally, we analyze how an airline’s experience affects the relationship between leasing and profitability.
L93|Dynamic pricing and market segmentation responses to low-cost carrier entry|This paper develops an empirical model of online airfares to inspect the impact of the entry of a low-cost carrier (LCC). We utilize a database collected from the website of an online travel agent in Brazil. We test whether incumbents reshape their airfare temporal profiles in an attempt to attract the price-sensitive passengers who constitute the target market of the newcomer. Our results suggest that LCC entry partially spoils the existing market segmentation schemes of incumbents, forcing them to revise their distribution management strategy, simplify their fare structure and migrate from a non-monotonic to a weakly monotonic price curve.
L93|The spatial scope of airline competition|We investigate whether alternative city- or airport pairs are viable substitutes and the extent to which they impact airline competition between the United Kingdom and continental Europe. To this end, we employ and measure airlines’ best responses in equilibrium. Using monthly airline-route seat capacity levels and two stage least-squares dummy-variables regression models, we estimate airlines’ strategic reaction to the competitors’ capacity levels, including competitors on other routes. We show that airlines’ relevant market extends beyond the airport-pair level. Strategic reactions depend on airline type, but all airline types have a similar strategic reaction towards high speed rail.
L93|The Effects of Terror on International Air Passenger Transport: An Empirical Investigation|This paper presents a theoretical model (adapted from the structural gravity model by Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003) to capture the effects of terrorism on air passenger traffic between nations affected by terrorism. We then use equations derived from this model, in conjunction with alternative functional forms for trade costs, to estimate the effects of terrorism on bilateral air passenger flows from 57 source countries to 25 destination countries for the period of 2000 to 2014. We find that an additional terrorist incident results in approximately a 1.2% decrease in the bilateral air passenger transport per unit distance while doubling of the accumulated terrorist incidents during the past 5 years reduces it by 18%. Terrorism adversely impacts the bilateral air passenger transport per unit distance both by reducing national output and especially by increasing psychological distress, which could be an important contributing factor in perceived travel costs. Last but not the least, we show that the responsiveness of international air travel to terrorism critically depends on the nature of the terrorist attacks. Specifically, international air passenger transport is found to be extremely sensitive to fatal terrorist attacks and terrorist attacks of targets such as airports, transportation or tourists.
L93|When Hotelling meets Vickrey. Service timing and spatial asymmetry in the airline industry|This paper analyzes rivalry between transport facilities in a model that includes two sources of horizontal differentiation: geographical location and departure time. We explore how both sources influence facility fees and the price of the service offered by downstream carriers. Travelers’ costs include a fare, a transportation cost to the facility and a schedule delay cost. The interactions in the facility-carrier model are represented as a sequential three-stage game in fees, times and fares. Duopolistic competition leads to an identical departure time across carriers when their operating costs do not vary with the time of day, but generally leads to distinct service times when this cost is time-dependent. We also find that higher per-passenger commercial revenue at one facility induces a lower fee charged by both facilities to their carrier and a lower fare charged by both carriers at their departure facility, while a lower marginal operating cost for one carrier implies a higher fee at its departure facility, a lower fee at the rival carrier’s facility and a lower fare at both facilities. Finally, we show that the socially optimal schedule differentiation decreases in the distance between facilities and in the unit transportation cost incurred by travelers, and increases in the unit schedule delay cost incurred by travelers as well as in the marginal time cost faced by carriers.
L93|Input Third-degree Price Discrimination in Transport Markets|We study the efficiency of input third-degree price discrimination in transport markets. Relevant cases are transport facilities such as airports, seaports and railway stations that sell access to the infrastructure to downstream firms. The two key distinctive features of these markets are the presence of negative consumption externalities and of public ownership (domestic-welfare maximizing sellers). We find that each of these features enlarges the extent to which input price discrimination is desirable. Our main result suggests that the current practice of enforcing a ban on input price discrimination by congestible facilities may be in place at the cost of efficiency.
L93|Airport Efficiency in Pakistan - A Data Envelopment Analysis with Weight Restrictions|This paper investigates the airports in Pakistan for potential cost inefficiencies. We identify inefficiencies by benchmarking the productive performance of airports using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). To improve the ability of DEA to differentiate performance levels, we analyze airport functions individually, using separate DEA models. In addition, restrictions are imposed on the possible weights of inputs and outputs in the DEA procedure, in order to improve the differentiation of performance. The definition of these weight restrictions is based on additional information on feasible production trade-offs and relative input prices. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first application of predefined weight restrictions in a DEA analysis of airport efficiency. The results suggest that there are cost inefficiencies at several airports, which are mainly caused by overstaffing and overinvestment in capacity. Furthermore, we find that the operational scale of most airports is inefficiently small, so that increases in traffic will result in declining unit costs.
L93|Economic importance of air transport and airport activities in Belgium – Report 2015|This study assesses the economic importance of air transport and airport activities in Belgium in terms of value added, employment and investment over the 2013-2015 period 1 . The sector considered embraces not only the activities directly connected with air transport, but also all those that take place on site at the six Belgian airports (Antwerp, Brussels,Charleroi, Kortrijk, Liège and Ostend). The study reviews the direct and indirect effects of the sector on the basis of microeconomic data (mainly obtained from the Central Balance Sheet Office) and mesoeconomic data (from the National Accounts Institute). It also includes a social balance sheet analysis and an indication of credit risk using statistical models from the NBB’s In-house Credit Assessment System (ICAS). In 2015, air transport and airport activities generated € 6 billion in direct and indirect value added (i.e. 1.5 % of Belgian GDP) and employed around 62 500 people in full-time equivalents (FTEs)either directly or indirectly (1.5 % of domestic employment including the self-employed). Brussels and Liège Airport remain the country’s biggest airports, respectively in terms of passenger and cargo traffic. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in March 2016, the regional airports received part of Brussels’ passenger traffic. All in all, Brussels recovered fairly quickly, especially freight traffic, but also passenger traffic resumed gradually to tie in with growth again since November 2016. Brussels and Liège are the fastest growing airports during the 2013-2015 period, respectively in terms of value added and employment. At Ostend Airport, these economic variables slumped in line with the evolution of freight traffic volumes. Antwerp’s growth rates went into the red as well, mainly under the influence of the difficulties faced by VLM Airlines. At Charleroi and Liège, the trend of value added is downward, while that is not the case for employment. The smallest changes are recorded in Kortrijk.
L93|Exit, Tweets, and Loyalty|"Hirshman's Exit, Voice, and Loyalty highlights the role of ""voice"" in disciplining firms for low quality. We develop a formal model of voice as a relational contact between firms and consumers and show that voice is more likely to emerge in concentrated markets. We test this model using data on tweets to major U.S. airlines. We find that tweet volume increases when quality - measured by on-time performance - deteriorates, especially when the airline operates a large shared\ of the flights in a market. We also find that airlines are more likely to respond to tweets from consumers in such markets."
L93|Airport, airline and departure time choice and substitution patterns: An empirical analysis|This paper uses the random-coefficients logit methodology that controls for potential endogeneity of prices and allows for general substitution patterns to estimate various demand systems. The estimation takes advantage of an original ticket-level revealed preference data set on travels from the New York City area to Toronto that contains prices and characteristics of not only flight choices but also of all non-booked alternative flights. Consistent with having higher valuations, our results show that travelers buying closer to departure have a higher utility of flying. Moreover, consumers’ heterogeneity decreases as the flight date nears. At the carrier level, we identify which carriers have more price-sensitive consumers and which carriers face greater competition. In addition, the results suggest that our multi-airport metropolitan area can be considered as a single market and that JFK and Newark are relatively closer substitutes. Overall, consumers are more willing to switch to alternative carriers than between airports or departure times.
L93|Entry Deterrence And Strategic Alliances|Researchers have written extensively on the impact that strategic alliances between airlines have on airfare, but little is known of the market entry deterrent impact of strategic alliances. Using a structural econometric model, this paper examines the market entry deterrent impact of codesharing, a form of strategic alliance, between incumbent carriers in domestic air travel markets. We find evidence of market entry deterrence, but deterrence impact depends on the specific type of codesharing between market incumbents as well as the identity of the potential entrant. We quantify the extent to which market incumbents' codesharing influences potential entrants' market entry cost and probability of market entry. (JEL L13, L93)
L93|Determinants of Route Presence in the EU Airline Industry|This paper investigates the determinants of airlines’ route presence in the single EU aviation market by estimating two probit models - one for full-service airlines and one for low-cost carriers - which specify the presence (or absence) of an airline’s service on the route as a function of its airport presence measures, the competition it faces from other airlines, and general route characteristics. The results point to the existence of dominant-firm advantages, domestic-firm privileges, and substantial airport-facilities-related barriers to entry in the EU airline industry. They further indicate that served routes are characterized by relative time efficiency of air travel (in comparison to car travel), large endpoint cities’ populations as well as per capita GDPs; and that competitive effects between full-service and low-cost airlines are asymmetric.
L93|The role of direct flights in trade costs|Abstract Effects of direct flights on trade costs are investigated using micro price data at the city level. After controlling for local retail/distribution costs, traded input prices are obtained to be further used in the measurement of trade costs across cities through arbitrage conditions. The existence of a direct flight enters trade costs regressions negatively and significantly. The results are shown to be robust to the consideration of many control variables, nonlinearities in the effects of distance on trade costs, possible endogeneity of having direct flights between cities and alternative definitions of the data. The direct flights that are shown to be determined by bilateral air services agreements are further shown to reduce trade costs through an endogeneity analysis; the main policy implications are twofold: (i) international trade policies through aviation services, such as Open Skies Agreements of the US, are alternative trade policy tools to reduce international trade barriers; (ii) direct flights facilitate the integration of internal markets as in the case of European Union.
L93|Domestic Market Power in the International Airline Industry|We posit and empirically test the hypothesis that airlines are able to charge a fare premium in markets that originate in their domestic country relative to similar markets that originate in foreign countries. To this end, we focus on intercontinental one-stop air travel trips for which the main, intercontinental, flight legs are identical, while the feeder legs depart from a mixture of domestic- and foreign origins. We collect a unique database of published fares for such trips and estimate reduced form fare regressions with main flight leg fixed effects. We find that trips from and to domestic airports (compared with foreign airports) are characterized by about 9.5 per cent higher fares, even after adding controls for airport dominance, trip operating costs, the competitive environment and origin catchment area characteristics. These findings demonstrate that airlines have substantial domestic market power, enabling them to raise fares at their domestic airports irrespective of aforementioned market conditions. The magnitude of this domestic country effect is large relative to the traditional airport dominance effect, suggesting that the distinction between domestic- and foreign origins is a crucial determinant of the degree of market power that airlines can exert in the international airline industry.
L93|The Impact of Airline Mergers on Quality: Why Do Different Mergers Have Such Different Effects?|We investigate the impacts of five airline mergers on one quality dimension, namely route frequency. We use monthly data on routes between the largest 64 US cities from 1999 to 2016. On average, the mergers decrease the frequency, but there are large differences between the five mergers. We hypothesize that these differences resulted from differences in the market and network structures. Our estimations indicate that, if a destination has more connecting flights of the merging airlines, the merger is less detrimental to the frequency, possibly because the merger removes serial marginalization in the quality and price setting. For the market structure effect, we use two distinct set-ups. In the first set-up, the effects of mergers depend on a lagged variable measuring the current market structure. On routes with stronger competition, mergers decrease the frequency more, possibly due to a larger effect on the market structure. When the merging airlines control all the flights, mergers have almost no impact on the frequency. The second set-up uses the market structure before the merger. When one of the merging partners controlled all the flights between two airports, the merger does not directly affect the market structure and seems to have little to no impact on the frequency. Surprisingly, if both partners were flying between two airports before the merger, this merger does not seem to be more harmful to the frequency than when only one partner was operating on the route.
L93|The total size of an airline and the quality of its flights|We examine the relationship between the total size of an airline and its service quality by analysing over 4.8 million domestic flights within the USA in 2016. The total size of an airline is measured by its total market share, total amount of assets or total number of full-time equivalent employees. Delays are a widely used proxy for service quality and the most common category of airline customer complaints. Numerous regressions have been estimated using arrival delay time and whether a flight arrives on time as dependent variables. The regressors of main interest were the total airline size and the degree of competition on the route and airport. We control for weather, congestion, date, and characteristics of the airport, flight and airplane. The results suggest that the larger the total size of an airline, the smaller its average delay time and delay occurrence. Hence, larger airlines seem to offer a higher quality in terms of delays. We also find that an origin airport with less competition may lead to more delays. Surprisingly, a less competitive route may reduce delays.
L93|US Open Skies Agreements and Unlevel Playing Fields|We examine the relationship between â€˜Open Skiesâ€™ agreements (OSAs) signed between the USA and various countries or regions on these markets and the absence of a so called â€˜level playing fieldâ€™; i.e. the existence of subsidies and other forms of protection that advantage one nationâ€™s airlines over those of co-signatories to an OSA. We argue that under an oligopoly market structure, strategic competition brought about by OSAs creates incentives to subsidize and/or protect domestic airlines. Such incentives are maintained or amplified by political lobbying efforts that bias civil aviation policies towards producer interests over wider measures of economic welfare. We report on financial aid and policies which have co-evolved along with OSAs and which have advantaged US airlines during the OSA period and which suggest that unlevel playing fields have been perpetuated and possibly made more unlevel during the era of OSAs.
L93|The effects of low cost carrier entry in the Turkish Airline industry|Abstract The paper examines the impact of low-cost carrier Pegasus Airlines’ entry on Turkish Airlines’ yields in domestic and international routes. We find that Turkish Airlines’ yields are lower in both types of routes in response to entry. Moreover, the LCC entry affects domestic routes substantially more than international routes. Due to lower fares and heightened competition, the number of passengers has more than quadrupled in the last decade. Hence, we argue that Pegasus entry has been instrumental in transforming the Turkish Airline industry, which has become more dynamically competitive recently.

Seit 2012 unterliegen die CO2-Emissionen des internationalen Luftverkehrs in Europa dem EU-Emissionshandel — allerdings bis Ende 2016 in regional erheblich eingeschränktem Umfang. Ab 2020 soll eine „marktbasierte Maßnahme“ zur Begrenzung der CO2-Emissionen des internationalen Luftverkehrs auf globaler Ebene eingeführt werden. Um das zurzeit geltende System weiterzuentwickeln hat die EUKommission unterschiedliche Ausgestaltungsoptionen, die im Hinblick auf die damit verbundenen emissionsbezogenen und ökonomischen Effekte analysiert werden.

Etwa ein Viertel der innereuropäischen Verbindungen ist potenziell vom Brexit betroffen. Bis zu 14% gelten aufgrund der Rechtslage als besonders gefährdet. Diese Verbindungen werden vor allem von Ryanair und easyJet angeboten. Sollten beide Billigflieger umstrukturieren, könnte sich die Angebotsstruktur im EU-Luftverkehr deutlich verändern. Auf der Nachfrageseite ist durch eine sinkende Wirtschaftsleistung für den deutschen Luftverkehr eine Dämpfung des Wachstums um 0,1 Prozentpunkte zu erwarten.
L93|Did Cheaper Flights Change the Direction of Science?|We test how a reduction in travel cost affects the rate and direction of scientific research. Using a fine-grained, scientist-level dataset within chemistry (1991-2012), we find that after Southwest Airlines enters a new route, scientific collaboration increases by 50%, an effect that is magnified when weighting output by quality. The benefits from the lower fares, however, are not uniform across scientist types: younger scientists and scientists that are more productive than their local peers respond the most. Thus, cheaper flights, by reducing frictions otherwise induced by geography and allowing for additional face-to-face interactions, seem to enable better matches over distance.
L93|Combination of Forecasts across Estimation Windows: An Application to Air Travel Demand|This paper applies combining forecasts of air travel demand generated from the same model but over different estimation windows. The combination approach used resorts to Pesaran and Pick (2011), but the empirical application is extended in several ways. The forecasts are based on a seasonal Box-Jenkins model (SARIMA), which is adequate to forecast monthly air travel demand with distinct seasonal patterns at the largest German airport Frankfurt am Main. Furthermore, forecasts with forecast horizons from one to twelve months-ahead, which are based on different average estimation windows, expanding windows and single rolling windows, are compared with baseline forecasts based on an expanding window of the observations after a structural break. The forecast exercise shows that the average window forecasts mostly outperform the alternative single window forecasts.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L93|¿Son las aerolíneas latinoamericanas más ineficientes? Estimaciones con fronteras estocásticas|Este trabajo se propone responder las siguientes preguntas: ¿cuál es el nivel medio de eficiencia en el transporte de pasajeros de una muestra de aerolíneas que operan en el Hemisferio Occidental? ¿Cómo se posicionan aerolíneas latinoamericanas puestas en perspectiva con otras de países desarrollados que operan en las Américas? ¿Hay diferencias de eficiencia así definida entre las aerolíneas de la muestra? ¿A qué se deben? Para contestarlas, se emplean técnicas de frontera estocástica. Son novedades a estudios preexistentes el uso de una amplia gama de alternativas de estimación y el estudio específico de las aerolíneas latinoamericanas junto con las norteamericanas. This study aims to answer the following questions: which is the average efficiency level in passenger transportation of an airline sample operating in the Western Hemisphere? How do Latin American airlines perform in comparison with American ones? Are there technical efficiency differences between airlines of the sample? Why? To answer, we employ stochastic frontier methods and we add to precedent studies the usage of an ample set of alternative techniques and the specific consideration to Latin American airlines.
L93|Competitividad en el transporte aéreo en Colombia|En este trabajo se analiza la competitividad del sector del transporte aéreo en Colombia. Para ello se estudia la situación actual, la política pública, el marco institucional, las inversiones públicas y privadas en los últimos veinte años, la cadena de los servicios aeronáuticos, las concesiones aeroportuarias y los factores determinantes de la competitividad de los aeropuertos colombianos. La eficiencia de los aeropuertos es central para lograr altos estándares de la operación aérea y de la competitividad del país. Se calcula entonces una frontera de eficiencia técnica para 22 aeropuertos colombianos usando el método del Análisis envolvente de datos (Data Envelopment Analysis, DEA) y se obtiene un ranquin de aeropuertos. Mediante un modelo de regresión truncada se identifican los factores que explican las diferencias en la eficiencia técnica entre los aeropuertos analizados. De otra parte, la competitividad de los aeropuertos del país se examina bajo dos ópticas: por un lado, con la metodología de la ventaja competitiva (Michael Porter, Índice de Competitividad del Foro Económico Mundial), se construye aquí un índice de Competitividad Aeroportuaria; por otro lado, se examina la incidencia de los costos que los aeropuertos en la competitividad del servicio aéreo. Se concluye que el marco regulatorio e institucional del transporte aéreo ha mejorado pero subsisten problemas de coordinación y cargas regulatorias redundantes para las aerolíneas; aunque las inversiones en infraestructura y tecnología (de tierra y aire) han aumentado de manera sustancial y el modelo de concesión ha sido exitoso, hace falta articular la política sectorial con una visión estratégica del transporte aéreo, como ingrediente central de la competitividad; los aeropuertos concesionados tienen un importante espacio de mejora en cuanto a la reducción de los costos de los servicios no regulados y el desarrollo de nuevos servicios aeroportuarios y, por último, los aeropuertos colombianos, con excepción de ElDorado, comparados con los de la región latinoamericana y con Miami, son relativamente más costosos. Se recomiendan varias acciones: formular una estrategia para la competitividad del sector; fortalecer aún más a la AEROCIVIL en cuanto al tamaño y calidad de su planta de personal; resolver el vacío que existe en cuanto a la regulación del sector en términos de la solución de las fallas del mercado y la fijación de tarifas en los segmentos donde no hay competencia; para ello, habría que poner a operar la Comisión de Regulación de la Infraestructura y Transporte; revisar la metodología para fijar las cargas regulatorias y su proporcionalidad; mejorar la disponibilidad de la información sobre la calidad y la capacidad aeroportuaria del país, así como de los costos de los servicios; definir de manera clara las competencias de las entidades que supervisan y regulan el sector; y, por último, avanzar en el diseño de los contratos de concesión, incorporando lecciones aprendidas, de manera que mejore el enforcement de los contratos y se reduzcan los costos de transacción para los agentes de la cadena de la prestación del servicio aéreo.
L93|The effect of rail travel time on airline fares: First evidence from the Italian passenger market|The empirical evidence shows that travel time is crucial for rail transport to be a competitor to air transport. However, there are no papers testing whether travel time has a direct effect on airline pricing. This paper is a step towards filling this gap. We test and quantify the effect of rail travel time on airline fares, using unique data at flight-level. We find that airlines design pricing strategies taking into consideration the travel time of competing rail transport service. Airlines are found to set, on average, higher fares as rail travel time increases. However, the competitive pressure induced by rail travel time is perceived by airlines only as the day of departure gets closer: from the 40th to the day before departure it increases while it gradually decreases as the departure date gets further away.
L93|The effect of competition on price discrimination in the international flight market between the U.S. and China|This research offers new evidence on the relationship between competition and second-degree price discrimination in the airline industry using a unique micro data set on international flight ticket transactions between the U.S. and China. Due to the disaggregated nature of the transaction level data used in this analysis, I am able to precisely measure ticket restrictions/qualities and offer some plausible explanations for the restriction-specific effects of market competition on price discrimination. Overall, the results suggest that there is a negative relationship between price discrimination and market competition, which is consistent with the traditional wisdom that the ability to price discriminate will be deteriorated by less market concentration.
L93|Estimating the impact of airport privatization on airline demand: AÂ regression-based event study|This paper develops an empirical model of passenger demand for routes of airports subject to either imminent or recent privatization. We investigate whether the privatization process produces a sequential impact over traffic. By employing a regression-based event methodology and controlling for fixed effects, price endogeneity and sample selection, we perform an econometric analysis of pre-privatization and post-privatization dynamic patterns of demand to infer the demand consequences of the major change in airport governance. We examine recent Brazilian airport privatization experience as a case. The main results suggest that privatization produced an overall increase in airline demand and that the airport notably recognized with the greatest demand potential and with the largest market penetration of a fast-growing low cost newcomer had the highest estimated ceteris paribus effect of privatization on demand.
L93|Baggage fees, operational performance and customer satisfaction in the US air transport industry|In recent years, there has been a â€œde-bundlingâ€ trend in the US airline industry, where specific services that used to be included in a ticket fare are now priced separately. Although a major reason for these fees is to raise revenues for the airlines, the fees may also impact the operations of carriers. Among the new fees implemented by most US carriers is a payment for checked baggage. This paper analyzes the association of baggage fees with airline operational service outcomes, as measured by flight delays, mishandled baggage rates and the rate of customer complaints. Using data from the US domestic air transport market over the period 2004â€“2012 and estimating a series of equations, our results show that, on average, an increase in baggage fees is associated with a decrease in the mishandled baggage rate and to a reduction in the percentage of delayed flights. No significant association is found between the fees and the rate of customer complaints.
L93|The U.S. Airways Group: A post-merger analysis|America West Airlines acquired the bankrupt US Airways on September 27, 2005 to form the US Airways Group, improving its competitive position in the US airline industry. This paper analyzes the post-merger performance of the US Airways Group using airline operating metrics and financial ratios for the period 2005 to 2013. While the airline has still a long way to go to improve its leverage and liquidity ratios, its capital structure and ability to pay its obligations have improved since 2005. Moreover, although the airline is still inefficient in utilizing its assets, the efficiency improvements achieved since the merger have resulted in profits and positive returns to investors. Its share prices have also largely outperformed the S&P 500 and the XAL since the merger, an indication that investors are pleased with how the merger is developing over time. In view of the US Airways Group's improving financial and operating performance, the merger is, essentially, a success.
L93|Environmental impact of aircraft emissions and aviation fuel tax in Japan|This investigation analysed the growing impact of commercial aviation on CO2 emissions, as well as its potential impact on climate change. It reviewed the effects of the Japanese Aviation Fuel Tax (koukuukinenryouzei), which has been levied on fuel loaded into all domestic flights in Japan since 1972. Using a Bayesian structural time series model, based on monthly observations of fuel consumption between 2004 and 2013 provided by the Ministry of Land, Transport, Infrastructure and Tourism - Japan, this research estimated the effect that this tax has had on the national demand for aviation fuel. It was established that the fuel tax has unequivocally reduced the amount of CO2 emissions from aircraft.
L93|Assessing firm behavior in carve-out markets: Evidence on the impact of carve-out policy|Airlines wanting to cooperatively set prices for their international air travel service must apply to the relevant authorities for antitrust immunity (ATI). While cooperation may yield benefits, it can also have anti-competitive effects in markets where partners competed prior to receiving ATI. A carve-out policy forbids ATI partners from cooperating in markets policymakers believe will be most harmed by anti-competitive effects. We examine carve-out policy applications to three ATI partner pairings, and find evidence more consistent with cooperative pricing in carve-out markets in spite of the policy, calling into question the effectiveness of the policy in achieving intended market outcomes.
L93|Disentangling the European airlines efficiency puzzle: A network data envelopment analysis approach|In recent years the European airline industry has undergone critical restructuring. It has evolved from a highly regulated market predominantly operated by national airlines to a dynamic, liberalized industry where airline firms compete freely on prices, routes, and frequencies. Although several studies have analyzed performance issues for European airlines using a variety of efficiency measurement methods, virtually none of them has considered two-stage alternatives – not only in this particular European context but in the airline industry in general. We extend the aims of previous contributions by considering a network Data Envelopment Analysis (network DEA) approach which comprises two sub-technologies that can share part of the inputs. Results show that, in general, most of the inefficiencies are generated in the first stage of the analysis. However, when considering different types of carriers several differences emerge – most of the low-cost carriers’ inefficiencies are confined to the first stage. Results also show a dynamic component, since performance differed across types of airlines during the decade 2000–2010.
L93|How do airlines react to airport congestion? The role of networks|In this paper, we investigate the relationship between airline network structure and airport congestion. More specifically, we study the ways in which airlines adjust frequencies to delays (as a measure of airport congestion) depending on the network type they operate. Our results suggest that network structure has a fundamental impact. Thus, while airlines operating fully-connected configurations reduce frequencies in response to more frequent delays, airlines operating hub-and-spoke structures increase frequencies. Therefore, network airlines have incentives to keep frequencies high even if this is at the expense of a greater congestion at their hub airports. This result sheds light on previously unclear results in the literature.
L93|Implication of spatial heterogeneity for airports' efficiency estimation|This research is devoted to the analysis of a role of spatial heterogeneity in estimation of airports' efficiency. Spatial heterogeneity, caused by uneven distribution of influencing factors over space, is widely acknowledged in the European airport industry, but rarely included in airport benchmarking procedures. We utilise modern methods of spatial econometrics to identify the importance of spatial heterogeneity for estimates of airports' resource elasticity and efficiency values. A set of utilised models includes the spatial error model, spatial stochastic frontier model, geographically weighted regression model, and their modifications.
L93|A comparative analysis of cost change for low-cost, full-service, and other carriers in the US airline industry|This study compares cost and productivity changes of full-service carriers (FSCs), low-cost carriers (LCCs) and ‘other’ carriers classified as regional or charter firms. Findings show cost reductions of 10 percent for FSCs and 22 percent for regionals/charters, and cost increases of 8.5 percent for LCCs from 1993 to 2014. Nontrivial productivity gains due to increases in load factor and stage length explain the findings for FSCs. Unexplained technical change accounts for the cost increases for LCCs, while productivity gains due to increases in load factor and stage length and unexplained technical change contribute to cost declines for ‘other’ carriers. These findings are interpreted as indicating (1) the LCC cost advantage over FSCs has eroded somewhat over this period, and (2) sources of cost changes over this period differ by air carrier classification.
L93|Total factor productivity analysis of Malaysia Airlines: Lessons from the past and directions for the future|The main objective of the study is to measure the total factor productivity (TFP) growth of Malaysia Airlines (MAS) over a 34-year period from 1980 to 2013 using a Törnqvist index method. Labour, capital, fuel and other inputs are selected as input measures, whereas the number of passengers, cargo and mail carried and non-traffic revenue are chosen as output measures in the measurement of MAS's productivity. The study revealed that MAS obtained a slow growth in TFP over the study period. The results showed that the privatisation of MAS was not sufficient to produce improved TFP performance. Furthermore, the study also found that the average stage length and load factor are interrelated with the TFP levels in a positive direction. Overall, this study extends the discussion of efficiency and productivity in the airline industry in Malaysia.
L93|An analysis of Delta Air Lines' oil refinery acquisition|Delta Air Lines acquired an oil refinery in April 2012 as a strategic move to hedge against higher fuel prices. Our paper analyzes the impact of the oil refinery acquisition, a backward integration strategy, on the airline's financial and operational performance, for the period Q1 2010 to Q2 2015, and we argue that the resource dependence theory best explains Delta Air Lines’ acquisition. The methodology involves descriptive statistics and short-term stock performance as well as an econometric model that estimates the impact of the oil refinery acquisition on Delta Air Lines' net income using quarterly financial and airline operating metrics data. The results indicate that it is too early to ascertain whether Delta Air Lines' oil refinery acquisition has any positive impact on its financial performance since the variable of interest is insignificant in predicting the airline's net income. Despite the apparent lack of positive impact of its oil refinery acquisition, however, the stock market has rewarded Delta Air Lines' strategy resulting in its share prices outperforming the S&P 500 and the XAL, an index of major airline stocks, in the 60-trading day period following the announcement of its acquisition.
L93|Airline delays, congestion internalization and non-price spillover effects of low cost carrier entry|This paper develops an econometric model of flight delays to investigate the influence of competition and dominance on the incentives of carriers to maintain on-time performance. We consider both the route and the airport levels to inspect the local and global effects of competition, with a unifying framework to test the hypotheses of 1. airport congestion internalization and 2. the market competition-quality relationship in a single econometric model. In particular, we examine the impacts of the entry of low cost carriers (LCC) on the flight delays of incumbent full service carriers in the Brazilian airline industry. The main results indicate a highly significant effect of airport congestion self-internalization in parallel with route-level quality competition. Additionally, the potential competition caused by LCC presence provokes a global effect that suggests the existence of non-price spillovers of the LCC entry to non-entered routes.
L93|Can market power be controlled by regulation of core prices alone? An empirical analysis of airport demand and car rental price|Many firms offer “core” and “side” goods in the sense that side-good consumption is conditional on core-good consumption. Airports are a common example where the supply of runway and terminal capacity is the core good and the supply of various concession services (for example, car rental services) is the side good. While side-good supply can be responsible for a major share in total revenue, monopoly regulation typically concentrates on the control of core-good prices (“core prices” in short). Whether market power can indeed be effectively controlled by the regulation of core prices alone then depends on whether core-good consumption is a function of the price for side goods. This study empirically shows that a one-dollar increase in the daily car rental price reduces passenger demand at 199 US airports by more than 0.36%. A major implication of our findings is that for the case of airports, the effective control of market power may require regulation of both prices for core and side goods.
L93|Does an increase in subsidies lead to changes in air fares? Empirical evidence from Spain|This paper examines the impact on prices of various regulatory changes in residents’ flight subsidies implemented in Spain in recent years. It draws on a large sample of domestic routes for the period 2003–2013 to estimate a price equation that accounts for the panel data and the potential endogeneity of specific explanatory variables. Price differences were not found between the treated routes (routes affected by the discounts) and the control routes (routes not affected by the discounts). This is the case regardless of the discount percentage on prices that island residents enjoy.
L93|US airport ownership, efficiency, and heterogeneity|All US commercial airports are in the public sector yet not all have the same ownership type. For medium and large hub US airports we use stochastic frontier analysis to analyze the efficiency differences for alternative airport ownership types. We find that while form of ownership may matter for cost efficiency, in general its effect is relatively small. Yet type of public sector ownership does have cost efficiency implications in certain environments. Further, when heterogeneity is not controlled, the results change substantially so that type of ownership matters much more which demonstrates the importance of controlling for cross section heterogeneity.
L93|Two-sided platforms in airport privatization|This paper develops an empirical model to examine the relationship between ownership change and two-sided-platform formation in the air transport industry. We investigate whether privatization enhances the dynamic capabilities of airports so that they more closely resemble a two-sided platform. We study the case of the recent privatization of Brazilian airports. We find evidence of a permanent, ceteris paribus increase in demand triggered after the privatization program. The results are consistent with a preemption of assets with a view to expanding operations and so benefiting from the network effects offered by a two-sided platform.

L93|Persistent and Transient Efficiency of International Airlines|This paper examines the efficiency of international airlines for the period 1998-2012 by using stochastic frontier panel data models. It estimates a four-component random error cost model for multi-output airline services, separating passenger and goods transportation at the national and international levels. The model distinguishes between firm heterogeneity, time-invariant persistent inefficiency, as well as transient (time-variant) inefficiency and random error components. This model is compared with two other models in which one of the four components is missing. All the models are estimated by using the maximum likelihood method. The models produce persistent, transient and overall efficiency for each airline and time period. The outcomes indicate that the four-component model has an advantage over the traditional panel data approach of separating airline heterogeneity and time-invariant inefficiency effects. The mean and dispersion of cost efficiency amongst airlines differ by model specifications and according to their geographical area of operations. The performance difference may be a consequence of different market structures and deregulation processes, and of specific competitive conditions such as resource availability and strategic alliances with competitors. The results confirm that in general the airlines are not able to achieve full cost efficiency. We find that carriers based in the Asia region are more efficient than carriers based in the European and North American regions. The bigger airlines are unable to take advantage of economies of scale and are not more efficient than their smaller counterparts.
L93|The Value of Relational Adaptation in Outsourcing: Evidence from the 2008 shock to the US Airline Industry|In this paper, we theoretically analyze, and empirically test for, the importance of relational adaptation in outsourcing relationships using the airline industry as case study. In the airline industry, adaptation of flight schedules is necessary in the presence of bad weather conditions. When major carriers outsource to independent regionals, conflicts over these adaptation decisions typically arise. Moreover, the urgency of needed adjustments requires that adaptation be informal and hence enforced relationally. Our model shows that for relational adaptation to be self-enforcing, the long-term value of the relationship between a major and a regional airline must be at least as large as the regional airline’s cost of adapting flight schedules across joint routes. Thus, when facing a negative economic shock, the major is more likely to preserve routes outsourced to regional airlines that have higher adaptation costs, and hence higher relationship value. We analyze the evolution of U.S. airline networks around the 2008 financial crisis, and we find that consistent with our predictions, routes outsourced to regional networks with worse average weather, and hence higher adaptation costs, were more likely to survive the shock.

L93|Factors Predicting Explicit and Implicit Attitudes Towards Body Scanners|Many ethical concerns have been raised about the implementation of body scanners at airports. However, no study thus far has investigated which factors influence the attitudes of the general public towards body scanners. Thus, the current study aimed to find variables predicting the implicit and explicit attitudes towards body scanners. Different sociodemographic and personality variables have been taken into account. Explicit attitudes were assessed by a questionnaire and implicit attitudes were assessed by the Single Target Implicit Association Test. Women worried more about the effects of a body scan and requested more information than men. People with more knowledge about body scanners worried more about possible discrimination through body scanners. In trend, people more enthusiastic about technology had a more negative implicit attitude towards body scanners. Implicit and explicit attitudes did not correlate. The findings emphasize the importance of integrating different kinds of users in the design and development of security technologies to account for different opinions, needs and worries. Moreover, we suggest using knowledge that is gained in these kind of studies to train airport employees. Classification JEL : C12; C90; L93; O33
L93|Inoperability and Income Distribution: the IEM Approach| In this paper an e ort is made to enrich the current Input-Output methodologies employed for studying the disruptive events, by extending the IO framework and including all the phases of the circular flow of income into the overall disaster impact. In this respect the Inoperability Extended Model is created and implemented in order to estimate the higher order effects in terms of value added percentage variations. The 2010 Social Accounting Matrix referred to the United Kingdom, is constructed and it is proposed as a starting point for assessing the effects of a system perturbation. The case of study is related to the eruption of the Volcano EyjafjallajÃ¶kull in mid April 2010 which became an international disruptive event heavily affecting the air transport services due to a full closure of British Air Space for several days. Finally the ranking of those commodities which are badly affected can provide guidance to the policy makers to minimize the overall impact on the economy
L93|Accounting for price endogeneity in airline itinerary choice models: An application to Continental U.S. markets|Network planning models, which forecast the profitability of airline schedules, support many critical decisions, including equipment purchase decisions. Network planning models include an itinerary choice model that is used to allocate air total demand in a city pair to different itineraries. Multinomial logit (MNL) models are commonly used in practice and capture how individuals make trade-offs among different itinerary attributes; however, none that we are aware of account for price endogeneity. This study formulates an itinerary choice model that is consistent with those used by industry and corrects for price endogeneity using a control function that uses several types of instrumental variables. We estimate our model using a database of more than 10million passenger trips provided by the Airlines Reporting Corporation. Results based on Continental U.S. markets for May 2013 departures show that models that fail to account for price endogeneity overestimate customers’ value of time and result in biased price estimates and incorrect pricing recommendations. The size and comprehensiveness of our database allows us to estimate highly refined departure time of day preference curves that account for distance, direction of travel, number of time zones traversed, departure day of week and itinerary type (outbound, inbound or one-way). These time of day preference curves can be used by airlines, researchers, and government organizations in the evaluation of different policies such as congestion pricing.
L93|Regulations in services sectors and their impact on downstream industries: The OECD 2013 Regimpact Indicator|This document presents the new 2013 set of the OECD Regulatory Impact (REGIMPACT) indicator. It measures the impact of regulatory barriers to competition in non-manufacturing sectors on all industries, through intermediate inputs. The paper describes how the indicator is calculated and discusses a number of challenges and trade-offs when constructing the indicator. They relate to the composition of the indicator, how the slow-moving or time-invariant retail and professional services regulation data are integrated with the annual energy, transport and communication regulation (ETCR) indicator and what sector weights are used for the calculation of the REGIMPACT indicator. The document then compares the 2003, 2008 and 2013 vintages of the REGIMPACT indicator and the alternative (narrow and wide) definitions of the 2013 indicator. Finally, the paper uses sectoral data to illustrate the extent to which different vintages and alternative indicator definitions can possibly influence sector-level panel regression results for outcome variables such as productivity, investment and labour inputs. Réglementation dans les secteurs des services et leur impact sur les industries en aval : la version 2013 de l'indicateur REGIMPACT de l'OCDE Ce document présente une version révisée en 2013 de l'indicateur REGIMPACT de l'OCDE. Il mesure pour chaque industrie, l'impact des obstacles réglementaires à la concurrence, par le biais des intrants intermédiaires dans les secteurs non manufacturiers. Ce document décrit la méthodologie utilisée pour calculer cet indicateur et examine un certain nombre de défis et de compromis liés à sa construction. Ils se rapportent à la composition de l'indicateur, notamment l’intégration de séries avec peu de variation temporelle telles que l’indice de réglementation dans le commerce de détail ou les services professionnels avec les indicateurs annuels de réglementation dans les secteurs de l'énergie, du transport et des télécommunications (ETCR) ainsi qu’aux pondérations sectorielles utilisées pour le calcul de l’indicateur REGIMPACT. Le document compare ensuite les versions 2003, 2008 et 2013 de cet indicateur et les définitions alternatives (étroites et larges) de l'indicateur REGIMPACT. Enfin, le document utilise des données sectorielles pour illustrer dans quelle mesure les différentes versions et définitions peuvent éventuellement influencer les résultats de régression en données de panel au niveau sectoriel pour des variables telles que la productivité, l'investissement et l’emploi.
L93|Analysis of the lowest airfares considering the different business models of airlines, the case of Budapest|This study reports the findings of a research that compared the lowest airfares of full-service network carriers and low-cost airlines and mapped the cost distance between Budapest and European cities. The study investigated return air tickets for three time periods in 48 European cities for travellers who originated from Budapest. The study was based on quantitative research methods using automated internet data collection and a unique GIS-based mapping method to compare airfares and visualise the cost distance between European cities and Budapest. Our findings showed that low-cost airlines outperform full-service network carriers by offering lower-fare air tickets, while the cost distance maps showed that cities accessible by low-cost airlines are ‘closer’ to Budapest in general.
L93|Incumbent Response to Entry by Low-Cost Carriers in the U.S. Airline Industry|This article studies incumbent price response to entry by low-cost carriers in the U.S. airline industry. I find that legacy carrier incumbents decrease their mean airfare, 10th percentile airfare, and 90th percentile airfare following entry by a low-cost carrier. Airfares decrease by a larger percentage at the right tail of the incumbentsâ€™ price distribution than at the left tail, suggesting that increased competition from low-cost carrier entrants leads to lower price dispersion.
L93|Productivity Trends in the Canadian Transport Sector: An Overview|In recent decades, the overall growth in productivity of many subsectors of the Canadian transportation and warehousing sector has been above average. In particular, while labour productivity (real GDP per worker) grew an average of 0.64 per cent per year between 2000 and 2014 in the transportation and warehousing sector, labour productivity grew an average of 1.83 per cent per year in the truck transportation subsector, 3.25 per cent per year in the air transportation subsector and 2.09 per cent in the train transportation subsector for the same period. Conversely, in the urban transit subsector, labour productivity decreased an average of 0.76 per cent per year between 2000 and 2014. This report provides a detailed analysis of output, input and productivity trends in four subsectors of the Canadian transportation and warehousing sector. It also examines drivers of the productivity growth for each subsector as well as policies that could enable faster growth. Given the impact that the transportation sector has on many Canadian industries as well as the Canadian economy, maintaining productivity growth is important.
L93|Quality Disclosure Programs and Internal Organizational Practices: Evidence from Airline Flight Delays|Disclosure programs exist in many industries in which consumers are poorly informed about product quality. We study a disclosure program for airline on-time performance, which ranks airlines based on the fraction of their flights that arrive less than 15 minutes late. The program creates incentives for airlines to focus their efforts on flights close to this threshold. We find that firms in this industry are heterogeneous in how they respond to these incentives. Moreover, this heterogeneity correlates with internal firm characteristics. Our findings highlight the importance of interactions between incentives created by a disclosure program and firms' internal organizational practices. (JEL D22, L15, L25, L93)
L93|Open Skies: Estimating Travelers' Benefits from Free Trade in Airline Services|The United States has negotiated bilateral open skies agreements to deregulate airline competition on US international routes, but little is known about their effects on travelers' welfare and the gains from the US negotiating agreements with more countries. We develop a model of international airline competition to estimate the effects of open skies agreements on fares and flight frequency. We find the agreements have generated at least $4 billion in annual gains to travelers and that travelers would gain an additional $4 billion if the US negotiated agreements with other countries that have a significant amount of international passenger traffic. (JEL D12, L11, L51, L93, L98)
L93|Effects of corruption on efficiency of the European airports|The effect of corruption on airport productive efficiency is analyzed using an unbalanced panel data of major European airports from 2003 to 2009. We first compute the residual (or net) variable factor productivity using the multilateral index number method and then apply robust cluster random effects model in order to evaluate the importance of corruption. We find strong evidence that corruption has negative impacts on airport operating efficiency; and the effects depend on the ownership form of the airport. The results suggest that airports under mixed public–private ownership with private majority achieve lower levels of efficiency when located in more corrupt countries. They even operate less efficiently than fully and/or majority government owned airports in high corruption environment. We control for economic regulation, competition level and other airports’ characteristics. Our empirical results survive several robustness checks including different control variables, three alternative corruption measures: International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) corruption index, Corruption Perception Index (CPI) and Control of Corruption Index (CCI). The empirical findings have important policy implications for management and ownership structuring of airports operating in countries that suffer from higher levels of corruption.
L93|Airport Improvements and Urban Growth|This paper estimates the effects of airports on economic growth in the local areas they serve, using data from US metropolitan areas. It applies a novel identification technique that uses the overall development of the air transport network to identify changes in airport size that are not influenced by local factors. Airport size is found to have positive effects on local employment with an elasticity of 0.02 and on GDP with an elasticity of 0.035. This means that for every job created at the airport by an exogenous increase in traffic, there are three jobs created outside of the airport. Airport size is also found to have positive effects on local wages and on the number of firms. In addition there is a positive effect on the employment rate, the magnitude of which suggests that around half of jobs created by airport expansion represent a net increase in the employment of existing residents, while half are taken up by workers who migrate to the area.
L93|Structural Estimation Of Sequential Games Of Complete Information|" type=""main"" xml:id=""ecin12189-abs-0001""> In models of strategic interaction, there may be important order of entry effects if one player can credibly commit to an action (e.g., entry) before other players. If one estimates a simultaneous-move model, then the move-order effects will be confounded with the payoffs. This article considers nonparametric identification and simulation-based estimation of sequential games of complete information. Relative to simultaneous-move games, these models avoid the problem of multiple equilibria and require fewer payoff normalizations. We apply the estimator in several Monte Carlo experiments and to study entry-order effects using data from the airline industry . ( JEL C57, C15, L93)"
L93|Product Quality Effects of International Airline Alliances, Antitrust Immunity, and Domestic Mergers|Much of the literature on airline cooperation focuses on the price effects of cooperation. A key contribution of our paper is to empirically examine the product quality effects of airline cooperation. Two common types of cooperation among airlines involve international alliances and antitrust immunity (ATI), where ATI allows for more extensive cooperation. Additionally, this paper examines the extent to which domestic mergers affect the quality of international air travel products. The results suggest that increases in the membership of a carrier’s alliance or ATI partners and domestic mergers are associated with the carrier’s own products having more travel-convenient routing quality. Therefore, a complete welfare evaluation of airline cooperation and mergers should not ignore product quality effects.
L93|Impacto en la economía cartagenera de la reducción de la tasa aeroportuaria para pasajeros internacionales|En este estudio se estima el impacto de la reducción reciente de esa tasa para los viajeros internacionales salientes del aeropuerto internacional Rafael Nuñez, de la ciudad Cartagena. En primer lugar, se examina el marco legal e institucional de la fijación y modificación de las tasas aeroportuarias en Colombia. En segundo lugar, se describe la economía cartagenera, en particular, la actividad del sector de hotelería y turismo. Por último, se modela y cuantifica el impacto de la modificación de la tasa aeroportuaria sobre el turismo y la economía cartagenera.
L93|AirTicket Sales as Bids from Airline Alliances|Motivated by the higher price sensitivity and service homogenisation in the airline industry in recent years, we propose a new methodology to deal with transaction prices and to estimate the effect of alliances in the US domestic market. The assumption that airlines compete on price allows us to take advantage of the observational equivalence between Bertrand competition and the reverse English auction. We then apply an MLE method, developed by Paarsch (1997) for esti- mating auctions, to recover the distributional characteristics of air fares using a sample of airline tickets from the US domestic market. This procedure allows us to benefit from the heterogeneity of individual prices while most studies have used average prices, which would have involved a loss of information and a potential bias. We find that an alliance operating in a market is associated with prices on average 18.9 percent higher. Additionally, we find the standard deviation of ticket prices to be 4.3 percent higher, which is likely related to more efficient revenue management practice by alliance partners operating together in the same market.
L93|Social Costs of Air Traffic Delays|The so-called buffer time or buffer delay allows airlines to control for excessive delays by introducing extra time in their schedule in addition to what is technically required. . We study the differences between unregulated markets - where airlines are free to fix their buffer times strategically - and a situation where a social planner would control for time schedules, and in particular the buffer time. To do so, we use a calibrated model of a network of three cities - one of them being a hub - served by a single airline. Welfare losses that follow from delays are relatively small as compared to the potential benefits that would follow from a decrease in ticket prices. The model thus advocates that, at least for the connections that are considered, fares rather than delays should be the focus of institutions aiming at enhancing passengers’ welfare.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L93|Airport Prices in a Two-Sided Market Setting: Major US Airports|This paper analyzes the rationale of airport business models. First, it provides evidence that the airports should be considered as two sided markets because of significant network externalities between the airlines and the passengers. This result invalidates the traditional approach where the airport-airline-passenger relationship is considered as vertically integrated, taking passengers as final consumers. Second, a testing procedure aimed at eliciting the real business model of airports demonstrates that the major U.S. airports do not internalize the externalities existing between airlines and passengers. We find that these airports set profit maximizing prices for the non-aeronautical services to passengers and Ramsey prices for the aeronautical services to airlines. Given these results, we conduct a welfare analysis by simulating the implementation of profit maximizing prices when an airport fully accounts for the two-sidedness of its activities. In particular, we show that the impact on social welfare is not independent on the specific features of each airport and that the privatization of airports cannot be considered as the only solution for airports.
L93|A note on optimal airline networks under airport congestion|We extend the monopoly case without congestion in Brueckner (2004) by examining network choice in a duopoly where airport congestion can occur. Airlines prefer hub-and-spoke configurations, even if this implies higher congestion costs. Airlines may be inefficiently biased towards hub-and-spoke networks.
L93|The impact of advanced biofuels on aviation emissions and operations in the U.S|We analyze the economic and emissions impacts on U.S. commercial aviation of the Federal Aviation Administration’s renewable jet fuel goal when met using advanced fermentation (AF) fuel from perennial grasses. These fuels have recently been certified for use in aircraft and could potentially provide greater environmental benefits than aviation biofuels approved previously. Due to uncertainties in the commercialization of AF technologies, we consider a range of assumptions concerning capital costs, energy conversion efficiencies and product slates. In 2030, estimates of the implicit subsidy required to induce consumption of AF jet fuel range from $0.45 to $20.85 per gallon. These correspond to a reference jet fuel price of $3.23 per gallon and AF jet fuel costs ranging from $4.01 to $24.41 per gallon. In all cases, as renewable jet fuel represents around 1.4% of total fuel consumed by commercial aviation, the goal has a small impact on aviation operations and emissions relative to a case without the renewable jet fuel target, and emissions continue to grow relative to those in 2005. Costs per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent abated by using biofuels range from $42 to $652.
L93|Clustered airline flight scheduling: Evidence from airline deregulation in Korea|This paper explores the impacts of competition level on airline scheduling in the Korean domestic short-haul routes where a hub-and-spoke system is not the optimal air transport network strategy. The empirical findings using the Korean airline panel data for the period 2006â€“2010 suggest that competition leads to less differentiated departure flight times as expected from spatial competition theory. Unlike the previous study on the U.S airline industry, the degree of this tendency for less differentiation differs across the type of routes: the Jeju island routes (leisure type) and the inland routes (business type), in the deregulated period. Following the May 2008 Deregulation Act we find an increasingly clustered pattern of airline scheduling in the Jeju island routes where there have been competitive pressures associated with new low cost entrants. This recent evidence would imply that airline carriers strategically schedule departure flight times and allocate flights between routes as competition increases in the deregulated period.
L93|Domestic air passenger traffic and economic growth in China: Evidence from heterogeneous panel models|This paper applies recent panel methodology to examine the short-run dynamics, the long-run equilibrium relationships and the Granger causal relationship between economic growth and domestic air passenger traffic. It is based on the quarterly panel data of 29 provinces in China from the period of 2006Q1 to 2012Q3. Tests for panel unit roots, cointegration in heterogeneous panels and panel causality are employed in a bi-variate panel vector error correction model (PVECM), which is estimated by the system generalized moment method (SYS-GMM). The results show evidence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between economic growth and domestic air passenger traffic. Specifically, 1% increase in the air passenger traffic is found to lead to an increase of 0.943% in real gross domestic product (GDP). A long-run and strong bi-directional Granger causal relationship is found between these two series. It is also found that there is a short-run uni-directional Granger causality running from the domestic air passenger traffic to the economic growth.
L93|Hunting scale-free properties in R&D collaboration networks: Self-organization, power-law and policy issues in the European aerospace research area|Based on previous studies of EU-subsidized research joint ventures, R&D collaboration networks, and aerospace industry, this work raises and tests a set of hypotheses in order to check whether the European aerospace research area shows a scale-free topology. Its main focus concerns the application of a proper power-law detecting methodology to most important parameters: projects' and organizations' direct and indirect centrality, organizations' membership, and finally projects' size and fund. While previous studies of other EU-subsidized research joint ventures carried on the analyses with relatively simpler methods and tested only the power-law form, our work employs minimum and significance values calculations, and contrasts the power-law with other heavy-tailed distributions, which are widely analysed and discussed. The results clearly state that some parameters can be substantially assimilated to a power-law, while others only moderately or not at all. An explanation of such differences is provided and grounded on the relation between self-organization and scale invariance, mostly confirming a direct dependence of the latter from the former. However, the peculiarities of projects' size distribution make the interpretation of that relationship more problematic and suggest the need to carefully investigate the effect produced in each specific context by external constraints. Further, the implications of the scale-free topological properties—and in particular of their occurrence in the relationship between organizations' direct and indirect connectivity—are explored and discussed also respect to the effectiveness of European research policies. Besides enhancing the understanding of EU-subsidized research joint ventures in the European aerospace research area, our work contributes to investigate the more general issues of the relationship between self-organization and power-law, and between organizations' direct and indirect connectivity within inter-organizational networks. Finally, the paper underlines the high relevance of scale-free properties—and thus, the need to follow a proper detection methodology—by showing their relationships with resilience and sustainability of socio-economic systems.
L93|Contestability and public concern about airfares: A case study in the Canary Islands|This paper studies – both from a theoretical and empirical perspective – a case of contestability in the Canary Islands' domestic air transport market. We show how after the exit of its rival in an initially duopolistic market, the remaining airline did not increase its prices in order not to provoke the entry of new rivals. According to our view, this result was explained by the ‘public concern’ that was created about the incumbent's behaviour and its attempt of presenting itself as a benevolent monopolist. However, its strategy failed and a new operator finally entered the market, with a subsequent drop in average prices. We prove our hypothesis by developing a theoretical multi-route oligopolistic model with differentiated services and by testing its implications using several difference-in-difference econometric techniques on a monthly prices database collected in 2012–2013.
L93|The impact of government failure on tourism in the Philippines|While the Philippines aspires to be one of the top tourist destinations in Southeast Asia, self-inflicted wounds like the failure of the government to comply with international aviation safety standards may derail the country from achieving its goals. This article estimates the short- and long-term impact of the US FAA downgrade of the Philippine civil aviation system in 2008 and the EU ban of Philippine carriers in 2010 on tourist expenditures, arrivals, and length of stay using monthly time series data. The econometric model, consisting of three equations due to the endogeneity of the tourist arrivals and length of stay variables in the tourist expenditures equation, is estimated simultaneously using the generalized method of moments. The results indicate that the US FAA downgrade and the EU ban impact monthly tourist receipts negatively in the short term while the downgrade also impacts tourist expenditures in the long term. Moreover, the ban impacts length of stay negatively in the short and long term while the downgrade impacts length of stay negatively only in the long term. The substantial decline in tourism receipts from 2008 to 2010 despite an increasing trend in tourist arrivals is due to the shorter stay of tourists, indicating that high-spending tourists have not returned following the downgrade and ban.
L93|Neutralising the Advantages of State-Owned Enterprises for a Fair Playing Field|Despite Vietnamese competition authorities’ attempts to control state monopolies in domestic markets during the last 10 year of establishment, this appears to be the key challenge of Vietnamese competition regime. In the process of transitioning from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, the State-owned enterprises (SOEs) sector is perceived as a means to ensure the socialist orientation of the economy as well as preserve national economic goals. For these purposes, SOEs have been offered several advantages ranging from tangible incentives to latent conveniences over the privately owned enterprises. In this context, competition laws and policies should be able to neutralise the advantages of SOEs to level the playing field or else it would be used a shield to protect SOEs from their private rivals. This paper looks into the issues with the SOE sector in the context of Viet Nam’s political economy and identifies the factors inhibiting the country’s effort to control State monopolies in the last 10 years of competition law enforcement. It provides commentaries on the implementation of competition laws and policies in Viet Nam from the perspective of economic integration, particularly the on-going negotiation Trans-Pacific Partnership.
L93|Aides d’Etat aux aéroports régionaux: une analyse biface|A lot of cases had arouse in the past decade about agreements between regional airports and low-cost carriers. These agreement are challenged on the basis of the State Aids European control as they rise concerns not only about competition distortions between airlines but also about fiscal competition risks among Member States or local governments. Such phenomena could be expected as regional airports are characterized by significant overcapacities and overlapping inducing a substitutability for airlines. Surprisingly, the new 2014 guidelines on State Aids granted to airlines open the way to transitory operating aid schemes, an option apparently at odds with the European longstanding principles. Our purpose in this paper is to demonstrate that such agreements can make sense from the economic point of view provided that the relationship between the carrier and the airport is no longer analysed as a vertical chain, inducing an assessment in terms of economic dependence, but as a two-sided market. The favourable usage terms granted to low cost carriers generate additional flows on the other side, with commercial revenues from shops or parking. Consequently, subsidizing operating costs might be rational, even for a private investor in a market economy, and might be a perennial device.
L93|Aides d'état aux aéroports régionaux : une analyse biface|Un abondant contentieux concurrentiel a été suscité par des conventions liant des aéroports secondaires et des compagnies aériennes à bas coût. Ces dernières ont en effet été passées au crible de l’encadrement européen des aides publiques car elles risquaient de donner lieu tant à des distorsions de concurrence entre opérateurs qu’à des phénomènes de concurrence fiscales entre des infrastructures souvent en situation de surcapacités et entretenant des rapports de substituabilité. La Commission a modifié les lignes directrices en 2014 en ouvrant la possibilité d’aides à l’exploitation mais pour une durée limitée. Cette avancée semble s’inscrire en contradiction avec les principes de base de l’encadrement des aides publiques. Notre contribution montre néanmoins, à l’aide d’un modèle économique, que de tels dispositifs peuvent faire sens dès lors que la relation n’est pas conçue comme une chaîne verticale, induisant une dépendance économique de l’aéroport secondaire vis-à-vis de la compagnie aérienne mais comme s’intégrant dans un marché biface dans lequel il fait sens économiquement de subventionner des flux de passager sur l’une des faces pour maximiser d’autres revenus commerciaux (boutiques, parkings) sur l’autre face. Ce faisant, une aide publique à l’exploitation peut être justifiée économiquement et n’a pas obligatoirement à être transitoire. Ainsi, un soutien à une desserte (par exemple sous forme de réduction des redevances aéroportuaires) pourrait s’intégrer dans une logique d’investisseur privé en économie de marché.
L93|Airport Improvements and Urban Growth|This paper estimates the effects of airports on economic growth in US metropolitan areas. The estimation uses a novel technique to identify the effects of changes in local airport sizes from overall changes in the air travel network. Airport size is found to have a positive effect on local employment with an elasticity of 0.03. This means that for every job created at the airport by an exogenous increase in traffic, around four and a half jobs are created outside of the airport. The effect appears to be driven primarily by a positive effect on services employment. Airport size is also found to have positive effects on local GDP, the number of firms, population size, and the employment rate. The magnitudes of the effects on population and the employment rate suggest that the jobs created by airport expansion are spread between existing residents and workers who migrate to the area. In addition, the effect on local employment is concentrated in parts of the metropolitan area that are nearer the airport.
L93|Co-integration Analysis of Aviation Demand and Economic Growth in Philippines|Purpose: This paper is empirically analyses the aviation-led growth hypothesis for Philippines by testing causality between aviation and economic growth. We resort to econometric tests such as unit root tests and test of cointegration purposed by Johansen (1988). Methodology: Fully Modified OLS, Dynamic OLS and Conical Cointegration Regression are used to estimate the cointegration equation for time span of 1970 to 2012. Findings: Empirical results reveal the existence of cointegration between aviation demand and economic growth. Graphic methods such as Cholesky impulse response function (both accumulated and non-accumulated) and variance decomposition have also been applied to render the analysis rigorous. The positive contribution of aviation demand to economic growth is similar in all three estimation techniques of cointegration equation. Finally Granger causality test is also applied to find the direction of causal relationship. Recommendations: Findings help in chalking out the importance of aviation industry in economic growth for Philippines.
L93|The political economy of the Essential Air Service program|We find that congressional influences affect the amount of airport subsidies that a congressional district receives through the Essential Air Service (EAS) program. The EAS program was passed with the goal of helping to continue commercial air service to rural communities following deregulation in the 1970s. Using data from 1998–2014, we find strong and consistent evidence that subsidies are higher in districts having congressional representation on the House Transportation and Ways and Means Committees. Our empirical results, when combined with news reports of members claiming credit for securing EAS funding, are consistent with the EAS serving private and public interests.

L93|Strategic and Operational Challenges for Tourist Air Transport|The main objective of this paper is to identify the strategic and operational challenges that will face air transport by 2030. The authors noted that in tourism, air transport is of great importance for the business, because it provides the movement of the tourist from the place of residence to the chosen destination. Methodology and assumptions were based on information, indicators, processed by the relevant international organisations. Correction factors were determined based on some assumptions: the importance of that activity to achieve tourist consumption; the recommendations of international organisations (WTO, EUROSTAT) on the role of each activity in the development of the tourism phenomenon; the results of various surveys conducted in time. The research results can have a degree of approximation, but the authors’ analysis pursues achieving a first attempt to quantify the transport activities in tourism and the role of the latter in the national economy. The results obtained by the authors will be furthered by research and analyses to be performed for each and every component of air transport, independently or within macroeconomic strategies.
L93|Estimating the Economic Effects of Deregulation: Evidence from the Turkish Airline Industry|This paper mainly studies the effect of deregulation on prices and quantity. For this aim, we employ cointegration methodology with structural breaks to empirically investigate the simultaneous relationship between deregulation, ticket prices, and the number of passengers in the Turkish airline industry. The findings confirm that deregulation increases quantity and decreases prices through accessibility to air transport service and actual competition, respectively. Also, structural breaks suggest that deregulation of prices and entry into the market has remarkable effect on the change in ticket prices and the number of passengers.

L93|Improving infrastructure in the United Kingdom|The United Kingdom (UK) has spent less on infrastructure compared to other OECD countries over the past three decades. The perceived quality of UK infrastructure assets is close to the OECD average but lower than in other G7 countries. Capacity constraints have emerged in some sectors, such as electricity generation, air transport and roads. Developing and regularly updating a national infrastructure strategy, with the National Infrastructure Plan being a welcome first step in this direction, would contribute to reduce policy uncertainty and tackle capacity constraints in a durable way. The design of coherent development plans by local authorities congruent with the national and local planning systems should continue to improve project delivery. The government intends to finance a large share of infrastructure spending to 2020 and beyond through private capital. Unlocking private investment in a cost effective and transparent way could be supported by further improving incentives for greenfield investment, continuing to carefully assess and record public-private partnerships, and promoting more long-term financing instruments. This Working Paper relates to the 2015 OECD Economic Survey of the United Kingdom (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-united-kingdom.htm). Améliorer les infrastructures au Royaume-Uni Au Royaume-Uni, les dépenses dans les infrastructures ont été inférieures à ce qu’elles ont été dans d’autres pays de l’OCDE au cours des trois dernières décennies. La perception de la qualité des actifs d’infrastructure y est comparable à la moyenne de l’OCDE, mais est plus faible que dans les autres pays du G7. Des contraintes de capacité se sont fait jour dans certains secteurs comme la production d’électricité, le transport aérien ou le réseau routier. L’élaboration et l’actualisation régulière d’une stratégie nationale en matière d’infrastructures, avec le Plan National d’Infrastructure étant une première étape bienvenue en ce sens, contribuerait à réduire les incertitudes au niveau de l’action publique et de s’attaquer de manière durable aux contraintes de capacité. La conception, par les collectivités locales, de plans de développement cohérents conformes aux systèmes de planification nationaux et locaux améliorerait la livraison de projets. Le gouvernement a l’intention de financer une grande partie des dépenses d’infrastructures jusqu’en 2020 et au-delà en mobilisant des capitaux privés. Le déverrouillage de l’investissement privé de manière transparente et avec un bon rapport coût/efficacité pourrait être soutenu en améliorant les incitations à investir dans des installations entièrement nouvelles, de recenser et d’évaluer soigneusement les partenariats public-privé et de promouvoir de nouveaux instruments de financement à long terme.
L93|Airline strategic alliances in overlapping markets: Should policymakers be concerned?|When there is significant overlap in potential partner airlines׳ route networks, policymakers have expressed concern that an alliance between such airlines may facilitate collusion on price and/or service levels in the partners׳ overlapping markets. The contribution of our paper is to put together a structural econometric model that is able to explicitly disentangle the demand and supply effects associated with an alliance between such airlines. The estimates from our structural econometric model do identify demand-increasing effects associated with the Delta/Continental/Northwest alliance, but statistically reject collusive behavior between the partners.
L93|On the Extent to which the Presence of Intermediate-stop(s) Air Travel Products Influences the Pricing of Nonstop Air Travel Products|Analysts of air travel markets, which include antitrust authorities, are interested in understanding the extent to which the presence of intermediate stop(s) products influences the pricing of nonstop products. This paper uses a structural econometric model to investigate the potential pricing interdependence between these two product types in domestic air travel markets. Counterfactual experiments using the estimated model suggest that in many (but far from a majority) markets the current prices of nonstop products are at least 5% lower than they would otherwise be owing to the presence of intermediate-stop(s) products.
L93|Competencia económica en el sector de transporte aéreo de pasajeros en México. Una revisión de la situación actual<BR>[Economic competition in air transport of passengers in Mexico. A review of the current situation]|This paper presents a brief review of the current conditions of economic competition in the sector of air travel in Mexico. So, this shows the most relevant legal framework for the sector and highlights of recent years; the document also shows the conditions of competition in the market through the analysis of concentration indices, prices, relationship between prices and market power, competition intra and inters airports and barriers to free competition. The results show a slight increase in economic concentration in the sector, however, in terms of the legislation this situation does not provide evidence that this competition process being affected. The main constraints on competition appear to be the prevailing physical barriers in the operation of the Mexico City International Airport and some aspects of current legislation.
L93|Low-cost Carriers, Local Economy and Tourism Development at Four Portuguese Airports. A Model of Cost-benefit Analysis|The liberalisation of air transport created a new era in the sector. The entry of low-cost carriers triggered dynamism and consequently changed the behaviours of the demand and supply of air transport services. The volume of traffic at Portuguese airports increased from 17 million passengers in 2002 to more than 30 million in 2012, representing cumulative growth of 75%. The commitment to low-cost carriers (LCCs) was a determining factor for this growth in that, in 2012, these carriers recorded a market share of 33%. This study aims to analyse the evolution of LCC air traffic in Portugal and its impact on regional economic development. Through a model of cost–benefit analysis, we determine the costs, benefits and net welfare in the developmet of the region driven by the LCC routes of 4 Portuguese airports, Faro, Lisbon, Funchal and Porto, between 2005 and 2012. The methodology proves the existence of a positive net impact driven by LCCs on the local economy, directly through job creation and increased consumption in the tourism sector and indirectly by the increased demand from other sectors.
L93|The Development of Low-cost Airlines and Tourism as a Competitiveness Complementor: Effects, Evolution and Strategies|This paper addresses the relationship between the development of the airline industry and tourism. On the one hand, air transport has triggered the growth of tourism throughout the world, while, on the other hand, tourism has acted as a complementary product for developing new flight routes. This process has intensified with the emergence of low-cost carriers. A profound change has been observed in companies’ strategy to adapt to the demands of this type of market. To conduct this study, a review of the existing literature related to tourism and lowcost carriers was carried out. To conclude, an analysis of the positioning and price fixing strategies of low-cost airlines operating on some of the most important tourist routes in Europe was performed. The results indicate different level of fares among the five companies in the sample, especially between Ryanair and easyJet, but similar pricing behaviour on the routes studied.
L93|Flying from Europe to the Algarve: The Geographical Impacts of the Growth of Low-cost Carriers (1996-2013)|The replacement of non-scheduled traffic by scheduled services is one of the main impacts that the liberalisation of the European Common Aviation Area has had on tourist airports. In the case of Faro, between 1996 and 2013, this shift led to both fewer routes served and reduced catchment areas in the source markets for tourists visiting the Algarve. The strategy pursued by Ryanair, the airport’s main carrier, focuses on connections that already channelled a greater volume of traffic when charter airlines dominated. Therefore, the impact of low-cost carriers on diversifying the number of airports of origin and source markets is limited. Moreover, using the spatial analysis functions of GIS software, we verified that the population linked to the theoretical catchment areas of airports with a non-stop flight to Faro in 2013 was smaller than that of the airports with such connections in 2000. The decision making process involved in the policy incentives for introducing new routes could benefit greatly from this type of analysis.
L93|Airports' Operational Performance and Efficiency Evaluation based on Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Tools|Airport benchmarking depends on airports’ operational performance and efficiency indicators, which are important for business agents, operational managers, regulatory agencies, airlines and passengers. There are several sets of single and complex indicators to evaluate airports’ performance and efficiency as well as several techniques to benchmark such infrastructures. The general aim of this work is twofold: to balance the data envelopment analysis (DEA) and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) tools and to show that airport benchmarking is also possible using a multicriteria decision analysis tool called Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH). Whilst DEA measures the relative performance in the presence of multiple inputs and outputs, MCDA/MACBETH uses performance and efficiency indicators to support benchmark results, being useful for evaluating the real importance and weight of the selected indicators. The work is structured as follows: first, a state-of-the-art review concerning either airport benchmarking and performance indicators or DEA and MCDA tool techniques; second, an overview of the impacts on airports’ operational performance and efficiency of emergent operational factors (sudden meteorological/natural phenomena); third, two case studies on a set of worldwide airports and Madeira (FNC) Airport; and fourth, some insights into and challenges for future research that are still under development.
L93|A Typology of Rural Airports in the United States: Evaluating Network Accessibility|Since deregulation of the airline industry in 1978, carriers have largely focused their commercial service efforts on medium and large hub airports located in metropolitan areas with sufficient demand for air travel services. These profitable locations often cross-subsidize service to smaller hubs, which can function as feeder nodes/links to the larger hub-to-hub carrier network. However, as fuel and labor costs continue to increase for commercial carriers, reductions and terminations of air service in smaller rural markets are common, reducing carrier footprints and leaving many regions of the United States without viable air transport options. To be clear, this is not a new development. Many rural and remote airports are all too familiar with service reductions, which is why safeguards such as the Essential Air Service program continue to operate. The purpose of this paper is to explore the network and geographic context of airports in the U.S., evaluating relative accessibility and using this information to develop a typology of rural airports for the U.S. Implications for policy and transportation planning are discussed.
L93|Platform pricing and consumer foresight: The case of airports|We analyze the optimal behavior of a platform providing essential inputs to downstream firms selling a primary and a second complementary good. Final demand is affected by consumer foresight, that is, consumers may not anticipate the ex post surplus from the secondary good when purchasing the primary good. We first set up a reduced‐form platform model and evaluate the effects of consumer foresight on the platform's optimal decisions. Then, we specialize the analysis in the context of airports, which derive revenues from both aeronautical and, increasingly, commercial activities. An airport sets landing fees and, in addition, it chooses the retail market structure by selecting the number of retail concessions to be awarded. We find that, with perfectly myopic consumers, the airport chooses to attract more passengers via low landing fees, and also sets the minimum possible number of retailers in order to increase the concessions’ revenues. However, even a very small amount of anticipation of the consumer surplus from retail activities changes significantly the airport's choices: the optimal policy is dependent on the degree of differentiation in the retail market. When consumers instead have perfect foresight, the airport establishes a very competitive retail market. This attracts passengers and it is exploited by the airport by charging higher landing fees, which then constitute the largest share of its profits. Overall, the airport's profits are maximal when consumers have perfect foresight.
L93|Conflict Points and Air Traffic Problem Resolutions of Air Traffic Controllers in Istanbul Airspace|Every hour of a day, airlines make millions of flights. In this century, it is getting more and more important to manage air traffic effectively and regularly. In order to manage this job that is important and connected with the human lives directly, there are air traffic controllers in the tower or control centers. To be successful for managing this extreme and exciting air traffic, air traffic controllers have to know and apply the exact rules that have international validity. However, every process of air traffic is not very regular. There may be some problems that air traffic controllers have to solve to prevent air traffic crashes or air misses. These are called ?conflict and conflict traffic?. There are some applications and solving methods in the job life. In this study, ?stanbul Airspace conflict points and applications which are used by air traffic controllers to solve the conflicts and save the day for the crew, passengers and aircrafts are researched.
L93|A Study of Low Cost Carriers (LCCs) in Hong Kong|This main purpose of this study is to begin a preliminary investigation into low cost carriers (LCCs) models and explore more insights about their specific approaches and development in the region with focus on Hong Kong. After carrying out critical reviews on the LCCs operations in USA, Europe as well as other successful experience in the Asia Pacific region including Japan and Malaysia, a more detail analysis would be made in Hong Kong with particular reference to its unique environment and close proximity with PRC. Based on several case studies, key characteristics are identified and several significant factors are revealed and then discussed. In particular, the development of airport infrastructure as well as high speed rail (HSR) might also have an impact to the LCCs development in Hong Kong and could be further examined.
L93|Faut-il autoriser des aides d'exploitation pérennes versées par les aéroports régionaux aux compagnies à bas coûts ? une analyse économique en termes de marché biface|"Les conventions liant des aéroports secondaires et des compagnies aériennes à bas coût ont donné lieu à un abondant contentieux concurrentiel. La compatibilité de ces dernières avec l'encadrement européen des aides publiques peut être interrogée en regard des risques induits de distorsions de concurrence entre opérateurs et de concurrence fiscale entre infrastructures. Les aéroports secondaires sont souvent en situation de surcapacités et se caractérisent par une relative substituabilité pour les compagnies concernées. La persistance de ces contentieux, déjà à l'origine de premières lignes directrices en 2005, couplée à la transformation de l'économie du secteur du transport aérien, a amené la Commission à modifier à nouveau ses lignes directrices en 2014. Elles ouvrent désormais la possibilité d'aides à l'exploitation et non plus seulement au démarrage, assouplissant ainsi les principes traditionnels de l'encadrement des aides publiques. Nous analysons économiquement ces mesures de soutien, basées par exemple sur des ristournes sur les redevances aéroportuaires, pour montrer qu'elles peuvent s'avérer rationnelles pour le gestionnaire d'une infrastructure aéroportuaire, et donc être compatibles avec le critère de l'investisseur privé en économie de marché, issu de la jurisprudence européenne. A cette fin, nous proposons une modélisation de l'aéroport comme une plateforme biface, en mesure d'arbitrer entre revenus liés à ses activités aéronautiques et revenus liés à ses activités commerciales. Nous montrons en outre qu'un lien existe entre l'intensité de l'aide et le mode de régulation ex ante des redevances aéroportuaires. Si ces dernières sont régulées par prix plafonds, la compagnie aérienne dont le pouvoir de négociation est plus élevé pourra s'approprier la plus large part des gains de l'échange. A l'inverse, une régulation par prix plancher permet de limiter cette appropriation et permet bien évidemment de ""plafonner"" ex ante le montant de l'aide potentielle."
L93|Bankruptcy predictions for U.S. air carrier operations: a study of financial data|We applied the binary quantile regression, a Bayesian quantile regression, and logit models to identify optimal bankruptcy prediction accuracy for U.S. air carriers for the period from 1990 to 2011. We used accuracy ratio and Brier scores as standards of comparison and a Bayesian binary quantile regression with optimal bankruptcy prediction accuracy for both healthy and bankrupt air carriers. Total assets positively and significantly influenced bankruptcy probability for air carriers. Operational variables consisted of quick assets to expenditures for operation, increase in sales, and working capital to assets; however, these variables negatively and significantly influenced air carriers’ bankruptcy probability.

L93|Can market power be controlled by regulation of core prices alone?: An empirical analysis of airport demand and car rental price|Many firms offer “core” and “side” goods in the sense that side-good consumption is conditional on core-good consumption. Airports are a common example where the supply of runway and terminal capacity is the core good and the supply of various concession services (for example, car rental services) is the side good. While side-good supply can be responsible for a major share in total revenue, monopoly regulation typically concentrates on the control of core-good prices (“core prices” in short). Whether market power can indeed be effectively controlled by the regulation of core prices alone then depends on whether core-good consumption is a function of the price for side goods. This study empirically shows that a one-dollar increase in the daily car rental price reduces passenger demand at 199 US airports by more than 0.36 percent. A major implication of our findings is that for the case of airports, the effective control of market power may require regulation of both prices for core and side goods.
L93|Loyalty Programs and Consumer Behaviour: The Impact of FFPs on Consumer Surplus|Frequent Flier Programs (FFPs) are said to impact airline consumer behaviour such that revenue of sponsoring airlines increases. Prior research relies on aggregate industry data to study FFPs. We examine the impact of FFPs on individual consumer behaviour in a quasi-natural experimental set-up using a combined discrete choice and count data model. We exploit an unanticipated change in the FFP to avoid self-selection bias. We derive the causal effect of redesigning a frequency reward program into a customer tier program on average transaction size, purchase frequency, revenues of the sponsoring airline, and compensating variation. We find that, on average, revenues increased by 8$ per member over a 16 month period. The welfare impact is small but positive. We find that, on average, consumer surplus increased by 5$ per member over a 16 month period. The results vary su bstantially across individuals. In line with previous studies, our results suggest that moderate buyers increase their average transaction size and purchase frequency most due to the introduction of the customer tier program.
L93|Single-Till versus Dual-Till Regulation of Airports|Most airports operate under public ownership, while some are privatized and economically regulated. Only a few airports are privately owned and experience little or no ex-ante regulation of airport charges. On the other hand, airports nowadays earn as much revenue from transport-related activities as from commercially-oriented business activities. Taken together, these two observations lead to a natural question: How to optimally integrate profits derived from commercial activities into the regulation of airport infrastructure charges? This question is addressed in this paper. We discuss basic issues that are relevant for the design of regulatory regimes for airports and how these issues can be tackled by using airport profits derived from commercial activities for infrastructure cost recovery. The main insights are summarized at the end of each section and then are further summarized in the conclusions section.
L93|Measuring Competition Intensity; An Application to Air/HSR Transport Markets|We develop a method to measure the intensity of competition between ﬁrms. Our method, which we call the Best Response Measure (BRM), is related to the conduct parameter method, but avoids the main problems associated with that method. The BRM relies on a very general framework and limited data requirements. Moreover, we show that it provides valuable information in determining the relevant market. We illustrate how the BRM can be used in markets with imperfect substitutes and apply the method to aviation markets in the North Sea area. This also enables us to establish to what extent the high speed rail link between London and the European mainland aﬀects the supply by air carriers.
L93|Combined Effects of Capacity and Time on Fares: Insights from the Yield Management of a Low-Cost Airline|Based on two strands of theoretical research, this paper provides new evidence on how fares are jointly affected by in-flight seat availability and purchasing date. As capacity-based theories predict, it emerges that fares monotonically and substantially increase with flight occupancy. After controlling for capacity utilization, our analysis also supports time-based theories, indicating a U-shaped temporal profile over a two-month booking period, as well as a sharp increase in fares in the two weeks prior to departure.
L93|Barriers to Entry in the Airline Industry: A Multidimensional Regression-Discontinuity Analysis of AIR-21|We investigate the success of legislation aimed at increasing competition at highly concentrated U.S. airports, mainly by forcing these airports to increase the availability of scarce facilities. We use a multidimensional regression-discontinuity approach to exploit a sharp discontinuity in the law’s implementation and identify its effects. We find that fares decrease by 13.4% (20.2%) in markets with one (both) end point(s) covered. Approximately half of the decline is driven by the entry of low-cost carriers. We find little evidence that the fare declines were accompanied by a diminished quality of service, and passenger volumes increased, which suggests the legislation improved consumer welfare.
L93|Airport Prices in a Two-Sided Market Setting: Major US Airports|This paper analyzes the rationale of airport business models. First, it provides evidence that the airports should be considered as two sided markets because of significant network externalities between the airlines and the passengers. This result invalidates the traditional approach where the airport-airline-passenger relationship is considered as vertically integrated, taking passengers as final consumers. Second, a testing procedure aimed at eliciting the real business model of airports demonstrates that the major U.S. airports do not internalize the externalities existing between airlines and passengers. We find that these airports set profit maximizing prices for the non-aeronautical services to passengers and Ramsey prices for the aeronautical services to airlines. Given these results, we conduct a welfare analysis by simulating the implementation of profit maximizing prices when an airport fully accounts for the two-sidedness of its activities. In particular, we show that the impact on social welfare is not independent on the specific features of each airport and that the privatization of airports cannot be considered as the only solution for airports.
L93|A few notes on the spatial development of the tourism industry in Madeira|Introduction: This paper analysis the spatial dynamics of the development of tourism industry in a leading tourism destination in Portugal. Previous studies focused on the spatial dynamics of the tourism industry had shown that, at the very begin, hotels and tourism facilities are located in the main city and surrounding areas along the coast. Then, the hinterland is incorporated into the dynamics of economic development to sustain the development of mass tourism. Method: Based on the Plantation Model proposed by Weaver (1993), we provide an illustrative description of the progressive spread of tourism facilities from Funchal to rural areas into the island rural areas in the North Coast. Despite all efforts to develop from scratch alternative market niches, rural areas face severe obstacles in developing the tourism industry. Rural areas are deprived of key tourism ?raw materials? such as complementary services, an entrepreneurial attitude on the rural houses owners' part, strongly linkages between the emerging tourism sector and agriculture and an ?autonomous? image abroad. All this issues are well evident in Madeira and we show that intra-island imbalances in terms of the accommodation capacity and tourism receipts are still a pressing issue. Conclusions: The aim of this paper is to apply the Weaver' Plantation Model to the Madeira Island case study in order to conceptualize and understand recent developments in the tourism sector and to provide recommendations to bridging the gap between the South Coast and the North Coast. Based on the evidence provided, we highlight the importance of investments in infrastructure and increased levels of accessibility, and we argue for a comprehensive analysis of tourism benefits from a rural area point of view.
L93|Airport Improvements and Urban Growth|This paper estimates the effects of airports on economic growth in the local areas they serve, using data from US metropolitan areas. It applies a novel identification technique that uses the overall development of the air transport network to identify changes in airport size that are not influenced by local factors. Airport size is found to have positive effects on local employment with an elasticity of 0.02 and on GDP with an elasticity of 0.035. This means that for every job created at the airport by an exogenous increase in traffic, there are three jobs created outside of the airport. Airport size is also found to have positive effects on local wages and on the number of firms. In addition there is a positive effect on the employment rate, the magnitude of which suggests that around half of jobs created by airport expansion represent a net increase in the employment of existing residents, while half are taken up by workers who migrate to the area.
L93|Air passengers? shopping behaviour and regional development|Introduction/objectives: This study analysis the behaviour of shoppers at Madeira?s International Airport by taking into consideration a wide range of travel and socio-demographic related variables as well as the moderating effects of time pressure and overall spending while on holiday. Shopping at the airport, remains one of the most important tourist activity, and its contribution to the local economy is highly significant, as many passengers cannot admit to end the journey without liking around the shops or buying something. In fact, understanding domestic and international visitors shopping preferences and delivering high service quality that meets or exceeds expectations provides valuable showcase to sell iconic local products. Quite surprisingly, there is a dearth of research on the subject on peripheral airports, which is at odds with the key importance of such infrastructures at the regional level. Methods: Based on a sample of over 1000 passengers, we investigate which factors contribute decisively to higher levels of shopping and spending. Twenty different variables were checked to analyse the factors that condition passenger decisions to make either purchase in one of the airport stores or consume food/ beverage in a catering establishment. A bivariate probit model were applied because it is well suited to answer two questions (dependent variable) with closely linked answers by being influenced by the same factors. In order to check whether national and international visitors differed in their shopping preferences multivariate statistics and parametric and non-parametric tests where applied to identify significant differences between visitors?. Results/conclusions: Contrary to what was anticipated, socio-economic status only impacts marginally the level of spending, while travelling for business/vfr reasons results in passengers spending more. The bivariate model leads to the conclusion that travel motivations are a predominant impacting upon spending. It is also observed that low-cost airlines passengers spend less than those opting for traditional airlines, while high levels of satisfaction with the current holiday lead to higher levels of spending. The results also reveal that visitor?s motivations have positive impacts on commercial activities at the airport. And the results also shown that domestic visitors share more negative views in their service evaluations than their international counterparts. Moreover, the results provide strong support for the propositions of the study that domestic and international visitors differed in their evaluation of services and shopping item preferences. The results are of relevance to airport managers and local tourism policy managers, because it identifies which passengers are more interested in shopping. Although the airport managers cannot alter the essential characteristics of the respondents, a wide range of initiatives can be implemented in order to increase the respondents' average expenditure levels by promoting regional products.
L93|Market Power, Efficiencies, and Entry Evidence from an Airline Merger| We investigate the competitive effects of the merger between Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines (2009) in the domestic US airline industry. Applying fixed‐effects regression models, we find that the transaction led to short‐term price increases of about 11% on overlapping routes and about 10% on routes that experienced a merger‐induced switch of the operating carrier. Over a longer period, however, our estimation results are consistent with the hypothesis that both merger efficiencies and postmerger entry by competitors initiated a downward trend in price, leaving consumers with a small net price increase of about 3% on the affected routes.

L93|Balancing competition and cooperation: Evidence from transatlantic airline markets|In the last two decades, airline alliances were not only successful in extending the size of their networks, but also received approvals by public authorities to intensify their cooperation up to merger-like revenue-sharing joint ventures (JVs). We empirically investigate the impact of the implementation of such joint ventures on both the respective airlines’ network structure and their productive efficiency. Using U.S. DOT T100 International Segment data and applying airline-market fixed effects models, we find that joint ventures – compared to services with a lower degree of cooperation – lead to a 3–5 percent increase in seat capacity between the respective partner airlines’ hub airports; however, this is done at the expense of services elsewhere in the network. Productive efficiency, as measured by load factors, is found to be 0.5–5 percent lower for joint venture routes compared to routes operated under antitrust immunity only. We use our empirical results to discuss implications for the balancing of competition and cooperation in transatlantic airline markets.
L93|Airbus gegen Boeing vor der WTO: Zeit für einen Legal-Case-Manager|The WTO has been dealing with the Airbus-Boeing dispute for more than ten years. Both parties continue to blame the other side for their unfair financing methods. This seemingly never-ending dispute not only ties up the resources of both aircraft manufactures but also negatively influences the reputation of the WTO and impairs its ability to act as an effective dispute settlement forum. To resolve this case — the biggest and most complex one that has ever reached the WTO — a legal case manager should assist the parties in either complying with the specifications made by the appellate body or in reaching a negotiated settlement.

L93|Third-degree Price Discrimination in the Presence of Congestion Externality|This paper analyzes third-degree price discrimination of a monopoly airline in the presence of congestion externality when all markets are served. The model features the business-passenger and leisure-passenger markets where business passengers exhibit a higher time valuation, and a less price-elastic demand, than leisure passengers. Our main result is the identification of the time-valuation effect of price discrimination, which can work in the opposite direction as the well-known output effect on welfare. This time-valuation effect clearly explains why discriminating prices can improve welfare even when this is associated with a reduction in aggregate output.
L93|An Empirical Analysis of a Merger Between a Network and Low-cost Airlines| We use a difference-in-difference estimator to examine the effects of a merger between three airline companies on two types of route: (1) on those where two low-cost carriers and (2) on those where a network carrier and one of the low-cost airlines had previously been competing. We report a reduction in flight frequencies but find no substantial effect on prices in the first case, while in the second we report an increase in prices but no substantial effect on frequencies. The results would seem to be attributable to the differences in the types of passenger flying these routes. © 2014 LSE and the University of Bath
L93|Airline Networks, Mergers, and Consumer Welfare| We study the consumer welfare effects of mergers in airline networks. Based on the development of a general classification of affected routes, we apply a difference-in-differences approach to exemplarily investigate the price effects of the America West Airlines-US Airways merger completed in 2005. We find that although average prices increased substantially on routes in which both airlines competed either on a non-stop or one-stop basis prior to the merger, substantial average price reductions observed for routes without any pre-merger overlap suggest that the merger led to a net increase in consumer welfare. © 2013 LSE and the University of Bath
L93|Is the Effect of Competition on Price Dispersion Nonmonotonic? Evidence from the U.S. Airline Industry| We investigate the effect of competition on price dispersion in the airline industry. Using panel data from 1993 to 2008, we find a nonmonotonic effect of competition on price dispersion. An increase in competition is associated with greater price dispersion in concentrated markets but with less price dispersion in competitive markets—an inverse-U relationship. Our empirical findings are consistent with an oligopolistic second-degree price discrimination model and encompass contradictory findings in the literature. © 2014 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
L93|Dynamic Oligopoly Pricing: Evidence from the Airline Industry|We explore how pricing dynamics in the European airline industry vary with competition and document patterns that are consistent with intertemporal price discrimination. First, the rate at which prices increase over time decreases in competition, supporting the idea that competition restrains the ability of airlines to price-discriminate against late-arriving customers. Second, the sensitivity to competition increases in the heterogeneity of the customer base, reflecting that restraints on price discrimination are only relevant when there is initial scope for discrimination. The patterns explain 83 percent of the observed within-flight price dispersion and 17 percent of the cross-market variation in pricing dynamics.
L93|Dynamic Oligopoly Pricing: Evidence from the Airline Industry|We explore how pricing dynamics in the European airline industry vary with the competitive environment. Our results highlight substantial variations in pricing dynamics that are consistent with a theory of intertemporal price discrimination. First, the rate at which prices increase towards the scheduled travel date is decreasing in competition, supporting the idea that competition restrains the ability of airlines to price-discriminate. Second, the sensitivity to competition is substantially increasing in the heterogeneity of the customer base, reflecting further that restraints on price discrimination are only relevant if there is initial scope for price discrimination. These patterns are quantitatively important, explaining about 83 percent of the total within-flight price dispersion, and explaining 17 percent of the observed cross-market variation of pricing dynamics.
L93|On the tractability of the piecewise-linear approximation for general discrete-choice network revenue management|The choice network revenue management (RM) model incorporates customer purchase behavior as customers purchasing products with certain probabilities that are a function of the offered assortment of products, and is the appropriate model for airline and hotel network revenue management, dynamic sales of bundles, and dynamic assortment optimization. The underlying stochastic dynamic program is intractable and even its certainty-equivalence approximation, in the form of a linear program called Choice Deterministic Linear Program (CDLP) is difficult to solve in most cases. The separation problem for CDLP is NP-complete for MNL with just two segments when their consideration sets overlap; the affine approximation of the dynamic program is NP-complete for even a single-segment MNL. This is in contrast to the independentclass (perfect-segmentation) case where even the piecewise-linear approximation has been shown to be tractable. In this paper we investigate the piecewise-linear approximation for network RM under a general discrete-choice model of demand. We show that the gap between the CDLP and the piecewise-linear bounds is within a factor of at most 2. We then show that the piecewiselinear approximation is polynomially-time solvable for a fixed consideration set size, bringing it into the realm of tractability for small consideration sets; small consideration sets are a reasonable modeling tradeoff in many practical applications. Our solution relies on showing that for any discrete-choice model the separation problem for the linear program of the piecewise-linear approximation can be solved exactly by a Lagrangian relaxation. We give modeling extensions and show by numerical experiments the improvements from using piecewise-linear approximation functions.
L93|Liberalism in Foreign Trade versus Liberalism in Air Transportation - Is there a Link?|: The aim of this paper is to determine whether there is a statistically significant link between regulation of international civil aviation and protectionism against foreign trade. We use weighted air liberalization index (WALI) as a proxy for the level of regulation in a countryâ€™s foreign aviation relations; trade tariff restrictiveness index (TTRI) and overall trade restrictiveness index (OTRI) as proxies for the level of protectionism in a countryâ€™s foreign trade. Correlation analysis shows that there is no statistically significant link between the indicators. Hence, our research confirms the view that air transportation is a specific sector and it is subject to a different kind of policies than trade in goods. We also demonstrate that large high-income countries tend to have a more liberal approach to international civil aviation than small low-income countries
L93|Estimating dynamic demand for airlines|This paper uses an original panel dataset with posted prices and sales to estimate a dynamic demand. We find that consumers become more price sensitive as time to departure nears which is consistent with having lower valuations. This result provides empirical support to a key theoretical implication in Deneckere and Peck (2012)—high-valuation consumers purchase earlier. We also find that the number of active consumers increases closer to departure.

L93|Network evolution, success, and regional development in the European aerospace industry|The success breeds success hypothesis has been mainly applied to theoretical network approaches. We investigate the European aerospace industry using data on the European Framework Programmes and on Airbus suppliers, focusing on the success breeds success hypothesis at four levels of analysis: the spatial structure of the European aerospace R&D collaboration network, its topological architecture, the individual actors that make up the network, and through a comparison of the Airbus invention and production networks. On the spatial level, SBS is favored: successful regions maintain their position and grow on a large scale, especially so for regions that have strongly participated from the very beginning. The regional hub structure is mirrored in the architecture of the European aerospace R&D collaboration network, where well-connected hub organizations play a key role in shaping the structure of the network through their many collaborative partnerships and do so in a way that strategically positions themselves with greater ability to access and regulate knowledge flows, as assessed by several centrality measures. Only successful organizations have the ability to form so many ties, with success thus breeding success in the European aerospace R&D collaboration network. The importance of the core organizations made clear through the centrality analysis is further supported by the analysis of weak ties, where we observe that the core organizations are connected to the rest of the network with many weak ties, thereby confirming their outstanding positions in the European aerospace R&D collaboration network as being able to access knowledge or other resources. With the combination of the R&D collaboration network and the Airbus production network on a spatial level, we see additional support for SBS, as those regions whose actors are frequent participants in both networks show the greatest share of successful actors. The European aerospace industry shows an ambidextrous character as a whole, which is nonetheless insufficient to avoid recent and future challenges demanding a strong emphasis on production skills.
L93|An empirical analysis of airline business model convergence|Based on a sample of 26 European passenger airlines, this study analyzes the development of airline business models over time. We used various distance measures to calculate concrete differentiation levels among these airlines between 2004 and 2012. The results indicate increasing similarity among these airlines, which lends support to the generally assumed convergence trend. The present paper complements the mostly qualitative and anecdotal literature on convergence in the airline industry, empirically shows actual adaptations in airlines' business models, and provides a platform for further research in the fields of empirical convergence analysis and corresponding strategic airline management.
L93|Internet Penetration and Capacity Utilization in the US Airline Industry|Airline capacity utilization increased dramatically between 1993 and 2007, after staying fairly level following deregulation. We argue that consumers' use of the Internet to investigate and purchase airline tickets reduces market frictions and allows airlines to meet demand with less capacity and higher load factors. We find that differences in the rate of change of metropolitan area Internet penetration are positively correlated with differences in the rate of change of airlines' airport-pair load factors. Consistent with our explanation, this correlation is greater on flights in more competitive markets and on flights with fewer total passengers.
L93|Airline Pricing, Price Dispersion, and Ticket Characteristics on and off the Internet|This paper uses transaction data to investigate the effects of Internet purchase on airline fares. Our data include ticket characteristics, restrictions, flight load factors, and dates and channel of purchase. Controlling for ticket and flight characteristics, online purchasers pay about 11 percent less than offline purchasers, which seems rooted in more efficient shopping. The results do not support a spillover in terms of reduced fares or dispersion from greater Internet shopping. The paper also uses the data to reevaluate the relationship between market concentration and fares, but fails to identify any statistically significant, robust relationship.
L93|Mixed effects of low-cost airlines on tourism in Spain|This article presents an estimate of the impact of low-cost airlines on Spanish tourism arriving from the principal EU-15 member states during the first decade of the 21st century by means of a multivariate analysis of tourist demand. The effects of low-cost companies (LCCs) on expenditure and on the number of tourists are separated. The expansion in low-cost airlines have had a positive and strong effect on the number of tourists but seems not to have influenced at all the aggregate expenditure made by them as the expenditure by tourist has decreased perhaps due to an increasing number of tourist with higher frugality or lesser income. This result could be regarded as a useful guide to policy makers when they subsidize LCCs.
L93|International passanger survey at the Airport Debrecen – Main characteristics of departure visitors from AD| The main reason of the research is to make a survey of the habits of foreign visitors arriving in Debrecen by air and their satisfaction. What was experienced in 2013 regarding low foreign proportion is also noticable in 2014. In the examined two months, of the whole passenger traffic between London and Debrecen only 10-15% is tourism by foreign visitors. There was not any information before about consumption of tourists arriving in Debrecen by air. In the course of my research I was examining the main elements of consumptions. From the gathered infromation from the questionaires it can be ascertained that on many occasions service providers failed to accomplish satisfying levels, quality. Underachievement occured and the experience of the visitors was worse than their expectations. This gives reasons for the indicators detailed analysis. The results of the satisfaction test might be an essential basis to further develop the city’s tourist products and services in the future. Personal experience of either visitors satisfaction or dissatisfaction, gets stored as a memory which influences future decisions on travelling. Because of this the city has to make an effort to provide higher standards of quality to people travelling into Debrecen by air from the first moment of arrival till the last moment of departure and leave satisffied.
L93|On the Tractability of the Piecewiselinear Approximation for General Discrete-Choice Network Revenue Management|The choice network revenue management (RM) model incorporates customer purchase behavior as customers purchasing products with certain probabilities that are a function of the offered assortment of products, and is the appropriate model for airline and hotel network revenue management, dynamic sales of bundles, and dynamic assortment optimization. The underlying stochastic dynamic program is intractable and even its certainty-equivalence approximation, in the form of a linear program called Choice Deterministic Linear Program (CDLP) is difficult to solve in most cases. The separation problem for CDLP is NP-complete for MNL with just two segments when their consideration sets overlap; the affine approximation of the dynamic program is NP-complete for even a single-segment MNL. This is in contrast to the independent-class (perfect-segmentation) case where even the piecewise-linear approximation has been shown to be tractable. In this paper we investigate the piecewise-linear approximation for network RM under a general discrete-choice model of demand. We show that the gap between the CDLP and the piecewise-linear bounds is within a factor of at most 2. We then show that the piecewise-linear approximation is polynomially-time solvable for a fixed consideration set size, bringing it into the realm of tractability for small consideration sets; small consideration sets are a reasonable modeling tradeoff in many practical applications. Our solution relies on showing that for any discrete-choice model the separation problem for the linear program of the piecewise-linear approximation can be solved exactly by a Lagrangian relaxation. We give modeling extensions and show by numerical experiments the improvements from using piecewise-linear approximation functions.
L93|Nonlinear Pricing Strategies And Competitive Conditions In The Airline Industry|" type=""main"" xml:lang=""en""> This paper empirically examines the effect of competitive conditions on nonlinear pricing strategies in the airline industry. We use a unique data set to analyze the impact of concentration and the competitive pressures generated by Southwest and other low cost carriers on the relative prices within a menu of fares. The menu orders tickets by quality based upon cabin and ticket restrictions. We analyze the ratio of fares charged for various qualities within the menu to the fares charged for the lowest quality nonrefundable, restricted tickets. We observe a fare compression for only the highest fares on only the most concentrated (i.e., monopoly) routes. This result is something of a puzzle given a monopolist's market power. We find, however, that actual and potential competition from Southwest reduces low end fares and generally leads to substantial fare compression throughout the fare menu. (JEL L11, L93)"
L93|Full Throttle: Reforming Canada's Aviation Policy|Federal government policies are a major cause of high costs throughout the aviation supply chain, often leading Canadians to waste time and money by seeking lower fares at nearby US airports, or not travel at all. High fuel taxes and onerous foreign ownership and airline-specific policies are harming the competitiveness of airlines. Meanwhile, airports have been transformed from the rundown state they were in when operated by the federal government to become world leaders in customer service and quality. However, Canada’s airports are now handicapped by federal government policies that result in otherwise higher costs for travellers. If Canadians are to have the most economically efficient aviation system possible – crucial for such a geographically vast country – the federal government should enact a comprehensive set of policy reforms across the aviation sector. The federal and provincial governments should reduce, or eliminate, remaining aviation fuel taxes. The federal government should also gradually loosen foreign ownership restrictions on Canadian airlines, eliminate both company-specific burdens and protection for Air Canada, and attempt to renegotiate open skies agreements with the United States and the European Union to open the right to operate on domestic routes to all international airlines. Twenty years ago, Canada was a global leader in moving airports from government to private operation. While the federal government still owns the major airports proper, it signed operating leases with not-for-profit airport authorities. These airport authorities make long-term commitments that the looming end of leases may soon jeopardize, necessitating Ottawa to take action soon. The federal government should sell its remaining interest in the leases at airports it owns either to the not-for-profit airport authorities that currently operate them or to for-profit corporations. Such sales could make investors, airlines, travelers, and taxpayers all better off.Rather than regulating privately owned airports, government policy should focus on increasing competition in the sector. For example, if the City of Toronto approves the extension of the runway at the Billy Bishop Toronto City Island Airport and allows jets of all types that meet noise requirements to operate there, that would benefit travelers by enhancing competition locally and beyond.Ottawa should treat airports and airlines like regular businesses, remove sector-specific taxes and ownership and operation regulations, and let our Canadian aviation companies compete on the world stage.
L93|Measuring strategic firm interaction in product-quality choices: The case of airline flight frequency|This paper investigates strategic interaction among airlines in product-quality choices. Using an instrumental variables approach, the paper estimates flight-frequency reaction functions, which relate an airline׳s frequency on a route to its own characteristics and to the frequencies of competing airlines. A positive reaction function slope is found in some cases, suggesting the presence of strategic interaction in the choice of frequencies. The paper also asks whether multimarket contact generates mutual forbearance in frequency competition, finding no evidence for such an effect.
L93|Flight cancellation as a reaction to the tarmac delay rule: An unintended consequence of enhanced passenger protection|We examine the effects of the US DOT׳s tarmac delay rule (effective April 29, 2010) on flight cancellations and gate departure delays, using carrier-level panel data for the period between May 2008 and April 2012. Our results suggest the DOT׳s investigations of tarmac delay incidents triggered risk-averse behavior by investigated carriers, which increased flight cancellations and gate departure delays to avoid violating the rule. Carriers׳ preemptive flight cancellations are estimated to have affected about 308,900 passengers in 2011 alone. The results also suggest that these side effects persist for at least two years after the investigations, having larger adverse effects on passengers booked on the highest and lowest frequency routes. The costs and benefits of the rule need reevaluation.
L93|Aviation fuel demand development in China|This paper analyzes the core factors and the impact path of aviation fuel demand in China and conducts a structural decomposition analysis of the aviation fuel cost changes and increase of the main aviation enterprises’ business profits. Through the establishment of an integrated forecast model for China’s aviation fuel demand, this paper confirms that the significant rise in China’s aviation fuel demand because of increasing air services demand is more than offset by higher aviation fuel efficiency. There are few studies which use a predictive method to decompose, estimate and analyze future aviation fuel demand. Based on a structural decomposition with indirect prediction, aviation fuel demand is decomposed into efficiency and total amount (aviation fuel efficiency and air transport total turnover). The core influencing factors for these two indexes are selected using path analysis. Then, univariate and multivariate models (ETS/ARIMA model and Bayesian multivariate regression) are used to analyze and predict both aviation fuel efficiency and air transport total turnover. At last, by integrating results, future aviation fuel demand is forecast. The results show that the aviation fuel efficiency goes up by 0.8% as the passenger load factor increases 1%; the air transport total turnover goes up by 3.8% and 0.4% as the urbanization rate and the per capita GDP increase 1%, respectively. By the end of 2015, China’s aviation fuel demand will have increased to 28 million tonnes, and is expected to be 50 million tonnes by 2020. With this in mind, increases in the main aviation enterprises’ business profits must be achieved through the further promotion of air transport.
L93|Fuel hedging, operational hedging and risk exposure — Evidence from the global airline industry|The aviation industry is characterized by low profit margins and a constant struggle with skyrocketing fuel costs. Financial and operational hedging strategies serve aviation managers as a tool to counteract high and volatile fuel prices. While most research on fuel hedging has concentrated on the U.S. airline market, this paper is the first study to include airlines from Asia and Europe. We analyze 64 airlines over 11years and find that Asian carriers are more negatively exposed than European airlines but less exposed than North American airlines. In contrast to Treanor, Simkins, Rogers and Carter (2012), this study finds less significant negative exposure coefficients among U.S. carriers. Using a fixed effects model we reject the hypothesis that financial hedging decreases risk exposure. One possibility is that the decreased volatility in jet fuel prices over the past few years has perhaps made airlines less exposed to fuel prices and hence, financial hedging is less effective. Operational hedging, defined by two proxies for fleet diversity, does not reduce exposure significantly, either. In contrast, a one percentage point increase in fleet diversity, calculated with a dispersion index using different aircraft types, increases the risk exposure coefficient by 1.83%. On the other hand, fleet diversity, calculated with different aircraft families, increases exposure by only 0.63%. These results are supported by the global trend of airline managers to reduce fleet diversity. Airlines have reduced their fleet diversity by 7.70% or 10.77% (depending on the proxy) between 2002 and 2012. The greatest reduction can be found among European airlines with 23.12% (28.04%).
L93|Exposure, hedging, and value: New evidence from the U.S. airline industry|For a variety of reasons, the U.S. airline industry is a natural sample to analyze the relation between corporate risk exposure, hedging policy, and firm value. First, we find that airline exposures to fuel prices are higher when fuel prices are high or when they are rising. Second, we analyze the relation between exposure coefficients and the percentage of next year's fuel requirement hedged by airlines. In response to higher fuel price levels, rising fuel prices, and higher levels of exposure to fuel prices, airlines tend to increase their hedging activity. Finally, we explore the previously documented jet fuel hedging premium illustrated in Carter, Rogers, and Simkins (2006). We find a positive hedging premium in our analysis; however, the interaction of hedging and exposure does not affect firm value. We conclude that airlines increasing hedging activity because of higher fuel price exposure are not valued higher compared to those airlines employing more stable hedging policies.
L93|Market definition for broadband internet in Slovakia – Are fixed and mobile technologies in the same market?|This paper uses a rich survey of 6446 households in Slovakia to estimate price elasticities of demand for Internet access, and draw implications for market definition. We estimate a mixed logit model, in which households choose between different broadband technologies: DSL, cable modem, fibre, WiFi and mobile. We find that a number of household characteristics influence the technology choices, and there is also significant unobserved heterogeneity. Demand for Internet access is highly price sensitive. The price elasticity of demand for DSL is −3.02, which falls in the middle of the range of elasticities for the other technologies. Furthermore, the price elasticity of demand at the level of all fixed broadband technologies (DSL+cable modem+fibre+WiFi) is equal to −1.98. For a reasonable range of profit margins, this estimate implies that mobile broadband should be included in the relevant antitrust market of fixed broadband. Our findings have implications for competition policy in Central and Eastern European countries where due to poor copper networks mobile broadband is an important alternative to fixed broadband.
L93|Price discrimination through refund contracts in airlines|This paper shows how an airline monopoly uses refundable and non-refundable tickets to screen consumers who are uncertain about their travel. Our theoretical model predicts that the difference between these two fares diminishes as individual demand uncertainty is resolved. Using an original data set from U.S. airline markets, we find strong evidence supporting our model. Price discrimination opportunities through refund contracts decline as the departure date nears and individuals learn about their demand.
L93|The role of aviation laws and legal liability in aviation disasters: A financial market perspective|Legal liability claims against airlines and airplane manufacturers following an aviation disaster are determined through a myriad of international treaties, intercarrier agreements, and federal and state laws. Which law applies in a specific situation depends on various circumstances surrounding the accident. As a result, pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage awards for the families of the accident victims may vary substantially from case to case. Our study examines how aviation disasters affect the short and long-term performance of US airlines and US airplane manufacturers and explores the factors that drive the performance differences. While prior research has largely focused on brand name effects and rising insurance premiums as possible determinants of stock price losses, our results suggest that the regulatory environment that applies to a given aviation accident has a significant impact on how the market reacts to its announcement. Ceteris paribus, we find that accidents that are governed by state laws which place no limit on damage claims entail particularly large stock price declines. Accidents for which federal laws or international treaties restrict claimable damages, on the other hand, are associated with smaller stock price drops.
L93|Economies of traffic density and scale in the integrated air cargo industry: The cost structures of FedEx Express and UPS Airlines|This paper examines the cost structures of the leading integrated air cargo carriers, FedEx Express and UPS Airlines. A total cost model is estimated for the two carriers using quarterly data on domestic operations and costs over a nine-year period (2003â€“2011). The estimated model indicates that the integrated industry exhibits increasing returns to traffic density and constant returns to scale. Accounting for carrier-specific differences in cost structure and network size, FedEx Express is found to be more cost-efficient than UPS Airlines. Looking at the carriers individually, UPS Airlines exhibits substantial economies of traffic density and constant returns to scale while FedEx Express' cost structure is characterized by weak economies of density and constant returns to scale. The combined effect of returns to density and returns to scale on the cost structures of integrated carriers is captured by economies of size. Both FedEx Express and UPS Airlines exhibit economies of size, indicating that carriers in the integrated industry can be more cost efficient by making appropriate adjustments to their network size as their output grows. Moreover, the relative cost-efficiencies of the carriers are reversed when their network-size differences are not controlled.
L93|Modeling the effects of wage premiums on airline competition under asymmetric economies of density: A case study from Brazil|This paper investigates the effects of wage premiums on the competition between Full Service Carriers (FSC) and Low Fare Carriers (LFC) in the airline industry. We study the impact of changes in the labor market and the resulting effects on performance in the product market and examine the role of economies of density. We develop an oligopoly model of airline competition with endogenous wages and simulate increases in labor costs. We apply the model to the case of the most important domestic route of Brazil using airline/route-specific demand and costs data. Our chief contribution relies on the empirical model of asymmetric economies of density for the competing business models. We estimate that LFCs have higher economies of density than FSCs. With the empirical models of demand, costs and wages, we compute the wage-elasticities of price-cost markups. We find that, on account of the higher sensitivity of marginal costs to labor costs of the FSCs, their markups are more affected by wage premium increases than the markups of the LFCs. The results are attenuated by higher economies of density, but amplified by higher price-elasticities of demand and lower economic growth.
L93|The effects of global alliances on international flight frequencies: Some evidence from Italy|We collect half-yearly data on nonstop flight frequencies offered by carriers on routes originating from Italian regions to European countries in the period 1998â€“2010. We find that, as the share of flights belonging to global alliances increases, the number of flights offered by airlines simultaneously expands, especially in the case of full-service carriers. Moreover, there is also evidence that the number of global alliances has a positive impact on flight supply.
L93|Mutual influence across routes using a common airport: The case of the domestic market in Japan|This paper empirically investigates the mutual influence of traffic volumes across routes serving the same airport. Regression analysis using the data on Japan's domestic air transport market reveals that an increase in passengers on a given route has a positive effect on the number of passengers on other routes that share an endpoint airport with the given route. This result implies that a change in policy for an airport is likely to influence routes that do not serve that airport as well as the routes that do.
L93|Airlines’ strategic interactions and airport pricing in a dynamic bottleneck model of congestion|This paper analyzes efficient pricing at a congested airport dominated by a single firm. Unlike much of the previous literature, we combine a dynamic bottleneck model of congestion and a vertical structure model that explicitly considers the role of airlines and passengers. We show that a Stackelberg leader interacting with a competitive fringe partially internalizes congestion, and that there are various toll regimes that induce the welfare maximizing outcome, widening the set of choices for regulators. In particular, charging the congestion toll that would apply for fully competitive carriers and that ignores any internalization, to both the leader and the fringe, yields the first-best outcome.
L93|Should jet fuel surcharges be regulated, and if so, how?|By adding fuel surcharges to base fares, airlines pass on the impact of higher jet fuel prices to consumers. Given the wide range of design options for fuel surcharge schemes, the reduced price transparency and the question of fair cost recovery, fuel surcharges have become a consumer protection issue. The paper reviews the regulatory approach to fuel surcharges in Brazil, the European Union, Japan and the United States. Further, it addresses the complexity of attempts to construct fuel surcharge schemes that rely on estimates of per-passenger fuel costs. The paper concludes that regulatory activities should aim to include fuel surcharges in all initial fare quotes and advertising. Enforcing fuel surcharge schemes that ensure a fair cost recovery would result in high regulatory costs and would also be in conflict with deregulation policies of removing restrictions on airline pricing.
L93|Why do contracts between airlines and airports fail?|We investigate the sustainability of vertical contracts between airports and airlines. We focus on the case of Quantity Forcing contracts, with a theoretical model that accommodates changes to the contracts' clauses or environments in a two period game, since contracts often include clauses that determine obligations for airlines and airports to be accomplished in more than a single period. We find that contracts – by which airlines commit to carry to the airport the quantity that maximizes joint profits and airports commit to advertise the airlines and to rebate charges – are not sustainable. The relationship holds for both the finite periods and a two period game, a situation similar to a Prisoner's Dilemma. Nevertheless, when there is uncertainty from demand fluctuations the Nash equilibrium of the game depends on the magnitude of the expected fall on demand and on the probability of the state of nature.
L93|Marginal costs estimation and market power of German airports|From a theoretical prospective, marginal costs are one of the main determinants of pricing policy. However, their complexity and to some extend the artificiality of marginal costs makes the concept very unpopular among practitioners, also in the aviation industry. Nevertheless, in this paper we aim to estimate cost functions for German airports and derive marginal costs for different types of aircraft using them. This allows us to make efficiency comparison for aeronautical activities. Moreover, using the results of Morrison (1982), we are also able to estimate the “k” coefficients of the Ramsey-pricing formula and then use it as a proxy for market power of these airports. As the result we obtain two rankings from the sample: the first is the cost efficiency ranking of airports, and the second ranking is with respect to market power.
L93|Marginal costs pricing of airport operations in Norway|The article first reviews the charge scheme used to finance the airport infrastructure in Norway. Then an econometric approach is taken using empirical data for production and costs from 2007 to 2009 in order to derive long-run marginal costs for passengers and air traffic movements at Norwegian airports using panel data analysis. The marginal costs are then applied as the basis for a revised airport charge scheme designed to meet the principle of maximizing social benefits. The results suggest that there should be a shift towards a relatively higher charge for passengers compared to air traffic movements.
L93|Charges of uncongested German airports: Do they follow Ramsey pricing scheme?|Ramsey pricing is considered to be a quasi-optimum pricing scheme designed for a multiproduct natural monopolist. Ramsey prices are optimal for airports with cost recovery problems, but are inefficient for busy airports. If so then it is interesting to check if current charges are close to the optimal one, and if not then why and by how much do they differ?
L93|U.S. air carriers and work-rule constraints – Do airlines employ an allocatively efficient mix of inputs?|Past research on the allocation of factor inputs for the airline industry suggests an overutilization of labor relative to other inputs immediately following deregulation. This study argues rigid work rules in conjunction with productivity improvements of nonlabor inputs may create an incentive for carriers to under-invest in labor relative to nonlabor inputs. Findings derived from estimating a long-run shadow cost function for this industry suggest that airlines over-employ non-labor inputs relative to labor. Simulations suggest potential savings ranging from 13 to 14 percent derived from satisfying the conditions of allocative efficiency for carriers in the study's sample.
L93|Airline route structure competition and network policy|We analyze the behavior of airlines in terms of route structure choice using a differentiated duopoly model that accounts for congestion externalities, passenger benefits from increased frequency, passenger connecting costs and airline endogenous hub location. We also examine the route structure configuration that maximizes welfare and whether it can arise as an equilibrium when a regulator implements optimal airport pricing, but does not regulate directly the route structure choice. We find that this is not always the case and that, therefore, an instrument directly aimed at regulating route structure choice may be needed to maximize welfare, in addition to per-passenger and per-flight tolls designed to correct output inefficiencies. This holds true when the regulator is constrained to set non-negative tolls, but also for unconstrained tolling. Finally, we also study the relative efficiency of airport pricing when the optimal route structure configuration cannot be decentralized by tolling.
L93|Economic effects of air transport market liberalization in Africa|Although the aviation industry is increasingly becoming important for Africa's economic development and integration, the ability of airlines to access foreign markets remains hindered by restrictive regulatory policies. Attempts have been made to fully liberalize the intra-African air transport market. Except for general assertions about the merits/demerits of liberalization, our empirical understanding of the welfare effects of such polices in Africa remains rudimentary. This study empirically measures the economic effects of air transport liberalization, mainly on two supply side variables: fare and service quality, measured as departure frequency. The results show up to 40 % increase in departure frequency in routes that experienced some type of liberalization compared to those governed by restrictive bilateral air service agreements. While the effect of liberalization is substantial in improving service quality, there is no evidence of its fare reducing effect.
L93|Airlines, Delays, Social Optimum, Calibration|The so-called buffer time or buffer delay allows airlines to control for excessive delays by introducing extra time in their schedule in addition to what is technically required. . We study the differences between unregulated markets - where airlines are free to fix their buffer times strategically - and a situation where a social planner would control for time schedules, and in particular the buffer time. To do so, we use a calibrated model of a network of three cities - one of them being a hub - served by a single airline. Welfare losses that follow from delays are relatively small as compared to the potential benefits that would follow from a decrease in ticket prices. The model thus advocates that, at least for the connections that are considered, fares rather than delays should be the focus of institutions aiming at enhancing passengers’ welfare.
L93|Aviation Demand as Covariate of Economic Growth in Bangladesh: Cointegration Estimation and Causality Analysis|The main purpose of the paper is to empirically examine the aviation-led growth hypothesis for Bangladesh by testing causality between aviation and economic growth. We resort to econometric tests such as unit root tests and test of cointegration purposed by Johansen (1988). Fully Modified OLS, Dynamic OLS and Conical Cointegration Regression are used to estimate the cointegration equation for time span of 1973 to 2012. Empirical results reveal the existence of relationship between aviation demand and economic growth. Graphic methods such as Cholesky Impulse Response function (both accumulated and non-accumulated) and variance decomposition have also been applied to render the analysis rigorous. The positive contribution of aviation demand to economic growth is similar in all three estimation techniques of cointegration equation. Finally Granger causality test is also applied to find the direction of causal relationship. Findings help in lime-lighting the importance of aviation industry in economic growth for a developing country like Bangladesh.
L93|The Value Of Bluer Skies. – How Much Do Consumers Gain From Entry By Jetblue Airways In Long-Haul U.S. Airline Markets?|The paper estimates the effects of entry by low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways in long-haul domestic U.S. airline markets. For the period from 2000 to 2009, we find that non-stop fares were on average about 21 percent lower post-entry ; however, the magnitude of the price effect depends on the pre-entry market structure. While entry into monopoly markets triggered an average price decrease of about 25 percent, the respective average price drop for entries into oligopoly markets lied at about 15 percent. Based on additional estimates of the price and income elasticities for longhaul domestic U.S. flights, we conclude that JetBlue’s long-haul entries alone led to an increase in consumer welfare of about USD 661 million.
L93|Economic importance of air transport and airport activities in Belgium – Report 2012|This study assesses the economic importance of air transport and airport activities in Belgium in terms of value added, employment and investment over the 2009-2012 period 1 . The sector considered embraces not only the activities directly connected with air transport, but also all the activities that take place on site at the six Belgian airports (Antwerp, Brussels, Charleroi, Kortrijk, Liège and Ostend). The study reviews the direct and indirect effects of the sector on the basis of microeconomic data (mainly obtained from the Central Balance Sheet Office) and macroeconomic data (from the National Accounts Institute). It also includes an analysis of the social balance sheet and certain ratios using Central Balance Sheet Office data. In 2012, air transport and airport activities generated € 5.6 billion in direct and indirect value added (i.e. 1.5 % of Belgian GDP) and employed 66,200 people in full-time equivalents (FTEs) either directly or indirectly (1.7 % of domestic employment). Brussels Airport is the country’s biggest airport in terms of passenger traffic, but has seen its leading position somewhat eroded by Charleroi, which with Ryanair has staged robust growth in the low-cost segment. Meanwhile, Liège has assumed the position of leading cargo airport and currently accounts for over half of total cargo traffic to and from Belgium. Charleroi and Liège are the fastest growing airports in terms of value added and employment. With the exception of Ostend, the Flemish regional airports have also proved resilient on both counts, while Brussels Airport may be described as holding more or less steady.
L93|How Airline Markets Work…or Do They? Regulatory Reform in the Airline Industry|No abstract is available for this item.
L93|A Model of Dynamic Limit Pricing with an Application to the Airline Industry|The one-shot nature of most theoretical models of strategic investment, especially those based on asymmetric information, limits our ability to test whether they can fit the data. We develop a dynamic version of the classic Milgrom and Roberts (1982) model of limit pricing, where a monopolist incumbent has incentives to repeatedly signal information about its costs to a potential entrant by setting prices below monopoly levels. The model has a unique Markov Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium under a standard form of refinement, and equilibrium strategies can be computed easily, making it well suited for empirical work. We provide reduced-form evidence that our model can explain why incumbent airlines cut prices when Southwest becomes a potential entrant into airport-pair route markets, and we also calibrate our model to show that it can generate the large price declines that are observed in the data.

L93|Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI): Transport and Courier Services|This paper presents the services trade restrictiveness indices (STRIs) for transport and courier services. The STRIs are composite indices taking values between zero and one, zero representing an open market and one a market completely closed to foreign services providers. The indices are calculated for 40 countries, the 34 OECD members and Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. This report presents the first vintage of indicators for transport and courier services and captures de jure regulations in force in 2013. The STRI supports the view that these services are subject to very different regulatory frameworks and, in some cases, to a relatively elevated degree of regulation. Indices for air transport covering measures affecting commercial establishment and accompanying movement of natural persons are on average quite high (0.43), with little variation across countries. A preliminary assessment of restrictiveness in cross-border trade in the sector shows that, while some progress in easing restrictions has been achieved through open skies agreements, significant limitations remain in place. The maritime transport sector is moderately open with an average STRI of 0.25. Foreign equity restrictions are still quite common in the sector and contribute significantly to the index. Most other sector-specific restrictions are found in the cabotage market and in ports. In road freight transport, the results confirm that the domestic road freight transport regime has been significantly liberalised over the years, and currently commercial establishment in the sector is largely affected by horizontal measures. The overall level of restrictiveness is relatively low with an average of 0.16, but exhibits pretty large variation. With respect to rail freight, the STRI also supports the view that considerable reforms have been undertaken in the sector in the past decades. The average level of restrictiveness is moderate at 0.22, although two countries maintain a statutory state-owned monopoly, which implies that the sector is completely closed to foreign suppliers. Finally, for courier services the results show that the overall level of restrictiveness is moderate with a sample average of 0.26. There is, however, large variation in STRI indices among countries. The elevated levels of restrictiveness are found in countries where foreign equity restrictions or statutory monopolies exist.
L93|The Network Effects of Air-Travel Demand|As demand increases, airline carriers often increase flight frequencies to meet the larger flow of passengers in their networks, which reduces passengers' schedule delays and attracts more demand. Motivated by this, I study a structural model of the U.S. airline industry accounting for possible network effects of demand compared with previous studies, the model implies higher cost estimates, which seem more consistent with the unprofitability of the industry; below-marginal-cost pricing becomes possible and appears on many routes. I also study airline mergers and find that the network effects can be the main factor underlying their profitability.

L93|A better deal for consumers and an attractive environment for investors: How the UK’s economic regulators are developing the use of regulatory and competition powers|There are great expectations in the UK for infrastructure and its role in delivering for customers and society, promoting efficiency and economic growth. These expectations are matched by an ambitious forward programme of investments in renewal and expansion of network capacity and quality across sectors, in some cases backed by the government and in others by private investors. Economic regulation and competition have a big role to play in aligning the interests of investors with the interests of customers and society. Specifically, in relation to investors, economic regulation and competition help to ensure investment is efficient, with the right investment taking place the right place, at the right time and at efficient cost. In this context, regulatory coherence and stability has rarely been so important. 2 In this paper we discuss • the relationship between competition and regulation, and the way regulators use their powers; • the importance of independent regulation in helping to ensure the delivery of what customers and society need, want and can afford from regulated sectors, particularly against a background of major investments in UK infrastructure; • how economic regulation needs to learn and evolve if it is to continue to help ensure delivery of what customers and society expect, given that regulated sectors and the environment in which they operate change over time; and • how the regulators are working together to maximise the benefits from coordination or read across between sectors.

This paper discusses: • the relationship between competition and regulation, as well as the way regulators use their powers; • the importance of independent regulation to ensure that consumer services are delivered efficiently, particularly in the context of major infrastructure investments in the United Kingdom; and • how UK economic regulators work together to improve the efficiency, uniformity and productivity of economic regulation.
L93|Air Cargo beyond Trade Barriers in Africa|We develop a methodology based on two important criteria - sensitivity in delivery time and value-to-weight ratio – to classify air cargo products. The classification is applied to evaluate the trade integration in Southern Africa since air cargo is a valuable option to overcome trade barriers associated with poor land transport infrastructure and corruption. We find that South Africa’s exports to industrialized countries consist of precious products such as diamonds and gold. These products tend to be transported in the hand baggage of a security personnel as they leave the loading weight of an average airplane almost unaffected. When correcting African trade for these ‘invisible outliers’ in the loading freight, we find that African trade integration including Southern Africa is based upon a comparatively higher share of air cargo relevant products than Southern Africa’s trade with industrialized and emerging economies. A more liberal market for air cargo services can reduce transport costs and will allow the continent to integrate even further.
L93|Demand uncertainty and capacity utilization in airlines|This paper studies the relationship between demand uncertainty—the key source of excess capacity—and capacity utilization in the US airline industry. We present a simple theoretical model that predicts that lower demand realizations are associated with higher demand volatility. This prediction is strongly supported by the results of estimating a panel GARCH framework that pools unique data on capacity utilization across different flights and over various departure dates. A one unit increase in the standard deviation of unexpected demand decreases capacity utilization by 21 percentage points. The estimation controls for unobserved time-invariant specific characteristics as well as for systematic demand fluctuations. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
L93|Time as a Trade Barrier|A large and growing share of world trade travels by air. We model exporters' choice between fast, expensive air cargo and slow, cheap ocean cargo, which depends on the price elasticity of demand and the value that consumers attach to fast delivery. We use US imports data that provide rich variation in the premium paid for air shipping and in time lags for ocean transit to extract consumers' valuation of time. We estimate that each day in transit is equivalent to an advalorem tariff of 0.6 to 2.1 percent. The most time-sensitive trade flows involve parts and components trade.
L93|The Welfare Effects of Use-or-Lose Provisions in Markets with Dominant Firms|A use-or-lose provision requires that firms employ a certain minimum fraction of their productive capacity. Variants have been used by regulators in the airline and wireless communications industries, among others. A typical stated objective is to limit capacity hoarding, thereby increasing aggregate output and welfare. When the dominant firm is more efficient than fringe firms, we find that imposing a use-or- lose provision induces the dominant firm to acquire capacity from the fringe, which causes aggregate output to fall. When the dominant firm is less efficient than the fringe, aggregate output rises. In both cases, total surplus may rise or fall. (JEL D43, K21, L13, L93)
L93|Assignment of Arrival Slots|Industry participants agree that, when inclement weather forces the FAA to reassign airport landing slots, incentives and property rights should be respected. We show that the FAA's Compression algorithm is incentive compatible, but fails to guarantee a form of property rights. This is significant since these conditions were the motivation for introducing Compression a decade ago. We give an alternative mechanism that does satisfy these conditions. It has the flavor of Top Trading Cycle variants of Abdulkadiroğlu and Sönmez (1999) and Pápai (2000) for related but distinct models. Finally, both mechanisms may fail another condition: the incentive to vacate unusable landing slots. (JEL D45, D82, L93, L98, P14, R41)
L93|On the Efficiency of Codeshare Contracts between Airlines: Is Double Marginalization Eliminated?|Previous research has suggested that codeshare agreements eliminate double marginalization that exists when unaffiliated airlines independently determine the price for different segments of an interline trip. Using a structural econometric model, this paper investigates whether codeshare contracts do eliminate double marginalization. The results suggest that both upstream and downstream margins persist when the operating carrier of a codeshare product also offers competing single-carrier product(s) in the concerned market. Furthermore, counterfactual simulations from the model suggest that efficient pricing of these codeshare products would lower their price, and yield nontrivial increases in consumer welfare.
L93|The Sky Is Not Flat: How Discriminatory Is the Access to International Air Services?|Using information on 2,300 Air Services Agreements covering 184 countries, we investigate the impact of air services liberalization on passenger flows. We find that a certain level of liberalization is required to have a positive effect on passenger traffic. In particular, we estimate that the multilateralization of multiple designation provisions, Open Skies Agreements and European Economic Area-type agreements would increase passenger traffic worldwide by 0.5, 5, and 10 percent, respectively. The potential endogeneity problem is carefully dealt with using instrumental variables and propensity score matching.
L93|A theory of the availability and level of consumer protection in online and mobile payments for public economic services|The mainstay of the paper is formed by an analysis of the factors that influence the community use of mobile payment for e-Government services, the use of mobile payment for the exchange of government goods and services, the types of e-Government services for which mobile payment is suitable, and real and perceived risks associated with mobile financial services. This paper presents a theory of the level of consumer protection and especially the availability of online payment systems and mobile public economic services, and highlights the use of Internet technology to provide effective and efficient public services. We underline the need to configure citizen-centric government services, accessibility challenges associated with the use of mobile, and diverse and transient nature of mobile technology use.
L93|Volatility Spillovers and Nonlinear Dynamics between Jet Fuel Prices and Air Carrier Revenue Passenger Miles in the US|This paper investigates the nonlinearities in the behavior of jet fuel prices and air carrier yields as measured by revenue passenger miles(RPMs), where one RPM is defined as one passenger flown one mile in revenue traffic. It indicates that previous research might have overlooked the possibilities of nonlinear dynamics between these two series. Drawing on existing tests of nonlinearities and chaos, this paper first investigates the existence of chaotic behavior as the source of nonlinearities in the monthly prices of jet fuel and RPMs. The findings show strong evidence that the two series exhibit nonlinear dependencies. Evidence is found, however, that this behavior may be inconsistent with chaotic structure. We propose and estimate bivariate GARCH(1,1) and bivariate EGARCH(1,1) models to ascertain the flow of information between jet fuel prices and revenue passenger miles. Estimation results of the bivariate GARCH models offer evidence that the shock transmission between the two series is mainly asymmetric, that is that positive and negative shocks impart degree of volatility differently. It is shown that the positive shocks to jet fuel prices show a substantially higher reaction from the revenue passenger miles. The conclusion is that, RPMs are quite responsive to upward volatility in prices of jet fuel, while falling jet fuel prices may not translate into efficiency gains.
