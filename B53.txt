B53|The Collaborative Innovation Bloc: A Reply to our Commentators|We are grateful for the comments to our article, and for the opportunity to respond to them. In our original contribution, we argued that the application of the EOE perspective could help make Austrian economics more concrete, relevant and persuasive, especially regarding policy prescriptions. At the heart of this perspective is the idea that entrepreneurship, when construed as the act of building an innovative firm, is an inherently collaborative activity. The comments have strengthened our conviction that the EOE perspective is of value for Austrian economics and been of great help in furthering our thinking on the matter. The comments have also helped us see how the perspective fits in with the broader tradition of Austrian economics.​

B53|The Urgent Need for an Economics of “Hategoatism”|The word “scapegoat” is defined as “a person made to bear the blame for others,” and similarly, “scapegoatism” refers to “the act or practice of assigning blame or failure to another, as to deflect attention or responsibility away from oneself” (Collins English Dictionary and Dictionary.com, respectively.) While these definitions do not mention economics specifically, in most cases the blame on the scapegoat is economic in nature. Scapegoatism also provides a convenient, though extremely inferior, substitute for valid analyses of economic problems. Scapegoatism, however, has a partner, dehumanization, which is the process of demonizing certain people as less than human and unworthy of humane treatment. Scapegoatism is not only accompanied by dehumanization, but it is often motivated by it. Thus, “scapegoatism” is a euphemism and it is understudied as a result, because there is no single term of art that combines scapegoatism and dehumanization. This paper offers a solution to this semantic dilemma by proposing the new term, “HATEGOATISM,” for the simultaneous existence of scapegoatism and dehumanization. Only one subfield of economics regularly embraces hategoatism, which is Libertarianism (where the “HATEGOAT” is government workers). Economists must lead by example by combating hategoatism, and that requires cleaning their own house first.
B53|Der spezifische Liberalismus von Hayek im Spektrum des Neoliberalismus|Friedrich August von Hayek hat der Nachwelt ein breites theoretisches Werk hinterlassen. Ein durchgängiger Wesenszug darin ist sein spezifischer Liberalismus, der durch einen negativen Begriff von Freiheit bestimmt ist. Damit verbunden ist Hayeks ausgeprägter methodologischer Individualismus. Doch Hayek polarisiert, und zwar nicht nur zwischen Anhängern und Gegnern, sondern auch innerhalb der Vertreter des neoliberalen Spektrums. Der Beitrag geht der Frage nach, in welchem Grade Hayek selbst die Verantwortung dafür trägt, indem Inkonsistenzen in seinem Denken aufgezeigt werden. Eine Konsequenz davon ist, dass Hayek zwar für verschiedene Varianten des Neoliberalismus als Bezugspunkt dient, aber die Heterogenität des modernen Neoliberalismus noch vertieft hat. Ob Hayek ein Ordoliberaler oder ein Marktradikaler ist, bleibt eine Frage, die bestenfalls tendenziell zu beantworten ist Ein einheitliches Denkkollektiv im Anschluss an Hayek existiert jedenfalls nicht, ebenso wenig wie ein homogener Neoliberalismus.
B53|Hayek on Expectations: The Interplay between two Complex Systems|In this paper we argue that Hayek’s expectations approach can be better understood by taking account of the interplay between two related complex systems: the complex system of cognition and the complex system of behavioral rules of action. The former is located at the individual level and concerns the way human beings perceive the physical world as and well as their fellow men. The second one concerns how human beings behave (essentially how they follow rules) and form expectations based on the properties of their cognitive systems, such that the system of rules to which they adhere provides higher order regularities which preserve their existence over time, that is, the existence of societies. The article is organized as follows. Section 1 provides a detailed description of these complex systems and emphasizes their differences. Section 2 deals with the interplay between these two systems, and discusses the consequences of forming expectations. Section 3 sums up the paper’s main arguments.
B53|The Collaborative Innovation Bloc: A New Mission for Austrian Economics|We argue that scholars in the Austrian tradition of economics should incorporate the notion of a collaborative innovation bloc into their study of spontaneous market order. We demonstrate how successful entrepreneurship depends on an innovation bloc of this kind, a system of innovation that evolves and within which activity takes place through time. The innovation bloc consists of five pools of economic skills from which people are drawn or recruited to form part of a collaborative team, which is necessary if innovation-based venturing is to flourish. The five skills are entrepreneurs, early- and later-stage-financiers, key personnel, and customers. Through real-world examples, we show how the application of the collaborative innovation bloc perspective could help make Austrian economics more concrete, relevant and persuasive, especially in regard to policy prescriptions.
B53|A note on re-switching and the neo-Austrian concept of the average period of production|The neo-Austrian average period of production is calculated by taking the shares of costs referable to each period out of the total amount of costs as weights. Once this notion had been introduced, its inverse relationship with the rate of interest prompted some scholars to believe that it could serve as a good measure of capital intensity. As will be shown, however, this new average period poses some problems. On the one hand, the inverse relationship mentioned above does not preclude the re-switching of production methods. On the other, if re-switching occurs, the most roundabout method may paradoxically be the one that gives the smallest net output per worker. This result can affect the revival of the Austrian business-cycle theory.
B53|Monopoly Capital and Innovation: An Exploratory Assessment of R&D Effectiveness|This research note performs some limited empirical assessments of the Baran and Sweezy (1966) contention that most research and development (R&D) efforts in the US are “wasted” at the macroeconomic level in that as R&D succeeds by absorbing a little of the excess economic surplus generated by a capitalist system, it still fails to generate a lot of innovation of a transformative nature. At an aggregate level, greater R&D efforts are correlated with higher worker productivity and standards of living, which is to be expected according to mainstream economic theory and literature. Yet, R&D efforts regarding job creation, new firm creation, and net business investment show either mixed results or even negative connections. There is some preliminary empirical support in this paper for many aspects of the Baran and Sweezy point of view on R&D, and these findings also hint that R&D is used in a monopoly capital system to further monopolization. The findings of this note also may help to explain how productivity gains and innovation over the last few decades may not be benefitting the typical worker or the creation of small businesses as well.
B53|Ökonomische Expertise und politökonomische Machtstrukturen|Aufbauend auf neueren und älteren Forschungsergebnissen zum Einfluss von ÖkonomInnen auf politische Entscheidungsprozesse und mediale wirtschaftspolitische Debatten wird in diesem Beitrag ein eklatantes politökonomisches Machtungleichgewicht unter einflussreichen ökonomischen ExpertInnen aufgezeigt: Es kann vor allem in Deutschland eine starke Dominanz von neo- bzw. ordoliberalen Interessenskoalitionen bzw. -netzwerken gegenüber alternativen, keynesianischen oder gewerkschaftsnahen Netzwerken konstatiert werden, wohingegen in Österreich durch eine noch stärkere Bedeutung korporatistischer Strukturen dieses Ungleichgewicht zumindest schwächer ausgeprägt ist. Auf Basis dieses Beitrags kann argumentiert werden, dass das politökonomische Machtungleichgewicht in der Ökonomik als einer der Grundpfeiler der Persistenz neoliberaler Wirtschaftspolitiken zugunsten ökonomisch Mächtiger zu verstehen ist.

Unsere These ist, dass in jenem Denkkollektiv der Kollektivgedanke ""des Marktes"" enthalten ist, wir zeigen dies anhand grundlegender Werke von Ludwig von Mises, dem Begründer des Marktfundamentalismus, sowie führender Denker des Ordoliberalismus. In diesem Beitrag wollen wir (1) auf konzeptioneller Ebene zeigen, auf welche Weise das Konzept ""des Marktes"" als eine ""Tiefenstruktur"" im Denken unterschiedlicher ökonomischer TheoretikerInnen verstanden werden kann, und (2) andeuten, welchen Einfluss diese konzeptionelle Grundlage des ökonomischen Denkens auf konkrete Vorstellungen zur Organisation von politischen und gesellschaftlichen Prozessen hat."

Nach einem historischen Überblick über das Konzept von Metaphern wird die Geschichte des dominanten Stranges in der ökonomischen Theorie als Geschichte einer Metapher von der Maschine skiziiert In der Geschichte der ökonomischen Theorie finden sich immer Metaphern, diese können als Formen eines bildhaften Sprachgebrauchs verstanden werden. Eine besondere Rolle hat im Hauptrang der Theorieentwicklung die Metapher von der Maschine gespielt. Nach einem historischen Überblick über das Konzept von Metaphern (Kap. 1) und der Kulturgeschichte der Metapher von der Maschine (Kap. 3) wird die Geschichte der ökonomischen Theorie als achtstufige Geschichte einer Metapher von der Maschine skizziert: Bei Quesnay als einer machine économique mit Bezug auf die Philosophie von Descartes, bei Smith eine natural order mit Bezug auf die Mechanik bei Newton, bei Malthus und Ricardo als Konzept von ökonomischen Gesetzen in Analogie zu Naturgesetzen in einer Neuinterpretation von Newton - ähnlich auch bei John Stuart Mill, bei Jevons und Walras als explizit ausformulierte ""mechanistische Nationalökonomie"", bei Autoren wie Gérald Debreu als Neuformulierung des Ansatzes von Walras als einer Informationsmechanik, sowie bei Friedrich August von Hayek als Konzept von ""dem Markt"" als einem Informationsnetzwerk in Analogie zu einem Telekommunikationssystem."
B53|"Wissen und Nicht-Wissen angesichts ""des Marktes"": Das Konzept von Hayek"|"Das Paper diskutiert den Einfluss von Karl Friedrich August von Hayek auf die Geschichte der ökonomischen Theorie, vor allem durch sein Konzept ""des Marktes"" als Wissenvermittlungs- und Wissensgenerierungsinstanz. Das ist mit einem Konzept des Nicht-Wissens für den Menschen verbunden, der angesichts des ""Überwissens des Marktes"" die Fähigkeit verliert, über das Wirtschaftssystem angemessen reflektieren zu können. Damit ist eine Aufwertung des Wissen von UnternehmerInnen und eine Abwertung des Wissens von WirtschaftswissenschaftlerInnen verbunden - mit Konsequenzen für das Konzept der Politik und auf die Art, wie z.B. über Klimaprobleme diskutiert werden. Im Paper werden diese Konzepte in Bezug auf die Absicht von Hayek diskutiert, langffristig die gesamte Gesellschaft zu verändern."

Las implicaciones de su uso en la política económica|La teoría propuesta por la Escuela austriaca determina que la inflación no se ve afectada por el aumento en el nivel general de precios, sino que, se presenta por una variación de la masa monetaria sobre la variación del PIB. En este sentido, el documento busca encontrar esta medida de inflación para Colombia e interpretar, según el ciclo económico austriaco, las crisis presentadas en el periodo 1991-2011.
B53|Possibilities of use of the noble metals market in the life insurance|Motivation: The financial crisis of 2008 undermined the trust of many people to the financial markets. During such crises one can observe growing prices and trust among others to tangible assets including noble metals. Noble metals, to which following metals are classed: gold, silver, palladium and platinum, in contrary to current financial instruments (shares, bonds, derivatives, bank deposits) do not generate interests. They are instead one of forms of thesaurisation. Moreover, they constitute (mainly gold) good protection from inflation in contrary to the fiat money. In Poland this market is not very developed yet, but its growing popularity can be already observed. Aim: The main aim of this paper is to analyse the possibilities to use the market of noble metals in the market of life insurances. Results: The insurance companies can potentially use noble metals in typically protective products as well as in saving. Additional aim of this paper is to determine the attitude of people purchasing noble metals to the financial markets (including the insurance industry) and investigating their attitude to risk. For the purpose of the researching part, a survey among people purchasing noble markets was used. Moreover, this group can be potentially most interested in purchasing insurance products based on gold or silver.

B53|Les droits et libertés fondamentaux à l'épreuve de l'efficacité économique : une application à la politique de la concurrence|La place croissante que revêt l'analyse économique dans le contentieux juridique, y compris dans le contentieux constitutionnel, pose la question de son impact sur les droits et libertés fondamentaux. Ces derniers peuvent être mis en balance avec la logique de l'efficacité. Dans le droit de la concurrence de l’Union Européenne, la mise en oeuvre d'une approche plus économique (ou approche par les effets) et la montée en puissance des procédures négociées (souvent justifiée par des gains d'efficience en termes procéduraux) constituent un exemple d'évolution de la pratique décisionnelle pouvant mettre en jeu non seulement les droits de propriété et la liberté contractuelle des firmes mais aussi le contrôle juridictionnel lui-même. Cet exemple nous conduit à nous interroger sur l'analyse économique de ces deux droits fondamentaux. Nous insistons sur la diversité des approches économiques en la matière en confrontant les approches de l'analyse économique du droit à celles du vieil institutionnalisme et de l'approche autrichienne.
B53|The Role of Agents’ Propensity toward Conformity and Independence in the Process of Institutional Change|This paper analyses institutional change and Veblen’s work (1907, 1914, 1919) under the perspective of cognitive economics. Particularly it focuses on two interesting issues of Veblen’s theory of economic change: 1. in Veblen’s view habits are both mental habits and behavioral habits and they play a twofold role in economic change because they are particularly relevant both as elements of propensity, and as forces resisting to change. 2 Veblen gives an exhaustive definition of instincts and habits but he does not completely explain the cognitive processes that bring changes and evolution in social habits. He develops an economic theory at the base of which there is an evolutionary view of reality and a deep awareness of the role of the human mind within the decision-making processes of choice. This paper is aimed at analyzing both issues using the interpretive tools offered by psychology and discussing the role of agents psychological propensity toward conformity and independence in explaining institutional change. The central idea is that if we better encompass the theory of conformity and independence developed in psychology (starting from Asch, 1952) in the analysis of economic institutions, we can better explain institutional change. Conformity is the effect of the pressure of social group on agents’ behavior. That concept contributes to explain resistance to change. On the other hand, psychology shows that agents are also subject to mechanisms of independence. These are key elements in explaining behavioral change. The analysis of Veblen’s instinct-habit concept under conformity-independence perspective shows interesting connections between Veblen and Hayek’s ideas of economic change. Hayek’s concept of evolution based on psychological and neurobiological aspect, in fact, is a contribution of great significance both in explaining the dual role of habits in institutional change and in understanding individual mechanisms that bring changes in social habits.
B53|Playing at markets: A New Austrian perspective on macroeconomic policy|Abstract The New Austrian (also called Neo-Mengerian) paradigm emphasizes the importance of nonequilibrium and emergent processes in explaining the social world. In this paper I analyze macroeconomic policy from a New Austrian perspective. I define macroeconomic policy broadly, encompassing not only policy relating to business cycles and growth, but to any policy aimed at directly manipulating emergent variables. Such policy is fundamentally incoherent, since it attempts to divorce social outcomes from the processes that generate them and give them meaning. A New Austrian approach to macroeconomic policy, which focuses on the rules structuring nonequilibrium-emergent social processes, avoids this problem.
B53|The unresolved problem of gratuitous credit in Austrian banking theory|Abstract Ludwig von Mises called gratuitous credit, the ability banks have to create new credit, the chief problem in a theory of banking. This paper traces how Mises and succeeding generations of Austrian-school economists have grappled with this problem, but have failed to find resolution. The result is that Austrian economists disagree on a variety of issues in banking and business cycle theory, such as whether there is an endogenous business cycle under free banking, or cycles only occur under central banking. Before a resolution can be attempted, current thinking must be clarified. This paper divides Austrian economists into five schools of thought. It points to a possible resolution in the economic development writings of Joseph Schumpeter.
B53|New Austrian macro theory: A call for inquiry|Abstract This essay sketches some contours of what we think can reasonably be called New Austrian macro theory. By New Austrian, macro we mean a style of theorizing that incorporates the core of traditional or Old Austrian macro and pushes that core in new directions by using new analytical tools and methods. We would note that New Austrian is not some invention or construction de novo, but is a product of blending some traditional Austrian insights and formulations with new analytical formulations that were never part of the Austrian tradition but which can multiply the analytical oomph of that tradition. In this essay, we explain that the traditional Austrian macro theory suffers not from analytical wrong-headedness but from an underdevelopment of those complementary pieces of intellectual capital that would render Austrian macro once again a significant player in the efforts of economists to theorize about the properties of economic systems in their entirety.
B53|Dynamic coordinating non-equilibrium|Abstract Neo-Walrasian conceptualizations and DSGE models are incompatible with the emergence of coordination and discoordination in economic activity. While many conceptualizations stemming from the Austrian tradition are generally consistent with these fundamental problems, their process driven approach is hampered by the use of equilibrium constructs. This paper argues for the adoption of formal models that avoid this problem by addressing the following questions. Why should Austrian macroeconomists model? Where do models fit in with respect to pure and applied theory? How to model without equilibrium? To answer this final question I present a structure that aids in the construction and communication of such models.
B53|The Interest Rate and the Length of Production: A Comment|Machaj (2015) does a great service in pointing out a key assumption, heretofore unaddressed, in Filleule (2007) and Hülsmann (2010). Machaj errs, however, in stating that who saves will have an ambiguous effect on the interest rate and that where savings are directed can have ambiguous effects on the length of production. In this brief comment I will first show that who saves will have no effect on the interest rate. I then turn my attention to what it means to “lengthen” the structure of production. Although extended production time or additional “stages” of production make convenient placeholders for increased roundaboutness, they fail to grasp the core concept as it pertains to capital theory – what is it about production processes that makes more or better consumer goods?
B53|Monetary Constitutionalism: Some Recent Developments|The volume edited by Leland Yeager more than 50 years ago and published in 1962 under the title In Search of a Monetary Constitution has turned out to be remarkably prescient since the Great Inflation was then about to begin. One might expect that in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis and Great Recession interest in monetary-constitutional matters would be revived and this has indeed been the case. In this paper an attempt is made to assess whether and to what extent scientific progress has been made in defining the nature and characteristics of a monetary constitution for the post-Crisis world. To that end some recent contributions to the literature are reviewed critically.
B53|James M. Buchanan: Neoclassical, Austrian, Neither, or Both?|James McGill Buchanan (1919-2013) received the Nobel Memorial Prize in 1986 for his work in public choice theory, set out in his The Calculus of Consent (1962), co-authored with Gordon Tullock. The Virginia School of Political Economy can be seen as a product of the work of Buchanan and Tullock, along with Ronald Coase, who published his ground-breaking paper on “The Problem of Social Cost” in 1960 while he was at the University of Virginia. This school of thought is generally thought to be in some ill-defined sense allied to the Austrian school of economics, mainly perhaps because of a shared pro-market policy stance. On the other hand, links between Buchanan and neoclassical economists such as Friedman and Stigler are frequently drawn, again probably with the pro-market policy recommendations of each in mind. It is notable that Buchanan, Hayek, and Friedman were all at various times presidents of the Mont Pelerin Society. Yet the differences between neoclassical and Austrian perspectives are profound. It has often been said that the one can be characterized as “equilibrium always” and the other as “equilibrium never”. The case of Buchanan and the Virginia School is therefore extremely interesting for the historian of economic thought. Significant questions are raised about the scope for reconciliation between schools of thought at the most profound levels of methodology and social philosophy. I posit that, allowing for a slight amount of breathing room, James Buchanan’s economic writings are more Austrian than anything else. From his earliest writings to his last publications, Buchanan clearly had an Austrian-leaning approach. Additionally, many of the criticisms he laid out about the economics profession were directed toward the more neoclassical minded among his peers. While the act of criticizing neoclassical economists does not indicate that Buchanan was an Austrian, it does seem to lay to rest any conclusions that he was a neoclassical economist himself.
B53|Zero time preference and eternal postponement of consumption|Ludwig von Mises in his magnum opus Human Action claimed that the absence of time preference would lead the consumer to postpone the act of consumption to indefinite future. Olson and Bailey (1981) demonstrated that zero time preference is consistent with positive real interest rate and positive present consumption if the marginal utility of consumption is rapidly decreasing and the income endowment is rising over time.This paper shows that zero time preference does not restrict present consumption to nil even if positive interest rate enables future consumption to be very large. Dynamic neoclassical model is applied to confirm that low intertemporal elasticity of substitution leads to positive present consumption even in the case of patient consumers. Determinants of the optimum present consumption are derived, and it is proved that labour income might not be increasing over time to confirm the approach of Olson and Bailey and to disprove the Mises theory.
B53|Who is John Galt? Un análisis de la crisis financiera de 2008 desde la óptica de la Escuela Austríaca|The 2008 financial crisis, is perhaps the most significative event in the world’s economy during the XXI century. The present paper tries to explain this phenomena in light of the Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT) developed by the Austrian School of Economics. With that in mind, this paper study the relation between the historical facts that happened during the previous years in the American economy and the stylized facts presented by the theory. In concrete we can observe an expansive monetary police held by the Federal Reserve during the previous years led the Federal Funds Rate below the individual’s intertemporal preference rate, i.e. original interest rate. As consequence of this, we can observe a misallocation of original factors in new ventures that led into a new more roundabout structure of production. Specifically, a conjunction of low interest rates in mortgages contracts and institutional factors led to the formation of a bubble in the real state sector. The growth in subprime lends and new ways to expand the credit via securities led into a financial mess that explodes once the Federal Reserve rises the FFR. As the FFR raised, the credit emitted by banks started to be tightened with less refinancing of default credits, specially affecting the subprime borrowers. As subprime borrowers default their mortgages, the different securities that were backed in them, start to have problems in payments. This affect not only individuals, but also banks, which have strong losses that in some cases led some financial organizations to the bankruptcy. As the securities were bought by agents of foreign economies the crisis spill over the world. As the ABCT predict, in this context the production structure in the expansive phase evolved in a more roundabout structure but as soon as the credit was retracted the structure became less roundabout. From the point of view of the stock market and the original factor’s prices, the behavior of this variables are in concordance with what the theory predict. Giving this, the stylized facts presented by the ABCT seem to be a good theoretical framework to explain this crisis.
B53|Think Tank networks of German neoliberalism. Power structures in economics and economic policies in post-war Germany|"Even after the financial crisis, economists still exert influence on politics and society in general on several levels and thus can be still interpreted as a discipline of power. Particularly in Germany there is a long tradition of institutionalized economic policy advice, which offers economists a channel of direct and indirect impact on politics. During the European crisis policies many scholar stressed a ""comeback"", ""revival"" or ""return"" of ordoliberalism, the German variety of neoliberalism. In this paper I show how economists connected in the ""German neoliberal thought collective"" since the end of WW II have built up a strong institutional powerstructure, which had a continuous impact on German economic politics over many decades. It can be shown that in several turning points of German economic history, German neoliberalism and its core politico-economic concept of ""Social market economy"" served as guiding principle of economic policy. Furthermore I will show that up to now there is an uneven power balance among economists with high political and societal influence, i.e. economists connected in Keynesian or union-linked networks are in a minority position compared to the dense network of economists in the ""German neoliberale thought collective"". Hence, what was observed during the European crisis policies as a ""comeback of ordoliberalism"" should rather be interpreted as the consequence of a persistant influence of German neoliberal networks on German economic politics over many decades."
B53|Argumentationsstrategien einer neoliberalen Reformagenda: Zum Diskursprofil der Agenda Austria in medialen Debatten|Am Beispiel der Agenda Austria wird analysiert, wie wirtschaftsliberale Think Tanks Macht durch politische Reformdebatten ausüben können. Theoretisch fundieren wir dies in der Analyse von diskursiver Machtausübung bei Foucault: Think Tanks verfügen über Macht, wenn sie durch Medien bestimmte Denkstile, Denkmuster und Normvorstellungen vermitteln, welche mit der Übernahme in den Wissensbestand der Gesellschaftsmitglieder handlungsrelevant werden. Mithilfe einer Diskurs- und Metaphernanalyse untersuchen wir Zeitungsartikel in österreichischen Qualitätsmedien und erstellen ein Diskursprofil der Agenda Austria. Wir kommen zu dem Ergebnis, dass sie über alle untersuchten Themenbereiche hinweg für Reformen argumentiert, welche die marktförmige Organisation der Gesellschaft fördern sollen. Weiters zeigt sich eine dichotome metaphorische Gegenüberstellung eines positiv bewerteten Marktes und eines negativ bewerteten Staates.
B53|Understanding Financial Instability: Minsky Versus the Austrians|Although Minsky’s interpretation of Keynes’s macroeconomics and essential message clashes with authoritative alternative interpretations, it has become increasingly influential during the years following the Global Financial Crisis, even in mainstream circles. This paper offers a critical evaluation of Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis from the perspective of the alternative Austro-Wicksellian paradigm. Although some of the similarities and/or analogies between Minsky’s approach and that of the Austrian School suggest a more than merely superficial affinity between the two theoretical frameworks and although some scope for cross-fertilization between both approaches can be found, both theoretically and empirically, at a fundamental conceptual level both theories remain incompatible and difficult if not impossible to reconcile, in particular in terms of fundamental causality and in terms of policy conclusions and prescriptions. Despite the fact that Minsky’s policy conclusions are multifaceted and somewhat eclectic, they manifest a lack of familiarity with the conclusions of the Austrian analysis of the problems of central planning by Big Players such as Big Bank and Big Government. Both approaches also offer contrasting interpretations of the historical experience of the Global Financial Crisis.
B53|Cultural Consequences of Monetary Interventions|Hayek and Keynes are usually perceived as antipodes in one of the grand macroeconomic debates of the twentieth century. But they also agreed on some basic issues of monetary theory, most notably on the harmful character of money hoarding and the desirability of a flexible money supply to offset or neutralise changes in the demand for money. In our paper we highlight some of the cultural implications of a permanent expansion of the money supply. We will focus on the specific case of credit expansion (ex nihilo creation of money through credit) which has held centre stage of the monetary evolution of the past two hundred years and, even more specifically, on credit expansion pushed to such an extent that it entails permanent price-inflation.
B53|The U.S. Monetary Policies Against the Great Recession of 2008: A Critique from the Deflationist Viewpoint of the Austrian School|Monetary and credit expansions have been the main tools used by the U.S. government and central bank to try and recover economically from the Great Recession of 2008. This paper expounds a radical criticism of these Keynesian policies, criticism developed by some contemporary economists of the Austrian School: the appropriate and fair remedy for this kind of crisis is not reflation but deflation.
B53|F. A. Hayek and the economic calculus|"The paper offers a revisionist account of certain episodes in the development of F. A. Hayek's thought. It offers a new reading of his 1937 paper, ""Economics and Knowledge,"" that draws on unpublished lecture notes in which he articulated more fully the distinctions he made in the paper between a ""pure logic of choice,"" or the economic calculus, and an ""empirical element,"" which he would later call the competitive market order. Next, the paper shows that Hayek continued to try to develop his ideas about the role of the economic calculus through the 1950s and early 1960s, an effort that has been missed because it never led to any published work. Finally, the paper examines Hayek's attempt to articulate a theory of the market process, one that would be at the same level of generality as the economic calculus, in lectures he gave at the University of Virginia. He never developed a full-fledged formal theory, but his failed efforts still bore fruit in leading him to his contributions on spontaneous orders and the (verbal) theory of complex phenomena. This work anticipated contributions by others who were more technically trained."
B53|A financial framework for understanding macroeconomic cycles: The structure of production is relevant|Purpose - A comprehensive understanding business cycles needs to account not only for the allocation of resources over time but also for resource allocation across industries at any point in time. But to properly understand how these “time-distortions” take place and how the price mechanisms that drive them work, a clear and well-defined conceptualization of the “average length” of the structure of production is required. The authors use insights provided by Macaulay’s duration and Hicks’s average period to show that financial duration and related concepts have a direct connection to macroeconomic stability. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a theoretical and conceptual approach. It first presents the connection between average period of production and financial duration and then compares and applies this to macroeconomic business cycle theories. Findings - This study points to important implications for macroeconomic policy. It not only claims that a low interest rate contributes to the creation of asset bubbles but also shows the market mechanism through which the real sector is affected. The application of financial concepts to macroeconomic cycles shows the price mechanism through which resources are allocated across industries. Originality/value - The financial approach we offer to business cycles is fairly unexplored. As such, this paper offers a novel conceptual and theoretical framework for business cycles.
B53|Les droits et libertés fondamentaux à l'épreuve de L'efficacité économique: une application à La politique de la concurrence|The increasing influence of economic analysis on case law, even in matters of constitutional litigation, raises the issue of its impacts on fundamental rights and liberties. Within the European Union competition law field, the implementation of the “more-economic approach” (named the effects-based approach) and the growing use of negotiated practices (often grounded on procedural efficiency concerns) provide us with a striking example of how the decisional practice may not only challenge property rights and economic freedoms but also impair the judicial control. This example leads us to interrogate the economic treatment of these two fundamental rights. We insist on the diversity of the theoretical approaches, confronting the economic analysis of law with old institutionalism and Austrian economics.
B53|Ragioni, negazioni e direzioni dell’intervento pubblico. Logiche del processo economico in Mises e Polanyi|Karl Polanyi e Ludwig von Mises condividono lo stesso periodo storico, lo stesso mondo intellettuale e, almeno in parte, la stessa formazione teorica. Il loro iniziale e più diretto contesto di riflessione è l’esperimento socialista della cosiddetta “Vienna rossa” (1919-1933), in cui politiche economiche interventiste avevano fortemente limitato lo spazio del mercato in particolari settori, tra cui quello della casa. Da questa esperienza trarranno conclusioni diametralmente opposte: per Polanyi quella di Vienna è la dimostrazione della necessità di regolare il meccanismo dei prezzi per ambire a una società più democratica, per Mises l’ennesimo tentativo di interferenza pubblica insostenibile e fallimentare, crollato sotto il peso delle sue inefficienze. Perché questa lettura radicalmente diversa degli stessi fatti? La ragione va ricercata in una dimensione che precede quella dell’analisi economica e si colloca nella opposta rappresentazione storico-metodologica del processo di mercato. Dall’individualismo metodologico (e problematico) dell’opera di Menger, con Mises la scuola austriaca di economia passa a un individualismo intimamente politico, che erge il liberismo a fine ultimo da perseguire indipendentemente dal contesto di riferimento e dagli effetti concreti. Polanyi, al contrario, propone una prospettiva prettamente istituzionalista in cui il mercato viene collocato storicamente e soprattutto indagato socialmente, a partire cioè dai fondamenti eccezionali che lo animano. Lo studioso ungherese fa dunque dipendere l’azione individuale dal tipo di società in cui questa è collocata, negando sia l’universalizzazione dei moventi umani utilitaristici (homo oeconomicus) che la subordinazione teorica e pratica della società rispetto al sistema economico. La critica ha una portata radicale e dalle ampie ripercussioni di politica economica perché indaga le rappresentazioni mentali alla base del mercato autoregolato: scambiando una parte (la forma di mercato) per l’intera economia umana (i diversi modi in cui le società hanno risolto il problema della sussistenza), la teoria liberista rinchiude fatalmente l’umanità in una falsa gabbia deterministica, contribuendo in modo decisivo ad ostacolare «la realizzazione economica dei nostri ideali».
B53|Mises and the moderns on the inessentiality of money in equilibrium|The challenge of rendering monetary exchange intelligible within a Walrasian general equilibrium framework is well known. Perhaps less well known is the difficulty of integrating monetary and exchange economies in decentralized conceptions of equilibrium, of which the evenly rotating economy of Ludwig von Mises (1949) is an early example. After reviewing the prospect for money in the evenly rotating economy, I survey the modern literature on frictions that make money useful for exchange. While exploring techniques commonly used to generate a useful role for money in this environment, I make a distinction between exchange frictions and epistemic frictions. Although theoretical efforts have largely focused on exchange frictions, recent experimental evidence suggests that epistemic frictions warrant further attention. I conclude that Mises should be seen as a pioneer in this literature, though recent advances demonstrate that the set of frictions capable of rendering money useful is much larger than he envisioned.

B53|Hayek’s monetary theory and policy: A note on alleged inconsistency|Challenging the dominant view, we claim that Hayek’s monetary views did not significantly change over his lifetime. The prevalent perception of early Hayek as a money stream stabilizer and late Hayek as a price level stabilizer is attributable to an unjustified normative interpretation of Hayek’s positive analysis. We argue that in his contributions to monetary theory, Hayek took the goals of monetary policy as exogenously given and analysed the efficiency of different means of achieving them. Hayek’s allegedly inconsistent transformation from a critic to an advocate of price level stabilization is explained by a change of issues under his focus, rather than by a change in his positive views. We also claim that Hayek was always aware that every practical monetary policy involves difficult trade-offs and that he was therefore reluctant to impose his own value judgments on what people should strive for.

Eine Analyse der deutschen Volkswirtschaft 1970-2014<BR>[Effects of the money market interest rate on the development of prices and productivity: An analysis of the German economy 1970-2014]|The European Central Bank is doing all it can to prevent deflation and to push inflation at the mark of two percent annually; it is currently not successful. Instead of reaching that goal, unintended side effects can be observed and new risks are evolving. Some people surmise that low interest rates on capital markets damage the productivity of an economy. This raises the question of why consumer prices have not started to rise. Standard models of neo-classical synthesis give an unambiguous answer: there is no demand as a result of a growing economy in Europe. The neo-classical paradigm is open to further, potentially more precise answers. Some people hypothesize that inflation will not come before the amount of consumption by the rich rises considerably. Both hypotheses – (i) a negative effect of low interest rates on productivity and (ii) luxurious consumption as a driver of prices – would be a surprising enrichment of the macroeconomic theory. The development of the German economy from 1970 – 2014 confirms the standard models, but not those supplementary theories.
B53|The Impossibility of Democratic Socialism: Two Conceptions of Democracy|Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny (1994) have used Public Choice analysis to criticize market socialism. Peter J. Boettke (1995) and Peter T. Leeson and Boettke (2002) have argued that F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom (2007 [1944]) constituted a form of Public Choice analysis as well, in particular presaging an application of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem to democratic socialism. This essay demonstrates that additionally, Hayek's book adumbrated the distinction between liberal or limited democracy and illiberal or totalitarian democracy. This distinction between two conceptions of democracy provides another means of criticizing democratic socialism. The democratic political system and socialist economic system are fundamentally incompatible, making democratic socialism impossible, in the sense that democracy cannot fulfill for socialism what democratic socialists expect from it. Democratic socialism will fail, not because those in power will betray their trust or abuse their power, but because the fundamental institutional constraints of democracy are incompatible with socialist economics.
B53|Interest Groups and the Impossibility of Democratic Socialism: Hayek, Jewkes, and the Arrow Theorem|Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny (1994) have used Public Choice analysis to criticize market socialism. Peter J. Boettke (1995) and Peter T. Leeson and Boettke (2002) have argued that F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom (2007 [1944]) constituted a form of Public Choice analysis as well. Boettke and Leeson say that Hayek adumbrated a form of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. This essay shows that Hayek was joined by John Jewkes in presaging a form of the Arrow theorem. In addition, this essay expands on the analysis by Boettke and Leeson, elucidating the broader implications which the Arrow theorem has for democratic socialism in particular. Democratic socialism is demonstrated to be impossible, in the sense that it cannot successfully accomplish the goals of its advocates. This is because the Arrow theorem implies that democratic political institutions are fundamentally incompatible with socialist economics.
B53|Labor Economics in a Planned Economy: F. A. Hayek and John Jewkes on the Impossibility of Democratic Socialism|Milton Friedman (1962) is associated with the claim that political and economic freedom cannot be distinguished (cf. Lawson and Clark 2010), using the famous example that there can be no freedom of speech where the government owns the printing presses. Less well-known is F. A. Hayek's example, drawn from labor economics, used to illustrate the same principle. Hayek was joined in this by his less well-known colleague, John Jewkes. Hayek and Jewkes argued that without a freely operating price system, central economic planning cannot function without compulsory regimentation of labor. Similarly, no state may simultaneously fix “fair” wages and demand a given pattern of productive output and employment. It is impossible to both achieve income equality and accomplish an economic plan. Hayek's and Jewkes's examples help explain why democratic socialism is impossible, in the sense that it cannot accomplish what its advocates desire.
B53|The Foreign Policy of a Democratic Socialist Regime: From Intervention to Protection to Warfare|Discussions of democratic socialism have focused on whether that system is compatible with domestic civil liberties. Less attention has been paid to its foreign policy implications. Despite the widespread acceptance of the democratic peace hypothesis, democratic socialism would be incompatible with peaceful foreign relations. Economic intervention and economic planning – even democratic – cannot be successful without insulating the domestic economy from foreign competition. This implies economic nationalism and autarky. Moreover, democratic socialism is often justified by the notion that the democratic will of the people should be absolutely sovereign. Such a conception of democracy has no place for constitutional limits on power. Such an unlimited democracy would soon prove illiberal and liable to be captured by a demagogic authoritarian dictator, and this would only exacerbate the deleterious foreign policy consequences of economic nationalism. Democratic socialism is therefore incompatible with the cosmopolitan and humanitarian values of democratic socialists.
B53|The Freedom of the Prices: Hayek's Road to Serfdom Reassessed|Recent debate has centered around the contemporary relevance and even the original validity of F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom. Was it directed against command socialism only or against welfare-state interventionism as well? Should the book even be read anymore? This essay takes a step back from the dichotomy between socialism and interventionism and explores two specific ideas of Hayek's which deserve renewed attention: first, his claim that economic liberty is the fundamental liberty and that political liberty is merely secondary in value. Second, Hayek's conception of the rule-of-law, which has implications for contemporary command-and-control regulation. Furthermore, that Hayek's philosophical conception of the rule-of-law in the Road to Serfdom is related to his economic theory of prices in “The Use of Knowledge in Society.” While Hayek's specific target in the Road to Serfdom was command socialism, his book embodied arguments which are more widely applicable and relevant today.
B53|Rethinking Credit Risk under the Malinvestment Concept: The Case of Germany, Spain and Italy|This study argues that increasing malinvestment in an economy raises the actual credit risk but not the calculated credit risk until the onset of a recession. To this end, I analyse the relationship between credit risk and malinvestment in Germany, Spain, and Italy using a credit risk indicator based on nonfinancial corporate bond yields and annual loan growth for nonfinancial corporations from January 2004 to November 2014 on a monthly basis. The study also analyses Italy using sectorial non-performing loans data since Italy was the most affected by malinvestment among the countries in question. As a result, this paper suggests that banks should include malinvestment as a subcomponent of credit risk and recognize that the actual credit risk is higher than the calculated credit risk during artificial booms. This recommendation also underscores that malinvestment should be analysed more empirically.
B53|Fisher and Mises on Zero Interest: A Reconsideration|This article demonstrates that the pure time-preference theory of Ludwig von Mises is inconsistent. A productivity element is studied in the Fisher model, and it is shown that time preference is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the existence of interest. An attempt is also made to reconcile the Austrian theory with the neoclassical theory of interest. It is suggested that the key difference lies in the definition of interest as such, and it is concluded that the Austrian theory is only a special case of a more general neoclassical framework.
B53|Může být přirozená úroková míra nulová? Neoklasický přístup<BR>[Can the Natural Rate of Interest Be Zero? A Neoclassical Approach]|Very low real rates of interest observed in modern economies might be caused by the fact that the natural rate of interest declined to a zero level. This article shows that a zero or a negative natural interest can be explained by the Böhm-Bawerkian and neoclassical theory. Firstly, two senses of time preference are introduced in a discounted utility model, and key determinants of the zero interest rate on the side of time preference are discussed in detail. Secondly, a simple general equilibrium model with fixed intertemporal endowment is presented. Within this model, a decreasing shape of the income stream is identified as a major source of zero interest along with a low intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption. Even in the world of zero or negative natural interest, it might be optimal to be a lender. The last section focuses on the role of marginal productivity of capital in the model, stressing the role of this phenomenon on one side and time preference on the other in lowering the natural rate of interest to a zero level.
B53|Dokąd zmierzał system gospodarczy Polski w latach 1995–2012?|Celem opracowania jest ocena stopnia realizacji założeń modelu ładu konkurencyjnego w okresie transformacji polskiej gospodarki w latach 1995–2012. Realizacja tak sformułowanego celu wymagała przyjęcia określonej metodyki opisu przemian systemu gospodarczego. Poszukując odpowiedzi na pytanie, czy system gospodarczy w Polsce przybliża się do ładu konkurencyjnego, czy może podąża w innym kierunku, przyjęto jako model referencyjny zestaw konstytuujących zasad ładu konkurencyjnego autorstwa Waltera Euckena. Stopień ich realizacji pozwolił odpowiedzieć na pytanie, czy system gospodarczy okresu transformacji przybliża się do pożądanego modelu ładu konkurencyjnego albo też może się od niego oddala. Na podstawie analizy wybranych wskaźników oceniających stopień realizacji zasad ładu konkurencyjnego w polskiej gospodarce w latach 1995–2012 można wnioskować o umiarkowanym zbliżeniu systemu gospodarczego do założeń modelu ładu konkurencyjnego. Największe zaniedbania w procesie kształtowania ram ładu gospodarczego mają miejsce w zakresie takich zasad ładu konkurencyjnego, jak: elastyczność cen, odpowiedzialność materialna za wyniki działalności gospodarczej, stałość polityki gospodarczej, swoboda zawierania umów. Relatywnie duży stopień realizacji reguł ładu konkurencyjnego ma miejsce w obszarach: stabilna wartość pieniądza, prywatna własność oraz otwartość rynków.
B53|Die neoliberale Utopie als Ende aller Utopien|"Friedrich von Hayek, die wirkungsmächtigste Person im Neoliberalismus, hat insbesondere in seiner Theorie des ""Wettbewerbs als Entdeckungsprozess"" eine Utopie formuliert, deren Besonderheit darin besteht, dass sie versucht, jeder anderen Utopie - gleich welcher Richtung - ihre Berechtigung zu entziehen. Denn hier wird ""dem Markt"" bzw. ""der erweiterten Ordnung"" eine Übervernunft zugeschrieben, die von keinem menschlichen Wesen kognitiv zu bewältigen ist. Hayek landet folgerichtig bei dem Bild, ""den Markt"" wie einen Gott anzusehen und ihm gottgleiche Attribute zu verleihen."
B53|Effekte des Kapitalmarktzinses auf die Preis- und Produktivitätsentwicklung: Eine Analyse der deutschen Volkswirtschaft 1970-2014|Die EZB tut alles, um ihr Inflationsziel von 2 Prozent zu erreichen - bislang ohne Erfolg. Stattdessen machen sich unerwünschte Nebeneffekte breit. So wird vermutet, dass niedrige Zinssätze auf dem Kapitalmarkt der Produktivität einer Volkswirtschaft schaden. Auf die Frage, warum die Konsumenten-Preise trotz niedriger Zinssätze und eines wachsenden Geldangebotes nicht steigen, geben die Standardmodelle der neoklassischen Synthese eine eindeutige Antwort: Es fehlt die Nachfrage einer wachsenden Wirtschaft. Das neoklassische Paradigma ist jedoch offen für weitere, möglicherweise präzisere Antworten. So wird vermutet, dass die Inflation erst einsetzt, wenn der Konsum der Reichen ansteigt. Beide Hypothesen - der negative Einfluss niedriger Zinsen auf die Produktivität und der Luxuskonsum als Preistreiber - wären eine überraschende Bereicherung der makroökonomischen Theorie. Die langfristige Entwicklung der deutschen Volkswirtschaft bestätigt zwar die Aussagen der Standardmodelle, nicht aber jene Ergänzungen.
B53|“Corporate Scene Investigation”: A Praxeological Attempt to Sketch the Profile of the Entrepreneur in Modern Business|Mature capitalism and market economy realities become intelligible also by scrutinizing their “prodigal children”: modern business corporations. But these are not some undivided entities. Beyond the place in the global division of labour, they are fiefs of in-built specialization among the corporate governance stakeholders, each of them representing individual-based aggregations of pure catallactic functions. With an atomized, anonymous, asymmetrical and amalgamated ownership in a globalized capital market, with the multi-level directorship, delegated to harmonize profit-orientated investment interests, with creditors, but also with other suppliers of factors of production, modern corporations seem to have overshadowed both the real entrepreneurs-actors as well as the pure corresponding function. Our article is a (praxeo)logical exercise to pinpoint and reveal the realistic field of definition of the “entrepreneurship function” within the modern corporate spectrum, delimiting and portraying the entrepreneurial aspect out of the real characters that inhabit the corporate entourage (precisely said, of shareholders, managers, creditors). It seems that the modern literature on the law and economics of the firm has lost sight of the entrepreneur(ship), whose presence is felt but rarely positively identified. The endeavour to locate and isolate this, along with the associated incentives and logic of action is a task with some analytical merits. A thorough discrimination of the entrepreneurs’ position inside the corporate field and, respectively, of the “natural” vs. “allowed” decision spheres can generate sounder judgments about the wellstructured and poorly-structured companies (good vs. poor corporate governance) or about institutions found to be business (un)friendly (good vs. poor corporate law-making). We define “good governance” at the level of the corporate form the situation when incentives are aligned with rights and obligations, and the “good law” the norm which does not alter the common sense of property rights and freedom of contracting. Without knowing them, any legal organization of the corporate form will be fraught with problems.
B53|Economic paradoxism and meson economics|The structure of the paper brings together three major sections, following the general approach to the impact of paradoxes in economic theory. The first section describes a necessary investigation in the synthesized universe of paradoxes, to capitalize on Quine’s paradox taxonomy, and to reveal the importance of really paraconsistent paradoxes, defining, in a relative and innovative manner, economic paradoxism in the sense of excess of creative capitalization of paradoxes in the area of science, as initiated by mathematician and logician Florentin Smarandache. The second section turns into an original exposition of economics theory and the third section reveals the concept of meson economics and the principles of that economy, completed with some final remarks, some of which are conclusive, and some others interrogative, aligned to the paradox of knowledge, in keeping with which human beings are looking for answers, and finally find more and more questions.
B53|Spontaneous order and social norms. Hayek’s theory of socio-cultural evolution|Hayek’s theory of socio-cultural evolution is a generalization of his theory on spontaneous market order. Hayek explains both the emergence of market and social institutions serving as a social basis for that order within the framework of a unified evolutionary logic. This logic interprets the emergence and survival of spontaneous order and group-level rules of conduct as an unintended consequence of human action. In order to explain the emergence of social norms exclusively on the basis of methodological individualism, one would have to give up an exclusively evolutionary explanation of these norms. Since Hayek applies the invisible-hand explanation to the investigation of social norms, he combines the position of methodological individualism with functionalist-evolutionary arguments in his analysis. Hayek’s theory of socio-cultural evolution represents a theory in the framework of which methodological individualism and functionalism do not crowd out but complement each other.
B53|An Austrian Analysis of China's Unsustainable Boom| Austrian Business Cycle Theory can shed light on the ways in which the current Chinese economic boom is unsustainable. On the one hand, government interventions, such as land monopolies, have raised costs for real estate developers. By limiting the availability of investment instruments and access to external markets, government interventions have created a strong demand for housing as a hedging tool. On the other hand, a loose monetary policy and artificially low interest rates have made the property market tempting for developers. Over-construction and over-consumption in the housing sector epitomise the capital structure analysis that Austrian economists regard as the core of their business cycle theory.
B53|La dinámica del empresario en la sociedad. De la Escuela Austriaca a la economía social de mercado|Una de las grandes aportaciones al pensamiento económico la constituye la aportación centroeuropea, desde la Escuela Austriaca a la Escuela de Freiburgo, sobre cuyas bases se desarrolla el ordenamiento económico de una economía social de mercado. Toda esta línea de conocimiento se caracteriza, en primer lugar, por la integración de la economía en la sociedad. Esto es, se desarrolla la dimensión societaria de la economía orientada a la persona y en base al principio de competencia. Es su gran comprensión de la realidad económica y del papel de la persona a la que caracteriza en búsqueda de libertad y responsabilidad para la «acción» de la persona. Es la gran contribución a un orden de libertad en el que la figura del empresario, de la «empresalidad», es el eje del desarrollo económico, el desarrollo schumpeteriano. A lo que la Escuela de Freiburgo contribuye con el diseño del ordenamiento económico-societario que enmarca en el «sistema de valores» la acción de la persona. Este ordenamiento económico define en base a principios y reglas el desarrollo de la organización económica en la sociedad. Walter Eucken impulsa esta conceptualización del orden económico como la referencia común para la actuación de la persona. El empresario juega un papel decisivo, en su dimensión societaria, para garantizar la dinámica de una economía de mercado que «funcione bien», que haga factible su existencia y garantice la eficiencia económica, por un lado, y el equilibrio social, por el otro. Una economía social de mercado es un «sistema de valores» societarios que integra los «fines» de la economía en la sociedad: el desarrollo integral de la persona mediante el uso eficiente de los recursos escasos. Eficiencia económica y equilibrio social garantizan un orden de libertades en el que puede desarrollarse el empresario si contribuye con su competencia y con el principio de subsidiaridad a su desarrollo.

B53|The Role of Psychology in Austrian Economics and Game Theory: Subjectivity and Coordination|In this contribution we relate the respective works of two important economists, Friedrich von Hayek and Michael Bacharach, namely one of the main intellectual leaders of the Austrian Schools and one of the most original game theorists. Hayek and Bacharach are two authors - few in number – who do not conceive that economic analysis could be built without the help of psychology. They both considered that subjective perceptions of the real world provide the first stage of decision processes and that, within this stage, psychological factors played a fundamental role. Therefore, they both proposed how perceptions, economic rationality and social coordination could be combined. However economists who really accept to take psychology into account often face new difficulties. The incorporation of subjectivity in economic behaviour can make much more complex the analysis of economic and social coordination. To overtake these new difficulties we will see that both Hayek and Bacharach integrate a specific approach to human cognition and resort to an evolutionary explanation of social coordination. This is the main message we deliver in this contribution.
B53|Is Publication in the Hands of Outstanding Scientists? A Study on the Determinants of Editorial Boards Membership in Economics|This paper aims at casting light on editorial boards of leading journals in economics. This topic has been largely neglected by economists and sociologists of science, although the crucial role played by editors of prestigious journals in steering the discipline. We start our analysis by mapping the content specialization and the level of oligopoly of the contributing institutions within each journal. Then, we assess the impact of editorial boards’ interlocking and turnover on similarity between journals. In the second half of the paper we investigate the determinants of editorial board membership in leading economic journals during the decade from 1994 to 2004. We observe that the scientist’s past productivity is a strong predictor of membership. Nevertheless, other determinants are at play. Among others, we found a significant positive effect of scientist’s social connections with the members of the discipline who are entitled to decide for the appointment as editor.
B53|Carl Menger’s Contribution to Capital Theory|"The common interpretation of Carl Menger’s take on capital theory rests upon a few sentences in his ""Principles of Economics"". His later monograph on the topic, ""Zur Theorie des Kapitals"" (""A contribution to the theory of capital""), is more or less ignored, although it must be seen as a recantation of his earlier views. As it becomes clear in this work, Menger would have opposed all attempts to define capital as a heterogeneous structure of higher-order goods – a definition that is associated with his name today. In his opinion capital is a homogeneous concept stemming from accounting practices. The debate about Menger’s view on capital does not only concern terminological points, but involves the subject matter of capital theory. A theory of capital based on Menger’s later view would concentrate on the way the market economy is organized and not on technical characteristics of a multi-stage production process."
B53|The concept of Ordnungspolitik through the lens of the theory of limited and open access orders|The paper argues that there are certain parallels between the ideas of ordoliberalism and the framework of limited and open access order (LAO/OAO) as developed by North, Wallis, Webb and Weingast (NWWW): Both approaches focus on the “interdependence of orders”, and both share an emphasis on state capacity in processes of social transition. I also argue that the ideas of the ordoliberals might give impulses for the further development of the LAO/OAO research agenda. Firstly, whereas NWWW mainly deal with the transition process from LAO to OAO, the members of the Freiburg school intensely dealt with the danger that an OAO might revert into an LAO. Accordingly, they spent much effort on developing policy proposals that aimed at preventing such a ‘re-feudalisation’ (Franz Böhm) of society. Secondly, especially when it came to the issue of accomplishing reforms, they also considered the role of informal institutions and beliefs, a topic somewhat neglected in the LAO/OAO-framework in its present form.

B53|The past, present and future of Virginia Political Economy|We present a short history of the Virginia School of Political Economy in its institutional settings of University of Virginia (UVA), Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, or Virginia Tech (VPI), and George Mason University (GMU). We discuss the original research and educational project as envisioned by Buchanan at UVA, its maturity into a normal science at VPI, and its continuation at GMU. We argue that the future of Virginia Political Economy will depend critically on the various alternative interpretations of the Buchanan project in positive economics, welfare economics, and political economy.

B53|Sovereignty as exchange of political property rights|I develop a positive theory of sovereignty that is rooted in political exchange. The key concept I use to characterize sovereignty is self-enforcing exchange of political rights. I conclude that a sovereign is an individual or body party to political exchange that does not rest on third-party enforcement. Importantly, sovereignty is an emergent phenomenon, defined in the process of bargains between holders of political power. I describe how political bargains within and across polities influences the distribution of political rights characterized by sovereignty, and I conclude by showing how my conception of sovereignty is compatible with theoretical understanding, and practical existence, of polycentric governance.

B53|Elections vs. political competition: The case of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|In models of political economy, institutionalization of free and open elections is presented as infusing competition into a monopolized regime. Due to elections, representative democracies are thought to reflect the will of the majority as opposed to the will of the elites. I challenge the idea that elections are a necessary condition of a well-functioning democratic system. In the liberal system of nobles’ democracy in the Kingdom in Poland, noble masses were able to shape political outcomes despite the absence of elections. In fact, it was the adoption of free royal elections in 1573 that undermined the democratic regime and contributed to the demise of the country. I argue that nobles’ democracy emerged from competition between the king and the regional rulers for the loyalty of nobles and that the system collapsed when royal elections disincentivized kings from seeking the nobles’ support.

B53|Discovery processes, science, and ‘knowledge–how:’ Competition as a discovery procedure in the laboratory|These edited remarks explore the relationship of the thought of F.A. Hayek to the development of experimental economics and related programs in economic design. Particularly emphasized are the insights of Hayek with respect to competition and their importance to the theoretical justification for, and empirical results derived from, the experimental study of market behavior. These remarks include some personal commentary on experimental methods, from the early double auctions of the 1960s through more recent work exploring the nature of business cycles. Finally, the intellectual history of the market structures examined in Vernon Smith’s work is discussed, comparing the exploration of the double auction to the horse market of Bohm-Bawerk, as well as the general insight of Adam Smith that causality stems from the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange to the discovery of specialization.

B53|The distribution of Schumpeterian and Kirznerian opportunities|Despite their presence in modern entrepreneurship theories, empirical investigations of opportunity types are scarce. We develop a 5-dimensional bipolar scale to measure the extent in which opportunities are Schumpeterian or Kirznerian. Drawing on this measure, we examine the shape of the opportunity distribution in relation to the environment and the characteristics of individuals who exploit them. Across a sample of 181 new products introduced by high-tech entrepreneurs, we find that pure Schumpeterian and Kirznerian types are rare, but rather opportunities display varying degrees of membership to one or the other type. The distribution is more skewed toward Schumpeterian opportunities for larger ventures, with a strategic focus on future needs, and operating in growing markets. In contrast, Kirznerian opportunities are more frequently pursued by small ventures, and by entrepreneurs that are young, with a strategic focus on present needs, and who are less innovative in their behavior.

B53|The constructivist view of entrepreneurial opportunities: a critical analysis|The notion that opportunities exist objectively “out there” has been repeatedly assaulted by scholars who counter that opportunities are subjectively constructed or created. This paper intends to restore the balance by bringing the critical strands of inquiry themselves under critical scrutiny. Beyond the formulation of some original lines of critique and the drawing of attention to some foundational yet insufficiently studied issues, this article further contributes the following: (1) it juxtaposes a taxonomical ordering of constructivist approaches; (2) it identifies angles of complementarity and contradiction with the objectivist perspective; and (3) it brings subtle conceptual distinctions into prominence.

The contemporaneous critical reactions to Knapp are analyzed, as well as some more recent versions of chartalism, and the strengths and weaknesses of the chartalist insights in monetary theory and policy.
B53|Modern Austrian School on Institutions, Development Problems and the Role of the Economist|The article deals with the classification of institutions by the reporesentatives of modern Austrian economic school and its meaning for understanding the problems of development economics. The especially important role of institutional stickiness in the initially alien social environment is emphasized. Attention is drawn to the fact that the intention to impute progressive institutions in a backward country without adjustment to its endogenous institutions or changing the latter by formation of new beliefs may lead to their rejection. On this basis the modern Austrian school sees the economist not as an engineer, but as a researcher and beliefs affecting educator.

Their ideas depend largely on how each of them conceive the role and purpose of economic science.
B53|Hayek’s Scientism Essay and the social aspects of objectivity and the mind|In his Scientism and the Study of Society, Hayek wishes to show the errors to which the moral scientist is led by emulating the methods of the natural sciences. The present paper argues that Hayek’s argument relies on a differentiation between the natural sciences and what he calls “ordinary experience” that is based on an unacceptable appearance-reality distinction and an implausible ontology. An alternative justification for the differentiation is offered by appealing to the manifold goals and social contexts of inquiry. Also, according to Hayek, the moral scientist needs to understand agents’ attitudes, and such understanding is possible because there is a similarity between the mind of the moral scientist and that of the agent. This paper tries to elucidate what Hayek thinks such similarity to be and how it may lead to the understanding of others. It proposes two alternatives: first, understanding as the projection of mental categories from behavioral evidence, and second, by looking forward to Hayek’s The Sensory Order, understanding as a functional correspondence between structures in the central nervous system.
B53|George Orwell and the Incoherence of Democratic Socialism|George Orwell's famous fictions, Animal Farm and Nineteen-Eighty Four were intended to advocate democratic socialism by portraying undemocratic forms of socialism as totalitarian. For Orwell, democracy was a political institution which would limit the abuse of power. But there are several problems with democratic socialism which ensure its failure. In Orwell's novel A Clergyman's Daughter, Orwell's views of economics and politics are inconsistent and conflicting in a way that ensures democratic socialism will not succeed on Orwell's terms. Democratic socialism in general is criticized according to F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom and John Jewkes's The New Ordeal by Planning, whose arguments differ crucially from those against market socialism by Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny. An economic analysis of the political institutions of democratic socialism shows that democratic socialism must necessarily fail for political (not economic) reasons even if nobody in authority has ill-intentions or abuses their power.
B53|Two Opposing Economic-Literary Critiques of Socialism: George Orwell Versus Eugen Richter and Henry Hazlitt|Orwell's famous fictions, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four criticized totalitarian forms of socialism from a Public Choice perspective, assuming that socialism would work as an economic system as long as the proper political institutions were in place to curb the potential for the abuse of power. This is contrasted with two novels by others who took the opposite approach: Richter's Pictures of the Socialistic Future and Hazlitt's Time Will Run Back. These two assumed that the political implementation of socialism would be perfect but that socialism would necessarily turn totalitarian because of the problem of economic calculation. These novels assumed away the Public Choice problem of institutions and the abuse of power and focused on the political implications of socialism as a purely economic system. Contrasting these two sets of novels shows how the Austrian and Public Choice schools criticize socialism in two entirely different ways.

B53|F. A. Hayek'in Bilgisizlik Teorisi Çerçevesinde Piyasa, Denge ve Planlama<BR>[Market, Equilibrium, and Planning within the Framework of F.A. Hayek's Theory of Ignorance]|In this article, the implications of the theory of ignorance developed by Hayek to economic theory and policy will be examined. The theory of ignorance appeared especially in the second period of Hayek’s career and has been applied to the field of economics, politics, and law. Accordingly, people do not have knowledge about the institutions they’ve got today, knowledge which other people have, their actions and the results of them. This kind of knowledge cannot exist as cumulative and the amount of it cannot be enhanced by technological developments. Hence, developing theories, making plans and practices as if we have complete knowledge will not conclude as we desire. This study will discuss and sum up Hayek’s criticizes on market perception, the assumption of perfectly competitive market, and equilibrium analysis of mainstream economics, his contributions to the possibility of economic calculation in socialism and central planning, and recent development in information theory of mainstream economics.
B53|Entrepreneurship: State of grace or human action? Schumpeter’s leadership vs Kirzner’s alertness|Joseph A. Schumpeter developed a very well-known theory of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship, centred on the concept of ‘new combinations’. According to him, innovation and entrepreneurship are destructive elements driving the system beyond an equilibrium position and setting in motion a competitive process, in order to reach a new equilibrium point. Though Austrian, Schumpeter was never a member of the Austrian School of Economics. However, his position as regards entrepreneurship is widely commented on by Austrian School members. In particular, Israel M. Kirzner devoted his research activity to develop an alternative concept of entrepreneurship rooted in Misesian human action and the concept of ‘alertness’. This paper aims to analyze and compare the two positions, in an attempt not so much to stress differences but to find possible common paths for further developments of the concept of entrepreneurship.
B53|At the Root of Economic Fluctuations: Expectations, Preferences and Innovation. Theoretical Framework and Empirical Evidences|The present paper aim to develop the Austrian Theory of Business Cycle in order to conclude that economic fluctuations are unavoidable. The conventional version of Austrian business cycle theory focuses on a temporary imbalance between natural and monetary rates of interest. When, because of the role of monetary authorities in defining the monetary rate, the two values are in a situation of imbalance, the resulting expansion stage is followed by a recession. On the other hand, if instead the expansive phase arises without any interference by monetary authorities but through re-adaptation of the productive structure to a modified structure of temporal preferences, a period of sustainable growth begins that will not be followed by a crisis. The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate, on the other hand, that because of profit-expectations and the combined action of Schumpeterian elements (imitations-speculations and the ‘creation of money’ by banks), even a so-called ‘sustainable’ boom will be affected by a liquidation and settling crisis. What distinguishes the latter situation from the conventional case of imbalance between monetary and natural rates is not the onset or otherwise of a crisis but, rather, its intensity and duration. We will define as natural an economic cycle characterised by a stage of expansion considered to be ‘sustainable’ in the Austrian theory but followed by an inevitable readjustment crisis. In conclusion we will try to link our theoretical conclusions with the crisis emerged in the Western world in 2007, to test the explanatory power of our theoretical framework.
B53|Bitcoin Mission Statement. Or What does it mean Sharing Economy and Distributed Trust?|Technological advancements in the means of production are the driving force behind the changes in the prevailing system of socio-economic relations. Feudalism was transformed into capitalism as a result of such advancements. While man obtained physical freedom, the financial freedom remained under the control of the centralized authority. A deep level of collaboration is required to attain the next level of productivity provided by new technological advancements. However, the present system with a centralized control of governance and finance appears to constrain and restrain the value producing economy. This constriction becomes especially evident when the business environment requires collaboration to create, as it underlines the inherent conflict of centralized control. The most recent tech sector innovations, such as smart contracts and cryptocurrencies, are poised to disrupt the system of centralized control. The removal of a centralized authority from the position of control will change the fabric of the society to reflect the mesh network of shared resources. The society will transform to the new form of socio-economic relations – the era of Crypto-Socialism.
B53|Interventionism: An Economic Analysis Of Priceless Resource Allocation|The present paper is going to build upon the Misesian theory of interventionism by presenting it in the light of property economics. We will argue that all forms of government interfere with the workings of the market can be counterfactually analysed by contrasting them with the voluntary order of laissez-faire capitalism. Interventionism is presented as a partial order, situated on the continuum between laissez-faire capitalism and socialism. The article argues that the limits of interventionism can be understood as a direct consequence of its functioning under the aegis of fiat property. Because the state can unilaterally decide the extent to which an individual is entitled to his private property (involuntary co-ownership), interventionism replaces the rational entrepreneurial order of the free market, which is constrained by the price structure and is directed by economic calculation, with the arbitrary value judgments of a single entity. This more general re-statement of the Misesian theory of interventionism from the point of view of property economics has the benefit of covering all possible policy measures while deducing the implications from an a priori perspective. From a methodological standpoint, this approach provides a more realist account of the implications of government involvement in the workings of the market as it does not require any unrealistic assumptions like: perfect information, equilibrium and dead weight loss comparison, or postulate a certain type of behaviour - benevolence, narrow self-interest or ideological error.
B53|Economic Freedom and Cultural Flourishing: A Praxeological Account on Value, Capital, Sustainability, and Identity|A theory of cultural â€œvalue, capital, and sustainabilityâ€ (as core economic concepts) is just a subset of the general economic theory. The â€œculturalâ€ epithet cannot generate independent epistemic effects, even though the mainstream economics of culture assumes the â€œcultural valueâ€ , â€œcultural capitalâ€ , â€œcultural sustainabilityâ€ as special realities, requiring special treatment. But if the cultural aspect can underline something â€œspecialâ€ , then, starting from some common definitions of culture, pointing to â€œa set of shared values, preferences, beliefsâ€ , we are dealing with subjective preferences demonstrable in action, with voluntary inter-personal relations, and with clearly defined property rights, since cultural mark is imprinted on various material supports as scarce resources. This paper takes an Austrian School praxeological route in cultural economics. The peculiarity of the proposed research line lies in demonstrating how such praxeological analysis may explain the fecundity of the cultural realm, as an expression of exercising the human freedom in society, by voluntarily sharing its seeds and fruits. Thus, the praxeological test of culture-making-of is meant to reveal institutional situations that do not meet the genuine cultural value exigency, nor the idea of cultural reproducibility, nor the idea of cultural survival, since they rely not on free and fair human (inter)action, but on violent and wasteful redistributions and privileges (aka support and protection).
B53|Austrian Business Cycle Theory: An Evolution and Contemporary Condition<BR>[Теория Экономического Цикла Австрийской Школы: Эволюция И Современное Состояние]|The aim of the paper is to analyze the process of evolution of Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ATBC). The theory was very popular until 1940 however after that it was in the shadow for the long years. The theory explains business cycle with fiduciary credit and other governmental distortion which lower interest rates and lead to incorrect capital structure compare to sustainable growth which supported by voluntary savings. ATBC considers laissez-faire as the most effective anticyclical economic policy. The paper presents the contribution to the theory made both by former leaders of the school (Mises, Hayek) and by contemporary adepts of the school.
B53|“Cultural Conflict”: Problem and Resolution Readdressed in Terms of Property Rights|Within the classical dichotomy between “culture” and “civilization”, in some narrow sense, the first term is held responsible for conflict propensity (for it is what coagulates communities, sometimes along with exalted differentiation), while the second is endowed with the great wisdom of disciplining clashes (since the division of labour in society is the very basis for productive cooperation, to speak of economic civilization). Even if this picture does not necessarily do justice to culture, which has a far greater bright side, and neglects the selective nature of economic competition among cultures, what should not be missed when speaking of ethnic, religious or territorial cultural identity is the conflict-spurring scarcity of resources, that is ultimately reducible and solvable in the logic of clearly defined and properly enforced property rights.
B53|Market vs. system failure as a rationale for EU regional policy? A critique from an evolutionary economic perspective|This paper reconsiders the economic explanation of EU regional policy from an evolutionary perspective. It contrasts the neoclassical equilibrium notions of market and government failure with the prevalent evolutionary neo-Schumpeterian and Austrian-Hayekian perceptions. Based on this comparison the paper criticises that neoclassical failure reasoning still prevails in non-equilibrium evolutionary economics when regional policy issues are examined. This is more than surprising since proponents of evolutionary economics usually view their approach as incompatible with its neoclassical counterpart. In addition, it is shown that this ?fallacy of failure thinking? even finds its continuation in the alternative concept of ?system failure? with which some evolutionary economists try to explain and legitimate regional policy interventions in local, regional or national innovation systems. The paper argues that in order to prevent the fruitful and more realistic evolutionary approach from undermining its own criticism of neoclassical economics and to create a consistent as well as objective evolutionary policy framework it is necessary to eliminate the equilibrium spirit from it. Finally, the paper delivers an alternative evolutionary explanation of EU regional policy which is able to overcome the theory-immanent contradiction of the hitherto evolutionary view on this subject. Building on the preceding remarks, policy implications for EU regional policy from a ?proper? evolutionary perspective are deduced.
B53|Ökonomie und Moral: Eine kurze Theoriegeschichte|Die ökonomische Theorie hat mit Moral wenig oder gar nichts zu tun. In den gängigen Lehrbüchern der Mikroökonomie findet sich in den Stichwortverzeichnissen kein Eintrag zu Moral oder Ethik. Die Studierenden lernen über die Wirtschaft nachzudenken, aber sie lernen dabei nicht, systematisch über ethische Fragen zu reflektieren. Nach der neoklassischen Lehre, wie sie in den Lehrbüchern präsentiert wird, weist wirtschaftliches Handeln nicht grundsätzlich moralische Aspekte auf. Ein solcher Tatbestand ist erstaunlich. Er widerspricht (phänomenologisch) unseren ökonomischen Alltagserfahrungen und (theoriegeschichtlich) einer jahrhundertelangen Tradition, die vor gut zwei Jahrhunderten schrittweise aufgegeben und im 20. Jahrhundert durch dezidiert morallose Standpunkte ersetzt worden ist.

Diese Begrifflichkeit wurde erstmals in der Österreichischen Schule der Nationalökonomie, und zwar von Ludwig Mises und Friedrich Hayek, und von Ordoliberalen wie Walter Eucken oder Wilhelm Röpke entwickelt. Ihr gemeinsamer Hintergrund war die Sichtweise eines bedrohten Liberalismus und die Vision einer neuen Gesellschaft. Diesem Ziel hatten ihre ökonomischen Theorien zu dienen. Sie stellen - obwohl dies oft verneint wird - eine genuine Politische Ökonomie dar."

B53|Las distintas caras de la economía institucional|En este trabajo se pretende ofrecer una imagen general de las distintas tendencias de la economía institucional. El objetivo es mostrar sus complementariedades, es decir, en qué medida ha ido surgiendo un cuerpo general coherente y relevante para el análisis histórico. Se han seleccionado las propuestas de un amplio grupo de autores y se han intentado engarzar argumentalmente. Tanto la selección de autores, como la de los aspectos de sus trabajos a los que se hace referencia, implican una elección personal basada en la experiencia docente e investigadora del autor en los últimos años. El engarce argumental entre ellos incorpora además criterios y apreciaciones personales. Todo ello creo que ha permitido organizar un discurso coherente, en el que los distintos autores van mostrando las distintas caras y herramientas de la economía institucional. Quedaría muy satisfecho si al leerlo se ve la posibilidad de ir situando en la argumentación general, con las consiguientes matizaciones, los autores y las ideas que se hayan echado en falta.

B53|Wyzysk w perspektywie sprawiedliwosci/Exploitation in the Face of Justice|The paper refers to selected problems of exploitation in the face of justice. The analysis is based on the definitions of exploitation contained in the Polish Penal and Civil Codes. The main subject of our interest is the identification of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the recognition of exploitation as being unjust. Supplementary question will refer to a specific type of justice which should be considered in this case. In respect to this we should consider retributive, distributive and social justice. Another important factor in this regard is the accepted theory of value. In the considered subject we will focus on the labour theory of value. The principal problem could be reduced to questions whether the exploitation is ipso facto unjust and how these two phenomena are related to each other.
B53|The Ethical Aspect of the Relationship of the Individual and the State in the Libertarian Perspective of Murray N. Rothbard|On the grounds of the libertarian ethics presented by Murray N. Rothbard, the state is an institution which acts against individuals and whole societies. The state steals money from its citizens (taxes), stands in the way of free market development and controls the economy, thus hindering entrepreneurship. Besides that, the state – through its rules and regulations – limits every man's right to make moral choices. The state is an immoral institution, therefore its citizens have the right to refuse to pay taxes, follow orders, and even – in some circumstances – corrupt civil servants. In this paper we analyse Rothbard’s ethics and look into the arguments of critics of libertarian thought. Practical social and economic solutions that emerge from Rothbard’s point of view are also considered.
B53|Critical Reflections on Rothbard’s Concept of Gross Investment|This paper critiques Rothbard’s ([1962] 2004. Man, Economy, and State – A Treatise on Economic Principles. Auburn, AL: Mises Institute) concept of gross investment. Rothbard introduced the concept in order to demonstrate his point that it is not consumer spending that primarily drives the economy, like the mainstream Keynesian view maintains, but the capitalists’ spending. In this paper, it is argued that, contrary to Rothbard’s opinion, the amount of gross investment as he defines it does not contain significant information concerning the question as to whether the capital structure of a society can be upheld or not. Instead, it is an arbitrary figure that depends on the length of the different stages of production. This problem has not been recognized by Rothbard because his exposition rests upon the assumption of an equal time length for all stages. Apparently, he has been led astray by his intention to find arguments against the importance of consumer spending in the determination of output.
B53|The Wage Curve in Austrian Models|We fully characterise, in terms of their local or global properties, the wage curves associated with Austrian models of production. When these properties are met, the degrees of freedom in the choice of parameters allow us to build an Austrian model which admits a given wage curve and satis es other requirements.
B53|Entrepreneurial Action, Public Policy, and Economic Outcomes|Examining the economics of entrepreneurship from the perspectives of productive versus unproductive entrepreneurial behavior and the role of institutions in economic outcomes, the authors in this book seek to advance the research on institutions by providing a simple framework to analyze the broader, long-term consequences of economic policies. They examine the relationship between economic freedom and economic outcomes and summarize empirical evidence and theory. The book also provides practical policy solutions that are based on the authors' cogent analyses.
B53|Advanced Introduction to the Austrian School of Economics|Erudite, accessible and lucidly written, this book provides both a stimulating introduction and excellent summary of the core principles, ideas and diversity of modern Austrian economics. The Austrian school was well within the mainstream of economic thought by the 1930s, but fell from prominence by the middle of the twentieth century. There was a renewed interest in the Austrian schoolâ€™s ideas beginning in the 1970s which has accelerated recently, but many economists do not have a good understanding about the distinguishing values and characteristics that set it apart. This volume is aimed at readers who already have a familiarity with economic analysis, but would like to know more about the distinct philosophies of the Austrian school.
B53|Free Market Economics, Second Edition|In this thoroughly updated second edition of Free Market Economics, Steven Kates assesses economic principles based on classical economic theory before Keynesian theory became dominant in macroeconomics and equilibrium analysis became standard in microeconomics. He looks at economics from the perspective of an entrepreneur making decisions in a world where the future is unknown, innovation is a continuous process and the future is being created before it can be understood.
B53|"A Hayekian Explanation of Hayek's ""Epistemic Turn"""|The present essay investigates F.A. Hayek’s epistemology and his methodology of sciences of complex phenomena for implications relevant to an explanation of Hayek’s own so- called “epistemic turn.” The thesis defended here is that Hayek’s dissatisfaction with his technical economics – in particular, his business cycle project – prompted, in keeping with his evolutionary theory of belief revision, the develo pment of an approach less susceptible to the same disappointment.
B53|Zero-Interest Rate Policy and Unintended Consequences in Emerging Markets|Since 2009, central banks in the major advanced economies have held interest rates at very low levels to stabilize financial markets and support the recovery of their economies. Based on a Mises-Hayek-BIS view on credit booms and Mises’ law of unintended consequences, this paper suggests that the prolonged period of very low interest rates in the large advanced economies (unintentionally) spurs volatile capital flows and fuels asset market bubbles in fast-growing emerging markets. The resulting inflationary pressure and risks of capital flow reversals gives rise to a new wave of interventionism as policymakers in emerging markets increasingly reintroduce financially repressive measures to isolate the economies from foreign capital inflows.
B53|What is Wrong with Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection Problems in the Conventional Economic Theory|The purpose of this paper is to challenge the conventional theory of moral hazard and adverse selection. Moral hazard and adverse selection problems in contemporary economic theory are plagued with four major aws: 1) the alleged asymmetrical information between buyer and seller as a problem in the coordination process of the market; 2) the confusion between different concepts or denitions of probability: case or class probabilities, pure subjective beliefs on the occurrence of an event or relative prices on betting markets; 3) the presupposed inability of actors (sellers and buyers) to solve by themselves the problems they face, 4) the pretense of economists to be able to correct these so-called market failures with compulsory insurance without creating new moral hazard and/or adverse selection problems worse than the ones they want to cure. We center our paper mainly on the internal and theoretical inconsistency of the canonical model developed by Akerlof and Rothschild and Stiglitz's theory and their followers based on additive or non additive expected utility associated with the subjective versus frequency tradition in statistics. As an alternative, we propose to approach these phenomena through the eye glasses of betting markets an securitization of insurance contracts.
B53|Capital Theory and the Process of Inter-Temporal Coordination: The Austrian Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth|Appreciation of the necessity of the inter-temporal coordination of heterogeneous capital goods is the chief contribution of Austrian economics to the theory of economic growth. Austrian theory illustrates why an institutional environment of freely formed prices predicated on private property is essential for economic growth. This leads Austrians to have a unique take on Solow growth theory, the financing gap model, national economic planning, and aggregative development measures.

B53|The Dangers of Deflation|Beginning no later than Mises’s The Theory of Money and Credit in 1912, the causes and consequences of inflation have been a central concern of the Austrian School of Economics. Unfortunately, that has meant relatively few analyses of the problems of deflation from a distinctly Austrian perspective. Deflation has dangers of its own, and there are important insights that are unique to the Austrian tradition that can add to our understanding of those dangers. This paper explores those dangers, both at the broad macroeconomic level and at a more microeconomic level by integrating the Austrian theory of capital with the monetary equilibrium theory account of deflation. Austrian concerns about inflation should not lead them to overlook the very real dangers of deflation. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2014
B53|An Empirical Analysis of the Austrian Business Cycle Theory|The Austrian economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich A. Hayek developed a unique theory of the business cycle. In their view, an unsustainable boom ensues when the rate of interest prevailing in the market falls below the natural rate. The boom is characterized not only by an increase in aggregate production but also by a distortion of the structure of production. Similarly, the recession that follows is characterized by a decline in aggregate production as the structure of production is repaired. Hence, the Austrian account of macroeconomic fluctuation stresses the misallocation and reallocation of resources in addition to the overproduction and underproduction of more conventional business cycle theories. In a recent article, Lester and Wolff (Review of Austrian Economics 26(4):433–461, 2013 ) attempt to consider the empirical relevance of the Austrian view. We argue that the authors’ use of the federal funds rate as an indicator of monetary policy is inappropriate in that it fails to distinguish a low market interest rate from a market interest rate that is low relative to the natural rate. Using an estimate of the natural rate provided by Selgin et al. ( 2011 ), we attempt to improve upon their analysis. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2014
B53|Extending the Analysis of Spontaneous Market Order to Governance|How much do markets depend on the state? The founders of the Austrian School of Economics saw a lot of room for markets but believed that government rules and regulations are needed to create framework for markets. More recent research, however, has shown that rules and regulations underpinning some of the most advanced markets such as stock markets have emerged from the market. This article discusses how Austrian economic insights about the importance of competition (although not atomistic competition), entrepreneurship, and consumer sovereignty can be applied to governance itself.

B53|Is there a self-enforcing monetary constitution?|A self-enforcing monetary constitution has rules that agents acting within the system will uphold even in the presence of deviations from ideal knowledge and complete benevolence. It thus does not require external enforcement. What would such a constitution look like? I show that two regimes—a version of nominal gross domestic product targeting that relies on market implementation of monetary policy, and free banking—meet these requirements for self-enforcing monetary constitutions. The analysis draws insights from political economy, and from constitutional political economy in particular. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
B53|Lessons from Constitutional Culture and the History of Constitutional Transfer: A Hope for Constitutionally Limited Government?|The literature shows a clear correlation between sound constitutional environments and human flourishing. However, the path to adoption of sound constitutions is much less clear. This paper turns to the history of constitutional transfer to propose an alternative to taxonomies offered in the literature, which typically classify constitutions either by governmental structure (presidential v. parliamentary, or centralized v. federalist) or by source of influence (e.g. US 1787, Spain 1812, France 1958). These classifications are found wanting; instead, this paper proposes a new taxonomy based on the origin of the constitutional ideas and adoption. Formal constitutional parchment must match informal constitutional culture, so a constitution’s likelihood of success is greatest when the ideas are indigenous; the source of adoption is ultimately secondary. The paper closes with four case studies of constitutional transfer and adoption. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2014
B53|From Vienna to Virginia: Exchange, rules, and social cooperation an introduction to the symposium|Serving as an introduction to the essays in this volume, we put forward an intellectual hardcore for a shared research agenda between Austrian and Virginia political economy. This research agenda rests on three pillars: exchange, rules, and social cooperation. Each of these pillars forms the distinctive flavor of Austrian and Virginian political economy with respect to theoretical approach, types and applications of empirics, and even to normative questions. Our essay explores the meaning of these pillars with respect to the broader study of political economy, as well as the intellectual superstructure of each respective school.

B53|Entrepreneurship: Catallactic and constitutional perspectives|The most important distinction between Virginia political economy (VPE) and the other branches of public choice scholarship is a close affinity of the former to Austrian economics. Contributions in both the Virginia and the Vienna (Austrian) traditions have emphasized this connection and highlighted the analytical and ideological interdependencies of the two schools. This paper argues that an application of the Austrian theory of political entrepreneurship to the VPE framework can provide important insights regarding the direction of political change. Kirzner’s theory of entrepreneurship explains that coordination of individual action is possible where price signals provide information. When price signals are absent the entrepreneurial process breaks down. There is common ground between Kirznerian entrepreneurship and Buchanan’s creative action. Scholars at the intersection of the Virginia and the Vienna traditions can use this common ground to make pattern predictions regarding the direction of political change.

B53|A subjectivist’s solution to the limits of public choice|In light of Wittman ( 1995 ) and Caplan ( 2007 ) this paper contends that the rational-choice approach to political science (“Public Choice theory”) has reached a dead end. By critiquing their treatment of rationality, knowledge assumptions, and views of the democratic process, an alternative is presented based on the core insight of the “Epistemic Primacy Thesis”. This subjectivist approach to political economy is introduced in light of an existing debate between the compatibility (or otherwise) of Austrian economics and Public Choice theory.

B53|Where are the big bills? Escaping the endogenizer’s dilemma|The continual expansion of rational choice theory to a greater range of social phenomena—from markets to politics and institutions—is a testament to its success. Each further application, however, simultaneously forecloses a potential source of inefficiency in economic systems. Abdicating efficiency considerations impairs economics’ explanatory power as much as its normative relevance. In this paper I explore the interconnected roles of subjectivism and knowledge problems in accounting for inefficiency. I conclude that the knowledge-generating properties of institutions allow for efficiency comparisons, but only in the embrace of a thoroughgoing subjectivism.

B53|Political economy and the science of association: A suggested reconstruction of public choice through the alliance of the Vienna, Virginia, and Bloomington schools of political economy|We argue that in order to answer the challenges that James Buchanan put to contemporary political economists, a reconstruction of public choice theory building on the work of Buchanan, F.A. Hayek and Vincent Ostrom must take place. Absent such a reconstruction, and the significant challenges that Buchanan raised will continue to go unmet.

B53|James M. Buchanan: An appreciation|James M. Buchanan co-founded the field of Public Choice. He was influenced by Austrian economics, and in turn influenced Austrian economics. In particular, he advanced the understanding of subjectivist cost theory. His individualist approach to public policy making has been adopted by many Austrian economists. With Richard Wagner, he analyzed the politics of Keynesian economics. They explained why Keynesianism in practice led to a larger government, permanent deficits and inflationary monetary policy.

B53|James M. Buchanan: Through an Austrian window|This tribute to the late James Buchanan is an elaboration of themes he developed on the importance of processes in real, experienced time, especially for individual choice. The conventional way of modeling choice is to think of it as the solution to a constrained maximization problem. If, however, we look at choice as a process in time it is inseparable from the evolution and self-development of the individual. Preferences emerge in the process of their becoming. The fundamental characteristic of choice is thus the expression of autonomy and not the satisfaction of given preferences. The implications of this for normative economics are explored.

B53|Entrepreneurship, and the entrepreneurial market process: Israel M. Kirzner and the two levels of analysis in spontaneous order studies|The science of economics is born out of the puzzle that the coordination of economic activities presents to our imagination. The solution to that puzzle is the entrepreneurial market process. Israel Kirzner has argued that the market economy operates with ruthless efficiency to coordinate economic activities and realize the gains from social cooperation under the division of labor because of the institutional framework within which it operates, namely private property rights. Kirzner, however, is suspicious of economic analysis that doesn't limit its analysis to an examination of processes within that framework, but instead attempts to apply that analysis to the evolution of the framework itself. These are the two-levels of analysis in spontaneous order studies. This paper presents Kirzner's arguments for maintaining a strict dichotomy between the levels of analysis, and then challenges his argument with a discussion of the positive political economy of endogenous rule formation.

B53|Resurrecting the ghostly entrepreneur|The longstanding debate on the exact theoretical role and nature of the entrepreneur has traditionally featured the works of three great economists, Joseph Schumpeter, Frank Knight and Israel Kirzner. Each had a somewhat different take on this question, but each of them shared the common assumption that the entrepreneurial function exists as an independent and objective input into the productive order. However, this assumption was vigorously called into question in a little noticed but very important piece by Harold Demsetz in 1983. Demsetz may be said to have “unbundled” the other writers entrepreneurial packages and could find substantially nothing therein that was not already accounted for in the standard neoclassical market model, with investors being rewarded for taking risk under conditions of uncertainty. He comes very close to denying that there even exists a separate entrepreneurial function in the production process. This paper then proceeds to argue that Demsetz has overstated his case and that there is a distinctive aspect to entrepreneurship that has not heretofore been noted in the literature. That is the idea of “the idea”, the original cognitive formulation of a plan, a new business, an invention, a reorganization or any other new concept. The problem in understanding the role of the entrepreneur is one of intellectual property, since, at the moment of idea formulation, there is no practical way to give property right protection to an abstract idea. A comparison to the patent and the copyright system elucidates this point. The only practicable method of protecting the inherent value of a new non patentable or non-copyrightable idea is by joining it with another input which can receive property right protection, such as any of the traditional production inputs. This explains the common confounding between entrepreneurship and starting a new firm. Because of the team production nature of the venture, it is impossible to measure the marginal contribution of each of the constituent elements, thus explaining why a lot of entrepreneurial ventures are “one-man” firms. The matter of compensating for entrepreneurial services in publicly held corporations is also considered. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
B53|The Mises-Hayek business cycle theory, fiat currencies and open economies|This paper extends the Mises-Hayek business cycle theory to open economies with fiat currencies. I explore: (1) the problem of domestic versus international monetary policy with fiat currencies in an international setting. (2) How the feedback effects between central banks in the context of an expansionary monetary contributes to extend and transmit a Mises-Hayek business cycle from big economies to small financially integrated economies. I find that a lengthening of the period of production is not the only effect produced on the capital structure, but also a misallocation of capital goods between the production of tradable and non-tradable goods and services and that business cycles can become more severe when there are open economies with fiat currencies.

B53|The capacity for self-governance and post-disaster resiliency|A community’s capacity for self-governance depends on the social coordination capacity of community organizations and associations, the ability of community members to effectively access both bonding and bridging social capital, the ability of community members to leverage their shared histories and perspectives, and the stability of social networks within the community. Both Elinor Ostrom and Jane Jacobs have explored how a community’s capacity for self-governance affects its ability to solve complex problems (for example, dealing with crime, the provision of public goods, or problems of neighborhood blight). The greater a community’s capacity for self-governance the better able it is to deal with these complex challenges. This paper examines how pre-disaster systems of self-governance aid in post-disaster community recovery. Our analysis focuses on the Mary Queen of Vietnam (MQVN) community and Gentilly, examines the effectiveness of their systems of self-governance prior to Hurricane Katrina and explores the role these systems played in promoting community recovery after the disaster.

B53|Evenly rotating economy: A new modeling technique for an old equilibrium construct|In the middle of the twentieth century, just five years before Arrow and Debreu proved the existence of an equilibrium for a competitive economy in the Walrasian system, Ludwig von Mises introduced the English-speaking world to his alternative equilibrium construct: the evenly rotating economy. In contrast to Arrow and Debreu, which characterizes equilibrium as a unique vector of prices and quantities, Mises depicts equilibrium as a pattern of behavior. After reviewing the Misesian conception of equilibrium and its failure to take hold in the profession, I turn to the modern literature. I contend that the evenly rotating economy is a special case of the now-prevalent class of search-theoretic exchange models. As such, I argue that this class of models is particularly well suited for applications considered by economists working in the Austrian tradition.

B53|The theory of interventionism as an Austrian theory of slowdowns|This paper addresses the question of whether the Austrian theory of interventionism helps us understand what growth economists call decelerations or slowdowns. It is proposed that the theory of stagnation based on non-productive entrepreneurship Coyne et al. (Journal of Austrian Economics 23(4), 333–346, 2010 ) complements the theory of interventionism, and when they are combined, a theory of slowdowns is the result. The consequences of this theory are used in an empirical investigation whose strategy is based on two hypotheses. One is that the interventionist process has institutional determinants which can be derived from the theory. The other is that interventionism is the mechanism of the slowdown of economic growth not only for those countries that have experienced relatively high growth rates in the past but also for those with normal growth rates. Using logit regressions it is shown that reductions in any area of economic freedom can be seen as one of the causes of slowdowns. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
B53|Cultural catallactics|In response to Israel Kirzner’s claim that “culture lies outside the scope of economic theory itself,” Storr advances a compelling vision of market processes in which price changes, profit/loss signals, and constitutional rules do their work only when refracted through culturally specific webs of meaning. Yet Storr provides few details about the analytic structure or consequences of his alternative approach and ultimately no answer to the Kirznerian question of how, or how fully, a culture-infused market process would eliminate incoherence of plans. Storr’s focus on the competing spirits that animate particular markets is congenial to Ludwig Lachmann’s emphasis on diverse interpretative frames through which individuals decode market signals. If pursued, the nascent Weber-Schütz-Lachmann trajectory of Storr’s cultural catallactics would showcase the distinctive strengths of the Austrian hermeneutic tradition as a radical alternative to the culturally disembedded Walrasian/Kirznerian market.

B53|Understanding the culture of markets: A reflection|This essay examines Virgil Storr’s ( 2013 ) Understanding the Culture of Markets, particularly the relationship between cultures and constitutions and the particulars of the ideal-typical ‘spirit’ of capitalism. Culture cannot be viewed as a constitution, I argue, because of fundamental differences between the two types of guidance to conduct, both for the actors within them and the researchers studying them. I also consider possibly conflicting interpretations of the idea of the animating spirit(s) of a market in the context of Storr’s example of the economic culture of the Bahamas.

B53|The Natural Cycle: WHY Economic Fluctuations are Inevitable. A Schumpeterian Extension of the Austrian Business Cycle Theory|The conventional version of Austrian business cycle theory focuses on a temporary imbalance between natural and monetary rates of interest. When, because of the role of monetary authorities in defining the monetary rate, the two values are in a situation of imbalance, the resulting expansion stage is followed by a recession. On the other hand, if instead the expansive phase arises without any interference by monetary authorities but through re-adaptation of the productive structure to a modified structure of temporal preferences, a period of sustainable growth begins that will not be followed by a crisis. The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate, on the other hand, that because of profitexpectations and the combined action of Schumpeterian elements (imitations-speculations and the ‘creation of money’ by banks), even a so-called ‘sustainable’ boom will be affected by a liquidation and settling crisis. What distinguishes the latter situation from the conventional case of imbalance between monetary and natural rates is not the onset or otherwise of a crisis but, rather, its intensity and duration. We will define as natural an economic cycle characterised by a stage of expansion considered to be ‘sustainable’ in the Austrian theory but followed by an inevitable readjustment crisis.
B53|A Cognitive Approach to Law and Economics: Hayek's Legacy| Hayek's contribution to law has been criticized and disputed. This paper shares the opinion that the significance of Hayek's legal writings and their relevance to law and economics can only be understood by jointly analyzing his economic and legal theories. Moreover, I will argue that both theories must be reconsidered in light of Hayek's theory of mind. This theory represents the key to understanding Hayek's thought in that it provides an insight into the complexity of cognitive and psychological determinants of coordination processes. The latter are essential for understanding the emergence of social institutions. From this perspective, Hayek's theory bears close relevance to current research in law. He suggests a different methodological approach in which the analysis of the micro-foundations of behavior is of central importance. I argue that such multidisciplinary inquiry can contribute to legal theory by explaining perception in decision-making processes. This line of analysis may also contribute to a normative legal theory that reduces errors in legal contexts. Such an interdisciplinary approach seems to be consistent with the OIE requirement — in the tradition of Veblen and Commons — that economic science must deal with a consistent theory of human behavior.

In order to achieve such a goal, it presents two arguments related to the Austrian School of Economics: the role played by the entrepreneur in Kirzner’s approach to the market process as an analogy to what is seen in the history of economic thought, and Hayek’s arguments for liberty as a defense of freedom of research and the existence of methodological pluralism. It is argued that, under the Austrian point of view, history of economic thought and methodological pluralism might be more appreciated by economists.

A Free-Market Look at Why the Stock Market Collapsed, the Economy Tanked, and Government Bailouts Will Make Things Worse\"", by Thomas E. Woods Jr.)"| Focused especially on the causes, Woods elegantly discovers in the tradition of the Austrian School of economics that the main culprit for the creation of crises is the monetary system’s nature. As he goes, this is a system that allows a process of artificially expanded money supply which necessarily leads to the general increase in the price level (inflation) that erodes the purchasing power of people’s money.

B53|Should we be Austere? A Normative look at Public Debt|Excessive debt accumulation is an important policy concern in both developing and advanced economies because it is associated with various issues, particularly low growth and high inflation. This is apparent from the deleveraging vs. deficit spending debate; in this, the focus has tended to be on two specific outcomes, that is, on economic growth, and inflation. So, this debate often overlooks the repercussions of debt on economic freedom. Economic freedom may be regarded not just as a means to macroeconomic growth and stability, but also as in end in itself. It tends to be inhibited when the full consequences of rising public debt, whether from external or domestic sources, are misunderstood, particularly when the underlying basis for debt accumulation is neither stimulus nor smoothing.
B53|Ecumenical foundations? On the coexistence of Austrian and neoclassical views on utility|Utility has long been a debatable concept, with many competing interpretations. The Austrian school and the neoclassical school, however broad these categories may seem, have made the most substantial and, by the same token, the most contrasting contributions to the theory of value. The paper’s goal is not to adjudicate past arguments or observe the evolution of the theory, but rather to resolve contemporary misunderstandings. The references are made to such trouble spots as subjectivism vs. objectivism, cardinality vs. ordinality, and mathematical formalism vs. verbal formalism. Both schools entrenched themselves in their views long ago. Nevertheless, this paper shows that discussing utility on common ground and on the basis of shared presumptions is not necessarily the melody of the future. The paper is concluded with recommendations on how the current dissent may be attenuated.

B53|On Human Rationality and Government Control|In this paper we first address a long-standing criticism of human rationality and what that means for the role of government. We review and compare much of the literature on rationality and demonstrate that various authors within various fields often mean very different things by the word “rational.” While we make no claims as to whether or not humans always behave rationally, we point out the flawed logic for what is suggested for the role of government as a way of addressing the human irrationality problem. Building on the Mises-Rothbard-Huerta de Soto tradition, we argue that what is more important than perfect rationality is purposeful action. We explain the dynamic nature of the market in which time plays an important role, and humans act with expectations to accomplish goals, learn from past mistakes, discover new information and modify their plans accordingly. Using Hayek’s approach, we discuss the knowledge problem in which data is dispersed among millions of individuals (unknown in its entirety to any central authority) as well as the problems with applying the scientific method exactly as it is used in the natural sciences to the human behavioral sciences. These problems combined, we argue, make for a much more disastrous system than would be a system in which often-irrational individuals would be free to make mistakes for themselves, discover new information and take actions for their own betterment.
B53|Fenomenologie jako základ ekonomické metody<BR>[Phenomenology as a Foundation of Economic Method]|In recent years, economic approach to human behavior has been challenged by contributions of cognitive science under the name of behavioral economics. As a result, two methodological strands in economics discord with each other: objectivistic (naturalistic) approach refuses the role of motivations in human behavior, adopting methods of natural science; subjectivistic (interpretative) approach, on the other hand, takes the teleological structure of human action as its corner stone. It is argued that position of the latter (esp. rational choice theory) has been undermined because it builds upon primitive version of human teleological structure. The paper shows that phenomenology offers a promising solution. Phenomenology identifies typical, invariant structures of human action and social world, with various degrees of their anonymity. If economic approach is founded on those structures adequately, then both rational choice theory and bounded rationality theories become compatible, as they differ in their degrees of anonymity only; they both belong to the body of (subjectivistic) economic approach to human behavior.
B53|The Wage Curve in Austrian Models|We fully characterise, in terms of their local or global properties, the wage curves associated with Austrian models of production. When these properties are met, the degrees of freedom in the choice of parameters allow us to build an Austrian model which admits a given wage curve and satisfies other requirements.
B53|Special Economic Zones - 20 years later|In this paper we undertake an ex-post evaluation of whether the special economic zones (SEZs) introduced in Poland in 994 have been successful in meeting regional development objectives. We evaluate the policy on as many of its objectives as possible: employment creation, business creation (which includes attracting foreign direct investment), income or wage effects, and environmental sustainability. We use different panel data methods to investigate this question at the powiat (nuts4 or something similar to a commune) and gmina (nuts5 or something similar to a village) levels in Poland during the 995-20 period. It is also possible to include numerous controls to reduce the problem of the omitted variables bias such as education level, dependency rates, state ownership, general subsidies and whether the area is urban or rural. Our results indicate that SEZs in Poland have been successful in a number of their objectives such as private business creation. The positive effect of the policy however mainly comes through foreign direct investment (FDI), whereas the effects on e.g. investment and employment are small or insignificant. In other areas, such as securing higher income levels and locking firms into the sustainability agenda through the adoption of green technologies and reduced air pollution, we find only a small positively moderating effect of the policy on what are traditionally economically disadvantaged areas in Poland that used to be dependent on the socialist production model. Hence, despite high levels of FDI, the zones policy has not managed to overcome the legacy of backwardness or lagging regions. The main policy implication of the paper is that SEZs may be successful in stimulating activity in the short run but the policy must be seen as one of necessary temporality and can therefore not stand alone. Before launching SEZs, policymakers must have plans in place for follow up measures to ensure the longer term competitiveness and sustainability implications of such an initiative. There is a need to understand the connection between the specific incentive schemes used (in this particular case tax incentives were used) and the kinds of firms and activities they attract, including the behavioral models that those incentives promote.
B53|Demand-driven innovation policies in the EU|The objective of the PICK-ME (Policy Incentives for Creation of Knowledge – Methods and Evidence) research project is to provide theoretical and empirical perspectives on innovation which give a greater role to the demand-side aspect of innovation. The main question is how can policy make enterprises more willing to innovate? This task is fulfilled by identifying what we consider the central or most salient aspect of a demand-side innovation-driven economy, which is the small and entrepreneurial yet fast growing and innovative firm. We use the term ?Gazelle? to signify this type of firm throughout the paper. The main concern of policy-makers should therefore be how to support Gazelle type of firms through various policies. The effectiveness of different policy instruments are considered. For example, venture capitalism is in the paper identified as an important modern institution that renders exactly the type of coordination necessary to bring about an innovation system more orientated towards the demand side. This is because experienced entrepreneurs with superior skills in terms of judging the marketability of new innovations step in as financiers. Other factor market bottlenecks on the skills side must be targeted through education policies that fosters centers of excellence. R&D incentives are also considered as a separate instrument but more a question for future research since there is no evidence available on R&D incentives as a Gazelle type of policy. Spatial policies to foster more innovation have been popular in the past. But we conclude that whereas the literature often finds that new knowledge is developed in communities of physically proximate firms, there is no overshadowing evidence showing that spatial policies in particular had any impact on generating more of the Gazelle type of firms.
B53|Price Level Stabilization: Hayek and New Keynesians|The doctrine of price level stabilization is one of the most important building blocks in modern macroeconomics. In 1920s and 1930s, Friedrich August von Hayek presented a theory that challenged this monetary-policy regime. Hayek stressed that attempts to stabilize the price level in the situation of a growing natural output might cause serious injection effects leading the economy to a boom-bust cycle. This article compares the Hayek theory with the New Keynesian doctrines. A simple graphical model is used to elucidate differences between the two theories. It is suggested that a declining price level might be a normal response of the price system in the expanding economy because the New Keynesian arguments stressing price rigidities may be of lower significance when the deflation in prices is caused by technological progress.
B53|Were Hayek?s Monetary Policy Recommendations Inconsistent?|Contrary to the received view, we maintain that Hayek?s monetary policy recommendations were not inconsistent. The prevalent perception of early Hayek as the money stream stabilizer and late Hayek as the price level stabilizer is attributable to an unjustified normative interpretation of Hayek?s positive analysis. We argue that in his contributions to monetary theory, Hayek took the goals of monetary policy as exogenously given and analysed the efficiency of different means to achieve these goals. Hayek?s allegedly inconsistent switch from being a critic to an advocate of price level stabilization is explained by a change in the issues on which he focused, rather than by a change in his theoretical views. We also claim that Hayek was always aware that every practical monetary policy involves difficult trade-offs and was thus reluctant to impose his own value judgments about what people should strive for.*We would like to thank Pavel Potu?ák for his helpful comments on an earlier draft. Any mistakes are, of course, ours.
B53|Darwinian paradigm, cultural evolution and human purposes: on F.A. Hayek’s evolutionary view of the market|The claim that the Darwinian paradigm of blind-variation-and-selective-retention can be generalized from the biological to the socio-cultural realm has often been questioned because of the critical role played by human purposeful design in the process of cultural evolution. In light of the issue of how human purposes and evolutionary forces interact in socio-economic processes the paper examines F.A. Hayek’s arguments on the “extended order” of the market (capitalism), in particular with regard to their policy implications. Its focus is on the tension that exists in Hayek’s work between a rational liberal and an agnostic evolutionary perspective. A re-construction of his arguments is suggested that allows for a reconciliation of these seemingly contradictory views. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
B53|Property rights as a complex adaptive system: how entrepreneurship transforms intellectual property structures|This article aims to provide some elements of an evolutionary theory of property rights. It applies a systems-based capital-theoretic perspective to explain the formation and transformation of property rights structures. The approach emphasizes how entrepreneurs create capital combinations by connecting capital goods—defined widely to include property rights, such as patents—in their production plans. Their actions change complementarity relations between property rights as used in production. We treat the property rights structure as a complex adaptive system that exhibits increasing structural complexity as it evolves. Entrepreneurs discover gaps in the property rights system. As they organize production to exploit profit opportunities, entrepreneurs regroup existing intellectual property rights (IPR) into new modules, such as patent pools, that encapsulate more complex combinations of basic building blocks of intellectual property. A patent pool constitutes an interpolation of a new meso level within the macro IPR structure. We apply our framework to the first of the patent pools for digital video compression technology used in digital television and DVDs. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
B53|The Illusion of Consumer Sovereignity in Economic and Neoliberal Thought|Contemporary economic policy discourses are heavily oriented towards competition and efficiency using modern conceptualisation of the market as an institution for resource allocation and governance. Market based policy approaches are considered necessary and sufficient instruments to achieve environmental goals while leaving individual freedom largely unaffected. This neoliberal position crucially depends upon the concept of consumer sovereignty. It encapsulates the idea that individual consumption is the only source of value and consumers are able to enforce their interests on producers via their power in the market place. Despite the concept of consumer sovereignty having huge importance in contemporary economic theory and policy, its meaning remains opaque. We explore how consumer sovereignty has been employed for political instrumental, market ideal and economic instrumental reasons by classic liberals, neo-Austrian and Neoclassical economists respectively. We go on to show that the concept of consumer sovereignty depends upon a series of problematic assumptions and fails to bear much relationship to reality. The theoretical basis of consumer sovereignty on individual preferences proves problematic, not least due to its ethical presumptions. Environmentalists search for what makes a just and sustainable society and neoliberalism is answering with the rhetoric of consumer sovereignty. This paper shows why that answer needs to be rejected and why environmentalism actually means critically rethinking the role of markets in society.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

B53|Merger waves and the Austrian business cycle theory|Following standard Austrian School theory, in this paper I identify merger waves as parts of Austrian type business cycles. As indicated by Mises, Rothbard and Hayek, when loan rates are reduced below their natural level through bank credit expansion this falsifies the monetary calculation of capitalist-entrepreneurs. As a result, new investments are initiated that calculation showed were not profitable before the interest rate reduction. On the other hand, the fall in interest rates falsifies households’ appraisals of their income and wealth, which turns them overly optimistic and causes them to over-consume, save less and go into debt. As a consequence of these developments the economy does not have enough resources for the completion of the new projects and businesses must increasingly withdraw the resources from other companies. I conclude that the increase in investment activity and the accompanying “resource crunch” cause a merger wave that helps prolong the boom phase of the cycle. The merger wave ends when the credit expansion is not sufficient to sustain the economic boom (which usually occurs when central banks finally let interest rates rise again and an overextended financial system tightens credit standards) and the bust phase begins. On the other hand, if the newly created fiduciary media does not enter the economy through the loan market to finance business investment, there should be no pronounced and sustained increase in merger activity followed by an economic bust.
B53|Against a post-Hayekian economic philosophy|The article takes a position on an approach that puts economic philosophy in a field consisting of three types of intersection: between political economy and social philosophy, between normative economics and moral philosophy, and finally between economics and philosophy of science. It shows, firstly, that this economic philosophy presupposes a Hayekian conception of the formation of the human mind and ways of economic progress, a design that offers the possibility of linking arguments of biological, moral and epistemological type in the same problematic. Despite this heritage, it is also undeniable that economic philosophy takes a distance with respect to Hayek, in particular, from the point of view of the criteria for the validity of a theory. While Hayek is animated by a concern for scientific truth, economic philosophy considers it necessary to establish another criterion for validity, this time, the predictive ability of a theory. But we should not assume that this change indicates a critical distance from the Austrian author, but rather an act of further allegiance.
B53|Keynes oder Mises? Wer hat die bessere Therapie für die Schuldenkrise?|Should fiscal consolidation and scaling down public debt be given highest priority in Euro countries in crisis? Or do they need a strong fiscal stimulus from expansive government spending for overcoming their deep recessions? Here, these questions are analyzed against the background of Keynesian and Austrian business cycle theories. It is argued that the prospects for Keynesian fiscal spending crucially depend upon the availability of competitive idle capacities. If such capacities have eroded during the long phase of cheap money, a fiscal stimulus would merely foster domestic inflation and foreign imports. The empirical evidence collected in this paper tends to support the latter view which is closer to the Austrians than to the Keynesians. The paper concludes that expansive government spending in Euro countries in crisis would postpone restructuring and would add further adjustment burdens to existing ones. Vor dem Hintergrund der keynesianischen und der österreichischen Konjunkturtheorie wird diskutiert, ob Haushaltskonsolidierung und Schuldenabbau in den Krisenländern des Euroraums oberste Priorität haben sollten oder ob es kräftiger Impulse durch staatliche Nachfrageprogramme bedarf, um diese Länder zunächst einmal aus ihrem konjunkturellen Tal herauszuholen. Dabei wird herausgearbeitet, dass die angemessene Antwort darauf nicht zuletzt davon abhängt, ob es in den Krisenländern überhaupt unausgelastete Kapazitäten in nennenswertem Umfang gibt, die konjunkturell wiederbelebt werden könnten, oder ob ihre Wirtschaftsstrukturen in den langen Jahren des billigen Gelds so stark erodiert sind, dass expansive Konjunkturprogramme weitgehend ins Leere laufen wür-den. Die in diesem Beitrag herangezogene empirische Evidenz spricht für letztere Sichtweise, die eher mit der österreichischen als mit der keynesianischen Sichtweise in Einklang steht. Mit einem konjunkturellen Strohfeuer würden die Krisen demnach nur unnötig verlängert, da die Strukturanpassung vertagt und auf heute schon bestehende Anpassungslasten weitere Anpassungslasten getürmt würden.
B53|New evidence on the structure of production: Real and Austrian business cycle theory and the financial instability hypothesis|This article develops the relationships among real business cycle (RBC) theory, Austrian business cycle (ABC) theory, and Minsky's financial instability hypothesis (FIH). In RBC models, recessions are caused on the supply side by random technology shocks which are independent of monetary policy. However, in ABC models, credit expansion results in negative productivity shocks, as the marginal return on investment is lowered and the production structure is extended by commitment to more capital-intensive activities. Thus, ABC theory helps resolve several problems with RBC theory. The FIH describes a process of endogenous overleveraging which unsustainably overvalues assets and exposes the financial sector to greater risk. This paper argues that the overleveraging described by the FIH is compatible with the unsustainable expansion of production described in ABC theory, and further argues that credit expansion would both provide additional funds to finance overleveraging, as well as encourage the process by making it cheaper with lower interest rates.
B53|Property rights, entrepreneurship and coordination|The notion of plan coordination enjoys a central place in the analysis of institutions and competitive market processes. The conventional wisdom is that institutions and policies vary in the extent to which they promote competition and how quickly and completely they bring individuals’ plans into closer coordination with one another. Kirzner has provided the most fully elaborated statement on the use of coordination as a positive analytical device for explaining market dynamics and as a normative criterion for evaluating economic policies. We identify the core propositions in his analysis that elucidate how economic coordination depends upon that most fundamental of market institutions – the system of private property rights. We also probe into Kirzner's claims about inherent limitations in our ability to compare the coordinative potential of alternative property rights systems. We unpack the consequences of these core propositions using the economic theory of property rights. We also examine Kirzner's assertion that dynamic competition – including Schumpeterian innovation – is necessarily coordinative in its market effects. We find that his argument rests on the implicit assumption that property rights remain constant during the process of market adjustment. We provide a case study of the advent of commercial aviation as a potential counterexample to his claims.
B53|In Search of the Right Tool: From Formalism to Constructivist Modelling|The object of this paper is to assert the implications, in terms of practices of the community of economists, of the adoption of specific mathematical tools. More precisely, the aim of this paper is to assert the non-neutrality of the mathematical tools used by economists and to show that, after half a century of domination of a peculiar vision of mathematics, namely formalism, economics is ready to switch to a diverse conception thanks to the availability of new mathematical tools, constructivist tools.
B53|Equilibrium versus Process: A Confrontation between Mainstream and Austrian Ontology|We confront mainstream and Austrian economics from a history of economic analysis point of view in order to identify the main reasons of their divergent interests on the concepts of, respectively, equilibrium and processes. The result of this confrontation attributes a decisive role to ontological considerations: mainstream central focus on equilibrium is the consequence of the adoption of specific mathematical tools. But the claim for a mathematical approach to economics is a doctrine that is independent from any study on the nature of the underlying economic system and real phenomena that are non-tractable are either reinterpreted in an amenable to reason form or are simply ignored. The choice of the tools determine the orthodox vision of the economic world as a closed system of interacting autonomous atoms. Austrians proceed exactly the other way round: ontological investigations are the starting point and as a consequence, they choose the relevant tools so to be coherent with their ontology where social reality is apprehended along an open processual view.
B53|Spontaneous Orders and the Emergence of Economically Powerful Cities|The importance of cities to economic dynamism and growth cannot be emphasized enough. It is crucial for our understanding of what drives economic growth to understand how cities emerge, develop and prosper. This paper investigates the emergence of cities from a spontaneous order and urban economics perspective. The analysis focus on agglomeration effects, externalities and regional clustering as explanations of cities and regional growth. Factors such as local knowledge and dispersion of knowledge are identified as important growth factors. With origin in Hayek’s famous citation “particular circumstances of time and place” these factors are thoroughly discussed in a spontaneous order framework.
B53|A framework for the study of firms as constitutional orders|Much of the literature on corporate performance focuses on institutional restructuring, and implicitly assumes that constitutional factors are determined exogenously. Existing theories of the firm—whether a “goal paradigm” or an “exchange paradigm”—provide useful insights; but we find them incomplete because they miss the extent to which companies build unique and meaningful constitutional orders. Building on Vanberg (Const Polit Econ 3(2):223–253, 1992 ), we investigate the extent to which the field of constitutional political economy (CPE) can improve our understanding of organisations, by providing a typology of CPE that can be applied to a study of firms. We make a distinction among (1) operational; (2) institutional; and (3) constitutional levels of management, and based on the CPE literature argue that “constitutional” considerations help us to define the boundaries of a firm and its operational environment.

B53|“The Economics of Time and Ignorance”: A critical re-examination after 25 years|This article serves as the introduction to a symposium on O’Driscoll and Rizzo’s The Economics of Time and Ignorance. The book was first published in 1985. The symposium aims to provide a retrospective assessment of the book’s contribution to modern Austrian economics. The article characterizes the book’s essential features and gives a brief sketch of the intellectual backdrop that provided the impetus for the book. It also summarizes the five other papers that are part of the symposium, including the responses by the two authors themselves. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013
B53|Is the economics of time and ignorance a “classic”?|A history of economic thought perspective on The Economics of Time and Ignorance reveals that the book rehabilitates some major themes in the Austrian tradition that were all but lost subsequent to the formalist revolution in economics that took place in the middle of the twentieth-century. The book also anticipates some important ideas that were extended and applied in Austrian economics after it was first published. Reviews have claimed that the book was a “classic” and also “original”. The book is too close in a temporal sense to judge whether or not future generations will canonize it as a “classic”. Using Stigler’s criteria as to what constitutes scientific “originality”, it is concluded that, taken as a whole, the book was not original. From the vantage point of the overall discipline of economics, it was a work advancing controversial ideas that would not easily change the beliefs, practices and interests of economists in general but it offered sound reasons for taking the Austrian thought-trajectory more seriously. It would be more fitting to view the authors as providers of many innovations contributing to the mature Austrian economics of the twenty-first century.

B53|Foundations of The Economics of Time and Ignorance|The Economics of Time and Ignorance grew out of the need to reinvigorate the Austrian School in light of the challenges of contemporary economics. It did this by re-examining the foundations of the Austrian tradition and by making explicit many of its hidden assumptions and implications. The book also attempted to make Austrian economics more of an open system than it had been in the conservationist decades of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. The degree to which it has been successful is examined in this essay. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013
B53|Hayek’s 1945 Finlay Memorial Lecture: Tracing the origins and evolution of his ‘true’ individualism|Hayek’s original 1945 University College Dublin lecture outlined the origins and evolution of two different interpretations of ‘individualism’, comparing and contrasting what Hayek terms ‘true’ and ‘false’ individualism notwithstanding the misleading contemporary interpretations and distorted perceptions of the assumptions underlining ‘true’ individualism. Hayek developed and extended the Scottish Enlightenment theory of spontaneous order originally formulated by Adam Ferguson’s maxim that social order was the result of unintended human action rather than the result of deliberate human design in order to explain the origin of complex social structures, which originated in a Cromwellian maxim. The origination and inspiration for the title of Hayek’s lecture is also considered, as is the influence of other thinkers; Mandeville, Tocqueville, Mill, Acton and Schatz that Hayek cites in his Dublin lecture.

B53|Reflections on The economics of time and ignorance coming of age|The re-appraisal after 25 years of The Economics of Time and Ignorance by G.P. O’Driscoll and M.J. Rizzo seeks to accomplish three things: (1) to situate the beginnings of the book against the background of the “doom and gloom” scenario of economics in the late 1970s; (2) to gauge reviewers’ response on its publication; (3) to consider its impact both on Austrian economics and mainstream economics; and, finally, to speculate on its ramifications for the future of Austrian economics.

B53|Nineteenth century London water supply: Processes of innovation and improvement|Public health concerns played a major role in driving the shift from private to government ownership of water works in Britain and the US. Poor water quality is one of the criticisms made of the eight water companies providing piped water to London during the nineteenth century. Critics argued that monopolistic water companies failed to invest in filtration, move their intake, increase capacity or expand their network until compelled to do so by regulation. Critics have taken a static view: looking at water and sanitation in London at a moment in time and identifying actions that the water companies could take that could improve water quality and, consequently, public health. Taking an Austrian process approach, however, shows that companies were continually investing to increase access to piped water and to improve water quality during a time of severe uncertainty and knowledge problems. Water companies often acted before the government to improve quality: early competition encouraged investment and innovation, while later government regulation followed entrepreneurs’ leads and imposed on all water companies improvements already implemented by some. Government decisions were responsible for much of the deterioration in water quality. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2013
B53|The Freiburg school and the Hayekian challenge|At first sight and in terms of explicit references, the relationship between Hayek and the early Freiburg School seems to have been one of mutually benign neglect. It took several decades before the “Hayekian challenge” was fully understood in Freiburg; in a way one could even argue that the challenge arrived in Freiburg only with Hayek himself in 1962. This delay can mostly be explained by different foci of attention. Hayek’s evolutionary economics and his classical-liberal social philosophy centers around the problem of private, dispersed knowledge. The (early) Freiburg School’s economics and its ordo-liberal social philosophy centers around the problem of private, concentrated power. This difference of perspective has consequences and can partly be explained by the different intellectual sources the proponents were drawing upon, and the different political struggles they were engaged in.

B53|Institutional stickiness of democracy in post-communist states: Can prevailing culture explain it?|Structural explanation of political development offers a finite set of factors that cause democracy to consolidate or not (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006 ). This approach is, however, insufficient to explain political development of post-communist countries because it ignores a role of social arrangements in democratic consolidation. The field of comparative political economy is becoming more acceptable to the idea that social institutions have significant impact on political development (Boettke et al. Review of Austrian Economics 18(3–4): 281–304, 2005 ). Using transitional experience of post-communist countries, I demonstrate that institutional stickiness of democracy depends on a combination of causal factors, including underlying political culture (Boettke et al. American Journal of Sociology and Economics 67(2), 2008 ; Pejovich The Review of Austrian Economics 16(4):347–361, 2003 ). Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2013
B53|The overlooked costs of the permanent war economy: A market process approach|How does the permanent war economy interact, and subsume, the private, non-military economy? Can the two remain at a distance while sharing resource pools? This paper argues that they cannot. Once the U.S. embarked upon the path of permanent war, starting with World War II, the result was a permanent war economy. The permanent war economy continuously draws resources into the military sector at the expense of the private economy, even in times of peace. We explore the overlooked costs of this process. The permanent war economy does not just transfer resources from the private economy, but also distorts and undermines the market process which is ultimately responsible for improvements in standards of living.

B53|The (quantity) theory of money and credit|The Theory of Money and Credit (1912) is rightly regarded as a seminal book in the development of the Austrian school approach to monetary theory. We argue that Mises’ understanding of the equation of exchange differs from both of the conventional textbook versions, and warrants recognition as being a distinct contribution. After supporting this claim we discuss it in light of expectations, monetary regimes, and the microfoundations of the quantity theory. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013
B53|State-led humanitarian aid: Another case of “government failure”|A review essay on Christopher Coyne’s Doing Bad by Doing Good: Why Humanitarian Action Fails (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2013). The book considers whether state-led humanitarian actions can be expected to succeed in reducing human suffering. Finding that as a rule they cannot be expected to do so, Coyne devotes the greater part of the book to an analysis of such programs in the light of the economic way of thinking, which in his approach blends public choice, basic applied price theory, Austrian economics, and the new institutional economics. He concludes that the best way to reduce human suffering in the long run is by promoting sustained economic development and that the best way to achieve such development is by adopting institutions that protect economic freedom.

B53|The evolving domain of entrepreneurship research|Research on entrepreneurship has flourished in recent years and is evolving rapidly. This article explores the history of entrepreneurship research, how the research domain has evolved, and its current status as an academic field. The need to concretize these issues stems partly from a general interest in defining the current research domain and partly from the more specific tasks confronting the prize committee of the Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research. Entrepreneurship has developed in many sub-fields within several disciplines—primarily economics, management/business administration, sociology, psychology, economic and cultural anthropology, business history, strategy, marketing, finance, and geography—representing a variety of research traditions, perspectives, and methods. We present an analytical framework that organizes our thinking about the domain of entrepreneurship research by specifying elements, levels of analysis, and the process/context. An overview is provided of where the field stands today and how it is positioned relative to the existing disciplines and new research fields upon which it draws. Areas needed for future progress are highlighted, particularly the need for a rigorous dynamic theory of entrepreneurship that relates entrepreneurial activity to economic growth and human welfare. Moreover, applied work based on more careful design as well as on theoretical models yielding more credible and robust estimates seems also highly warranted. Copyright The Author(s) 2013
B53|The Financial and Economic Crisis and the Aberrance of Economics|Positivism-empiricism-falsificationism has become the ‘state-of-the-art’ methodology of economics. In this article it will be argued that this approach (1) suffers from (logical) deficiencies when applied to the science of human action and (2) has helped legitimizing, and putting into practice, policies that have actually contributed greatly to bringing about the latest financial and economic crisis. The ‘Austrian’, or to be more precise: the ‘Misesian’, method (praxeology) will be outlined as the proper methodology in the field of social science.
B53|"""New"" And ""Old"" In Economic Neoliberalism"|"In the evolution of economic history, the economic neoliberalism can be considered one of the most important. On the one hand, neoliberalism is a promoter of freedom in decision making process and competition. On the other hand, the market and its capability to supply information for the individuals and firms represents one of the central pillars for economic growth, development and profitability. Finally, we cannot ignore the diversity of neoliberal ideas, the number of promoters, and the global extension of neoliberalism. For these reasons, we consider that a short incursion in the history of neoliberalism is also actual and necessary. In the recent evolution of the neoliberal doctrine we can mention several important stages in the 20th century. During the first stage - between the first and second decade - Mises revived the School of Vienna, in his attempts to combat the concepts strongly promoted in the economic theory by the socialist doctrine. The second stage, comprised between the third decade and the end of the fourth decade, was an unfavourable period, during which the concepts of liberal orientation were strongly criticized. The third stage of the neoliberalism evolution, as a doctrine, can be placed between the last part of the fourth decade and the end of the fifth decade, having as object of debate the criticizing of the concepts launched in the economic literature by John Maynard Keynes. The fourth stage meant the entry of neoliberalism in a shadow cone, which lasted from the beginning of the 1950's until towards the middle of the 1970's, due to the popularity ""enjoyed"" by keynesism. The failure to apply the keynesist theories, declared in the second half of the 1970's, meant the entry of neoliberalism in an extended stage of development, which lasted until towards the end of the first decade of the 21st century. After year 2008, there are voices stating that the neoliberal principles are unable to find the answer to the world economic crisis and that, in fact, their promotion to such a wide scale contributed to this negative evolution of the economy."
B53|Methodological Misconceptions in the Social Sciences. Rethinking social thought and social processes|Contemporary social teaching suffers from a grave deficiency: it is lacking rules of methodology and procedure suited to social reality that are, in particular, able to reconcile increasing creativity (implying irreversibility) with rationality, which are indispensable for the scientific judgement of theoretical ideas. Unfortunately, this lack is largely ignored, and eminent social scholars have even explicitly and emphatically theorized a rejection of method. This allows rhetorical and literary skills to prevail over the reasons of science, thereby promoting a deceptive instead of constructive pluralism, confusion in the study of contemporary societies and growing ineptitude in their government, what represents a main source of afflictions in the present world. Method is a two-edged sword: it offers powerful assistance in and enhances our capability of understanding and solving the problems of everyday life; but if the chosen method is inappropriate,it can seriously obstruct the advancement of knowledge. Significantly, the best contributions to social knowledge have been ad hoc studies that disregard method and simply apply common sense. But ad hoc studies suffer a lack of coordination, and the neglect of method makes it difficult to evaluate and select findings and results. As a consequence, ad hoc analyses have little chance of stimulating the cumulative growth of knowledge. However, the present study is intended as a contribution that prevents method from becoming a prison for the mind as opposed to a stimulant of creativity and knowledge.
B53|"Taktické omyly ekonomů rakouské školy při ""dobývání ortodoxie""<BR>[Austrians´ Tactical Mistakes that Prevent Them to ""Conquer the Orthodoxy""]"|According to quite a number of scholars, even non-Austrian, some theories of Austrian school of economic thought do provide an increasingly relevant material to explain recent boom-and-bust economic cycles as well as financial crises. However, I argue, this development is not adequately reflected by a corresponding growth of Austrian influence within the economic orthodoxy. Quite to the contrary, many orthodox scholars have taken over rigidly Keynesian positions since the financial crisis culminated in 2008 and 2009. In my article I maintain that Austrians themselves have contributed significantly to such a situation by not preventing three major tactical mistakes, related to the domain of sociology of economics, from occurring. Firstly, they have not formed a really unified and thus influential group of scholars; instead, they have been divided into a few streams, sometimes with highly contradictory stances. Secondly, many Austrians have made bold predictions, especially with regard to possible enormous inflation stemming from the unprecedented provision of liquidity to the financial system during and in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, which have not been fulfilled at all. Thirdly, a critical number of Austrian school´s economists do not effectively communicate with the rest of the profession and even, it seems, fail to adequately comprehend the orthodox analytical tools and theories.
B53|A Reassessment of the Owner - Manager “Class Conflict”: the Unintended Private Consequence of Some Public Regulations|Traditional literature regarding “corporate governance” finds the “tension between ownership and management” (as it was shaped by the agency theory) to be a node in the logic of what should be the answer to the question “how the structure of the corporation’s property can be designated and, in this way, achieve its organizational architectural efficiency on the more developed financial markets, populated by publicly listed firms and owned by «diffuse» shareholders?”. In such modern capital markets, that are more dynamic due to a more liberal corporatist law (although uneven across jurisdictions), a phenomenon as “unprecedented” as “ambiguously” theorized by Berle and Means (1932) has been identified: the classic problem of the “separation of ownership from control”. This article makes a brief survey on a part of the corporate governance literature that is mostly neglected and in the ignorance of which lies the melting down in the same pot of the “separation of ownership from control” reality and the “managerial omnipotence” fatality, both associated to modern multinational corporation, and, more or less, misled by Berle and Means (1932). The Austrian School’s treatment within the theory of the firm has the potential to mitigate bad explanations and poor policy prescriptions that undeservedly hamper the very capacity of corporate structures to adapt themselves to changes, the need turning more stringent in times of worldwide spread crises.
B53|Étudier les biens communs par les changements institutionnels : régimes de propriété autour des races animales face à l’innovation génomique|Ce papier propose d’adapter le cadre proposé par Schlager et Ostrom (1992) pour analyser les droits de propriété appliqués à la gestion de ressources communes, afin de réaliser une étude dynamique de régimes de propriété dans le cas de la gestion de ressources génétiques animales. Les ressources génétiques animales, et notamment les races de ruminants (bovins et ovins) sont des ressources communes (appartenant à des communautés d’éleveurs) qui ont fait jusqu’à présent peu l’objet de privatisation comparativement aux ressources végétales (variétés appartenant à des firmes). En décrivant l’évolution de différents « régimes institutionnels de sélection » de ces ressources sur le temps long, et leur déstabilisation actuelle du fait de changements politiques et technologiques (notamment dans le cadre de la sélection génomique), nous montrons en quoi ces ressources communes ne sont pas uniquement des ressources biologiques. Elles sont étroitement liées à des ressources informationnelles et des dispositifs de gestion et de production du progrès génétique, qui représentent une forme de propriété intangible. Nous étudions la co-génération de ressources génétiques et informationnelles, en focalisant l’analyse sur l’évolution des régimes de propriété et des structures de gouvernance associés à ce système de ressources. En effet, une analyse uniquement en termes de droits de propriété sur les ressources biologiques ne permettrait pas de comprendre les changements actuels. Nous montrons en quoi ce cadre, pris dans une perspective dynamique, permet de mettre à jour des changements invisibles autrement, notamment la déstabilisation d’un régime institutionnel vu au travers de sa composante informationnelle.
B53|Electronic Resources and Heterodox Economics| The idea of measuring scientific relevance by counting citations is gaining influence among economists, and thanks to the electronic bibliographic resources now available the procedure has become relatively simple and fast. However, when it comes to putting the idea into practice many problems emerge. This paper uses four of the principal bibliographic electronic resources (EconLit, JSTOR, Web of Science and Scopus) to test the practical applicability of this method to the case of the five theoretical schools classified as 'Current Heterodox Approaches' in JEL code B5.
B53|Quel pasticciaccio brutto dell’euro|Il saggio illustra la spiegazione Classico-Kaleckiana della crisi dell’Eurozona domandandosi se essa sia un effetto indesiderato o possa, invece, rappresentare il dispiegamento dei veri obiettivi anti-sociali della moneta unica. Si esaminano poi le possibili vie d’uscita, inclusa quella di un massiccio “Piano Marshall” europeo di investimenti recentemente proposta dal sindacato tedesco. Quest’ultima soluzione ci appare inadeguata in quanto non tiene conto della più ampia dimensione della problematica della moneta unica e dei divergenti interessi nazionali in Europa. Altre due soluzioni – la più desiderabile via Keynesiana e quella, più densa di incognite, della rottura dell’euro – ci appaiono per ora non nell’ordine delle cose, a meno di un grave incidente che conduca dritti al secondo esito. Al momento la kossovizzazione della periferia europea appare come la prospettiva più probabile.
B53|The anatomy of emergence, with a focus upon capital formation|Emergence is a unifying theme of both evolutionary economics and complex systems theory. In spite of this centrality, emergence in economics has not been subject to an extensive critical analysis. This paper remedies this deficit. We identify several conditions that economic patterns (i.e. rule-systems, structures) must satisfy to qualify as emergent: (1) material realization (emergent patterns are realized in physical structures and processes); (2) coherence (pattern is not a mere aggregate but a systemic whole); (3) non-distributivity (pattern possesses global properties absent from its parts); (4) structure dependence (systemic properties depend upon connective structure). These four core features are common to all forms of emergence in economics. Evolutionary economic systems also exhibit extra-strength versions of emergence, which require that patterns possess one or more additional features: (5) genuine novelty; (6) unpredictability in principle; and (7) irreducibility. We introduce three basic forms of emergence that occur in economic systems—minimal, diachronic and synchronic emergence—and apply these ideas to capital formation at all levels of economic order. The economy-wide capital structure exhibits strongly emergent properties (both diachronic and synchronic) that depend on its structural and functional organization; it is not a mere aggregate of capital goods. Within the realm of capital phenomena, we also compare the distinguishing characteristics of emergent and spontaneous (self-organizing) orders. We provide a case study of the iPhone as an emergent capital pattern to illustrate conditions (1)–(7) above and the different types of emergence.
B53|Markets as economizers of information: Field experimental examination of the “Hayek Hypothesis”|The work of Friedrich Von Hayek contains several testable predictions about the nature of market processes. Vernon Smith termed the most important one the ‘Hayek hypothesis’: equilibrium prices and the gains from trade can be achieved in the presence of diffuse, decentralized information, and in the absence of price-taking behavior and centralized market direction. Vernon Smith tested this by surveying data on laboratory experimental markets and found strong support. We repeat this exercise using field experimental market data. Using field experiments allows us to test several other predictions. Generally speaking, we find support for Hayek’s theories.
B53|Spatial Concentration in the Financial Industry|This paper investigates factors that determine the spatial concentration in the financial industry. Why does the financial industry have such a high spatial concentration? The theoretical framework is based on theories from regional economics, with a focus on agglomeration effects, externalities, and the regional clustering of an industry. The positive agglomeration effects arise from access to i) specialized labor, ii) specialized suppliers, and iii) knowledge dispersion (Marshall 1920). Jacobs (1961, 1969) contributes to a discussion of the role of cities (urban economies) in terms of innovations and entrepreneurship. The high degree of spatial concentration in the financial sector emphasizes the importance of local embeddedness, networks, face-to-face communication, knowledge spillovers, and spatial proximity for the organization of the financial industry. These factors accentuate the importance of local knowledge and the dispersion of knowledge, factors that have been thoroughly discussed and analyzed in the field of Austrian economics. Therefore, an Austrian view is included to examine the role of knowledge in the spatial concentration of financial centers. Scholars such as Hayek (1937; 1945) and Lachmann (1978 [1956]) contribute to understanding the use of knowledge in society.

While calling for us to provide historical evidence to validate the quibbles we put forward, Selgin himself overstates the evidence. He also claims that we have distorted what he has written, and that we use incorrect monetary theory.

B53|An Austrian approach to law and economics, with special reference to superstition|This paper has two purposes. First, it considers what the components of an “Austrian” law and economics might consist of. I argue that Ronald Coase’s conception of law and economics precludes the economic analysis of legal institutions and, in particular, the beliefs that support them. In doing so, Coase’s conception precludes an Austrian law and economics. In contrast, Richard Posner’s conception of law and economics makes such analysis the core of its study. In doing so, Posner’s conception provides a productive foundation for an Austrian law and economics. Second, to illustrate what some aspects of an Austrian law and economics might look like in practice, I consider several examples of the economic analysis of beliefs of import for the law. I focus on objectively false beliefs, or superstitions, and argue that some such beliefs are socially productive. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012
B53|Hayek, Keynes, and modern macroeconomics|The Great Recession seems to be creating a change in the trend of macroeconomic thinking. Prior to the financial crisis of 2008, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models dominated the macroeconomics literature without any apparent challengers on the horizon. Since then, however, we have seen an increasing interest in macroeconomic models that address the state of confidence (“animal spirits”), complexity, cognition, and radical uncertainty. Most of the renewed interest in animal spirits, complexity, cognition, and radical uncertainty has come from a more or less “Keynesian” perspective. We discuss the potential to emphasize these elements from a more “Hayekian” perspective and argue that Austrian approaches to macroeconomics along these lines are more likely to resonate with mainstream economists than in years past.

B53|Monetary equilibrium and price stickiness reconsidered: A reply to Bagus and Howden|Bagus and Howden (Review of Austrian Economics 24(4): 383–402, 2011 ) argue that price stickiness is a poor justification for advocating a flexible money supply through the issuing of fiduciary media under central or free banking. They view the contraction in output following an exogenous increase in money demand as an optimal response, worry about redistribution effects from the issuance of fiduciary media, and claim a changing money supply complicates economic calculation. Accepting their view that the contraction in output is an optimal response to an exogenous change in money demand, we still find a potentially beneficial role for monetary policy (under central banking) or fractional reserve note issue (under free banking). We show that even if all prices were perfectly flexible, changes in the money supply to offset changes in money demand might still be desirable. We point out several errors and mischaracterizations in their article, justify our decision to disregard wealth transfers, and discuss how a flexible money supply might facilitate economic calculation.

B53|Radical scholarship taking on the mainstream: Murray Rothbard’s contribution|Does one have to make a choice between ideological purity and success as an economist? Many free-market economists believe that one has to choose one or the other. Murray Rothbard (1926–1995) held views on economics and government far outside the accepted mainstream. Nevertheless he was extremely prolific in both mainstream and non-mainstream outlets and his work has influenced many people. This article surveys Rothbard’s contributions to top ranked economics journals and discusses some of the attention his work received in those journals and elsewhere. Rothbard left a bold and uncompromising research program in political economy that has inspired many to follow. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012

In this reply I argue that the differences between Posner and Austrians that Marciano uses as the basis for his contention are normative. If, as Austrians claim, Austrian economics is purely positive, those differences are irrelevant to the appropriate foundations for an Austrian law and economics. They pose no problem for a Posnerian founding. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012
B53|In Defense of the Euro: Austrian School Approach (Critics of ECB Errors and Brussel’s Interventionism)|The mechanism of euro functioning is analyzed in the article from the standpoint of limiting the autonomy of monetary authorities of the European monetary union members, which precludes them from manipulating national currency for the short sighted political interests and postponing painful structural reforms under crises aimed at liberalizing the economy. In some aspects euro excels the classical gold standard, which fell under monetary nationalism attack in the 1930s. Motives and arguments of critics and adversaries are analyzed and the reasons for euro defense are exposed. Real economic and social problems of Europe and ECB errors are described.

B53|Financial Crises and Monetary Policy Interventions in the View of the Austrian School|In our attempt to understand the causes and consequences of the most critical international financial crisis of the 21st century which, besides crushing world economies, questioned the bases of the mainstream economic theories, we focused our attention on the solutions provided by the Austrian School’s representatives (in doing that we have nevertheless tried to avoid prejudices). According to them, the reckless policy of artificial credit expansion promoted by the monetary authorities represents the major cause of the economic and financial crises as well as of recurrent recessions. Our study aims to provide an enumeration (of course, not an exhaustive one) of the causes of the financial crises, from the Austrian School perspective, but also draws attention to the inevitable political and social consequences of the interventionist policy in the economy, in general, and in the banking system, in particular.
