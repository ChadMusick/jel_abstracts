Z32|Tourism and insecurity in the world|The study assesses the role of forces of law and order in modulating the insecurity-tourism nexus in 163 countries for the period 2010 to 2015. Policy syndromes or insecurity dynamics include: violent crime, access to weapons, political instability and perception of criminality while the policy variables of forces of law and order are captured with â€œsecurity officers & policeâ€ and â€œarmed service personnelâ€ . The empirical evidence is based on Negative Binomial regressions. The findings show that the policy variables can be effectively used to crowd-out the negative incidence of policy syndromes on tourist arrivals. The results are contingent on net effects (from conditional and unconditional effects), insecurity dynamics and thresholds. A threshold is an inflexion point at which the unfavorable unconditional effect from a policy syndrome of insecurity on tourist arrivals is completely neutralized by policy variables of forces of law and order. Policy implications are discussed.
Z32|Global Tourism and Waves of Terror: Perspectives from Military Expenditure|This study complements existing literature by investigating how military expenditure can modulate the effect of terrorism externalities on tourism. The geographical and temporal scopes are 163 countries and the period 2010-2015. The empirical evidence is based on negative binomial regressions. Terrorism externalities are measured in terms of terror-related incidents, injuries, fatalities and damaged properties. We find that military expenditure significantly lessens the destructive impact of these terror-related incidents in order to induce positive net effects on tourism. This finding is robust to all measurements of terrorism. Homicides and violent demonstrations reduce tourists’ arrivals whereas the rate of incarceration of convicted offenders has the opposite effect. The analysis is extended to income levels and regions in order to provide more opportunities for policy implications. Justifications for differences in these comparative tendencies are discussed.
Z32|Llegadas de turistas internacionales a Colombia durante 2001-2017: evolución, características y determinantes|En este documento se estudian las llegadas de turistas internacionales a Colombia. Se identifica el origen geográfico de los viajeros y se dividen en dos subgrupos: los colombianos residentes en el exterior y los extranjeros. Se encuentra que los arribos de turistas internacionales: i) se concentran en 20 países emisores, ii) se componen, mayoritariamente, de colombianos no residentes, iii) se aceleraron en los últimos 5 años debido al incremento notable de las llegadas de extranjeros, y iv) explican la dinámica de los ingresos externos por viajes. Se estiman ecuaciones de gravedad con modelos de datos panel para el periodo 2001- 2017, hallando que las llegadas dependen positivamente del tamaño de la economía de los países emisores de turistas, del volumen de comercio, de la población colombiana residente en el exterior y de la infraestructura en los establecimientos de alojamiento, y negativamente de la distancia hasta Colombia y de la percepción de inseguridad interna. Además, se encuentra que los determinantes de las llegadas son diferentes entre los colombianos no residentes y los extranjeros. **** ABSTRACT: We study international tourist arrivals to Colombia. We identify the travelers’ geographical origin and divide them into two subgroups: Colombians living abroad and foreigners. We find that the inflows of international tourists: i) are concentrated in 20 emitting countries, ii) are composed mostly of Colombians living abroad, iii) accelerated in the last 5 years due to the remarkable increase in foreigners’ arrivals, and iv) explain the evolution of international travel receipts. We estimate gravity equations using panel data models for the period 2001-2017, finding that arrivals depend positively on the size of the economy of emitting countries, the volume of trade, the Colombian population living abroad and the infrastructure in hotels and accommodation establishments, and negatively on the distance to Colombia and on the perception of internal security. In addition, we find that the determinants of arrivals are different for Colombians living abroad and foreigners.
Z32|Tourist arrivals, energy consumption and pollutant emissions in a developing economy–implications for sustainable tourism|Sustainable tourism management policies should aim at maximising economic benefits from tourist arrivals while minimizing associated adverse impacts on the environment. This study assesses the short-run and long-run relationships between tourist arrivals, per capita economic output, emissions, energy consumption and capital formation, citing Nepal as a specific case study. We developed four hypotheses and tested them using time-series econometrics based on the autoregressive distributed lag model and Granger causality tests. The results provide strong evidence of an economy driven tourism sector where expansion in economic output leads to expansion in tourist arrivals. More tourist arrivals, in turn, generate positive impacts on gross capital formation. Energy consumption negatively affects tourist arrivals, calling for increased attention towards improving energy efficiency and energy diversity. We conclude that national policies to increase tourist arrivals should be integrated with national energy and environmental policies in order to facilitate the transition towards a sustainable tourism sector.
Z32|Tourism and insecurity in the world|The study assesses the role of forces of law and order in modulating the insecurity-tourism nexus in 163 countries for the period 2010 to 2015. Policy syndromes or insecurity dynamics include: violent crime, access to weapons, political instability and perception of criminality while the policy variables of forces of law and order are captured with “security officers & police” and “armed service personnel”. The empirical evidence is based on Negative Binomial regressions. The findings show that the policy variables can be effectively used to crowd-out the negative incidence of policy syndromes on tourist arrivals. The results are contingent on net effects (from conditional and unconditional effects), insecurity dynamics and thresholds. A threshold is an inflexion point at which the unfavorable unconditional effect from a policy syndrome of insecurity on tourist arrivals is completely neutralized by policy variables of forces of law and order. Policy implications are discussed.
Z32|Global Tourism and Waves of Terror: Perspectives from Military Expenditure|This study complements existing literature by investigating how military expenditure can modulate the effect of terrorism externalities on tourism. The geographical and temporal scopes are 163 countries and the period 2010-2015. The empirical evidence is based on negative binomial regressions. Terrorism externalities are measured in terms of terror-related incidents, injuries, fatalities and damaged properties. We find that military expenditure significantly lessens the destructive impact of these terror-related incidents in order to induce positive net effects on tourism. This finding is robust to all measurements of terrorism. Homicides and violent demonstrations reduce touristsâ€™ arrivals whereas the rate of incarceration of convicted offenders has the opposite effect. The analysis is extended to income levels and regions in order to provide more opportunities for policy implications. Justifications for differences in these comparative tendencies are discussed.
Z32|A Substantial Discount on Ski Passes: A Synthetic Control Analysis|The synthetic control method serves as an appropriate and promising approach to do quantitative comparison research. However, the method is rarely used in the context of tourism. We fill this research gap by applying the method to the case of a Swiss mountain destination. Alpine tourist destinations have suffered from a declining demand in the last decade. Fewer tourist visit ski resorts. Consequently, the tourism industry in these destinations is under pressure to seek for solutions to face this falling demand. Saas-Fee, a Swiss mountain destination particularly hard hit by the decline of visitors has come up with an innovative offer: A substantial price discount on ski passes. In this present study, we aim to estimate the causal effect of the price discount in Saas-Fee. We adopt the synthetic control method to analyze the impact of the destinations’ policy on tourism demand. Further, we perform placebo tests on all units in our donor pool to evaluate the significance our results. Finally, we show how to assess the assumptions of the synthetic control method in the context of tourism.
Z32|The impact of Airbnb on residential property values and rents: evidence from Portugal|Short-term rentals have facilitated the upraise trend in tourism growth in several cities around the world. However, concerns for the negative effects that such home-sharing platforms may have on the housing market and traditional markets have driven community groups and housing advocates to intensely react against them. Whether or not shortterm rentals increase housing prices and rents for local residents is an empirical question. We quantify the causal effects of Airbnb's short-term rentals on urban housing affordability in Portugal by estimating quarterly housing rents and prices as a function of Airbnb concentration. We take advantage of the 2014 regulatory reform and employ a difference-in-differences (DiD) empirical strategy. We estimate an overall increase in property values of 34% and 10.9% for rents due to the short-term lease regulatory reform. We also find that these effects are particularly localized to the historical centers and areas attractive to tourists in the cities of Lisbon and Porto. A better understanding of the effects of shortterm home rentals on housing markets and of the magnitude of its impact on residential property prices and rents are crucial information to determine whether it needs to be regulated and how proper regulation should be designed.

Z32|Mitigating externalities of terrorism on tourism: global evidence from police, security officers and armed service personnel|In this paper, we investigate the role of security officers, the police and armed service personnel in dampening the effect of terrorism externalities on tourist arrivals. The temporal and geographic scopes are respectively 2010-2015 and 163 countries. Four terrorism measurements are used. They include the number of: incidents, injuries, fatalities and property damages. The main findings indicate that armed service personnel can effectively be used to modulate the damaging influence of all four terrorism externalities in order to achieve a positive net effect on tourist arrivals. Conversely, the corresponding moderating role of security officers and the police is not statistically significant. Moreover, violent demonstrations and homicides have a harmful effect on tourist arrivals while the number of incarcerations displays the opposite effect. Policy implications are discussed.
Z32|Contemporary Drivers of Global Tourism: Evidence from Terrorism and Peace Factors|This study examines the effect of terrorism and peace on tourist destination arrivals using a panel of 163 countries with data for the period 2010 to 2015. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments and Negative Binomial (NB) regressions. Our best estimators are from NB regressions from which the following main findings are established. First, political instability, violent demonstrations and number of homicides negatively affect tourist arrivals while the number of incarcerations positively influences the outcome variable. Second the effects from military expenditure, “armed service personnel” and “security officers and polices” are not positively significant. Managerial implications are discussed.
Z32|Tourism and social media in the world: An empirical investigation|The study examines the relationship between tourism and social media from a cross section of 138 countries with data for the year 2012.The empirical evidence is based on Ordinary Least Squares, Negative Binomial and Quantile regressions. Two main findings are established. First, there is a positive relationship between Facebook penetration and the number of tourist arrivals. Second, Facebook penetration is more relevant in promoting tourist arrivals in countries where initial levels in tourist arrivals are the highest and low. The established positive relationship can be elucidated from four principal angles: the transformation of travel research, the rise in social sharing, improvements in customer service and the reshaping of travel agencies. This study explores a new dataset on social media. There are very few empirical studies on the relevance of social media in development outcomes.

Z32|Tourism, amenities, and welfare in an urban setting|Using data on Italian cities, we document that over the period of 2001–2011, the number of establishments and employment in some key service industries are positively related to the inflow of tourists. We then build a general equilibrium model of small open cities encompassing these empirical features to study the impact of tourism on endogenous consumption amenities, factors’ allocation across sectors, prices, and welfare. We also study the interplay of exogenous historical amenities, tourism, and residents welfare in a system of two cities. When residents are immobile, they are unambiguously better off when they live in a city with richer historical amenities, and thus more tourists, than the other city. When residents are mobile and their welfare is equalized between cities, the strength of consumption amenities becomes crucial to determine whether they are better off living in an urban system where cities are heterogeneous or similar in terms of historical amenities.
Z32|Risk Spillovers in Returns for Chinese and International Tourists to Taiwan|Fluctuations in the numbers of visitors directly affect the rates of return on tourism business activities. Therefore, maintaining a firm grasp of the relationship between the changes in the numbers of Chinese tourists and international travellers visiting Taiwan is conducive to the formulation of an effective and practical tourism strategy. Although the topic of international visitors to Taiwan is important, existing research has discussed the issue of the travel demand between Chinese tourists and international travellers visiting Taiwan. This paper is the first to examine the spillover effects between the rate of change in the numbers of Chinese tourist arrivals and the rate of change in the numbers of international traveller arrivals. Using daily data for Chinese tourists and international travellers visiting Taiwan over the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 October 2016, together with the Diagonal BEKK model, the paper analyses the co-volatility spillover effects between the rate of change in the numbers of international travellers and the rate of change in the numbers of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan. The empirical results show that there is no dependency relationship between the rate of change in the numbers of Chinese tourists and the rate of change in the numbers of international travellers visiting Taiwan. However, there is a significant negative co-volatility spillover effect between the rate of change in the numbers of Chinese tourists and the rate of change in the numbers of international travellers. The empirical findings suggest that Taiwan should abandon its development strategy of focusing only on a single market, namely China, and to be pro-active in encouraging visits by international travellers to Taiwan for sightseeing purposes, thereby increasing the willingness of international travellers to visit Taiwan. Moreover, with the reduction in the numbers of Chinese tour groups visiting Taiwan, and increases in the numbers of individual travellers, the Taiwan Government should change its previous travel policies of mainly attracting Chinese tour group travellers and actively promoting in-depth tourism among international tourists, by developing tourism that focuses on the special characteristics of different localities. In this way, the government can enhance the quality of Taiwan’s tourism, and also attract travellers with high spending power.
Z32|Asymmetric Risk Impacts of Chinese Tourists to Taiwan|Consider using the simple moving average (MA) rule of Gartley (1935) to determine when to buy stocks, and when to sell them and switch to the risk-free rate. In comparison, how might the performance be affected if the frequency is changed to the use of MA calculations? The empirical results show that, on average, the lower is the frequency, the higher are average daily returns, even though the volatility is virtually unchanged when the frequency is lower. The volatility from the highest to the lowest frequency is about 30% lower as compared with the buy-and-hold strategy volatility, but the average returns approach the buy-and-hold returns when frequency is lower. The 30% reduction in volatility appears if we invest randomly half the time in stock markets and half in the risk-free rate.
Z32|Awareness of Tourism Products and Tourist Satisfaction: A Case of Indonesia|Objective - The Jember District has a very exotic beach tour of Papuma Beach, which shows its white sand and provides historical tours of the Cave of Japan. Papuma Beach is ranked number 1 of the 10 most beautiful beaches in the Jember District. This research aims to understand the influence of tourism product components on the satisfaction of tourists. The components of tourism products in this study include attractiveness, facilities, and accessibility. Methodology/Technique - This research is a quantitative study with a population of tourists visiting Papuma beaches. The number of samples in this study amounted to 40 samples. The data is analysed using a multiple regression analysis with the SPSS program. Findings - The results of the study show that the influence of tourist attractions and facilities on the satisfaction of tourists at the Papuma Beach Tour in the Jember District is strong. Novelty - However, the accessibility variable has no significant effect on satisfaction.
Z32|The Contribution of Tourist Attraction, Accessibility and Amenities in Creating Tourist Loyalty in Indonesia|Objective - The Pulau Merah Beach is the most beautiful beach and enjoys number one ranking from the other seven beaches. The unique beach of Pulau Merah in Banyuwangi is so popular among the people of East Java, it is also one of the destinations favored by foreign tourists, particularly for surfing. The Pulau Merah Beach is uniquely placed in a small hill located close to the shoreline. The Pulau Merah beach has a 200-meter-high hill and this reddish color causes the beach to be known as the Pulau Merah Beach. This study aims to determine the partial and simultaneous effects of tourist attraction, accessibility, and amenities on tourist loyalty on the Pulau Merah beaches. Methodology/Technique - This research is a quantitative study. The sample includes 80 tourists visiting Pulau Merah Beach. The data is analyzed using a multiple regression analysis with the SPSS Program. Findings - The results of the study show that tourist attraction, accessibility, and amenities have a significant, partial and simultaneous effect on tourist loyalty. Novelty - Attractiveness, accessibility, and amenities have a significant influence on the satisfaction of tourists.
Z32|Cabo Verde Transition Finance Country Pilot|A transition finance country pilot was initiated by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) in partnership with the government of Cabo Verde. The study aims to capture the challenges facing Cabo Verde following graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) to Lower Middle Income Category (LMIC), including the shifting financing for sustainable development landscape, the mounting risk of debt distress and the economic and environmental vulnerabilities as a Small Island Developing States (SIDS). In line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA), the pilot study proposes a new “ABC” approach targeted to assess all available sources of financing (ODA, OOF, private investment, domestic resources, and remittances), identify emerging SDG financing gaps and promote better alignment of resources with national financing for sustainable development strategies.

Z32|Asymmetric Risk Impacts of Chinese Tourists to Taiwan|Since 2008, when Taiwan’s President Ma Ying-Jeou relaxed the Cross-Strait policy, China has become Taiwan’s largest source of international tourism. In order to understand the risk persistence of Chinese tourists, the paper investigates the short-run and long-run persistence of shocks to the change rate of Chinese tourists to Taiwan. The daily data used for the empirical analysis is from 1 January 2013 to 28 February 2018. McAleer’s (2015) fundamental equation in tourism finance is used to link the change rate of tourist arrivals and the change in tourist revenues. Three widely-used univariate conditional volatility models, namely GARCH(1,1), GJR(1,1) and EGARCH(1,1), are used to measure the short-run and long-run persistence of shocks, as well as symmetric, asymmetric and leverage effects. Three different Heterogeneous AutoRegressive (HAR) models, HAR(1), HAR(1,7) HAR(1,7,28), are considered as alternative mean equations for capturing a variety of long memory effects. The mean equations associated with GARCH(1,1), GJR(1,1) and EGARCH(1,1) are used to analyse the risk persistence of the change in Chinese tourists. The exponential smoothing process is used to adjust the seasonality around the trend in Chinese tourists. The empirical results show asymmetric impacts of positive and negative shocks on the volatility of the change in the number of Group-type and Medical-type tourists, while Individual-type tourists display a symmetric volatility pattern. Somewhat unusually, leverage effects are observed in EGARCH for Medical-type tourists, which shows a negative correlation between shocks in tourist numbers and the subsequent shocks to volatility. For both Group-type and Medical-type tourists, the asymmetric impacts on volatility show that negative shocks have larger effects than do positive shocks. The leverage effect in EGARCH for Medical-type tourists implies that larger shocks would decrease volatility in the change in the numbers of Medical-type tourists. These results suggest that Taiwan tourism authorities should act to prevent the negative shocks for the Group-type and Medicaltype Chinese tourists to dampen the shocks that arise from having fewer Chinese tourists to Taiwan.
Z32|Visiting friends and relatives tourism: the case of Uruguay|In this paper, we analyze Uruguayans living abroad that visit Uruguay for their holidays, what in the literature is called Nostalgic tourism or Visiting friends and relatives (VFR) tourism. Several studies point Uruguay as one of the South American countries with the largest proportion of its population living abroad. In addition, tourism is a very important economic activity in Uruguay. Visitors from Argentina have been always the majority in the Uruguayan inbound tourism. During 2017 in Uruguay 68% of total tourists were Argentinians, 12,5% Brazilians, and 8% VFR tourists. This last share was near 16% during the first decade of this century and even higher in the XXth. century. We analyze and estimate the VFR tourism demand in Uruguay, and compare it with Argentinian tourist demand, since the majority of VFR tourists live in Argentina (64%). After characterizing VFR tourists, we apply Johansen methodology and built four models: two for VFR tourism and two for Argentinian tourism, considering monthly data for the number of tourists and quarterly data for tourists expenditure. Applying Johansen methodology, we found at least one Vector error-correction model (VEC) equation for each model considered. In the first two models (taking into account the number of tourists), the elasticities (income and prices) were smaller for VFR tourists compared with Argentinian tourists, meaning that the number of VFR tourists react less to changes in income or relative prices than Argentinians. But in the case of tourists expenditure, the result was the opposite, with VFR tourists responding more to changes in prices or income than Argentinians. Impulse response functions show a greater reaction of Argentinian tourists to changes in relative prices, but similar in the case of an income shock. Finally, forecasts show a good adjust of the forecast to actual data.

Z32|Wirtschaftliche Perspektiven für Kroatien|This publication is available in German language only. For a brief English summary see further below. Eine Analyse der kroatischen Wirtschaft und abgeleitete Politikempfehlungen auf nationaler und EU-Ebene Ziel der Studie ist die Ausarbeitung von Politikempfehlungen, die dabei helfen sollen, die kroatische Wirtschaft positiv zu stimulieren und der Bevölkerung im Land eine langfristige Perspektive zu geben. Dabei soll insbesondere analysiert werden, welchen Beitrag Österreich und die EU zur Abfederung etwaiger Effekte auf den kroatischen und österreichischen Arbeitsmarkt leisten können, die bei Auslaufen der Übergangsregelungen für die Beschäftigung von kroatischen Arbeitskräften in Österreich, die bis längstens 30.06.2020 in Anspruch genommen werden können, zu erwarten sind. English Summary Economic Prospects for Croatia An Analysis of the Croatian Economy and Resulting Policy Recommendations at National and EU Level The aim of the study is to develop policy recommendations that are supportive of providing a positive stimulus to the Croatian economy and offering a long-term perspective to the population in the country. In particular, it is analysed which contributions Austria and the EU can make to mitigate potential negative effects that may arise upon the expiration (by 30 June 2020 at the latest) of the transitional arrangements for employing Croatian citizens in Austria.
Z32|The Impact of Foreign Participation in Outdoor Tourism Activities on Job Creation|We test whether foreign tourists in outdoor activities have contributed to job creation in Northern Portugal in 2006-2014. This is the very first study in Portugal that focus on the impact of foreign participation in outdoor activities on job creation, being innovative in this regard. Based on data from 4 sources, we employ OLS to regress the employment changes on the number of new firms, turnover, the share of foreigners in outdoor tourism activities, and on labour productivity. Results indicate a negative but not statistically significant impact. This result may imply that the higher foreign participation in outdoor tourism activities the lesser the number of employees in those firms. However, since results are non-significant they suggest the need of further empirical investigation.
Z32|Forecasting Tourist Arrivals with Google Trends and Mixed Frequency Data|In this paper, we examine the usefulness of Google Trends data in predicting monthly tourist arrivals and overnight stays in Prague during the period between January 2010 and December 2016. We offer two contributions. First, we analyze whether Google Trends provides significant forecasting improvements over models without search data. Second, we assess whether a high-frequency variable (weekly Google Trends) is more useful for accurate forecasting than a low-frequency variable (monthly tourist arrivals) using Mixed-data sampling (MIDAS). Our results stress the potential of Google Trends to offer more accurate prediction in the context of tourism: we find that Google Trends information, both two months and one week ahead of arrivals, is useful for predicting the actual number of tourist arrivals. The MIDAS forecasting model that employs weekly Google Trends data outperforms models using monthly Google Trends data and models without Google Trends data.
Z32|“What really matters is the economic performance: Positioning tourist destinations by means of perceptual maps|The present study aims to cluster the world's main tourist destinations according to the growth of the economic performance of the tourist activity and of the tourist and economic development experienced during the last decade. With this objective, we combine the information from a set of tourist and economic indicators for the main 45 tourist destinations over the period between 2000 and 2010. Destinations are ranked with respect to their average growth rate over the sample period. By assigning a numerical value to each country corresponding to its position, all the information is summarised into two components (“economic performance of tourist activity” and “tourist and economic development”) via multivariate techniques for dimensionality reduction: multidimensional scaling (MDS) and categorical principal components analysis (CATPCA). By means of perceptual maps, we find that destinations can be clustered into four different groups. The first one, dominated by Western and Northern Europe markets, contains some of the top destinations (France, Spain and the United States). A second one, with a predominance of Mediterranean destinations (Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Israel), obtains high scores in both dimensions. In the third one, we find Cambodia and China, alongside Egypt and Turkey. Finally, a fourth group dominated by Eastern Europe destinations (Bulgaria, Croatia and Latvia) with low scores in both dimensions.
Z32|Spatial-economic impacts of tourism on regional development: challenges for Europe|Despite the increasing socio-economic importance of tourism, in particular in the European context, a set of recent studies involving a large number of European regions has led to the identification of important problems related to the sustainable use of natural resources, innovation dynamics and specialization patterns, impacts of tourism on regional economic growth, and the relations between tourism performance and regional sustainable development in Europe. Taking these questions as a starting point, the purpose of this review article is to propose a conceptual framework for their analysis, including concepts like authenticity, place, smart tourism, co-creation of destinations and experiences, information segmentation, differentiation of supply, life cycle of tourism destinations, path dependence, customer variety, specialization or integrative diversification of tourism products. Finally, this analytical framework is used in order to identify and discuss a set of challenges for the future of tourism in European regions, with a view to policy and managerial implications, oriented to the integration of tourism policies within a broader context of socio-economic development, with implications on the definition and implementation of innovation and regional development policies, including smart specialization strategies. These challenges relate to the touristic experience (memorable, personalized and authentic), innovation (in the context of a diverse economy) and participatory governance (communities sharing spaces and places).
Z32|Peace is much more than doves: The economic benefits of bird-based tourism as a result of the peace treaty in Colombia|Colombia has the greatest bird diversity of any country in the world, with approximately 1900 recorded species, equivalent to 20% of all bird species worldwide. Advances made by the Colombian government to achieve greater security within the country – putting an end to the long-standing armed conflict – and to promote ecotourism can help position Colombia as one of the most important bird watching destinations worldwide. This study estimates the economic benefits from bird-based tourism in post-war Colombia. In particular, we estimate the value that members of the US-based National Audubon Society place on a birding tour that includes the participation of local communities (some of whom were victims of the armed conflict), and visits to important areas for bird watching that are increasingly accessible. The study also approximates the demand for international bird watching tourism to the country. Through the application of the contingent valuation method, we show that birding enthusiasts would be willing to pay, on average, an additional $58 per person per day for a tour in Colombia, as compared to a similar tour in terms of duration and services in Costa Rica, currently one of the main tourism destinations for birdwatchers. Our analysis indicates that a total of 278,850 North American bird watchers would be interested in visiting the country, generating an annual profit of $9 million and 7516 new jobs. In addition to confirming demand for bird-based travel, the study provides information about potential visitors’ preferences, which can help guide the development of a strategy to promote bird-based tourism to Colombia.
Z32|Has cultural heritage monetary value an impact on visits? An assessment using Italian official data|In this paper we try to investigate which factors affect the visits to Cultural Heritage (CH), using Italy as a case study. We adopt a broad definition of CH including archaeological and historical sites, historical buildings and, also, museums, focusing our attention on State CH. In our empirical analysis we use a rather innovative indicator of CH value, i.e. the monetary value of State CH, officially provided by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Using these data, this paper aims at evaluating if such monetary value has a significant role in stimulating visits to cultural sites for the years 1996-2010. We also control for other factors potentially affecting the number of visits to cultural sites, such as alternative tourist attractors and the regional performance in the tourism sector. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to investigate the effect of CH monetary value on cultural participation.
Z32|Service Quality as an Antecedent of Brand Equity: Empirical Evidence in the Medical Tourism from Jordan|This study aims to investigate the effect of service quality (SQ) on brand equity in medical tourism context. SQ is considered as a critical success element for achieving competitive advantage and building strong medical tourism brands in today’s competitive market, Jordan is included. A brand with strong equity is vital weapon for a medical tourism’s differentiation strategy and development of customer loyalty. In this study, a survey has been distributed to 384 medical tourist’s in Jordan. Only, 306 data are usable and were used for data analysis. The findings of this study showed that the SQ is significantly associated with overall brand equity. Also, each of SQ dimensions that referring to tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, empathy, and assurance are significantly correlated with overall brand equity.
Z32|Event: Strategies of Tourism Development in Primorsky Krai (Russia)|Primorsky Krai with its rich natural tourism potential hasn’t yet found its place in the international market, so event-marketing can help to solve this problem. The impact of mass events may occur as an indirect and direct inclusion in the program of the tour. In this work there are examples of public events in the Primorsky region, which have a significant international impact and, moreover, tend to grow in popularity among tourists. The largest international exercise, which had opened a new page in the development of the Russian Far East was the APEC Summit, which was held in Vladivostok in September 2012.
Z32|Forecasting in a Mixed Up World: Nowcasting Hawaii Tourism|We evaluate the short term forecasting performance of methods that systematically incorporate high frequency information via covariates. Our study provides a thorough introduction of these methods to the tourism literature. We highlight the distinguishing features and limitations of each tool and evaluate their forecasting performance in two tourism-specific applications. The first uses monthly indicators to predict quarterly tourist arrivals to Hawaii; the second predicts quarterly labor income in the accommodations and food services sector. Our results indicate that compared to the exclusive use of low frequency aggregates, including timely intra-period data in the forecasting process results in significant gains in predictive accuracy. Anticipating growing popularity of these techniques among empirical analysts, we present practical implementation guidelines to facilitate their adoption.
Z32|Recent Topical Research on Global, Energy, Health & Medical, and Tourism Economics, and Global Software|The paper presents an overview of recent topical research on global, energy, health & medical, and tourism economics, and global software. We have interpreted “global” in the title of the Journal of Reviews on Global Economics to cover contributions that have a global impact on economics, thereby making it “global economics”. In this sense, the paper is concerned with papers on global, energy, health & medical, and tourism economics, as well as global software algorithms that have global economic impacts. The topics covered include re-opening the Silk Road to transform Chinese trade, education and skill mismatches, education policy for migrant children, code of practice and indicators for quality management of official statistics, projections of energy use and carbon emissions, multi-fuel allocation for power generation using genetic algorithms, optimal active energy loss with feeder routing and renewable energy for smart grid distribution, demand for narcotics with policy implications, access to maternal and child health services of migrant workers, computer technology to improve medical information, heritage tourism, ecotourism impacts on the economy, society and environment, taxi drivers’ cross-cultural communication problems and challenges, hybrid knowledge discovery system based on items and tags, game development platform to improve advanced programming skills, quadratic approximation of the newsvendor problem with imperfect quality, classification of workflow management systems for emails, academic search engine for personalized rankings, creative and learning processes using game-based activities, personal software process with automatic requirements traceability to support start-ups, and comparing statistical and data mining techniques for enrichment ontology with instances.
Z32|Tourism Stocks in Times of Crises: An Econometric Investigation of Unexpected Non-macroeconomic Factors|Following the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, the European media emphatically pronounced that billions of Euros were wiped from tourism related stocks. The theoretical relationship of the industry with such unexpected non-macro incidents received moderate academic coverage. Nevertheless, the quantifiable impact of such events on tourism-specific stock values, both in terms of returns and volatility, is still a barren landscape. Using econometric methodology, the paper investigates the reaction of five hospitality/tourism stock indices to 150 incidents depicting major Acts of Terrorism, ‘Acts of God’, and War conflicts in the 21st Century. Empirical findings underscore the effect of such incidents on hospitality/tourism stock indices, with distinctive differences among the different types, the specificities of each event, and the five regions under investigation. This paper contributes to the extant literature and enhances our conceptual capital pertaining to the industry’s current financial practices that are related to stock performance and behavior.
Z32|Towards a less vulnerable and more sustainable development: heritage tourism in island economies|The relationship between economic specialization in tourism and growth has been extensively explored, both theoretically and empirically. Although results are ambiguous, a general conclusion of nonlinear effects may be drawn. The originality of our work is to suppose the existence of similar nonlinear relationships between specialization in tourism, vulnerability, and sustainability, and to empirically investigate them for island economies. More particularly, beyond certain tourism specialization thresholds, economic growth slows (as shown in the previous studies) while economic vulnerability increases and sustainability decreases (as found in our empirical work). Our analysis is founded on the hypothesis that these thresholds relate to strategic differences in the development of tourism according to the existence and method of mobilizing the heritage resources of insular economies. The level of differentiation of tourist servicesÑevaluated using an indicator of the change in prices charged for tourist services in presence of world heritage sites (UNESCOÕs list) should moderate the impacts of specializing in tourism on vulnerability and sustainability. We built and explored an original dataset for up to 18 island economies during the period 1990-2008, which are systematically compared with up to 108 non-island countries. By using panel regression analysis, we show that the most suitable strategies for a less vulnerable and a more sustainable development, which may be naturally combined based on each islandÕs specificities, would be: high specialization in heritage tourism, low specialization in luxury tourism, high specialization in mass tourism when there is no valuable heritage, and low specialization in mass tourism in presence of world heritage sites. Illustrative case studies are discussed following a proposed typology of island economies based on their specialization in tourism and the differentiation of the services offered to visitors.
Z32|Management Control Systems within Sustainable Ecotourism: A Study of Belitung|"""Objective – This study aims to examine the implementation of ecotourism management control systems in Belitung. The purpose of this is to make the management system more effective and efficient in achieving its targets. Methodology/Technique – Questionnaires were delivered to tourism department officers in Belitung and a direct interview was also conducted with the Regent. The established goals for the development of ecotourism management are defined using the Management Control System ('MCS') framework to effectively and efficiently obtain and utilize resources to achieve those objectives. These goals require targeted congruence, supported by motivated employees, running on formal and informal control mechanisms with the application of risk allocation. Findings – This research shows that management control systems have been applied in the development of inclusive and sustainable ecotourism. However, personal and organizational target congruence shows areas for improvement, particularly with respect to shifting from mining to ecotourism as the the source of economic profitability. Novelty – The Belitung local government has recently amended its policies to focus more heavily on the development of inclusive and sustainable ecotourism. """
Z32|The Effect of Population Socio-Economic Characteristics on Tourism Demand in Serbia: A Survey|The synthesis of various theoretical concepts and empirical research confirms the significance of leisure time and leisure funds as fundamental factors of tourism demand. It also confirms the fact that the correlation between resources and needs shows that all the person's efforts are directed to coordination between their needs and means and that those tourist needs are manifested through the tourist consumption. Therefore, the study is based on the assumption that socio-economic characteristics of population have a great influence on the decision concerning where and how the vacation will be used. Thus, the aim of the research was to determine whether there is and how important is the influence of socio-economic characteristics of the population as independent variables on the scope and direction of movement of tourist demand in the particular case in practice. Based on the conducted research and analysed results, the authors strived to examine the initial hypotheses, that is to provide a statistical correlation between the dependent and independent variables. The results of research confirm the hypothesis that the socio-economic characteristics of working and living conditions of the population have a great impact on the dynamics and scope of tourism demand. According to the defined aim, the theoretical elaboration of the results dominates the study. During the research and results analysis, the following methods were used: T-test, One-Factor Analysis of Variance, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Logistic Regression and Multiple Regression.
Z32|Sustaining nature-based tourism in Iceland|Iceland has been experiencing a tourism boom. The number of tourists visiting annually quadrupled between 2010 and 2016 and shows continued strength. The tourism sector is now the major export earner and is also creating new jobs and supporting new businesses. The government budget has also benefitted from high tax revenues. The surge in tourism supported growth after the crisis and the sector has become a major pillar of the economy. But, the breakneck growth of tourism has created a number of challenges. Growing pains have emerged as accommodation supply has lagged in the wake of unexpectedly large number of tourists, contributing to pressure on the local housing market. The environment, particularly in some popular sites, has also come under pressure. The government has reacted to these environmental and social impacts and has worked with the industry to agree on a path forward. Sustaining a nature-based tourism for Iceland will require more coordinated policy across government and a long-term strategic plan that builds on Iceland's strengths. Protecting the unique environmental attractions of Iceland - while mitigating adverse social impacts - will lay the basis for the healthy development of a new important sector. This working paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of Iceland (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-iceland.htm).
Z32|Tourism and regional development: a spatial econometric model for Portugal at municipal level|This study examines the importance of tourism as a factor for regional economic development in Mainland Portugal, emphasizing the inter-regional spatial spillover effects. A spatial analysis of the main variables of the tourism sector revealed strong evidence of positive spatial autocorrelation across the municipalities of Portugal. A significant spatial clustering of these activities on coastal location was identified, leading to the formation of hot spots in coastal regions and cold spots in inland regions. Furthermore, this work specifies spatial econometric models aiming to estimate the relevance of the tourism sector in regional economic development, on a municipal level. The results show that tourism is a significant driver of regional economic development. Moreover, they revealed the presence of positive and significant inter-regional spillover effects, which strongly enhance tourism’s economic impact.
Z32|Puerto Rico: Continuing Socio-Economic Deterioration and the Need for Change|The long-run decline of the Puerto Rican economy, predating the recession of the last decade, is evident in the relative stagnation that emerged from 1980 onward. The roots of both the relative stagnation and the long recession lie in the political status of the island. The option of statehood, however, can be the foundation for a new era of economic expansion. The long-lasting economic problems of Puerto Rico are evidenced by several measures: the low rate of economic growth, the high unemployment rate and the low labor force participation rate, the falling investment rate, the high poverty level, the extreme degree of economic inequality, and the massive exodus to the states. And, of course, there is the very high—crisis level—amount of public debt. In addition and of central importance, the poor treatment of Puerto Rico relative to the states by the U.S. government has contributed to the economic situation on the island and demonstrates the role of status in bringing about economic weakness and decline. The popular belief that Puerto Rico receives “generous” treatment from Washington is belied by the data. Moreover, while many observers viewed Puerto Rico as an economic success story during the late 1900s, this view erred in measuring success by the growth of GDP instead of GNP, the former including the profits of firms based off the island (mainly in the U.S.) and not providing a measure of economic conditions of Puerto Rican people of firms. The detrimental impact of Puerto Rico’s political status as a U.S. territory—or, if one prefers, a U.S colony—shows up clearly in the unequal treatment of Puerto Rico relative to the states in certain important federal programs. For example, Puerto Ricans have not been eligible for the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and only partially eligible for the Child Tax Credit (CTC). A Puerto Rican family with two parents and two children and with earnings of $25,000 would have had a net income in 2011 of $23,587 after all federal taxes. It would not receive the EITC and CTC. An identical family in the states with earnings of $25,000, after all federal taxes and the EITC and CTC would have a net income of $30,013—$6,426 more than the Puerto Rican family. Beyond these vary tangible negative impacts of the current status, and more fundamental, is the broad economic dependency of Puerto Rico. This dependency has led to an underdevelopment of Puerto Rican based economic activity and to government policies that have always looked outward for special favors from Washington and investment from abroad. The results show up in an excessive reliance on manufacturing and a failure to develop economic activity in areas where Puerto Rico has clear advantages—e.g., tourism and specialized business services linking the states to Latin America. The results of dependency also have included a weak and distorted financial sector and a failure to invest sufficiently in infrastructure, education, and science.
Z32|Puerto Rico’s Economic Debacle: Correctly Blame Washington|The dire economic situation has been widely recognized. As it has become apparent that the Puerto Rican government will not—indeed, cannot—meet its debt obligations, the situation has received considerable attention in the U.S. Congress and media. Most of the discussion explains the crisis as the result of irresponsible actions by the Puerto Rican government. While such irresponsible actions have certainly played an important role, ultimate responsibility for Puerto Rico’s economic decline lies in Washington. This federal government responsibility is formally stated in the U.S. Constitution, where territories are declared to be “property” of the United States and Congress has the authority to “make all needful Rules and Regulations” concerning territories. Moreover, the policies toward Puerto Rico established by the federal government have generated a dependence that has been at the root of the island’s economic debacle. While many people, politicians and economists in the states, believe that Puerto Rico has been treated “generously” by federal programs, this view is belied by the data.
Z32|Should The U.S. Government Do More? Why Puerto Rico’s Economic Conditions Matters To the United States|In 2016, the federal government established the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) to deal with the Puerto Rican economic crisis. However, PROMESA did not provide substantial and direct support for the island’s economy—i.e., no funds. Should the U.S. government do more? Puerto Rico has an economy larger than several states, and it has a substantial level of trade with the states. Thus, the states have an economic interest in the well-being of Puerto Rico. Aside from narrow economic interests, the federal government has a responsibility to protect its people, whether danger comes from crime, disease, severe weather, or economic collapse. Puerto Ricans, as U.S. citizens, deserve the same protection as their fellow citizens in the states. In terms of human rights, the de facto colonial status of Puerto Rico is in conflict with avowed principles of the U.S. government and has resulted in relatively poor treatment by the federal government. There are several actions that the U.S. government could take to do more for Puerto Rico; for example, including Puerto Rico in federal programs in the same manner as the states are included and providing U.S. Treasury guarantees for new Puerto Rican bonds, which would supply funds to catalyze a new era of economic growth.
Z32|Making Puerto Rico A State: A Win-Win Opportunity|Since Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain to the United States at the end of the Spanish-American War, the status of Puerto Rico has been adjusted at various times and has continually been an issue of controversy. In recent decades, the controversy has focused on whether Puerto Rico should become a state, remain in its current territorial status, or become an independent nation. This paper explains how Puerto Rico’s territorial status has created a condition of dependency, doing substantial harm to the island’s economic condition. The period of successful economic growth in decades immediately following World War II created some rapid economic growth, but firmly established the era of dependence that has been so economically detrimental. Thus the current status has to be rejected as a basis for long-run economic success in Puerto Rico. Statehood, in particular, holds out the likelihood of gains for both the United States and Puerto Rico, a win-win situation. The Puerto Rican people have increasingly come to favor the statehood option. With a recognition of the opportunity for a win-win outcome, the foundation for a move to statehood would be established.
