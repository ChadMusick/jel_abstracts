H87|Revenue Implications of Destination-Based Cash-Flow Taxation|We estimate the revenue implications of a Destination Based Cash Flow Tax (DBCFT) for 80 countries. On a global average, DBCFT revenues under unchanged tax rates would remain similar to the existing corporate income tax (CIT) revenue, but with sizable redistribution of revenue across countries. Countries are more likely to gain revenue if they have trade deficits, are not reliant on the resource sector, and/or—perhaps surprisingly—are developing economies. DBCFT revenues tend to be more volatile than CIT revenues. Moreover, we consider the revenue losses resulting from spillovers in case of unilateral implementation of a DBCFT. Results suggest that these spillover effects are sizeable if the adopting country is large and globally integrated. These spillovers generate strong revenue-based incentives for many—but not all—other countries to follow the DBCFT adoption.
H87|Kant-Nash tax competition|In a two-country economy we analyze how tax competition differs from the standard all-Nashian tax competition, if one or both countries are Kantians in Roemer’s sense. Kantians are shown to choose a higher tax rate than Nashians for any given tax rate of the other country, which indicates that they seek to mitigate the (Nashian) race to the bottom. We avoid dealing with multiple equilibria by assuming that capital is sufficiently scarce, and we find for symmetric countries that the all-Kantian tax competition is efficient and that the inefficient race to the bottom is weakened in economies with a Nashian and a Kantian. That confirms the intuitive idea that countries following the Kantian categorical imperative avoid or at least soften the socially undesirable impact of (Nashian) self-interest. We also investigate the incentives of opportunistic countries to choose Nashian or Kantian behavior out of self-interest and find that either both governments choose to behave as Kantians or that - under different conditions - the robust Nashian selfinterest supersedes Kantian moral principles such that the inefficient all-Nashian tax competition results.
H87|Once bitten: new evidence on the link between IMF conditionality and IMF stigma|While the consequences and effectiveness of IMF conditionality have long been the focus of research, the possible negative impact of IMF conditionality on countries’ willingness to ask for an IMF programme – often termed ‘IMF stigma’ – has recently received attention particularly from policy circles. In this paper we investigate how countries' past experience with the IMF and their peers’ experience with the IMF affect their likelihood of entering a subsequent IMF arrangement. Our results indicate that, even when controlling for the success of past programmes, a country is less likely to approach the IMF for help if in the past it experienced an above-average number of disbursement-relevant conditions. We find hardly any impact of peers’ experience, except for Asian countries. JEL Classification: F33, F53, F55, H87
H87|Revenue vs Expenditure Based Fiscal Consolidation: The Pass-Trough from Federal Cuts to Local Taxes|A growing literature emphasizes that the output effect of fiscal consolidation hinges on its composition, as the choice of increasing revenues vs cutting expenditure is not neutral. Existing studies, however, underscore the role of local governments in a federal setting. Indeed, transfer cuts at the central level might translate into higher local taxes, changing the effective composition of the fiscal adjustment. We evaluate this transmission mechanism in Italy, where municipalities below the threshold of 5,000 inhabitants were exempted from (large) transfer cuts in 2012. This allows us to implement a difference-in-discontinuities design in order to estimate the causal impact of transfer cuts on the composition of fiscal adjustment, also because tight fiscal rules impose a balanced budget on Italian municipalities. We disclose a pass-through mechanism by which local governments react to the contraction of intergovernmental grants by mainly increasing taxes rather than reducing spending. From a political economy perspective, this revenue based fiscal consolidation is driven by municipalities with low electoral competition and low party fragmentation.

H87|Intertemporal Evidence on the Strategy of Populism|Do candidates use populism to maximize the impact of political campaigns? Is the supply of populism strategic? We apply automated text analysis to all available 2016 US Presidential campaign speeches and 2018 midterm campaign programs using a continuous index of populism. This novel dataset shows that the use of populist rhetoric is responsive to the level of expected demand for populism in the local audience. In particular, we provide evidence that current U.S. President Donald Trump uses more populist rhetoric in swing states and in locations where economic insecurity is prevalent. These findings were confirmed when the analysis was extended to recent legislative campaigns wherein candidates tended towards populism when campaigning in stiffly competitive districts where constituents are experiencing high levels of economic insecurity. We also show that pandering is more common for candidates who can credibly sustain anti-elite positions, such as those with shorter political careers. Finally, our results suggest that a populist strategy is rewarded by voters since higher levels of populism are associated with higher shares of the vote, precisely in competitive districts where voters are experiencing economic insecurity.

H87|Stock Flow Adjustments in Sovereign Debt Dynamics: The Role of Fiscal Frameworks|We assess, via system GMM, how Stock Flow Adjustments (SFA) affect the debt-to-GDP ratio in 65 countries (covering developed and emerging and low-income countries) between1985-2014. We find that SFAs positively contribute to the change in the debt-to-GDP ratio with a coefficient close to one. The existence of fiscal rules with monitor compliance contributes to lower the debt level. The fall in the debt ratio due to fiscal rules before the crisis was between 1.7%-4.2% of GDP while after the crisis, revenue and debt-based rules did not contribute to the reduction of debt, which was reinforced with large SFAs.
H87|Is a dynamic approach of tax games relevant?|In this paper we argue that static models provide an incomplete analysis of interjurisdictional tax competition. According to Wilson (1987) a static tax competition model might predict the long-run outcomes of government decision making in a dynamic setting. We show that this conjecture is only true when policymakers commit to a tax path at the start of the game without future updates (open-loop behavior), with the proviso that they are time-indifferent and/or capital is perfectly mobile. Static models however never predict future outcomes when policymarkers continuously update their tax rates (Markovian behavior). In particular, we address the following aspects. How do long-run outcomes in a dynamic setting change relative to static games? How does social welfare change accordingly? If policymakers have the choice, which strategical behavior (Markovian or open-loop) should they adopt? In light of this, which one confers the highest social advantage?
H87|The Impact of the CCTB on the Effective Tax Burden of Corporations: results from the Tax Analyzer Model|The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the introduction of the CCTB draft Council Directive from October 2016 on the effective corporate tax burdens in the 28 EU Member States and to assess the relative importance of single elements of the harmonised tax base. Furthermore, the impact of the CCTB introduction is estimated for R&D corporations and the tax effects of the 2016 CCTB draft Council Directive and the original draft Council Directive as of 2011 are compared.
H87|Semi-endogenous growth models with domestic and foreign private and public R&D linked to VECMs|We present semi-endogenous growth models with total-factor productivity as functions of domestic and foreign private and public R&D. In a small country case with a Cobb-Douglas TFP production function, foreign R&D drives steady-state growth and the production function can be a long-term relation in a vector-error-correction model. Marginal productivity conditions can be long-term relations for a vector-error-correction model if the functional form is of a Cobb-Douglas type or a CES function generalised to a VES function. In case of a VES function, steady states exist only for special cases of parameter restrictions.
H87|A Viable International Tax-Order for Cross-Border Pensions|There is strong evidence that the existing pattern of cross-border pension taxation in OECD countries and beyond is extremely diverse and inconsistent and thus generates a double equity dilemma for individuals and countries alike. We argue that this dilemma cannot be solved within the current double-taxation treaty network and therefore propose a new conceptual framework for the taxation of old-age pensions in a world of high and increasing cross-border mobility of workers and pensioners. We demonstrate that a coordinated move to a front-loaded pension tax system and exclusive source taxation would pave the way for an international pension tax order which eliminates the double equity dilemma. As an additional innovative element of front-loaded pension taxation we discuss the decoupling of individual tax assessment and tax payment which may prove helpful by smoothing transitional effects when the front-loaded pension tax system is introduced.
H87|Fiscal competition and public debt|This paper explores the implications of high indebtedness for strategic tax setting when capital markets are integrated. When public borrowing is constrained due to sovereign default or by a binding fiscal rule, a rise in a country's initial debt level lowers investment in public infrastructure and makes tax setting more aggressive in that jurisdiction, while the opposite occurs elsewhere. On net a jurisdiction with higher initial debt becomes a less attractive location. Our analysis is inspired by fiscal responses in severely hit countries after the economic and financial crisis which are consistent with the theoretical predictions. We find a similar pattern on the sub-national level using administrative data from the universe of German municipalities.
H87|The Missing Profits of Nations|By exploiting new macroeconomic data known as foreign affiliates statistics, we show that foreign firms are an order of magnitude more profitable than local firms in tax havens, but less profitable than local firms in other countries. Leveraging this differential profitability, we estimate that close to 40% of multinational profits are shifted to tax havens globally each year. The non-haven European Union countries appear to be the main losers from this shifting. We show theoretically and empirically that in the current international tax system, tax authorities of high-tax countries do not have incentives to combat profit shifting to tax havens. They instead focus their enforcement effort on relocating profits booked in other high-tax places. This policy failure can explain the persistence of profit shifting to tax havens despite the sizable costs involved for high-tax countries. We provide a new international database of GDP, trade balances, and factor shares corrected for profit shifting, showing that the rise of the global corporate capital share is significantly underestimated.
H87|Stabilisation policies to strengthen Euro area resilience|The euro area sovereign debt crisis highlighted important weaknesses in the euro area design. Fiscal policy did not build sufficient buffers before the crisis, which forced some countries to tighten fiscal policy too rapidly during the downturn to restore market confidence in sovereign borrowing. Despite this, sovereign stress remained high, weakening further the banking sectors highly exposed to government bonds, which in return reduced further market confidence in fiscal sustainability in case of banks’ bailout. As a result, monetary policy was the main public instrument to support the activity, but its effectiveness was reduced by the fragmentation of financial markets along national lines as the crisis deepened. In order to durably sever the links between banks and their sovereigns, euro area countries agreed on a banking union. The creation of a common supervisor was a very important step in that direction. However, further progress is needed in reducing and sharing risks, creating a common deposit guarantee scheme and the application of existing rules to ensure sufficient risk sharing can take place in case of crisis. At the same time, incentives need to be put in place for banks to progressively move away from a too high exposure to domestic sovereign bonds. A step in that direction could be the introduction of euro area safe asset, which would pool sovereign issuance from various countries, in parallel with gradual introduction of capital surcharges on sovereign exposures. Such progress may not be sufficient, however, for national fiscal policies and monetary policy to smooth a major crisis. The introduction of common fiscal stabilisation capacity is necessary to buttress the euro area in case of a deep recession, both at the country level and euro area level. Finally, policies aiming at further cross-border integration of capital markets should reinforce private risk sharing, reducing the burden on macro policies. This Working Paper relates to the 2018 OECD Economic Survey of the Euro Area. (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-european-union-and-euro-area.htm)
H87|Stabilising the Euro Area through unemployment benefits re-insurance scheme|The paper examines the possible design and macroeconomic stabilisation properties of a euro area unemployment benefits re-insurance scheme using annual historical data from 2000 to 2016. The scheme we propose is similar in some aspects to the recent proposals, including the IMF’s paper on the central fiscal capacity, while preserving important re-insurance characteristics, such as experience rating and caps on cumulative balances. Counterfactual simulations for individual euro area countries suggest that the scheme, at the cost of average annual contributions of 0.17% of national GDP, could have (i) provided additional macroeconomic stabilisation in the financial crisis of 2009-2013, both at the euro area level and at the level of individual countries hit by the crisis, and (ii) avoided permanent transfers among countries.
H87|Location choice and tax responsiveness of foreign multinationals: Evidence from ASEAN countries|This study uses a firm-level dataset to examine the impacts of taxation on multinationals' decisions to set up new foreign subsidiaries in developing ASEAN countries. It finds that taxes play a critical role in MNEs' location choice decision, with tax incentives being instrumental for maintaining location choice probabilities associated with each host country. The findings also indicate important heterogeneity in the tax responsiveness. First, the tax sensitivity for high-tech firms is significantly lower than that for low-tech firms. Second, having a prior presence in the respective host country is associated with substantially lower tax responsiveness. Finally, in accordance with international tax-avoidance considerations, the tax responsiveness is significantly diminished for affiliates with a connection to tax-haven countries. These provide important policy implications for developing-country governments that consider employing tax incentives to attract MNEs.
H87|The Comfortable, the Rich, and the Super-rich. What Really Happened to Top British Incomes During the First Half of the Twentieth Century?|We examine shifts in British income inequality and their causes between 1911 and 1949. Newly re-discovered Inland Revenue 1911 estimates and more detailed data from subsequent official income distribution enquiries are used to show that income was substantially more concentrated at the top of the income distribution in 1911 than previous estimates suggest, and that the top 1 per cent were the principal 'losers' in the subsequent trend towards reduced income inequality. We find that this trend reflected a sharp decline in top 'unearned' incomes - paralleling the findings of Piketty and Saez for France and the USA. This explains the paradox between the observed reduction in British income inequality and the lack of evidence for any substantial redistribution of income between salary and wage-earners.
H87|Lightweight Suggestion from the Commission to Reform the Financing of the EU Budget|Abstract EU budget is currently financed almost fully by Own Resources, which are based on customs, Gross National Income, and statistically corrected VAT bases of the Member States. Marginal income is provided by activities of the EU, such as fines. Furthermore, rebates received by the large net payers influence markedly the actual amount of contributions paid. The reform proposal published in May 2018 by the European Commission on the new system of Own Resources does not markedly improve the financing structure of the EU budget. The proposal simplifies the calculation of the VAT-based Own Resource. In addition, it introduces three new Own Resources based on CCCTB, ETS allowances and the amount of non-recycled plastic packaging waste. The largest contributions continue to come from the GNI-based Own Resources, Traditional Own Resources, and the VAT-based Own Resources. Environmental effects would be modest. The implementation of CCCTB would improve the conditions in Internal Markets and increase tax revenues, but independently of the use of the proceeds as Own Resource in the EU budget. Strongest resistance is expected to be generated by the suggestion of removing gradually all the rebates of the large net payers.
H87|Sovereign Bail-Outs and Fiscal Rules in a Banking Union|This paper studies optimal fiscal rules in a two-country economy in which cross-country linkages between sovereign debts and banking sectors motivate bail-outs among countries. The first-best sovereign borrowing, which is contingent on countries' output gap, cannot be achieved in the presence of asymmetric information on a country's potential output. Because bail-out induces overborrowing, fiscal rules can be implemented to prevent the ensuing inefficiency. A mechanism can be designed to induce a country with low potential output (i.e., a small negative output gap) to run an optimal budget deficit upon receiving a (ex-post) transfer from the other country. We characterize conditions under which this `cyclically- contingent' fiscal mechanism Pareto dominates an alternative `cyclically-adjusted' fiscal rule imposing a unique ceiling on a country's borrowing, independently of its potential output.
H87|A European Net Wealth Tax|The increase of wealth inequality in many EU countries has spurred interest in wealth taxation. While taxes on wealth for a long time have played only a marginal role in the public finance and taxation literature, more recently a variety of arguments are brought forward in favour of (higher) wealth taxation. At the same time, tax competition has led to an almost complete disappearance of recurrent net wealth taxes in Europe. By dealing with non- and under-reporting in the Household and Consumption Survey (HFCS) data set provided by the European Central Bank, we are able to estimate the wealth distribution within 20 EU countries and the revenue potential of a progressive EU-wide net wealth tax.
H87|The effect of double taxation treaties and territorial tax systems on foreign direct investment: Evidence for Spain|The paper evaluates the effect of Double Taxation Treaties (DTTs) on Spain's inward and outward Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for the period 1993-2013. Estimates produce positive and statistically significant coefficients. However, there are some differences between the inbound and outbound samples, the type of DTT and the group of developed and developing FDI partner countries. Moreover, interpretation of results differs depending on the fixed or random effects estimation technique used. The paper also analyses the effect on FDI of the rules agreed in DTTs and applied by the investors' residence country in order to correct international double taxation. The authors conclude that the tax saving derived from the application by Spain of the territorial system is positively related to investment from this country to abroad. However, the tax saving provided by the application by the partner countries of the territorial system does not have a significant effect on the investment of these countries into Spain.
H87|Tax expenditure and the treatment of tax incentives for investment|Governments use tax expenditures to boost investment, innovation and employment. However, these schemes are largely opaque, costly and often ineffective in reaching their stated goals. They also frequently trigger unwanted side effects. In order to improve the performance of these tools, the authors present three concrete policy proposals: First, governments should increase transparency on tax benefits. G20 members should take the lead on this with frequent and comprehensive tax expenditure reports. Second, G20 governments should improve the design of tax incentives with the aim of minimizing the generation of windfall profits and negative spillover effects within and across (in particular, on poorer) countries. Third, governments should phase out tax expenditures that are environmentally harmful, including tax incentives for fossil fuels and other schemes that promote an unsustainable use of natural resources.
H87|Democracy and aid donorship|Almost half of the world's states provide bilateral development assistance. While previous research takes the set of donor countries as exogenous, this article is the first to explore the determinants of aid donorship. We hypothesize that democratic institutions reduce poor countries' likelihood to initiate aid giving. On the contrary, the leadership of poor authoritarian regimes face fewer constraints that would hinder these governments to reap the benefits of a development aid program despite popular opposition. To test our expectations, we build a new global dataset on aid donorship since 1945 and apply an instrumental-variables strategy that exploits exogenous variation in regional waves of democratization. Our results confirm that the likelihood of a democratic country to start aid giving is more responsive to income than it is the case for authoritarian countries. Overall, democracies are - if anything - less rather than more likely to engage in aid giving.
H87|Verteidigungsausgaben in der (wirtschafts)politischen Diskussion|Die deutschen Verteidigungsausgaben werden im Rahmen der NATO immer wieder als zu niedrig kritisiert, insbesondere von Seiten der US-Administration. Auch wenn die Bindungswirkung des Ziels für die Militärausgaben in Höhe von 2 Prozent des Bruttoinlandsprodukts strittig ist, hat es doch erhebliche politische Relevanz. Deutschland bewegt sich seit Jahren deutlich unter diesem Ziel und wird es auch nach den aktuellen Haushaltsplanungen in den nächsten Jahren nicht erreichen. Im Gegensatz zu anderen europäischen Ländern hat Deutschland seine Verteidigungsausgaben nach dem Ende des Kalten Krieges deutlich gesenkt und auf dem niedrigeren Niveau gehalten. In den Achtziger Jahren lagen die Ausgaben in Deutschland noch zwischen zwei und drei Prozent des BIP, heute sind es laut der NATO-Definition noch 1,2 Prozent. Die beiden europäischen Atommächte geben jährlich rund 2 Prozent ihrer Wirtschaftsleistung für die Landesverteidigung aus, nachdem es gegen Ende des Kalten Krieges bis zu fünf Prozent waren. Verglichen mit dem absoluten Niveau von 1990 konnte Deutschland eine Friedensdividende von über 400 Milliarden Dollar in Form von geringeren Ausgaben einfahren. Die aktuellen außenpolitischen Diskussionen, eine sich verändernde Sicherheitslage und vielfach beklagte Ausrüstungsmängel der Bundeswehr können zu steigenden Ausgaben und damit zu zusätzlichen Risiken für den Bundeshaushalt führen. Die bisherige Finanzplanung spiegelt dies nur eingeschränkt wider.
H87|Funding for International Affairs Activities, Within and Outside Agenciesâ€™ Base Budgets|The Congress provides the State Department, the Agency for International Development (USAID), and other agencies a â€œbase budgetâ€ each year to fund ongoing activities related to international affairs. The agencies have received other â€œnonbaseâ€ funding in recent years, in the form of supplemental appropriations, emergency appropriations, and funding for overseas contingency operations. In this report, CBO analyzes the recent use of such nonbase appropriations for international affairs activities.
H87|How Large is the Corporate Tax Base Erosion and Profit Shifting? A General Equilibrium Approach|This paper estimates the size and macroeconomic effects of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) using a computable general equilibrium model designed for corporate taxation and multinationals. Our central estimate of the impact of BEPS on corporate tax losses for the EU amounts to €36 billion annually or 7.7% of total corporate tax revenues. The USA and Japan also appear to loose tax revenues respectively of €101 and €24 billion per year or 10.7% of corporate tax revenues in both cases. These estimates are consistent with gaps in bilateral multinationals' activities reported by creditor and debtor countries using official statistics for the EU. Our results suggest that by increasing the cost of capital, eliminating profit shifting would slightly reduce investment and GDP. It would however raise corporate tax revenues thanks to enhanced domestic production. This in turn could reduce other taxes and increase welfare.
H87|Profit shifting and investment effects: The implications of zero-taxable profits|Recent empirical research documents a tendency of multinational enterprise affiliates to bunch around zero reported profit. We set up a theoretical model of multinational firm behavior in which we allow for corner solutions in the choice of the optimal transfer price due to insufficient profits or losses of affiliates. Such constraints in the choice of the transfer price induce bunching and generate investment effects in the low-tax as well as the high-tax country. In equilibrium, affiliates might overinvest and the investment effects generate a tendency for too high profit taxes. The analysis provides a micro-foundation for the investment effects that result from transfer pricing. The finding stands in contrast to the existing literature where transfer pricing choices are unconstrained.
H87|Frontloaded Income Taxation of Old-Age Pensions: For Efficiency and Fairness in a World of International Labor Mobility|Strong evidence shows that the existing pattern of cross-border pension taxation in OECD countries and beyond is extremely diverse and inconsistent, generating a double fairness dilemma for individuals and countries alike. This paper argues that this dilemma cannot be solved within the current network of double-taxation treaties. Instead, it proposes a new approach for the taxation of old-age pensions in a world of high and increasing cross-border mobility of workers and pensioners. The paper demonstrates that a coordinated move to frontloaded pension taxation and exclusive source taxation would pave the way for an international pension tax order that eliminates the double fairness dilemma. An additional innovative element of frontloaded pension taxation is presented: the decoupling of individual tax assessment and tax payment, which may help curb political opposition against frontloaded pension taxation and smooth transitional effects after its introduction.
H87|Measures of Global Public Goods and International Spillovers|This paper attempts a first-cut listing of global public goods and international spillover activities, as well as providing some data on their global distribution alongside basic correlational analysis. Few if any goods are “pure” global public goods and there is a spectrum of the extent of spillovers. Some global public goods are not well measured. The listing is far from exhaustive, nor is it based on rigorous selection criteria. But it does suggest considerable diversity in trends, levels and sources of public good and spillover activities.
H87|Taxing multinationals: The scope for enforcement cooperation|We present a tax-competition model with two policy instruments: the corporate tax rate and the tightness of tax enforcement (i.e., controls on profit shifting by multinational enterprises). Tougher enforcement increases the cost of profit shifting, and thus mitigates tax competition. In a framework of noncooperative tax choices, we compare the equilibria of the noncooperative and cooperative enforcement choices. After showing that enforcement cooperation may not benefit the low-tax country, we indicate two drivers that promote enforcement cooperation. The first driver of cooperation is complementarity (imperfect substitutability) of countries’ enforcement efforts, taking into account that dispersed enforcement efforts among the involved countries are less effective. We show that cooperation is more likely with greater enforcement complementarity. The second driver of cooperation is tax leadership, which reduces the extent of disagreement on tax enforcement.
H87|How Large is the Corporate Tax Base Erosion and Profit Shifting? A General Equlibrium Approach|This paper estimates the size and macroeconomic effects of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) using a computable general equilibrium model designed for corporate taxation and multinationals. Our central estimate of the impact of BEPS on corporate tax losses for the EU amounts to €36 billion annually or 7.7% of total corporate tax revenues.

It would however raise corporate tax revenues thanks to enhanced domestic production. This in turn could reduce other taxes and increase welfare.
H87|Who owns the wealth in tax havens? Macro evidence and implications for global inequality|Drawing on newly published macroeconomic statistics, this paper estimates the amount of household wealth owned by each country in offshore tax havens. The equivalent of 10% of world GDP is held in tax havens globally, but this average masks a great deal of heterogeneity—from a few percent of GDP in Scandinavia, to about 15% in Continental Europe, and 60% in Gulf countries and some Latin American economies. We use these estimates to construct revised series of top wealth shares in ten countries, which account for close to half of world GDP. Because offshore wealth is very concentrated at the top, accounting for it increases the top 0.01% wealth share substantially in Europe, even in countries that do not use tax havens extensively. It has considerable effects in Russia, where the vast majority of wealth at the top is held offshore. These results highlight the importance of looking beyond tax and survey data to study wealth accumulation among the very rich in a globalized world.
H87|The Political Economy of Multilateral Aid Funds|When allocating foreign aid, donor countries face a problem of incentivizing recipient countries to invest in state capacity. Here, we show that donors can incentivize recipient countries by committing to collective decision-making: If aid allocation decisions are made ex post via bargaining between donors, then the negotiated outcome will be skewed towards aggregate efficiency, which induces the recipients to compete over ex ante investments. Our model links the fund's composition of membership and its decision rules to participation, investment and allocation decisions. We also find that majority rule induces stronger competition between recipients, resulting in higher investments in state capacity. The qualitative predictions of our model are broadly consistent with empirical findings on multilateral aid. In particular, the model rationalizes our novel empirical finding that, relative to organizations that use a consensus rule, organizations that use majority are more responsive to changes in recipient-country quality.
H87|European Banks and Tax Havens: Evidence from Country-by-Country Reporting|Banks in the European Union recently started publicly reporting data on profit, number of employees, turnover and tax on a country-by-country basis. I introduce the largest, hand-collected data set of its kind, which covers almost 50 banks for up to 5 years between 2013 and 2017. I identify the main locations of European bank's profits, which include the largest European economies as well as tax havens. I focus on answering the question of how geographically aligned these profits are with economic activity. I find that some of the tax havens have maintained high shares of profits in contrast with their much lower shares of employees. These results indicate that banks are likely shifting their profits to tax havens, but for the profit shifting to be directly observed, regulators will need to ask banks to publish even better data.
H87|Commodity taxation and regulatory competition|Abstract The purpose of this paper is twofold. We first investigate whether product market regulations affect commodity taxation in open-to-trade economies, and second, we study the strategic interaction in regulatory measures between trading partner countries. We present a two-country general equilibrium model in which destination-based commodity taxes finance public goods, and product market regulation affects both the number of firms in the market and product diversity. Based on data for 21 OECD countries over the 1990–2008 period, we provide empirical evidence suggesting that product market regulations are strategic complement policies and that domestic regulations have a negative impact on domestic commodity taxation.
H87|Increasing resource rent taxation when the corporate income tax is reduced?|Under international tax competition, corporate income tax rates are predicted to decrease, and the tax burden will shift onto immobile factors. This case study considers tax changes that illustrate the predictions for Norway 2012–2018. Petroleum rent was taxed at high rates in 2012, and while corporate income tax rates were reduced in four steps, the marginal tax on rent was kept constant. The four steps are analyzed in light of the tax burden shift predicted by theory, and possible intentions of the government. The tax on petroleum rent has not been increased. Government intentions seem to have been shifting.
H87|Twin Deficits Revisited: a role for fiscal institutions?|We revisit the twin deficit relationship for a sample of 193 countries over the period 1980-2016, using a panel fixed effect (within-group) estimator, bias-corrected least-squares dummy variable, system GMM, and common correlated effects pooled estimation procedures. The analysis accounts also for the existence of fiscal rules in place, their features, and their interaction with the budget balance. In the absence of fiscal rules, the twin deficit hypothesis is confirmed. The size of the estimated coefficient on the budget balance is between 0.68 and 0.79. However, the existence of fiscal rules strongly reduces the effect of budget balance on the current account balance (the coefficient is reduced to 0.1). In fact, the twin deficits relationship does not hold with some specific kinds of rules: debt rules, rules with monitoring of compliance, as well as budget balance rules and debt rules in emerging market economies and lowest income countries, and in the post-crisis period.
H87|Profit shifting by EU banks: evidence from country-by-country reporting|We investigate profit shifting by the largest and systemically relevant European multinational banks using new data made available through country-by-country reporting for the financial years 2014-2016. We capture tax incentives for income shifting using a multilateral tax differential between the local tax rate and the tax rates in the other countries where the bank has operations. We find that profits - particularly those recorded in tax havens - are negatively affected by corporate taxation. Moreover, the bulk of income shifting seems to take place among subsidiaries, as foreign-to-foreign tax differences matter significantly more that home-to-foreign differentials. Simulation results suggest that the amount of shifted profits in tax havens is about 38% of true profits. The ratio between shifted and true profits drops to about 7% when selected non havens are considered.
H87|Asylum providers: Hawks or Doves?|I examine the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium of an asylum provision game in pure strategies, assuming that asylum is an international public good. An equilibrium does not necessarily exist because the players. payo¤s are not quasiconcave. When an equilibrium exists, it is either unique or multiple. When multiple equilibria arise, the game is a variant of hawk-dove game. Multiple equilibria suggest the counter-intuitive possibility that the more popular destination is more open to refugees even though openness is not modeled to boost popularity.
H87|Discretionary fiscal policy in the Euro area: past, present, future|The depth and the length of the recent crisis prompted a more positive re-assessment of a countercyclical fiscal stance, especially in the euro area. Against this background, we look at discretionary fiscal policy in the euro area from three different perspectives. First, we provide evidence that the discretionary fiscal policy in euro-area countries has been mostly a-cyclical even if our estimates suggest that using it counter-cyclically could have been useful, particularly during the crisis. Second, focusing on the short-run – i.e. taking as given the economic and institutional constraints that currently make a significant fiscal expansion quite unrealistic in Europe – we discuss some budget-neutral proposals aimed at fostering economic growth. Finally, taking a more forward-looking perspective, we discuss the issue of the appropriate fiscal stance for the euro area as a whole, and argue that the advantages of having a coordinated approach (e.g. through a centralized fiscal capacity) can be substantial.
H87|Endogenous Leadership in Tax Competition: A Combination of the Effects of Market Power and Strategic Interaction|This paper extends Kempf and Rota-Graziosi (2010, “Endogenizing Leadership in Tax Competition.” Journal of Public Economics 94 (9):768–776) and Hindriks and Nishimura (2015, “A Note on Equilibrium Leadership in Tax Competition Models.” Journal of Public Economics 121:66–68) by jointly considering the effects of market power and strategic interaction in tax competition. We depict the regional asymmetry as different slopes and different vertical intercepts of the inverse demand for capital. In our setup, the risk-dominant equilibrium in which the large region leads is regained. Moreover, dissimilar to Kempf and Rota-Graziosi (2010, “Endogenizing Leadership in Tax Competition.” Journal of Public Economics 94 (9):768–776) and Hindriks and Nishimura (2015, “A Note on Equilibrium Leadership in Tax Competition Models.” Journal of Public Economics 121:66–68), we show that with a large market demand and a low capital endowment, the leadership by the large region can still be Pareto-dominant even if the asymmetry is very small.
H87|Memorable Encounters? Own and Neighbours' Experience with IMF Conditionality and IMF Stigma|While the consequences and effectiveness of IMF conditionality have long been the focus of research, the possible negative impact of IMF conditionality on countries’ willingness to ask for an IMF programme - often termed ‘IMF stigma’ - has recently received attention particularly from policy circles. In this paper we investigate how countries’ past experience with the IMF affects their likelihood of entering an IMF arrangement again. To also allow for such learning for countries which never had an IMF programme, we include neighbours’ past IMF conditionality. Our results indicate strong learning from own experience, but hardly any learning from neighbours, except for ASEAN countries. We conjecture that the stigma associated with IMF conditionality may exist for individual country cases, but that a more general ‘IMF stigma’ cannot be related to observing how the IMF treats peers.
H87|Bonus taxes and international competition for bank managers|We analyze the competition in bonus taxation when banks compensate their managers by means of fixed and incentive pay and bankers are internationally mobile. Banks choose bonus payments that induce excessive managerial risk-taking to maximize their private benefits of existing government bailout guarantees. In this setting the international competition in bonus taxes may feature a ‘race to the bottom’ or a ‘race to the top’, depending on whether bankers are a source of net positive tax revenue or inflict net fiscal losses on taxpayers as a result of incentive pay. A ‘race to the top’ becomes more likely when governments’ impose only lax capital requirements on banks, whereas a ‘race to the bottom’ is more likely when bank losses are partly collectivized in a banking union.
H87|Learning to Tax ?- Interjurisdictional Tax Competition under Incomplete Information|We present a multi-period model in which countries set source-based taxes without having precise information how their and their neighbours' tax rates affect the tax base. Countries can learn from past experience and from observing their neighbours' outcomes and/or tax policy choices. We consider the sequence of Markov perfect equilibria and show that the beliefs become more precise over time and, eventually, correct. The precision of beliefs in a given period increases in the number of observed countries. In equilibrium, tax rates are inefficiently low if the value of learning is positive and the pace of learning increases in the level of tax rates (because higher tax rates trigger larger tax base effects which helps learning); in the presence of fiscal externalities, tax rates are too homogeneous (because variance in tax policies enhances learning). If, due to fiscal externalities, the value of learning is negative, the opposite may be true. From the viewpoint of empirical measurement, the model generates time patterns that look as if countries react to each other even if there are no fiscal externalities. We conclude that the existing evidence may therefore be inconclusive with regard to the existence of tax competition.
H87|Domestic Taxes and Export Composition: Evidence from VAT Adoption Worldwide|In principle, a VAT should be neutral with regards to both the level and composition of exports. In practice, this may not be the case because exporters in many countries receive incomplete VAT refunds. When VAT refunds are incomplete, the exports of industries that rely heavily on intermediate goods are especially likely to be negatively affected by a VAT. Motivated by these considerations, this paper uses trade data for over 100 countries spanning 1962-2015 to evaluate the differential effect of the VAT across industries. I find that an industry with a 10% point higher intermediate goods share of output sees a decline in exports of over 8% relative to an industry with a lower share. This effect is particularly pronounced for low-income countries and essentially absent for high-income countries.
H87|Optimal tax routing: network analysis of FDI diversion|Abstract The international corporate tax system is considered a network. Just like for transportation, “shortest” paths are computed, which minimize tax payments for multinational enterprises when they repatriate profits. We include corporate income tax rates, withholding taxes on dividends, double tax treaties, and double taxation relief methods. We find that treaty shopping leads to an average potential reduction of the tax burden on repatriated dividends of about 6% points. An indicator for centrality in the tax network identifies the UK, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands as the most important conduit countries. Low-tax havens do not have a crucial role in reducing dividend repatriation taxes. By contrast, tax haven financial centres do. In the regressions we find that the centrality measures are robustly significant explanatory variables for bilateral FDI stocks. This also holds for our treaty shopping indicator.
H87|Capital structure determinants and adjustment speed: An empirical analysis of Dutch SMEs|This paper presents empirical evidence of both the determinants and the adjustment speed of capital structure of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Netherlands. Using an administrative panel data set of the period 2000-2014, containing 153,923 fi rms, we estimate a partial adjustment model through system GMM. The results show that firm size and pro tability reduce debt to assets ratios, while tangible assets, depreciation, and marginal taxes increase them. Growth of assets is either statistically or economically insigni cant. The estimated adjustment speed parameter is 0.748, indicating that the adjustment process is particularly slow in the Netherlands.
H87|Exchange rate implications of Border Tax Adjustment neutrality|This paper investigates the implications for the nominal exchange rate of a Border Tax Adjustment (BTA) when there is BTA neutrality. A border tax adjustment is a change from an origin-based system of taxation, that taxes exports but exempts imports to a destination-based system that taxes imports but exempts exports. Both indirect taxes (e.g. a VAT) and direct taxes (e.g. a cash-flow corporate profit tax) can be subject to a BTA. In the US, a BTA for the corporate profit tax is under discussion. There is BTA neutrality when the real equilibrium, including measures of profitability and competitiveness, of an open economy is unchanged when it moves from an origin-based to a destination-based tax. The conventional wisdom on the exchange rate implications of a neutral BTA is that the currency of the country implementing the BTA will strengthen (appreciate) by a percentage equal to the VAT or CPT tax rate. The main insight of this note is that this 'appreciation presumption' is not robust, even when all conditions for full BTA neutrality are satisfied. Indeed, plausible alternative assumptions about constancy (or stickiness) of nominal prices support a weakening (depreciation) of the currency by the same percentage as the tax rate. On the basis on the very patchy available empirical information, it is not possible to take a view with any degree of confidence on the implications of a BTA for the nominal exchange rate, even if full BTA neutrality prevailed. Whether BTA neutrality itself is a feature of the real world is also a disputed empirical issue. Therefore, buyer (or seller) beware.
H87|On regional integration, fiscal income, and GDP per capita|This paper investigates the economic impacts of regional integration on a small jurisdiction in a dynamic fiscal competition environment. The tradeoffs between the economic benefits and the loss of policy flexibility resulting from integration are analyzed from the perspectives of fiscal revenue and GDP per capita. Our results show that the small jurisdiction's loss of flexibility in policy making can dominate the other effects of integration. Specifically, if the small jurisdiction's efficiency in providing public inputs is originally sufficiently high (low), regional integration always reduces (improves) its net revenue, independently of the extent of efficiency improvement due to integration. However, when the small jurisdiction's efficiency is originally intermediate, the impact on net revenue crucially depends on the magnitude of the efficiency effect. Our analysis also characterizes the tradeoffs resulting from integration between policy flexibility on the one hand and capital mobility and fiscal equalization on the other.
H87|International environmental agreements with ancillary benefits: Repeated games analysis|Both ancillary and primary benefits, generated by climate change mitigation, are indispensable key factors to implement the full participation in international environmental agreement (IEA). This paper presents a new IEA model with ancillary benefits, using a repeated game with the linear and quadratic emission abatement cost functions of each country. This study also investigates the effect of ancillary benefits on the condition for full participation in IEA. Ancillary benefits function as a complementary device of punishment scheme for IEA. Our main results show that ancillary benefits can facilitate full participation in IEA, thus suggesting that they should be considered in climate change negotiations.
H87|Global Climate Policy Will Have Net Benefits Larger Than Anyone Thinks (and Welfare Gains, Strangely, Are Likely To Be Much Larger Yet)|As with other public goods lacking strong special interest support, global climate policy suffers from two serious theoretical flaws. The first is failure to endogenize the labor-leisure decision when conducting benefit-cost analysis. Recognition that income generated will not remain the same pre-and-post policy results in downward bias in benefit estimation. Much more importantly, there will generally be free riding in input markets in addition to the well-known output demand revelation problem. Since even households with very high marginal values cannot individually increment public goods, too little income will be generated and too much of the income that is generated will be spent on relatively low value ordinary private goods. The ungenerated income would have all been spent on the public good, apart from general equilibrium considerations, resulting in additional—and perhaps large—downward bias in benefits of global climate policy. The reallocation of spending from relatively low value private goods to higher value public goods may further greatly increase willingness-to-pay for policies stabilizing global climate.
H87|The location of financial sector FDI: Tax and regulation policy|This paper analyzes how corporate taxation and regulatory requirements affect the location of financial sector FDI. We use novel information on new financial services entities established by multinational firms in 83 host countries. We find a negative effect of host country taxes on the probability of choosing a particular host location. We can also confirm a significant influence of the regulatory environment. For example, stricter (equity) capital requirements negatively affect location probabilities. Our empirical approach allows us to provide new insight in how a policy measure of a given country affects other countries by estimating cross-country tax and regulation elasticities.
H87|Ideology and redistribution through public spending|For a panel of OECD economies (1980–2013) we analyse the scope of government ideology to shape patterns of public expenditures. To address if public expenditures are used to channel redistributive outcomes, we adopt a flexible panel error correction model and proceed in two steps: Firstly, we analyse if ideological positions matter for the sizing of the public sector. Secondly, we address the actual impact of government ideology on two disjoint categories of public expenditure that are characterized by distinguished redistributive effects. Under both, left-wing and right-wing governments, public spending shows progressively redistributive effects which are indirectly channelled through their policy response to changing macroeconomic, fiscal and demographic fundamentals. While right-wing governments act progressively redistributive under favourable socio-economic conditions, their left-wing counterparts do so under unfavourable conditions. Comparing the two effects in terms of their explanatory content, we find that the latter is stronger than the former.
H87|Secular Stagnation: Determinants and Consequences for Australia|Slack OECD economic performance and weaker macroeconomic policy support Summers's reuse of the phrase â€˜secular stagnationâ€™. Globalisation has redirected growth towards emerging economies, and anticipated rates of return on investment are impaired by perceived risk, institutionalised risk aversion, ageing and dependency, declining commitments to public investment and research and development with rising shares directed to health, retained trade distortions, industrial concentration and slower human capital accumulation, not to mention unexpected global abundance of fossil fuels and a slower Chinese economy. The information and literature supporting these concerns is reviewed and implications for global and Australian policy are inferred.
H87|Harmonization of R&D Tax Credits across the European Union: Nonsense or common sense?| We examine the relevance of R&D tax credits as incentives to spur investment in R&D throughout the European Union (EU) and discuss the relevance and feasibility of harmonizing these tax-based policy instruments across Member States. Based on a thorough investigation of the instruments implemented in five selected European countries (Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK), we argue that the main obstacle to harmonization lies in the great diversity of instruments and eligibility conditions that currently prevail across the EU. We conduct a subsidiarity test, which suggests that, if the EU decides to move towards a harmonized R&D tax credit framework, it should at least impose a minimal level of tax rebate at the EU level, possibly complemented by additional country-level incentives. We highlight that the recent proposal of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) goes further than this minimal EU-level tax credit, by suggesting to implement a “super-deduction” that would allow EU-based firms to deduce more than 100% of their R&D expenditures from their tax base. We also discuss, as far as the harmonization of R&D tax credits is concerned, possible implication of Brexit both for the UK and for the EU. To complement our reflection and discussion, we develop an econometric analysis on our five selected countries. The super‐deduction proposed by the European Commission (EC) has its roots in the conviction that economic growth in Europe can only be knowledge-based, and that the current level of R&D investment in the EU is too low. The EC hopes that the super‐deduction will boost R&D investment across Europe, which is assumed to be conducive to more innovation and, ultimately, more growth. Our econometric analysis allows us to test whether this hope is empirically grounded, by examining whether the R&D tax credits implemented in the five aforementioned EU countries have spurred R&D and innovation (measured by patenting intensity) between 1980 and 2007. We find that the R&D conducted when a tax credit is available is associated with more R&D in the future in all five countries, and with more innovation in three countries out of five. However, we do not find any causal effect of the tax credit on innovation.
H87|EU ETS-broken beyond repair ? An analysis based on FASTER principles|The EU ETS is one of the main European climate policies, covering 45 percent of EU’s greenhouse gas emissions. Its main goal is to limit emissions cost-effectively, and to trigger innovations using a strong price signal, making low-carbon technologies more competitive. While emissions reduction targets for 2020 have already been achieved, the exact role of the ETS in this success remains controversial. The assessment is crucial, as more and more countries and regions plan to adopt similar policies to achieve their targets expressed in the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, communicated at the Paris Conference of the Parties. The EU ETS, as the longest running and largest carbon market in the world, will undoubtedly serve as a point of reference. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive analysis of the policy. First part outlines the historical development of emission trading systems, as well as the development of the EU ETS since its inception in 2005. Second part uses FASTER principles developed by the World Bank and the OECD to perform a multi-criteria, qualitative analysis of the EU ETS in its current form. Third part concentrates on the upcoming revision for the fourth phase, evaluating whether the proposals correctly address the policy’s shortcomings. It also provides some alternative reform proposals.
H87|Aid Dispersion: Measurement in Principle and Practice|Excessive dispersion of development assistance has been high on the Paris Agenda on aid effectiveness. However, there is no agreement in the existing literature on how aid dispersion should be measured and few studies of the extent of the problem. We argue for using the Theil Index for both recipients and donors. This relative inequality measure has a major advantage: it allows for a perfect decomposition into variation between and within entities. Exploiting this property, we can rank official donors and recipients not only in terms of the total spread, but also assess the contributions of geographic and sectoral dispersion. We provide a detailed picture of developments along various dimensions (globally as well as for countries, income groups, and regions, over 1998–13). We further distinguish between bilateral and multilateral donors. Consistent with other studies using more limited samples, we find little effect of the Paris Agenda overall. Aid is more fragmented in Sub-Saharan Africa and in the poorest countries. Globally as well as for most donor and recipient countries, between variation is the main driver of the spread, lending support to the geographic concentration policies many donor countries have adopted. Bilateral aid has been somewhat more dispersed than multilateral aid and in both cases the large number of donors controlling similar shares of total funds is a major driver of the total spread. The latter suggests that concentration could also be achieved through a reduction of the number of actors on the donor side of the aid industry, a perspective that previous studies using other measures have been unable to capture.
H87|Losing concentration? Lessons from a Swedish aid policy reform|Sweden is one of the donor countries that signed up for the Paris Agenda, which among other things advocated reducing aid dispersion. It also adopted its own geographical concentration policy in 2007. My empirical analysis shows that Sweden managed to achieve this goal only for two years following the reform and that this was followed by backsliding. Moreover, its current aid policy framework barely mentions the topic. I argue that a major reason was the failure to institutionalize the policy. This left it vulnerable to the regular politics of aid, which tend to generate both geographic and thematic spread. Reduced peer pressure, as the international community has moved away from the Paris Agenda, might also have contributed.
H87|Trade Misinvoicing: What can we Measure?|The existing studies on trade misinvoicing have focussed on the discrepancy in reported trade statistics between developing and developed countries. The estimates based on such methods rely on the assumption that developed countries report their trade statistics correctly. In this paper, we provide evidence that trade misinvoicing between developed countries is in fact large and any esti-mate based on such method may not provide an accurate representation of the dimensions of trade misinvoicing in the world. Further, there is need to develop a methodology by which one can attribute the misinvoicing to one or the other trade partner. To address this problem, we offer an alternative methodology. Since the exports of a country are necessarily imports of another country we use do-mestic factors to predict the export and import misinvoicing for a sample of large misinvoicers for the period 1990 to 2014. Such estimates allow us to establish whether the discrepancy can be at-tributed to the export or the import side for all countries. We find that the domestic factors better explain the export side, therefore, allowing us to estimate illicit flows through trade misinvocing us-ing the export misinvoicing by all countries.
H87|Estimating the Revenue Impacts of Tax Harmonisation|This paper reviews studies that attempt to measure empirically, revenue gains from tax harmonisation. Three groups of studies emerge, those that use cross-country regression, partial equilibrium analysis, and applied general-equilibrium (CGE) models—they all suggest (explicitly or implicitly) that the relationship between tax rates and tax revenues is ambiguous. In some special circumstances, there are gains that can be realized from tax harmonization, but those gains are usually modest in scope. Tax harmonization tends to disadvantage certain countries especially when the participating countries are different in size, and disparities in their initial tax structures are wide.
H87|Managing Change and Strategic Thinking: Evidences from Hospitality and Tourism Sector of the UK|This qualitative paper examines the strategic thinking and managing change in complex business environment in the hospitality and tourism sector of the UK through the cases of Hilton London Canary Wharf and Hilton London Tower Bridge. For the purpose of analysis, researchers explored the research phenomenon under different models including TALC model and IBTEE Model. Using convenience sampling, researchers interviewed face-to-face 12 Line Managers and 30 employees through open-ended semi-structured interview questions regarding change management process and obstacles interlinked with it. Findings revealed that although Hilton hotels have adapted changes to some extent but there is still more room for further improvement. The management of the selected hotels highly relies on the training purpose for the effective change adaption whereas coaching and research is lagging behind. The biggest constraint during effective change adaption is the diverse background of the workforce as most are from the multicultural backgrounds. Moreover, the communication, ritual, and cultural barriers are causing issues in the change process. Lastly, the recommendations are given for consolidating effective change management at workplace.
H87|Assessing the Importance of Taxation on FDI: Evidence from South-East Asian Developing Countries|This study examines the influence of taxation on FDI using data from South-East Asia. It employs the quantile regression approach with fixed effects that provides a comprehensive view of the tax sensitivity across the FDI distribution. Estimates confirm the significantly negative impact of the bilateral effective average tax rate but its effect is heterogeneous across the distribution. This stresses the importance of understanding the effect of taxation across the distribution rather than only at the mean. Also, the economic significance of the tax is relatively smaller than that of other fundamental factors such as labor quality and governance.
H87|National Tax Regulation, International Standards and the GATS: Argentina—Financial Services|Can a WTO Member discriminate against foreign suppliers of services located in jurisdictions that refuse to share information with a government to permit it to determine if its nationals engage in tax evasion? Does it matter if the Member uses standards developed by an international body as the criterion for deciding whether to impose measures? In Argentina—Financial Services the WTO Appellate Body held that services from jurisdictions that share financial tax information may be different from services provided by jurisdictions that do not cooperate in supplying such information. It overruled a Panel finding that measures to increase taxes on financial transactions with non-cooperative jurisdictions were discriminatory. We argue that the AB reached the right conclusion but that an important opportunity was missed to clarify what WTO Members are permitted to do to enforce their domestic regulatory regimes, and how international standards could have a bearing on this question. By giving consideration to arguments that the likeness of services and service suppliers may be a function of prevailing domestic regulatory regimes, the AB increased the scope for confusion and future litigation.

H87|A policymaker’s guide to a Euro area stabilization fund|Abstract In 2012, several reports were published advocating the creation of a genuine fiscal capacity at the European level, to strengthen the foundations of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) by helping member countries to adjust to asymmetric shocks. The design of a common stabilization fund should be well thought, though: what would be stabilized? When would transfers be paid? Would they be directed towards governments or individuals? How would they be financed? And would they help stabilize economies? We address these questions by outlining recent existing proposals, their features and their simulated stabilization effects. We finally underline the difficulties in implementing such a scheme.
H87|Tax Policy Effects on Business Incentives in Pakistan|The Pakistan system of taxing enterprises has undergone major changes in recent years. Nevertheless, the corporate tax system remains plagued by a number of problems, problems that relate to the neutrality, the yield, and the simplicity of the tax system. This chapter discusses these issues, with a focus on the distorting effects of tax policy on business invest.
H87|The Troika’s variations on a trio: Why the loan programmes worked so differently in Greece, Ireland, and Portugal|Portugal and Ireland exited Troika loan programmes; Greece did not. The conventional narrative is that different outcomes are best explained by differences in national competences in implementing programme requirements. This paper argues that three factors distinguish the Greek experience from that of Ireland and Portugal: different economic, political, and institutional starting conditions; the ad hoc nature of the European institutions’ approach to crisis resolution; and the very different conditionalities built into each of the loan programmes as a result. Ireland and Portugal show some signs of recovery despite austerity measures, but Greece has been burdened beyond all capacity to recover convincingly.
H87|International tax competition: A reappraisal| This paper investigates the interactions between tax policies at the international level (OECD countries). Both contemporaneous and time-delayed tax interactions are considered using Spatial Dynamic Panel Data model from Yu et al. (2008). Moreover, we test if the interdependence between governments exists due to the geographic closeness but also due to the proximity in terms of public investment levels. The results show, on one hand, that there are positive contemporaneous but negative time-delayed interactions. It is compatible with the existence of tax competition in a contemporaneus way, but also with the free-riding phenomena in the time-delayed approach. On the other hand, we show that interactions between countries are higher when they have similar levels of public investment than for the geographical closeness. This last result confirms the theoretical assumption that countries with close infrastructure investment are more likely to achieve tax harmonization. However, the negative time-delayed interactions are not consistent with this hypothesis, proving both tax and infrastructure competition between the OECD countries still exists.

H87|Strategic Responses to International Tax Competition: Fiscal (De) Centralization versus Partial Tax Harmonization| This paper analyzes a countryâ€™s optimal fiscal strategy among centralization, decentralization, and partial tax harmonization. Countries are asymmetric in productivity levels and characterized by multi-level government such that there is both horizontal and vertical tax competition. The main result from the analysis is that partial tax harmonization is more difficult to achieve in fiscally decentralized economies with high levels of productivity and low labor taxation. This result is confirmed by recent data from the OECD and explains the observed difficulties in achieving capital tax harmonization in the European Union. JEL Classification Numbers: F15, F38, H20, H87 Key Words: Centralization; Decentralization; Fiscal Competition; Partial Tax Harmonization.
H87|The true art of the tax deal: Evidence on aid flows and bilateral double tax agreements|Of a total of 2,976 double tax agreements (DTAs), some 60% are signed between a developing and a developed economy. As DTAs shift taxing rights from capitalâ€ importing to capitalâ€ exporting countries, the latter inherently benefit more from the agreements. In this paper, we argue that capital exporters use foreign aid to incite capital importers into signing DTAs. We demonstrate in a theoretical model that in a deal, one country does not trump the other, but that the deal must be mutually beneficial. In the case of an asymmetric DTA, this requires compensation from the capitalâ€ exporting country to the capitalâ€ importing country. Examining DTAs that are signed between donor and recipient countries between 1991 and 2012, and using a fixed effects Poisson model, we find that bilateral foreign aid commitments increase by 22% in the year of the signature of a DTA. Evaluated at the sample mean, this translates into around US$ six million additional aid commitments in a DTA signatory year.
H87|Toward a global norm against manipulating the integrity of financial data|The financial crisis that erupted in 2007 highlighted how important trust is for the global system and how fragile it can be. The 2016 Bangladesh central bank cyber incident exposed a new threat to financial stability and the unprecedented scale of the risk that malicious cyber actors pose to financial institutions. Beyond theft, using cyber operations to manipulate the integrity of data, in particular, poses a distinct and greater set of systemic risks than other forms of financial coercion. The complex and interdependent character of the financial system and its transcendence of physical and national boundaries mean that manipulating the integrity of financial institutions' data can, intentionally and/or unintentionally, threaten financial stability and the stability of the international system. Importantly, unlike the 2007-2008 global crisis, this risk exists independent of the underlying economic fundamentals and will only increase as more and more governments make cashless economies an explicit goal. The G20 finance ministers and central bank governors should be commended for urging improvements in the resilience of the global financial system in their March 2017 communique. In a next step, the G20 member states could commit their countries explicitly to refrain from using offensive cybertools to corrupt the integrity of data in the financial system and to cooperate when such attacks do occur.
H87|Delegating climate policy to a supranational authority: a theoretical assessment|This paper studies the delegation of climate policy to a supranational environmental authority. We develop a simple model of a world consisting of a large number of countries, which derive utility from energy consumption. Countries suffer from global warming and local air pollution, both caused by the combustion of fossil fuels, and decide individually on investments in clean technologies for energy production. A supranational environmental authority decides for each country on the maximally permitted amount of greenhouse gas emissions. We demonstrate that the authority faces a dynamic inconsistency problem that leads to welfare losses, but these losses can be kept small if the authority is endowed with an optimally designed mandate. The optimal mandate penalizes the cost of local air pollution very heavily relative to the cost of global warming. However, delegation of climate policy faces a further difficulty, as countries have a recurrent incentive to change the authority’s mandate over time.
H87|Common labor market, attachment and spillovers in a large metropolis|Abstract In this paper, we extend the home-attachment model to a setting with multiple (more than two) jurisdictions and consider non-cooperative policy making for provision of different types of metropolitan public goods in the presence of a common labor market. Migration and working place choices are independent. We show that the optimal redistributive policy implemented by a central authority always yields equalization of private consumption levels across jurisdictions. This result holds whether or not policy makers are able to anticipate migration responses to their policy choices. In the decentralized leadership games, jurisdictions make choices that fully internalize externalities.
H87|Measuring climate policy stringency: a shadow price approach|Abstract To assess the effect of environmental policy on production structures, trade structures, or foreign direct investment, a measure for the stringency of policy is necessary. Measures typically used in empirical studies share several disadvantages: they are not available on a sectoral basis to reflect concerns of industry competitiveness; they are not available for a wide range of countries to allow for international comparisons; or they are not broad enough to reflect the multidimensionality of environmental policy. This paper develops a thorough, internationally comparable, sector-specific measure of multidimensional climate policy stringency where a shadow price approach serves as a basis. The approach is applied to climate policy by determining sector-specific emission-relevant energy costs on the basis of the sectors’ usage of emission-relevant energy carriers and the carriers’ respective prices. The resulting shadow price estimates are heterogeneous and can be applied in future research to test for carbon leakage and pollution havens.
H87|Olson’s exploitation hypothesis in a public good economy: a reconsideration|Abstract Since the publication of Olson’s (1965) The Logic of Collective Action, the exploitation hypothesis, in which the rich shoulder the provision burden of public goods for the poor, has held sway despite empirical exceptions. To address such exceptions, we establish two alternative exploitation hypotheses based on contributors’ asymmetric preferences or on their productivity differences regarding the public good. The classic hypothesis and its two variants are proven in a novel fashion. For asymmetric preferences, we also establish the exploitation hypothesis for the joint products model with private and public co-benefits. Our theoretical insights are then illustrated by some empirical examples from the field of international public goods, such as military defense and cross-border pollution.
H87|Multinational Firms and Tax Havens|Multinational firms with operations in high-tax countries can benefit the most from reallocating taxable income to tax havens, though this is sufficiently difficult and costly that only 20.4% of German multinational firms have any tax haven affiliates. Among German manufacturing firms, a 1 percentage point higher foreign tax rate is associated with a 2.3% greater likelihood of owning a tax haven affiliate. This is consistent with tax avoidance incentives and contrasts with earlier evidence for U.S. firms. The relationship is less strong for firms in service industries, possibly reflecting the difficulty of reallocating taxable service income.
H87|Efficiency and Equity Effects of Taxing the Financial Sector: Lessons from a CGE Model for Belgium|This paper assesses the effects of applying a VAT or a sales tax on (intermediate or final) sales of the financial sector. It uses a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model calibrated for a small open economy. It highlights the differentiated sectorial and redistribution effects of these taxes and shows the importance of the financial openness of the economy on these results.
H87|Collective action in an asymmetric world|A central authority possessing tax and expenditure responsibilities can readily provide an efficient level of a public good. Absent a central authority, voluntary arrangements must replace coercive ones, and significant under-provision must be expected. International public goods are particularly challenging due to the substantial asymmetries among nations. Small-interest nations have strong incentives to ride cheaply. Our empirical results reveal cheap riding intentions in providing for climate change mitigation, a critical international public good. The evidence is provided by individual nations' Intended Nationally Determined Contributions voluntarily pledged for the Paris Climate Change Conference. We find that larger nations made much larger pledges in proportion to both their Gross National Incomes and their historical emissions. Implications for the Nordhaus Climate Club and carbon-tax proposals are discussed. To achieve Pareto optimality despite disparate cheap-riding incentives, we propose the Cheap-Riding Efficient equilibrium. That solution takes the Nash equilibrium as a base point, and then applies the principles of either the Nash Bargaining solution or the Lindahl equilibrium to proceed to the Pareto frontier.
H87|A Model of the International Monetary System|We propose a simple model of the international monetary system. We study the world supply and demand for reserve assets denominated in different currencies under a variety of scenarios: a hegemon versus a multipolar world; abundant versus scarce reserve assets; and a gold exchange standard versus a floating rate system. We rationalize the Triffin dilemma, which posits the fundamental instability of the system, as well as the common prediction regarding the natural and beneficial emergence of a multipolar world, the Nurkse warning that a multipolar world is more unstable than a hegemon world, and the Keynesian argument that a scarcity of reserve assets under a gold standard or at the zero lower bound is recessionary. Our analysis is both positive and normative.
H87|International Environmental Agreements: Doomed to Fail or Destined to Succeed? A Review of the Literature|We survey the economics literature on International Environmental Agreements (IEAs). We classify the extant literature into the following categories: pure IEA games without linkages, which focus on a single externality stemming from global pollution; IEA games with side payments and issue linkages, which consider carrot or stick mechanisms to lure cooperators or punish defectors; political economy models, which examine intra- and inter-governmental issues that affect international negotiations; design issues of IEAs; behavioral factors, which affect the willingness of countries to cooperate; and additional externalities resulting from open economy issues and adaptation, which interact with the global pollution externality and affect the free-riding incentives of countries. Based on this classification of the literature, we attempt to identify conditions under which an international environmental agreement would be sustainable and effective.
H87|The Direction of Strategic Delegation and Voter Welfare in Asymmetric Tax Competition Models|This paper examined a political process and economic consequences of tax competition among asymmetric countries. Citizens are endowed with heterogeneous capital incomes. The median-voters deliberately elect a delegate whose preferences differ from their own, to pursue advantages in the international tax competition. When the countries have different productivity of the capital, the country with a low capital productivity may delegate the tax authority to a citizen who is richer than the median-voter. As a result, the outcome through strategic delegation may make the median-voters and the majority of citizens worse-off than the selfrepresentation outcome, contrary to the previous studies with symmetric countries. Similar results are obtained when the countries differ in capital endowments. In contrast, when the countries differ in population size, productive inefficiency is reduced, and the median-voters are better-off through strategic delegation. We also point out that the role of campaign promises is important for the equilibrium tax rates and citizens f welfare.
H87|Revenue for EMU: A Contribution to the Debate on Fiscal Union|In the wake of the euro area crisis, the debate on instruments to deepen economic integration among its members has intensified, among others putting forward a fiscal stabilization capacity for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) members. Contributions made so far to further this idea have mostly concentrated on the expenditure side and possible stabilization properties. This analysis reviews the most important proposals and discusses design choices and institutional conditions to develop the revenue side of such a fiscal instrument.
H87|Competition for Foreign Capital under Asymmetric Revenue-Orientation|This paper develops a model of inter-regional competition for mobile capital considering that regions may have different revenue-orientations. It shows that, if regions are asymmetric in terms of revenue-orientation, the less revenue-orientated region obtains higher tax-revenue and higher social welfare in the equilibrium than the more revenue-oriented region. However, if regions are symmetric, the equilibrium tax-revenue and social welfare are higher in the case of greater revenue-orientation of regions. Moreover, regions spend on public-investment and end up with Pareto-inferior equilibrium outcome, regardless of whether regions are symmetric or asymmetric. It also analyses implications of public-investment spill-over on equilibrium outcomes.
H87|Are Preferential Tax Holidays Dynamic Inconsistent?|In a two-period dynamic model, where a single country is trying to attract large investors endowed with capital with varying rate of returns, we show that the result of Kishore and Roy (2014), that a country has incentives to commit to a non-preferential regime to circumvent dynamic inconsistency problem does not hold. Tax revenue of the government may be higher under a preferential regime compared to a non-preferential regime.
H87|Dynamic Inconsistency, Falling Cost of Capital Relocation and Preferential Taxation of Foreign Capital|"When capital is sunk after it is invested, a host government facing heterogeneous foreign investors who differ in their cost of capital relocation (which falls over time) has a strong incentive to wait in order to gain from relatively lower cost of capital relocation and offer preferential taxes over time in order to attract less eager investors. We ?nd that, if the government can commit to future tax rates, the tax revenue increases as the cost of relocation decreases. Moreover, under preferential taxation scheme the equilibrium tax revenue of the government is equal to what it can earn under full commitment. The tax revenue under non-preferential taxation scheme is lower compare to full commitment outcome when cost of capital relocation falls considerably over time but remains strictly positive. Under every taxation schemes considered in this paper, the equilibrium tax rate falls over time if cost of capital relocation falls considerably which offers another explanation for- ``why the tax rate falls over time in tax treaties?"""
H87|Dynamic Tax Competition, Home Bias and the Gain from Non-preferential Agreements|"In a dynamic two-period model of tax competition, where an investor has home bias for the country where he/she invests in the initial period, we show that tax revenue under a non-preferential taxation scheme is strictly higher compared to a preferential taxation scheme. A non-preferential taxation scheme not only increases tax revenue in the later period, it also reduces competition in the initial period. The gain from having a non-preferential regime is strictly increasing in home bias as long as home bias is not large enough. When home bias is above a critical level, the gain from having a non-preferential agreement is independent of home bias. While the literature on tax competition has identified that ``home bias"" can make non-preferential taxation preferable to a preferential regime when investors are small with heterogeneous home bias, we show that even when investors are large with a discrete home bias, a non-preferential regime generates higher tax revenue compared to a preferential regime. We show that even when only one of the capital bases has home bias, a non-preferential regime generates higher tax revenue compared to a preferential regime. This paper also quantify the gain from a non-preferential regime with a parameter which captures home bias and provide clear comparative statics. Moreover, we also show that a country has an incentive to unilaterally commit to a non-preferential agreement."
H87|Tax Competition, Policy Competition and the Strategic Use of Policy Restrictions on Foreign Direct Investments|In a dynamic two-period model of tax competition where competing countries strategically choose foreign investment restrictions which increases sunk cost of investments, we show that choosing a higher level of restriction is beneficial for the competing countries. A higher level of restriction reduces competition and increases tax revenue in the later period, which allows the government to offer large tax holidays during the initial period of investment. The result is counter-intuitive as it is widely believed that sunk cost reduces foreign direct investments. Moreover, even though competing countries are ex-ante symmetric, equilibrium choice of the level of restrictions may not be equal. The result provides sunk cost as another rationale for tax holidays in the presence of competition.
H87|Possible Ways of Further Evolution of Tax Systems in the EAEU Countries<BR>[Пути Гармонизации Систем Налогообложения В Странах Евразийского Экономического Союза]|In the article in detail is studied the process of tax harmonization in the EAEU by analyzing the main economic indicators, as well as the legal aspects of the tax systems in order to identify similarities and differences in the EAEU and the impact of harmonization of tax policy on the EAEU Member Countries. There are general regulation for indirect taxes such as VAT and duty taxes which defines the main principles of using these taxes during the export and import processes. However, there are not any regulations on EAEU level for direct taxes, although some main features such as tax rates and base of PIT and CIT in EAEU Member States have lots of common features. Also, it was found out that the structure of EAEU Member States’ economics differs a lot which leads to a huge difference between the amount and share of tax revenue and tax burden in Member Countries. In the end of the article the main principles and methods for tax harmonization in EAEU are suggested based on the results of the analysis and the experience of tax harmonization in EU.
H87|Problems of Quantifying Public Goods in the Healthcare Sector|A market system does not automatically lead to an optimum allocation of public goods. Market-based exchange will always lead to a deficit of a public good compared with the socially optimal level. We argue that public goods in each sector of the economy constitute an isomorphic, socioeconomic system that is not a “black box.” Thus, in order to determine the deficit of public goods, it is first necessary to investigate the available quantities versus the quality of those goods, because their performance is not only a function of public spending. There is no generally accepted methodology for doing this and there are no universal methods for quantifying public goods. The aim of this work is to develop a universal methodology for the quantification of public goods in ordinal categories, taking into account both the amount and quality of a good and budgetary valuing. In the empirical part, the authors identify various models (assets structures) of healthcare financing, using a set of OECD countries as an example. The authors also investigate to what extent these models influence the value of public goods in that sector. Composite measures have been computed for both the amount and quality of public goods. Subsequently, an agglomerative cluster analysis and a multifactorial analysis of variance are performed. Although the studied systems are diverse and reflect different social choices, the analyses show that the effectiveness of a healthcare system depends not only on the level of public financing, but also on its structure.
H87|The global carbon budget: a conflicting claims problem|Abstract An effective climate agreement is urgently required, yet conflict between parties prevails over cooperation. Thanks to advances in science it is now possible to quantify the global carbon budget, the amount of available cumulative CO2 emissions before crossing the 2 ∘C threshold (Meinshausen et al. Nature 458(7242):1158–1162, 2009). Countries carbon claims, however, exceed this. Historically such situations have been tackled with bankruptcy division rules. We argue that framing climate negotiations as a classical conflicting claims problem (O’Neill Math Soc Sci 2(4):345–371, 1982) may provide for an effective climate policy. We analyze the allocation of the global carbon budget among parties claiming the maximum emissions rights possible. Based on the selection of some desirable principles, we propose an efficient and sustainable allocation of the available carbon budget for the period 2000 to 2050 taking into account different risk scenarios.

Eigentlich gibt es in der Europäischen Union ein geeignetes Regelwerk, um überhöhte Budgetdefizite zu verhindern. Die Anwendung der Fiskalregeln hat allein aber nicht zu den angestrebten Ergebnissen geführt. Die Autoren schlagen daher die Einrichtung von politisch unabhängigen Fiskalräten vor, die eine Kontrollfunktion übernehmen könnten.
H87|Modelling corporate tax reform in the EU: New calibration and simulations with the CORTAX model|This report investigates the economic impact of the European Commission proposal for a common corporate tax base (CCTB) and a common consolidated corporate tax base with formula apportionment (CCCTB) within the EU. Furthermore, on top of the common base, it considers proposals to reduce the debt bias in corporate taxation. To do so, we employ an applied general equilibrium model (CORTAX) covering all EU Member States, featuring different firm types and modelling many key features of corporate tax regimes, including multinational profit shifting, investment decisions, loss compensation and the debt-equity choice of firms.
H87|Study on comparable data used for transfer pricing in the EU|This study aims at providing an overview and assessment of the availability and quality of market data ('comparables') used for transfer pricing purposes and, more specifically comparable searches under the Comparable Uncontrolled Price (‘CUP’) method and under the Transactional Net Margin Method (‘TNMM’)in the EU-28 Member States. More specifically, the study covers the following aspects: Assessing and evaluating situations characterising the lack and / or non-reliability of comparable data; Assessing and evaluating the situation for pan-European comparable searches ; Developing and envisaging EU-tailored solutions and possible adjustments taking into consideration some advantages and assets offered by the EU internal market ; Contribute to strengthening and effectively implementing an improved EU transfer pricing framework and fight against aggressive tax planning.
H87|Study on the application of economic valuation techniques for determining transfer prices of cross border transactions between members of multinational enterprise groups in the EU|This study provides an overview on how valuation techniques can practically and most efficiently be used for transfer pricing purposes in the EU, particularly for transactions involving intangibles. The information to support the study was gathered through desk research and interviews with transfer pricing and corporate finance valuation specialists from all EU Member States and nine of the EU’s main trade partners. The study investigates the differences between valuations for transfer pricing purposes and valuations for other purposes, and the state of play in terms of experience of the EU Member States and trade partners.
H87|Leadership in Tax Competition with Fiscal Equalization Transfers|We propose a timing game of asymmetric tax competition with fiscal equalization scheme. The study finds that governments tend to play a sequential-move game as the scale of equalization transfer increases, which explains the emergence of tax leaders in tax competition. The presence of a tax leader is likely to exacerbate capital misallocation among countries, suggesting that equalization transfers aimed at narrowing the interregional fiscal gap might cause an inefficient capital allocation.
H87|Climate Policies with Private Information: The Case for Unilateral Action|Countries often have private information about their willingness to pay for protecting the climate system. We use a principal-agent model to reexamine the economic case for unilateral action by individual countries, in our case of the principal. We find that the incentive structure that arises in an incomplete information framework may lead to a more positive assessment of unilateral action than in papers that neglect private information. First, we find that a unilateral commitment to emission reductions that is made before contract negotiations always reduces aggregate emissions, in contrast to the results in the seminal contribution by Hoel. Second, we show that the principal often has an interest to unilaterally reduce emissions below the level to which she would be obliged under the standard contract solution. Hence we provide an economic rationale for overcompliance. Multilateral externalities and type-dependent outside options, which are characteristic for climate policies, play a crucial role to explain these results.
H87|Participation and Duration of Environmental Agreements|We analyze participation in international environmental agreements in a dynamic game in which countries pollute and invest in green technologies. If complete contracts are feasible, participants eliminate the holdup problem associated with their investments; however, most countries prefer to free ride rather than participate. If investments are noncontractible, countries face a holdup problem every time they negotiate; but the free-rider problem can be mitigated and significant participation is feasible. Participation becomes attractive because only large coalitions commit to long-term agreements that circumvent the holdup problem. Under well-specified conditions even the first-best outcome is possible when the contract is incomplete.
H87|Lessons from the American Federal-State unemployment insurance system for a European unemployment benefits system|The federal-state system of unemployment insurance (UI) in the United States was established by the Social Security Act of 1935 during the Great Depression. Under the program, states provide temporary partial wage replacement to involuntarily unemployed workers with significant labor force attachment. The federal government induced states to establish UI programs through two means: 1) a uniform federal tax imposed on employer payrolls, with a 90 percent reduction granted in states operating approved UI programs, and 2) grants to states to administer their programs. The system has evolved into a collection of separate state programs adapted to different regional, economic, and cultural contexts that all meet the same standards. This paper reviews state practices concerning applicant eligibility, benefit generosity, and benefit financing, with the aim of revealing lessons for a possible European unemployment benefit system (EUBS). We examine areas of federal leadership, explicit federal-state cooperation, and state innovation. While the U.S. system offers some good ideas for setting up an EUBS, there are also lessons in some shortcomings of the U.S. experience. We identify areas of risk for individual and institutional moral hazard in a multi-tiered UI system, and give examples of monitoring methods and incentives to ameliorate such risks. We suggest approaches for gradual system development, encouraging lower-tier behavior, benefit financing, and responses to regional and system-wide crises.
H87|Partial tax harmonization through infrastructure coordination| In this article we analyze the role that infrastructure coordination plays to in achieving partial tax harmonization in a coalition of asymmetric jurisdictions. We find that infrastructure coordination with di¤erent investment levels can facilitate partial tax harmonization between asymmetric jurisdictions when asymmetries are not too large. Furthermore, agreeing on a common investment level can be even more e¤ective in facilitating partial tax harmonization between asymmetric jurisdictions. Our results explain the harmonization of corporate tax rates observed in the EU between 1995 and 2006 where there was simultaneous convergence of public infrastructure investments facilitated via EU structural funds.

H87|The value of commitment and delegation for the control of greenhouse gas emissions|We analyze a stylized model of a world consisting of a large number of countries, which derive utility from energy consumption but suffer both from the emission of greenhouse gases (smog, black carbon, etc.) as well as from the external effects caused by climate change. The countries decide individually on investments in clean (i.e., emission free) technologies for energy production, whereas a supranational environmental authority decides for each country on the maximally permitted amount of emissions of greenhouse gases. We demonstrate that the authority faces a dynamic inconsistency problem that leads to welfare losses. Yet these welfare losses can be kept small if the mandate for the authority penalizes the local cost of emissions very heavily but puts little or no weight at all on the cost of climate change.
H87|Welfare Implications of AEoI|The Automatic Exchange of Information (AEoI) is a tax standard that governs how tax authorities of participating countries exchange information related to taxpayers’ foreign investments. We quantify the mismatch between costs and benefits of information exchange agreements and investigate the impact of foreign investment taxation and costs associated with information reporting requirements on the welfare of compliant countries. This paper shows that AEoI-abiding economies would entail substantial welfare losses. For any combination of interest rate, foreign earnings taxation and compliance cost, the welfare costs of AEoI are larger for the source (small open) economy than the revenue is for the residence country. Without commitment and enforcement, countries might be tempted to deviate from such agreements and share information only partially. The paper’s result provides a rationale for sharing of AEoI infrastructure costs among jurisdictions.
H87|Accounting of pay-as-you-go pension schemes using accrued-to-date liabilities: An example for Switzerland|Due to demographic change, the fiscal sustainability of pension schemes financed on a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) basis is of more interest for policy makers than ever. Unsustainable financing brings along a future burden to pensioners through pension cuts and/or to the working population through increasing contribution rates. With comparable data about the unfunded accrued-to-date pension liabilities of social security pension schemes soon being available due to a recent update of the international System of National Accounts (2008 SNA), we present a simple framework for accounting of paygo pension schemes using these estimates of accrued-to-date liabilities. Additionally we incorporate another definition of liabilities, the current workers' and pensioners' net liabilities (CWL). Applying this accounting framework using both definitions of liabilities to the Swiss pension scheme (AHV), we show that financing of the AHV is unsustainable. In order to restore fiscal sustainability either an increase in the contribution rate to 12 percent or a cut in average pension levels of about 38 percent would be necessary.
H87|The German statutory pension scheme: Balance sheet, cross-sectional internal rates of return and implicit tax rates|We present a framework for accounting of the German statutory pension scheme and estimate a balance sheet for the years 2005 until 2012. Extending and applying the methodology proposed by Settergren and Mikula (2005), we estimate the cross-sectional internal rates of return of the German pension scheme over this period. We are able to show that the cross-sectional internal rate of return is mainly financed by increasing contributions and by changing the liabilities not backed by assets. Additionally, our results reveal that from an expenditure perspective, the major part of the internal rate of return is resulting from changing longevity rather than indexation of pension entitlements. Finally, we prove that from a cross-sectional perspective the implicit tax of a pension scheme can mainly be interpreted as an “implicit wealth tax” on pension wealth and subsequently present empirical estimates for these cross-sectional implicit tax rates.
H87|Urban cultural amenities and the migration of the creative class|This paper models the migration of the Creative Class (Florida, 2003) in a New-Economic-Geography framework. Beside wage differentials, urban cultural amenities play an important role on the choice of location. A public cultural good, financed by taxes, is introduced as an agglomeration force. The public-good is purely consumed by skilled workers. Additionally urban cultural diversity across cities is taken into account to model exogenous differences between cities. I analyze the political equilibrium of tax competition. Furthermore the effects of asymmetries of cities and trade liberalization is examined. There is an optimal level of provision of public cultural goods. In the dispersion-scenario the equilibrium tax rate for workers is hump-shaped with respect to trade integration while for skilled workers it is u-shaped. In the core-periphery scenario the equilibrium tax rate for the core decreases with increasing trade freeness.
H87|Ecological Fiscal Transfers in Europe – Evidence-Based Design Options for a Transnational Scheme|Ecological Fiscal Transfers (EFT) have recently gained attention as a promising instrument addressing public authorities to provide incentives for nature conservation. In parallel, both the EU and various European countries are exploring new mechanisms to mobilise funding to support biodiversity conservation. We develop a proposal for an EFT design within the supranational context of the EU and assess its potential effects with evidence-based estimates. We i) provide both a theoretical underpinning and a synthesis of the current EFT schemes and EU Nature Directives, ii) propose a model for EFT implementation within the existing EU funding mechanisms based on quantitative and qualitative conservation indicators, iii) analyse how resulting payments would be (spatially) distributed among European regions, and iv) discuss the model outcomes in terms of ecological effectiveness, distributive effects and cost-effectiveness. We thereby contribute to the debate about how to better integrate ecological public functions within multi-level and supra-national governance structures.
H87|First the stick, then the carrot? A cross-country evaluation of the OECD's initiative against harmful tax competition|In 1998 the OECD launched one of the most comprehensive initiatives ever to combat harmful tax competition. The following paper analyzes how companies' investment activities in tax havens are associated with the three most salient elements of the OECD initiative. Our analysis is based on a U.S. and on a German panel data set. The results suggest that the investment activities of both countries' companies in tax havens are negatively associated with the first element, i.e., the tax havens' public status as being blacklisted. We additionally find that the two subsequent elements of the initiative, that is, the tax havens' commitments to the OECD standards of transparency and the existence of bilateral information exchange agreements, are positively associated with U.S. companies' investment activities in these countries. Unlike the U.S. case, tax havens' commitments are negatively associated with German companies' investment activities, while the evidence is mixed for the case of a bilateral information exchange agreement with Germany. We interpret our findings in the light of reputational effects.
H87|The political economy of multilateral aid funds|"In 2014 over $60 billion was mobilized to help developing nations mitigate climate change, an amount equivalent to the GDP of Kenya. Interestingly, breaking from the traditional model of bilateral aid, donor countries distributed nearly fifty percent of their aid through multilateral aid funds (OECD, 2015). In this paper, we show that by delegating aid spending to an international fund, donor countries mitigate a ""hold-up"" problem that occurs when donor countries are tempted to allocate aid based on, say, a regional preference. That is, under bilateral aid, donor-country bias decreases the incentive of recipient countries to invest in measures such as good governance that increase the effectiveness of aid. By delegating allocation decisions to a fund, however, donor countries commit to allocating aid via centralized bargaining, which provides recipient countries with an increased incentive to invest. Additionally, we show that allocating funding by majority rule further increases recipient-country investment, since higher investment increases the probability that a recipient's project will be selected by the endogenous majority coalition, and detail conditions under which majority is the optimal voting rule."
H87|Trade Costs, CO2, and the Environment|This paper quantifies how international trade affects CO2 emissions and analyzes the welfare consequences of regulating the CO2 emissions from shipping. To this end, the paper describes a model of trade and the environment, compiles new data on the CO2 emissions from shipping, and estimates key parameters using panel data regressions. Results show that the benefits of international trade exceed trade's environmental costs due to CO2 emissions by two orders of magnitude. While proposed regional carbon taxes on the CO2 emissions from shipping would increase global welfare and increase the implementing region's GDP, they would also harm poor countries.
H87|A Glimpse Into The Offshore World After “Panama Papers”|In the light of the latest leak of offshore documents, Panama Papers, the purpose of this article is to analyse a set of data made available, that reveals important information on the offshore world and the mechanisms by which it functions. There are identified the main business structures and tax benefits that are offered under the Panamanian legislation, as well as that of other offshore jurisdictions that are being used in the construction of tax planning schemes aimed at obtaining important tax benefits. The results of the analysis present interesting findings regarding the offshore financial services industry, the intermediaries involved in the structuring of tax planning schemes and the most commonly used offshore jurisdictions in tax structuring plans.
H87|International Coordination in Asylum Provision|This article summarises theoretical studies on asylum provision in multi-country settings. The common feature of their models is the assumption that asylum-related policies of safe countries generate cross-border externalities. The presence of externalities results in inefficiently low provision of asylum. The studies explore ways to increase asylum provision to the efficient level, but reveal more difficulties than a solution.
H87|Does Trade Liberalization Affects International Trade Tax Revenue? Evidence from Dynamic Panel Threshold Method|This paper examines the relationship between trade liberalization and trade tax revenues applying an advanced dynamic panel threshold technique. The empirical analysis is based on a large panel-dataset including 103 developing countries for the period 1993-2012. The empirical finding results indicate that the relationship between trade liberalization and trade tax revenue is non-liner and also provide evidence of a Laffer effect. In particular, we find that additional trade liberalization has a negative impact on trade tax revenue, but this negative effect will disappear at the higher levels of trade liberalization. The results point to harness the benefits of trade liberalization without having worry a lot about its impact on trade tax revenues.
H87|The tax burden on banks over the period 2006-2014|Following the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), concerns about having a level playing field become more important due to the heterogeneity in bank taxation rules across Europe: measuring the tax burden can provide a first rough measure of the extent of heterogeneity across countries. After a review of the main differences in banks taxation between Italy, France, Germany, Spain and the UK, the paper provides estimates for the tax burden and deferred tax assets in these countries over the years 2006-2014; the impact of differences in taxation on bank profitability is also examined. Moreover, the paper carries out a more in-depth analysis of Italian banks by considering both individual balance sheet data and aggregate tax return data. The impact of tax measures on financial stability and on profitability is further analysed. The comparative analysis points to a wide heterogeneity across countries in the tax treatment of the banking sector. This suggests that it would be advantageous to explore possible ways to make the tax systems of the countries participating in the SSM more homogeneous; a first step could be to harmonize tax bases.
H87|The Dynamics of Climate Agreements|This paper analyzes a framework in which countries over time pollute and invest in green technologies. Without a climate treaty, the countries pollute too much and invest too little, particularly if intellectual property rights are weak. Nevertheless, short-term agreements on emission levels then reduce every country's payoff, since countries invest less when they anticipate future negotiations. If intellectual property rights are weak, the agreement should be tougher and more long-term. Conversely, if the climate agreement happens to be short-term or absent, intellectual property rights should be strengthened or technological licensing subsidized.
H87|The Dynamics Of Climate Agreements|I develop a dynamic model of private provision of public bads allowing investments in technologies. The analysis is tractable and the MPE unique. The framework is used to derive optimal incomplete contracts in a dynamic setting. While the noncooperative equilibrium is very inefficient, short-term contracts can be worse due to hold-up problems. The optimal long-term contract is more ambitious if its length is relatively short and the technological spillover large. The optimal length increases in this externality. With renegotiation, the outcome is first best. The results have several implications for how to design a climate treaty.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H87|Should the Carbon Price Be the Same in All Countries?|International differences in fuel taxation are huge, and may be justified by different local negative externalities that taxes must correct, as well as by different preferences for public spending. In this context, should a worldwide unique carbon tax be added to these local taxes to correct the global warming externality? We address this question in a second best framework à la Ramsey, where public goods have to be financed through distortionary taxation and the cost of public funds has to be weighted against the utility of public goods. We show that when lump-sum transfers between countries are allowed for, the second best tax on the polluting good may be decomposed into three parts: one, country specific, dealing with the local negative externality, a second one, country specific, dealing with the cost of public funds, and a third one, global, dealing with the global externality and which can be interpreted as the carbon price. Our main contribution is to show that the uniqueness of the carbon price should still hold in this second best framework. Nevertheless, if lump-sum transfers between governments are impossible to implement, international differentiation of the carbon price is the only way to take care of equity concerns<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H87|COP 21 and Economic Theory: Taking Stock|The texts of the COP?21?Decision and its Annex are scrutinized from the particular point of view of the extent to which economic theoretic concepts can be considered to inspire them. While this is shown to be partially the case in some of the intentions, the texts themselves contain more diplomatically formulated promises than effective implementation of relevant mainstream well established economic concepts.
H87|Implementing Tax Coordination and Harmonization through Voluntary Commitment|Pareto-improving tax coordination, and even tax harmonization, are Nash implementable between sovereign countries without any supranational tax authorities. Following Schelling's approach, we consider voluntary commitment, which constrains countries' respective tax rate choices. We develop a commitment game where countries choose their strategy sets in preliminary stages and play consistently during the final one. We determine the set of tax rates, which are implementable by commitment. This allows countries to reach Pareto-improving equilibriums. We also establish that complete tax harmonization may emerge as the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of the commitment game as long as the asymmetry between countries remains limited. Our analysis contributes to the rationale of tax ranges and, more broadly, of non binding but self-enforcing commitments (not equivalent to cheap talk) in the context of tax competition.
H87|The Exploitation Hypothesis in a Public Good Economy: Some Extensions|Since Olson’s (1965) The Logic of Collective Action, the exploitation hypothesis, in which the rich shoulders the provision burden of public goods for the poor, has held sway despite empirical exceptions. To address such exceptions, we establish two alternative exploitation hypotheses based on asymmetric preferences or on productivity differences regarding the public good. The classic hypothesis and its two variants are proven in a novel fashion. Our theoretical insights are then illustrated by some empirical examples from the field of international public goods, such as military defence and cross-border pollution.
H87|Reconciling insurance with market discipline: A blueprint for a European fiscal union|This contribution develops a blueprint for a European fiscal union. The proposal addresses the shortcomings of most other reform designs which do not offer a solution for insolvent or noncooperative euro countries. We suggest a design which combines fiscal insurance with an orderly procedure to restructure the debt of an insolvent euro member. We show that fiscal insurance and a sovereign insolvency procedure are no contradiction but, on the contrary, mutually enforcing: An effective fiscal insurance helps to limit the stability risks involved in the implementation of an insolvency regime for sovereigns. And vice versa, a well-defined insolvency procedure reduces the danger that a fiscal capacity motivated as an insurance against transitory asymmetric shocks degenerates into a permanent transfer system. Moreover, we show that both elements are a helpful complement for the functioning of the European banking union and the new European fiscal governance.
H87|The Political Economy of Multilateral Aid Funds|In 2014 over $60 billion was mobilized to help developing nations mitigate climate change, an amount equivalent to the GDP of Kenya. Interestingly, breaking from the traditional model of bilateral aid, donor countries distributed nearly fifty percent of their aid through multilateral aid funds (OECD, 2015). In this paper, we show that by delegating aid spending to an international fund, donor countries mitigate a “hold-up” problem that occurs when donor countries are tempted to allocate aid based on, say, a regional preference. That is, under bilateral aid, donor-country bias decreases the incentive of recipient countries to invest in measures such as good governance that increase the effectiveness of aid. By delegating allocation decisions to a fund, however, donor countries commit to allocating aid via centralized bargaining, which provides recipient countries with an increased incentive to invest. Additionally, we show that allocating funding by majority rule further increases recipient-country investment, since higher investment increases the probability that a recipient's project will be selected by the endogenous majority coalition, and detail conditions under which majority is the optimal voting rule.
H87|Decentralized Leadership|This paper studies the efficiency of decentralized leadership in federations where selfish regional governments provide regional and federal public goods and the benevolent central government implements interregional earmarked and income transfers. Without residential mobility, unlimited decentralized leadership is efficient only if the center implements redistributive interregional income and earmarked transfers to equate consumption of private and regional public goods across regions. Such policies perfectly align the incentives of the selfish regional governments. With imperfect residential mobility, decentralized leadership is efficient if the center adopts redistributive interregional income and earmarked policies and there is a common labor market in the federation.

A New Comprehensive Data Set|This paper critically reviews the theoretical basis for the provision of the global financial safety net (GFSN) and provide a comprehensive database covering four elements of the GFSN (foreign exchange reserves, IMF financing, central bank swap lines and regional financing arrangements) for over 150 countries in the sample period 1960-2015. This paper also presents some key stylised facts regarding the provision of GFSN financing and compares macroeconomic outcomes in capital flow reversal episodes depending on how much GFSN financing was available to countries. Finally, this paper concludes with some avenues for further research on the possible evolution of the GFSN.
H87|On the Efficiency of Destination and Origin Commodity Taxation in the Presence of Consumption Generated Cross-Border Pollution|We combine consumption generated cross-border pollution and public pollution abatement in a theoretical framework to examine the efficiency of the destination and origin principles of commodity taxation. The key result of our study is that with public pollution abatement, the non-cooperative equilibrium origin-based consumption taxes are set efficiently. This result holds not only in the context of symmetric countries, but under certain conditions carry over also to asymmetric countries. The non-cooperative equilibrium destination-based consumption taxes are inefficient. In the absence of public pollution abatement, the Nash equilibrium commodity taxes under either taxation principle are inefficient.
H87|The New Role of the World Bank - Working Paper 421|The World Bank was founded to correct failures in international capital markets. That role has shifted over the past 70 years. Modern analyses should proceed from the premise that the Bank’s central goal is and should be to reduce extreme poverty. We show that the vast majority of donor subsidies to the Bank go to its funding vehicles aimed at the poorest nations. We argue that the Bank’s principal impact arises through its influence on national policies, and that economic theory suggests such influence is often best exerted multilaterally. This view implies new ways to structure and evaluate the institution.
H87|Incentives to tax foreign investors|Abstract This paper shows that a small country can have an incentive to tax inbound FDI even in a setting with perfect competition and free entry that is compatible with the Diamond–Mirrlees (Am Econ Rev 61(1):8–27, 1971) framework. While firms make no aggregate profits worldwide due to free entry in this setting, they make taxable profits in foreign production locations because their costs are partly incurred in their home countries. These profits are not perfectly mobile because firm productivity varies across locations. Consequently, the host country does not bear the entire burden of a tax on foreign firms, giving rise to an incentive to tax foreign investors. The standard zero optimal tax result can be recovered in this model under an apportionment system that ensures zero economic profits in each location.
H87|Taxing and Subsidizing Foreign Investors|Many countries impose taxes on foreign investors while also having in place targeted subsidies that are designed to attract them. This paper shows that such a policy can be optimal for a host country. The government has an incentive to tax inframarginal firms because they are relatively immobile and an incentive to subsidize marginal firms because the economic activity generated by such a subsidy can increase domestic wages in excess of the fiscal cost. These policies improve domestic welfare at the expense of foreigners. Hence, this analysis can explain why tax coordination efforts can simultaneously entail reduced taxes and subsidies.
H87|Drowned by Numbers? Designing an EU-wide Unemployment Insurance|The severity of the recent crisis has given rise to several proposals for the creation of a European unemployment insurance system. In this paper, we first explore the theoretical backgrounds of a common insurance system. We, then, analyze the main features of an EU-wide unemployment insurance, and explore its financial and political sustainability, under different scenarios, including a “US-equivalent” one. We finally highlight key issues with regard to implementation and potential undesirable effects.
H87|La globalización y sus relaciones con la tributación, una constatación para América Latina y la OCDE|En este artículo se revisan los principales retos que implica la globalización para los sistemas tributarios en el mundo y se propone un ejercicio econométrico que incluye a países de la OCDE y América Latina para identificar qué impuestos se han afectado. Se acude al índice de globalización de Dreher por ser una medición más acorde con la naturaleza multidimensional del fenómeno. Se encuentra que la recaudación de los impuestos sobre la renta personal y el comercio internacional se asocian negativamente con el avance de la globalización, pero no ocurre así con los impuestos a la renta empresarial, al consumo o al capital, ni con la presión tributaria. ***** This paper considers the main challenges of globalization on tax systems and presents an econometric exercise that takes into account OECD and Latin American countries aiming at identifying which taxes have been particularly affected. We use the KOF index because it is a multidimensional measurement of globalization. Our findings suggest that revenue for taxes on personal income and international trade are related (negatively) to globalization; on the other hand, tax burden and taxes on corporate income, consumption and capital are not.
H87|Equilibrium leadership in tax competition models with capital ownership: a rejoinder|Abstract This paper reconciles two opposite results in the tax competition literature. Kempf and Rota-Graziosi (J Public Econ 94(9–10):768–776, 2010) and Hindriks and Nishimura (J Public Econ 121:66–68, 2015) have shown that the two Stackelberg outcomes prevail as the subgame perfect equilibria when capital is entirely owned by nonresidents. However, Ogawa (Int Tax Public Finance 20(3):474–484, 2013) has shown that the simultaneous-move outcome prevails when capital is entirely owned by residents. We develop a model in which capital ownership can vary freely between these two polar cases. We show that there exists a unique degree of residential capital ownership such that the equilibrium switches from the Stackelberg to the simultaneous-move outcomes. The chance for the simultaneous-move outcome to prevail increases with the extent of production asymmetry between regions. Partial ownership also induces a novel effect of tax leadership that we call the preference reversion effect.
H87|Tax treaties with developing countries and the allocation of taxing rights|Abstract Worldwide income taxation in the country of residence is a legal dogma of international taxation. We question this dogma from the perspective of relations between developed and developing countries from legal and economic perspectives, and make a modern and fair proposal for tax treaties. We show under which conditions a developing and a developed country will voluntarily sign a tax treaty where the developing country is more inclined to share the information with the developed country and whether they should share revenues. Moreover, we demonstrate how the conclusion of a tax treaty can assist in the implementation of a tax audit system in the developing country.
H87|Tackling Spillovers by Taxing Corporate Income in the European Union at Source|This paper surveys and evaluates the corporation tax (CT) systems of the Member States of the European Union on the basis of a comprehensive taxonomy of actual and potential regimes, which have as their base either profits, profits and interest, or economic rents. The current regimes give rise to various instate and interstate spillovers, which violate the basic tenets â€“ neutrality and subsidiarity â€“ of the single market. The trade-offs between the implications of these tenets â€“ harmonization and diversity, respectively â€“ can be reconciled by a bottom-up, reversible strategy of strengthening source-based taxation and approximating tax rates. The strategy starts with dual income taxation, proceeds with final source withholding taxes and rate approximation, and is made complete by comprehensive business income taxation. Common base taxation, if desired, should probably be left to the Member States themselves.
H87|Environmental awareness: The case of climate change|"The extent of provision of a public good often relies on social awareness and public support for it. This applies, in particular, to global reduction of greenhouse gases and its relevance for mitigating climate change. We examine the concept of ""public awareness"" by introducing a formal model that analyzes efforts to mitigate climate change in a setting with heterogeneous countries. In the theoretical part we examine the Nash equilibrium of the contribution game. The effects of awareness and economic parameters on mitigation efforts can be disentangled, raising the possibility of linking awareness of climate change with economic wealth. The second part provides some empirical observations and offers the rankings of countries regarding awareness for climate change, as well as an empirical relationship between awareness and economic wealth."
H87|Discrimination in Dynamic Procurement Design with Learning-by-doing|Discriminatory programs that favor local and small firms in government procurement are common in many countries. This paper studies the long-run impact of procurement discrimination on market structure and future competition in industries where learning-by-doing makes incumbent firms more efficient over time. We consider a sequential procurement design problem in which local and global firms compete for public good provision. Both firms benefit from learning-by-doing if they provide the public good in the previous period but global firms only may be able to transfer learning-by-doing from different markets. We find that the optimal procurement has to be biased in favor of the local firm even when all firms are symmetric with respect to their initial cost distribution. This bias fosters future competition and reduces intertemporal expected transfers to providers.
H87|Does inflation cause growth in the reform-era China? Theory and evidence|The government reaps seigniorage revenue from higher rates of money growth, hiring away more workers from entrepreneurs (the government crowding-out effect). There is also a positive seigniorage effect when part of the revenue goes to entrepreneurs, acting as a subsidy to R&D. When the government retains a larger share of the revenue, the government crowding-out effect dominates, and inflation retards growth. When entrepreneurs get the larger share, the seigniorage effect dominates, and inflation increases growth. Both OLS (ordinary least squares) and IV (instrumental variable) regressions using time-series data during 1979–2014 in China show that differenced inflation (to ensure stationarity) has a significantly positive effect on growth. When we use the level of inflation, we find that a 1 percentage point increase in annual inflation would bring a 0.53 percentage point increase in annual growth of per worker real GDP. The robust, causal effect of inflation on growth in China provides support for our theory.

H87|The political drivers of renewable energies policies|This paper empirically analyzes how political factors affect the deployment of renewable energy (RE) sources and compares their explanatory power to that of other economic, energy and environmental drivers that have received greater attention in the literature so far. The sample encompasses the EU countries bound to attain the target of 20% share of gross final energy consumption by 2020. The panel data analysis shows that lobbying by the manufacturing industry negatively affects RE deployment, whereas standard measures of government quality show a positive effect; furthermore, left-wing parties promote the deployment of RE more than right-wing parties.
H87|Coordination and the fight against tax havens|The success or failure of the fight against tax havens is the outcome of a many player coordination game between a tax haven and its potential investors. Key determinants are the costly international pressure and the size of the haven country's revenue pool. The latter is determined endogenously by the decisions of many individual investors. Our analysis suggests a non-standard market model that explains why haven countries would ever comply with international standards of transparency despite the large empirically observable returns in the tax haven business. It also alludes to why service fees in tax havens can be positive despite a competitive financial market with multiple tax havens. Furthermore, we identify a trade-off between the fight against tax havens and high tax rates. Finally, low fines for disclosed offshore tax evasion, e.g. in special programs for tax evaders who voluntarily report their offshore wealth, strengthen haven countries against international pressure.
H87|The market for conservation and other hostages|A “conservation good” (such as a tropical forest) is owned by a seller who is tempted to consume (or cut), but a buyer benefits more from conservation. The seller prefers to conserve if the buyer is expected to buy, but the buyer is unwilling to pay as long as the seller conserves. This contradiction implies that the market for conservation cannot be efficient and conservation is likely to fail. A leasing market is inefficient for similar reasons and dominates the sales market if and only if the consumption value and the buyer's protection cost are large. The theory thus explains why optimal conservation often fails and why conservation abroad is leased, while domestic conservation is bought.
H87|The Differential Effects of Bilateral Tax Treaties|Bilateral tax treaties (BTTs) are intended to promote foreign direct investment through double-taxation relief. Using BEA firm-level data, we find a positive effect of BTTs on FDI, which is larger for firms that use differentiated inputs. BTTs allow multinational firms to request assistance from treaty partners' governments if they have a grievance about how tax liabilities are determined. These provisions disproportionately benefit firms that use inputs for which an arm's-length price is difficult to observe, since allocation of earnings across countries is more complex. We find differential BTT effects for both sales by existing affiliates and entry of new affiliates.

H87|International Taxation and Cross-Border Banking|This paper examines empirically how international taxation affects the volume and pricing of cross-border banking activities for a sample of banks in 38 countries over the 1998?2008 period. International double taxation of foreign-source bank income is found to reduce banking-sector FDI. Furthermore, such taxation is almost fully passed on into higher interest margins charged abroad. These results imply that international double taxation distorts the activities of international banks, and that the incidence of international double taxation of banks is on bank customers in the foreign subsidiary country.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H87|Heterogeneous firms, 'profit shifting' FDI and international tax competition|Larger firms are more likely to use tax haven operations to exploit international tax differences. We study tax competition between a large country and a tax haven. In the large country, heterogeneous firms operate under monopolistic competition and can choose to shift profits abroad. We show that a higher degree of firm heterogeneity (a mean-preserving spread of the cost distribution) increases the degree of tax competition, i.e. it decreases the equilibrium tax rate of the large country, leads to higher outflows of its tax base and thus decreases its equilibrium tax revenues. Similar effects hold for a higher substitutability across varieties.
H87|Is a transactions tax an effective means to stabilize the foreign exchange market?|The desirability of a transactions tax in the foreign exchange market, or Tobintax, depends on whether the tax deters short-term, destabilizing trade. While supporters claim that the tax would be a deterrent for short-term capital flows, critics contend that the deterrent capability of the tax would be limited. This paper attempts to resolve some lingering questions about the arithmetic of a transactions tax, and concludes that a tax would raise the required return from trade for any time horizon, and thus deter all trades driven by small expected capital gains (i.e., smaller than the square of one plus the tax rate), and not necessarily those driven by a short horizon of the investor. The paper then explores the consequences of this result on the effectiveness of the tax within competing paradigms and concludes that a Tobin tax is not likely to be an effective means to reach the declared objectives.

H87|Tax Exporting: An Analysis Using A Multiregional CGE Model|This paper investigates whether devoloped coutries export taxes to developing countries, contributing to the deterioration of their terms of trade and welfare; that is to what extent the distribution of gains from trade is being affected not by existing tariffs in developed countries, which are already at low levels, but by their domestic taxation. An eight-region CGE model for the world economy is used. The results indicate that developed regions export capital taxes to developing regions. However, the effects of import tariffs on welfare and terms of trade are larger than those of domestic taxes
