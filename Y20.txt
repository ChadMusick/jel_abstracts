Y20|Child well-being and the Sustainable Development Goals: How far are OECD countries from reaching the targets for children and young people?|This paper summarises available evidence on the distance that OECD countries need to travel in order to reach the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets for children and young people. More than 50 indicators are included in this analysis, covering 43 of the 169 targets, and 11 of the 17 Goals. The analysis finds that, on average, OECD countries are still far from reaching the targets pertaining to Goals 4 “Quality education”, and 8 “Decent work and economic growth”. Goals 1 “No poverty”, 2 “Zero hunger” and 16 “Peace, justice and strong institutions” are also highlighted as priority areas. However, the results vary widely across OECD countries, and among specific targets within each of the goals. Yet, all of these findings need to be considered in light of what it is not currently possible to measure. In particular, there are large data gaps for Goals 1 (“No poverty”), 5 (“Gender equality”), 11 (“Sustainable cities and communities”), and 16 (“Peace, justice and strong institutions”).
Y20|“Reverse Engineering” The Pitching Research Template: A Simple Tool to Help Understand the Academic Literature|"Academic literature can be wordy and hard to understand. This letter discusses the application of the ""pitching research"" template by Faff (2015, 2016) as a useful tool to help PhD students in understanding the literature – and particularly the “key” papers – that they read for their research. The authors also offer personal reflections on the experience of using the pitch template for this purpose and encourage other PhD students to use it to aid their research."
Y20|Machine learning at central banks|We introduce machine learning in the context of central banking and policy analyses. Our aim is to give an overview broad enough to allow the reader to place machine learning within the wider range of statistical modelling and computational analyses, and provide an idea of its scope and limitations. We review the underlying technical sources and the nascent literature applying machine learning to economic and policy problems. We present popular modelling approaches, such as artificial neural networks, tree-based models, support vector machines, recommender systems and different clustering techniques. Important concepts like the bias-variance trade-off, optimal model complexity, regularisation and cross-validation are discussed to enrich the econometrics toolbox in their own right. We present three case studies relevant to central bank policy, financial regulation and economic modelling more widely. First, we model the detection of alerts on the balance sheets of financial institutions in the context of banking supervision. Second, we perform a projection exercise for UK CPI inflation on a medium-term horizon of two years. Here, we introduce a simple training-testing framework for time series analyses. Third, we investigate the funding patterns of technology start-ups with the aim to detect potentially disruptive innovators in financial technology. Machine learning models generally outperform traditional modelling approaches in prediction tasks, while open research questions remain with regard to their causal inference properties.

Y20|Strengthening the Management of Ubiquitous Internet by Refining ISO/IEC 27001 Implementation Using a Generic Responsibility Model|The recent emergence of decentralized networks and ubiquitous Internet has highlighted the need for a better management of the companies’ IT architecture and for an improvement of the users of the network’s responsibility. Many standards have recently emerged to face these requirements. By analyzing them, we observe that they all include reference to the user responsibility but also that no common understanding of it exists. These statements have oriented our research toward the elaboration of an innovative, simple and pragmatic responsibility model that includes a user commitment dimension. ISO/IEC 27001:2005 is one of that new standard that aims at providing a framework for improving the information system management and the security of IT architecture. Although this standard is recognized over the globe, many surveys and cases studies provide interesting feedback about its implementation problems. In this paper, we introduce our responsibility model, we depict the responsibility aspects encompassed in ISO 27001 and we propose some improvement perspectives to face these problems and strengthen its implementation.
Y20|Management Framework for the Visualization of Smart Monitoring Architectures Apply to Distributed Ubiquity Mobility Platform|Smart Mobility is proved to be a high priority topic in regard to arising European societal challenges. Deploying smart mobility required both technological and monitoring knowledge, and one important key features of the initiative stay in the multiplicity of the final users. Its goal is, depending on the type of users, to provide the required accurate data through a dynamic monitoring application. This implies to collect data coming from physical sensors deployed in all the parking areas of a region. Those sensors are simple, meaning that the information that they can collect is limited to an entry or exit signal of a vehicle. This paper presents an architecture for applying the visualization of smart monitoring architecture to a distributed ubiquity mobility platform and show a deployment in the frame of a use case. The later has been developed in a European region and consists in a smart mobility monitoring project.

Una Introducción A La Evaluación Realista Y Sus Métodos<BR>[What Works, For Whom, In What Respects, To What Extent, In What Contexts, And How? An Introduction To Realist Evaluation And Its Methods]|Este artículo introduce la Evaluación Realista (ER) para el análisis de políticos públicas. La ER encuentra justificación en las limitaciones de prácticas dominantes, como las técnicas de evaluación de impacto, para ofrecer explicaciones sobre el porqué una intervención o programa tuvo (o no) resultado. La noción de cambio o transformación de la ER se centra en el estudio contextual de la agencia humana, o la forma en que individuos y colectividades actúan frente a iniciativas públicas o privadas orientadas a resolver problemáticas sociales. El texto se adentra en propuestas metodológicos para el despliegue de una ER en la práctica, tarea que implicará un trabajo interdisciplinario para refinar diferentes teorías sobre qué funciona, para quién, en qué aspectos, hasta qué punto, en qué contexto y cómo. Su adherencia al realismo científico hace de la ER una alternativa democrática, pero rigurosa, para contribuir en la generación de diseños más pertinentes de políticas públicas.
Y20|Cryptocurrency Voting Games|This work shows that weighted majority voting games occur in cryptocurrencies. In particular, two such games are highlighted. The first game, which we call the Rule Game, pertains to the scenario where the entities in the system engage in a voting procedure to accept or reject a change of rules. The second game, which we call the Attack Game, refers to the scenario where a group of entities in a cryptocurrency system can form a coalition to engage in double spending. For the Rule Game we provide analysis to argue that the Coleman’s preventive power measure is the appropriate tool for measuring a player’s influence in the game while for the Attack Game, we define a notion of stability based on the notion of minimal winning coalitions. For both the Rule Game and the Attack Game, we show how to analyse the games based on a snapshot of real world data for Bitcoin which is presently the most popular of all the cryptocurrencies.

Y20|Review of information systems research for media industry–recent advances, challenges, and introduction of information systems research in the media industry|Abstract Global media reports clearly show a tremendous increase in spending on Information Technology (IT) and Information Systems (IS) in the media sector. Two main trends are currently visible. First, as stated in McKinsey & Company’s Global Media Report, consumers continuously shift from spending on traditional media products towards rapidly-increasing spending on digital services and media products – consumer patterns have rapidly changed. Second, as stated in Gartner’s reports about the media industry, spending on IT services in the media industry increases gradually, and as a whole, the media industry is the third-largest spender on IT, after banking/finance and manufacturing. Third, as reported by both authors in their works, several facets of the media industry have undergone extreme changes, including business models, declining revenue, content models, management, economics and public funding. The aim of this study is to investigate research work related to IS in the media industry, in particular in the management and economic areas. To conduct this study, we investigated a large corpus of studies that have been contributed to IS research within the Association for Information Systems (AIS) within the past decades. We utilised advanced text mining methods to identify contributions and thematic areas. Our results clearly indicate that there is a significant downward trend of research works dealing with media industry aspects. This trend was a surprise to us, as it contradicts the emergence of new digital technologies which became key drivers in the media industry after 2009. We conclude this article by giving research directions, illustrating the opportunities and importance of investigating media industries within the context of IS, and introducing the research field of Information Systems in the eMedia Industry.

Ulrike Malmendier and Geoffrey Tate consider ""Behavioral CEOs: The Role of Managerial Overconfidence."" Kent Daniel and David Hirshleifer discuss ""Overconfident Investors, Predictable Returns, and Excessive Trading."" A number of insights and lessons emerge for our understanding of markets, public policy, and welfare. How do firms take advantage of consumer overconfidence? Might government attempts to rule out such practices end up providing benefits to some consumers but imposing costs on others? How are empirical measures of CEO overconfidence related to investment and the capital structure of firms? Can overconfidence among at least some investors help to explain prominent anomalies in stock markets like high levels of trading volume and certain predictable patterns in stock market returns?"
Y20|How to Write and Publish A Scientific Paper: A Closer Look to Eastern European Economics, Business and Management Journals|Background: Scientific research publishing carries significant role in the development of the society. Apart from the dissemination of knowledge, there are also motives for publication of scientific research results at the level of individual researchers. Objectives: The goal of the paper is to propose simple, yet highly applicable advice when pursuing the publication of a paper in a scientific journal providing a closer look to economics, business and management journals that focus on Eastern European countries. Methods/Approach: The 4 Cs model of scientific writing and publication is presented, based on four questions: (1) How to pick a topic relevant for publication?; (2) How to select a journal for possible publication?; (3) How to structure the paper in accordance with the IMRAD format?, and (4) How to efficiently write the paper? Results: Step-by-step application of the 4C’s model is presented in the paper with an outlook to economics, business and management journals that focus on Eastern European countries. Conclusions: Publication in a scientific journal is an important venue for scientific researchers. In preparing the presentation of the scientific research results for the publication, number of issues relating content, style, composition and presentation should be taken into account.

Y20|The Game of Mathematics in Liberature|The presentation will focus on the recent artistic phenomenon called liberature, in the context of its mathematical qualities. In this literary trend which inextricably connects the textual and physical layer of the work, each element is expected to be created according to a certain formula which, in turn, should bring a holistic piece of literature. Artistic pieces similar to liberature have existed for several thousand years, and nowadays researchers tend to call them proto-liberary. However, after 1999, with the advent of theoretical and critical insights on liberature in Poland and elsewhere, much more mathematically-oriented works have appeared which are strictly liberary. In the presentation, I will base on the theoretical idea behind liberature when discussing Zenon Fajfer?s liberary work Ten Letters (Pol. Dwadzie?cia jeden liter [twenty-one letters]). The piece will be analysed mainly from the point of view of geometry and the intriguing play with numbers, which is visible already in the very title ? the ten-lettered word Ten Letters. Both of the mathematical elements enumerated ? i.e., the game of numbers and geometry ? are inextricably connected with the liberary construction of the whole volume and of language in Fajfer?s work.

Y20|Marketizing the up-to-date forecasting|Marketizing the up-to-date forecasting is a component of its general transformation process. It reflects the fluctuating relation between forecasting and market mechanism. In this study it is considered an interaction between making estimates and the market logic. The following aspects are monitored: 1) intensive introduction of the forecasting elaboration process into the market supply, making forecasting an object of business activity and offering forecasts as goods in the market exchange; 2) the changes in the forecast functions in the capital accumulation process within the financial sector.

Breve recuento de la legislación minera en Colombia (1829 – 2001)|Este documento presenta un breve recuento de la legislación minera en el país durante su vida republicana, esto es, desde 1829, fecha en que Simón Bolívar expidió el decreto sobre minas o Ley minera, hasta 2001, cuando se expidió el Código de Minas que rige en la actualidad. El objetivo del texto consiste en describir cómo han cambiado, a lo largo del tiempo, el conjunto de reglas y los objetivos de la política minera a nivel nacional para así identificar sus rasgos centrales, principales cambios y continuidades. La descripción se estructura alrededor de los siguientes ejes temáticos: 1) propiedad del recurso minero; 2) sistemas legales o instrumentos jurídicos que regularon el proceso de su aprovechamiento; 3) relación entre minería y entorno (ambiente y comunidades); y 4) legalización y formalización. El documento hace un breve recuento de cerca de doscientos años de historia de la legislación minera y busca servir de herramienta académica de consulta general para nutrir e informar el debate actual, ubicándolo en su contexto histórico.
Y20|How crime affects economic performance: The case of Guatemala|The impact of crime on economic growth is obviously substantial, but measuring the degree of its effects on a country's economic performance is subject to a great deal of uncertainty. This paper primarily attempts to close this gap using the economics of crime monitoring model, a new economic instrument that could be used to evaluate the impact of crime on economic performance. Guatemala was used to illustrate the applicability of the model from where analyses provide a coherent evaluation of the degree to which crime can affect a country's economic performance.
Y20|Economy as the value streams. Preliminary study|Economy can be generally described as a bunch of value streams. At least a part of capital accumulation is assumed to be the consequence of value stream blockage, and a means too keep such blockage. Negative relation between capital accumulation and foreign trade balance coming out from this assumption is supported by the data from national accounts, and hence justify the idea of economy as the value streams. A lot of research ideas are following this assertion, most of them promising results useful for socio-economic policies, and for optimizing institutions and business practices in order to make them more conductive to capital flows.
Y20|Conversant for the Prisoners of Earth|A study explained the nature of astronomical objects and their movement in an orbit of momentum. Not only some astronomical objects have been identified in a simpler form but also provided their characteristics. On the basis of this analysis and interpretation of estimated phenomena and the visibility of objects in Universe, the Core concept has been identified to explain the movement in a space and causes that are responsible for universal theorem. The purpose of the study is to provide better understanding of relationship among gravity, distance and time with the support of laws of astrophysics. An assumption was made for a constant factor that (P) is the product of distance covered by the body and gravitational force acting on it. An empirical derivation has been deployed with help of supported standard equations in order to explain the association whereas further research is possible in developing the relation and association of other astrophysics factors or lead the current study towards the theory.

Y20|A Case Study on Intercultural Literacy of Newcomer Children in Kobe|This paper sheds light on the process of intercultural literacy acquisition of newcomer children (NCC) in a youth program organized for them by an NPO which is working to create a multicultural society. Based on the observations done with an NPO in Kobe,the learning process in the initial stage of intercultural literacy development was closely examined. Intercultural literacy includes the ability of NCC to recognize and express their own opinions and perspectives as ethnic minorities in their host society. By having dialogue with other participants in the youth program, the newcomer children gain approval of their own ethnicity, knowledge about the situation of foreign people in Japan, etc. Uponparticipating in the program, the newcomer children advanced from beingparticipants and settlers, to expressionistsas they subsequently acquired intercultural literacy.

Y20|How Crime can Affect Economic Performance through the Application of an ECM-Model: the Case of Guatemala|Crime has a potentially large impact on economic growth but measuring their economic impact is subject to a great deal of uncertainty. The central objective of this paper is to set forth a model – the economics of crime monitoring model (ECM-Model) – to evaluate the impact of crime on economic performance. The model is based on five basic indicators – (i) the total crime frequency rate (β); (ii) the national crime vulnerability rate (μT); (iii) the crime devastation magnitude rate (λ); (iv) the economic desgrowth rate (δ); (v) and the crime vulnerability surface (VV-Surface). In addition, this research applies the ECM-Model in the case of Guatemala to evaluate how crime affects economic performance in a small developing country.

Y20|How to write and publish a paper in a journal indexed in Web of Science: a closer look to Eastern European economics, business and management journals|Scientific research publishing carries huge importance for the development of the society. Apart from the dissemination of knowledge, there are also motives for publication of scientific research results at the level of individual reserachers: it might be a requirement for graduation or promotion, and there is also an individuals’s wish to be recognized as a respectable researcher. Depending on how difficult it is for a paper to get accepted for publishing, publications can be ranged from the least difficult to the most difficult to get published in, in the following order: a book chapter, a conference, a non-indexed journal and an indexed journal. Journals are currently indexed in two databases: Scopus and Web of Science. Of the two, Web of Science has a long tradition and is formally accepted in a number of countries and institutions as an indicator of the quality of an indexed journal. Hence, publication in a journal that is indexed in Web of Science is an important venue for scientific researchers, although previously published papers indicate that there are substantial obstacles for researchers from developing countries. When considering writing for publication, four critical questions emerge: (1) How to pick a topic that is relevant for publication?, (2) How to select a journal for possible publication of research results?, (3) How to structure the paper in accordance with the IMRAD format?, and (4) How to efficiently write the paper?. The goal of the paper is to propose simple, yet highly applicable advice when answering these questions and thus pursuing the publication of a paper in a scientific journal providing a closer look to economics, business and management journals indexed in Web of Science that focus on Eastern European countries.
Y20|Publikačné stratégie a ich využitie vo vedeckej činnosti|Cieľom každého vedeckého pracovníka je prezentovať výsledky svojej práce v renomovaných odborných vedeckých časopisoch doma a v zahraničí. Články však musia spĺnať prísne kritéria, ktoré sa týkajú nielen kvality spracovania danej problematiky, ale aj rozsahu práce, štylistickej a formálnej úpravy. Rozhodujúcim faktorom je aj správny výber relevantného časopisu na publikovanie. V praxi často dochádza k tomu, že príspevky autorov sú odmietnuté napriek ich vysokej kvalite a originalite, pretože téma práce sa nezhoduje s odborným zameraním periodika, ktoré si autor vybral. Tento problém, ako aj mnohé iné, je možné účinne riešiť pomocou individuálnej publikačnej stratégie, ktorá identifikuje kvantitatívne ako aj kvalitatívne faktory na úspešné publikovanie vedeckých prác. Cieľom tohto príspevku je preto ponúknuť návod na vypracovanie takejto publikačnej stratégie.

Y20|The Emergence Of La Decroissance|The paper aims to provide an overview of the emergence of degrowth – the notion designates a grass root, political and academic movement which is progressively spreading since the previous decade across Europe as a reaction to the drawbacks associated with the imperatives of economic growth. The intellectual founder of the new paradigm of degrowth is the Romanian born economist – Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen. The translation of his scientific works and the publication in French was to become the first milestone of degrowth discourse France becoming the cradle of the movement. While degrowth encompasses many dimensions such as equity, ecology, democracy or enjoyment of life, the overarching theme of the movement is the escaping of the economy as a central societal value. Degrowth gained an increasing audience in the beginning of the years 2000’, spreading progressively mostly in other Francophone, Francophile or Latin language speaking countries such as Italy and Spain, but in other European nations as well.

Y20|Understanding the Impact of the Economic Crisis on Child and Maternal Health among the Poor : Opportunities for South Asia|ï»¿ï»¿The economic crisis hit many countries in 2007 and the effects are still being felt, especially in poorer developing nations. Much of the debate surrounding the economic crisis and its impacts has focused on the financial and economic aspectsâ€”import/export impacts, economic growth losses, labor force cutbacks, and fiscal imbalances. The social impact, especially on poor and vulnerable groups, has received less mention. Yet, if countries are to address the overall impacts of the economic crisis, it is vital that they also consider investing time and money to deal with social impacts more effectively. There are fears, however, that a reduction in spending on vital sectors (including the healthcare sector) to ensure economic recovery could affect poor and vulnerable populations and, in turn, erase the progress that has been made thus far. The decision to reduce such spending could also come from donors, who tend to favor a market-led recovery process in economic crises, thereby neglecting vital social service sectors that cater to the needs of poor populations. This spending can supplement government services or fill resource gaps and as a result reductions could have negative impacts on beneficiary populations, particularly the poor and vulnerable. Addressing child and maternal health issues within the context of the economic crisis is one key area to consider given its short, medium, and long-term effects on populations in developing countries. In South Asian countries, child and maternal health-related indicators tend to be disturbing despite the rapid growth rates in many of these countries. The number of infant deaths is still quite high, nutrition of children and women continues to be problematic, and maternal health and pre/post natal care remains poor. This paper presents an overview of child and maternal health in the South Asia region, but also recommends that interventions take into account a series of factors if the impacts of the economic crisis are to be minimized : There is a need for more information and research on the impacts of the crisis; Investing in social protection and safety nets is imperative; Food security should be integrated into social protection; Vulnerable households require support to cope with the crisis despite their own efforts and coping strategies; State investments that support vulnerable populations should be protected in times of crisis.
Y20|Understanding the Impact of the Economic Crisis on Child and Maternal Health among the Poor : Opportunities for South Asia|ï»¿ï»¿The economic crisis hit many countries in 2007 and the effects are still being felt, especially in poorer developing nations. Much of the debate surrounding the economic crisis and its impacts has focused on the financial and economic aspectsâ€”import/export impacts, economic growth losses, labor force cutbacks, and fiscal imbalances. The social impact, especially on poor and vulnerable groups, has received less mention. Yet, if countries are to address the overall impacts of the economic crisis, it is vital that they also consider investing time and money to deal with social impacts more effectively. There are fears, however, that a reduction in spending on vital sectors (including the healthcare sector) to ensure economic recovery could affect poor and vulnerable populations and, in turn, erase the progress that has been made thus far. The decision to reduce such spending could also come from donors, who tend to favor a market-led recovery process in economic crises, thereby neglecting vital social service sectors that cater to the needs of poor populations. This spending can supplement government services or fill resource gaps and as a result reductions could have negative impacts on beneficiary populations, particularly the poor and vulnerable. Addressing child and maternal health issues within the context of the economic crisis is one key area to consider given its short, medium, and long-term effects on populations in developing countries.

Under the current legal framework on banking loan, low income people can buy them by â€œloan"" from banks in Vietnam.

Y20|Global Blockchain Benchmarking Study|This study provides an empirical overview of the current state of both enterprise and public sector use of blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT). The study gathered data from over 200 enterprise DLT start-ups, established corporations, central banks and other public sector institutions, including non-public data obtained through confidential online surveys. The study details the emergence and evolution of the DLT ecosystem, explores its actors and their business models, and examines the current state of the industry in terms of use cases, network/application deployments, and key challenges to broad DLT adoption. The study also explains the concept of ‘blockchain’ and DLT, highlights the different DLT architectures, and dives into governance-related issues. Finally, an entire section is dedicated to investigating how the public sector is approaching DLT.
Y20|Inequality, Polarization and Poverty in Nigeria|This study examines the impact of zonal differences on the distribution of per capita expenditure in terms of polarization, inequality and poverty. Data sources include the NCS 1996 and NLSS 2004. Analytical techniques used include Gini index and selected measures of polarization Dimensions around which polarization have taken place were analyzed following the identification-alienation framework. Simulation method was used to measure the impact of alternative policy measures on the level of poverty, inequality and polarization. The study reveals decline in the level of inequality and polarization in Nigeria Increasing level of identification indicates emerging level of bipolarization. The main dimensions of increasing polarization include zone, secondary education, unemployed people, sector and gender. It is inferred that intra zonal inequality-reducing policies will be more effective and efficient at reducing poverty. Egalitarian focused polices are suggested to reduce differences between polarization dimensions in order to forestall conflicts and social tension in Nigeria.

Y20|Introducing Anthropological Foundations of Economic Behavior, Organization, and Control|One of the rude awakenings for economists from the current recession is an emerging understanding that economics has gone wild with its highbrow mathematical models that bear little resemblance to reality. The failure of economics to predict and solve the current global recession, has restored the “dismal science” title to the profession. It stems from the cultish fascination with Adam Smith’s Invisible Hand, centered around the belief in the efficient market hypothesis. This fascination exposes analytical holes in the methodology that economics has followed lately, as economics itself has moved too far away from its key social foundations. This situation is incomprehensible and needs redressing. I compiled a book - Selected Readings on the Anthropological Bases of Economic Behavior, Organization, and Control - to help economists and others get back in touch with their genealogy. This current paper is a watered down version of the introduction to Selected Readings. It concludes that real life is neither as simple nor economic as economic theory sometimes suggests. In fact, and for much of human history, non-economic factors and forces have driven economic activities. Selected Readings provides an opportunity for reinforced focus on economics principles. Alone and detached from its social foundations economics has a future only as fiction. As serious non-fiction, economics cannot successfully divorce itself from its elemental foundations in the social sciences. To advance its theory in the past economics needed to borrow from mathematics and physics. Such learning must continue. However, to remain policy-relevant economics cannot wish away the very social bases upon which it is founded. Without social foundations one might as well kiss economics goodbye.
Y20|Potreba skúmania podnikateľských stretégií v postindustriálnej ére podnikania<BR>[The Needs of Business Strategies Research in Postindustrial Business Era]|The purpose of this article is to find out if there is a necessity of doing research in business strategies due to differences between businesses in industrial and postindustrial era. Business strategies are a key factor of success. Only a company with a good strategy can beat others in hard competition. There are some rational reasons to think that the strategies used in industrial era are not sufficient enough to by appropriate to be used in postindustrial era. The idea is that the share of information technologies (IT) based companies is still growing. So is their importance. The main idea is that the Porter’s generic strategies model should be enriched with a new strategy concept. This concept would be so called perfect differentiation. That would mean that an IT based company could choose a strategy of parallel differentiation and costs leadership.
Y20|SRSA Presidential Address: Local Economic Impact of the Great Recession of 2008-2009|SRSA Presidential Address: The 2008/2009 recession has been the worst recession since World War II. The national unemployment rate went from 5.0 percent to over 10 percent in less than two years. GDP was negative during five of the six quarters during 2008 and the first half of 2009. Over 8.3 million establishment jobs were lost during the first 24 months of the recession. While the national numbers are staggering, the state and local impacts are quite varied. In this presentation I will identify the disparity of impact at the state and local level. In addition, I will also try to dispel a number of myths surrounding the cause and reactions to this economic crisis.

Y20|Agent-Based Financial Modelling: A Promising Alternative to the Standard Representative-Agent Approach|In this paper we provide a brief introduction to the literature on agent-based financial modelling and, more specifically, artificial stock market modelling. In the selective literature review two broad categories of artificial stock market models are discussed: models based on hard-wired rules and models with learning and systemic adaptation. The paper discusses pros and cons of agent-based financial modelling as opposed to the standard representative-agent approach. We advocate the need for the proper account of market complexity, agent heterogeneity, bounded rationality and adaptive (though not simplistic) expectations in financial modelling. We also argue that intelligent adaptation in highly uncertain environment is key to understanding actual financial market behaviour and we resort to a specific area of artificial intelligence theory, namely reinforcement learning, as one plausible and economically appealing algorithm of adaptation and learning.
Y20|Editorial Note|With this issue we celebrate the tenth release of publication of the “Theoretical and Empirical Researches in Urban Management” (TERUM) journal. TERUM was established in 2006 by the Research Centre in Public Administration and Public Management from the Academy of Economic Studies, Bucharest, Romania, with the original intention of creating a high-quality refereed journal with a standard of intellectual rigor and academic standing. The journal’s aim was to provide theoretically and empirically informed analysis on social, economical and technical issues related with urban development and management.
Y20|Editorial. Note|Since the begining of this year, once with the new form of the journal, we have exerted every effort to make TERUM a quality publication that provides an international forum for researchers who are concerned with urban management.
Y20|Editorial. Urban Issues In Asia|In the last decade we have assisted at a spectacular transformation of the human settlements, as more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas. This transformation acquired significant magnitude in Asia. In 1950, Asia had only one city with a population of more than 10 millions people; by 2015, it is projected to have 23 cities (Asian Development Bank. 2008). In a region where a population of one million constitutes a small settlement, urbanization creates many challenges, especially about how·to feed, shelter, and generate employment in a sustainable way. Urbanization in Asia involves around 44 million people being added to the population of cities every year, equivalent to 120,000 people each day. The huge increase in urban populations require the construction of more than 20,000 new dwellings, 250 kilometers of new roads, and additional infrastructure to supply more than six megaliters of potable water (Asian Development Bank. 2008).
Y20|Introduction to a Special Issue on Rural Health in the U.S|Rural health is a subject area that has long been the domain of scholars in schools of public health and of those in the health care services research fields. Issues such as health care supply, patient demand, and access to in-patient and clinical services have been long-running research questions of scholars that focus on this area.
Y20|Pluralism and Heterodoxy: Introduction to the Special Issue|This paper introduces a special issue of the journal devoted to work presented at two recent conferences of the Association for Heterodox Economics (AHE). The AHE is an organisation which advocates and provides a forum for non-mainstream approaches to economics. Recent conferences have focused on pluralism. Pluralism is a variegated concept with multiple motivations and arguments in its favour. Such arguments tend to be ontological and epistemological, but may also be pedagogical. Pluralism has been advocated as a moniker preferable to heterodoxy which might be adopted by non-mainstream economists. However, it is problematic. The papers which comprise the remainder of this issue illustrate that point. The papers are discussed in turn and contrasted.
Y20|Stylebook:Tips on Organization, Writing, and Formatting|Fifteen years of copy-editing experience – with theses (both in economics and in several medical fields), journal articles, book chapters and books, conference presentations, government reports, etc. – are distilled here. Papers are often sent to me for “language correction”, but what I usually find is that, far more than that, what they most need is major work on organization, writing, and formatting (including presentation of tables and figures). Even good writers can improve their writing by paying attention to the points herein, I believe. Of course digging deeply into issues of organization, writing, and even formatting improves readability (and thus the probability of being published, read, and cited), but it can also help to improve the quality of the thinking, i.e., the content of the paper. I first review the standard organization of most empirical papers in economics, with suggestions for improvement (including a brief discussion of some issues in reporting of statistical and econometric results). Then I discuss many points of good (and bad) writing (including sections on The Language of Economists and on Overused/Misused Words) as well as points of formatting (including many choices, where – even more than in writing – consistency is the most important rule). Throughout, some differences between Swedish and English practice are discussed, as well as some between American and British practice.
Y20|Money and Technological Change: The Role of Financing in the Process of Evolution: Introduction|"This special issue on ""Money and technological change"" is a collection of papers that focus on the understanding both of how credit and finance systems effectively work and of their role in shaping firms' innovative strategies and determining their performances. Already Schumpeter acknowledged to what extent innovation and thereby economic growth rely upon the credit system. Taken together, the contributions to this special issue elaborate on a methodological proposal: monetary circuit and technological diffusion schemes, but also the long-waves approach, ought to be implemented as open schemes that allow one to decide, according to the relevant circumstances, which variables can be taken as given and which other variables are to be determined endogenously. As in a monetary economy of production technologically evolving crises are explained by the relationships between financial and technological decisions, ""money and machineries"" must both be explained as endogenous variables."

Y20|Material culture in Sixteenth Century Venice: a sample from probate inventories, 1510�1615|This paper presents a panel of data about material culture in early modern Venice. The data are taken from three samples of Venetian probate inventories drawn up voluntarily from Venetian widows in the years 1510�1615, at intervals of roughly fifty years. The entire period has been divided into two subgroups of three years each (1511�1513, 1560�1562), and one of six years (1610�1615). The selection of goods tries to reflect the variety of objects appearing in written lists of Venetian interiors (pieces of furniture, paintings, musical instruments, tableware, cloths), though it aims to present a view of domestic interiors in early modern Venice that pays special regard to less essential goods.
Y20|Editorial Introduction|This Journal comes out from a barely disguised, though deep, anxiety about the way we, the economists, may improve the ways of providing meaningful explanations for what makes and does not make sense in such economic developments as prosperity, globalisation, material imbalances, labour relations, or common property. These issues are usually resuscitated under contemporary labels such as “feminism”, “environmentalism”, “Marxism”, or “liberalism”. However, it can be argued that these issues have represented in fact recurrent threads of economic thinking dating back to ancient times.
Y20|Re/Combining Knowledge and Innovation Activities. Editorial|The aim of this Special Issue of the European Journal of Social and Economic System is to collect a series of papers which deal with the issue of knowledge recombination and innovation, adopting different perspectives and using different methodologies. The term recombination is taken from genetics and it means the natural formation in offspring of genetic combinations not present in parents by the processes of crossing over or independent assortment1. It appeared in the economics literature quite recently, imported by a biologist, Stuart Kauffman (e.g. 1993), who is interested in complex systems; and by an economist, Martin Weitzman (e.g. 1998), who studies economic growth. Both of them refers to this concept, since they intend to show how new ideas emerge from a combination of past ideas and to stress that the element of novelty arises from the new way to relate (keep together) pre-existing elements instead of inventing ex-nihilo. The idea is far from being new, even in economics. Already Usher (1929) and Schumpeter (1934) evoked this feature of both inventive and innovative activities. The former claimed that invention finds its distinctive feature in the constructive assimilation of pre-existing elements into new synthesis, new patterns or new configurations; the latter that the essence of innovation is carrying out new combinations and that development consists primarily in employing existing resources in a different way, in doing new things with them. Moreover, already the French mathematician Henri Poincaré recognized this point long time ago, for example, when reflecting on how the finest ideas were generated in the sciences: They are those which reveal to us unsuspected kinship between other facts, long known, but wrongly believed to be strangers to one another. Amongst chosen combinations the most fertile will often be those formed of elements drawn from domains which are far apart. (1908). More recently, the theory of the firm in the Schumpeterian vein has referred expressly to it: the creation of any sort of novelty in art, science or practical lifeconsists to a substantial extent of a recombination of conceptual and physical materials that were previously in existence (Nelson and Winter, 1982, p. 130).

Y20|Beliefs, Norms, and Markets. Editorial|The papers retained for the special issue address concerns that naturally arise when one weakens the hypotheses underlying most of mainstream economic theory, in particular, the representative agent assumption. This assumption, indeed, obscures one of the most important facts about socio-economic life: The interactions among individuals are mostly local, in space and time. Thus, information transmits slowly from agent to agents. The actions from one agent affect the other agents at different points of time and therefore, in different contexts. This creates a fundamental heterogeneity even among otherwise identical individuals. Small effects can have large consequences; rationality becomes elusive as no agent can built a sufficiently comprehensive mental image of the world to do more than purposely react to local circumstances; learning may be spurious and unable to converge towards any, by force exceedingly complex, true model of the economy. In such a context theoretical enquiries, but also empirical work, are forced to abandon many of the intellectual maps and certitudes of neoclassical theory to enter what is still largely terra incognita.

A crawling peg with a low rate of depreciation was the economic tool chosen by three successive administrations to reduce inflation by using the exchange rate as the main nominal anchor. This process was uniquely complex, as the country experienced in the same years an important trade liberalization following the firm of MERCOSUR treatise. Inflation was reduced gradually and the policy resulted in continuous and significant real appreciation of the uruguayan peso (""atraso cambiario"") which determined great problems in external balance that ended in a big financial crash in 2002. This paper analyzes the intertemporal problems associated with this policy through personal interviews with leading economic officials of the time and examines the public positioning assumed by politicians, businessmen and trade unionists of those years."

Y20|Una Introduccion A La Teoria Y La Practica De Las Subastas|While auctions gain relevance as a trading mechanism, different events show how unskilled many firms and governments are when using them. The objective of this article is to familiarize the reader with the auction theory, either to improve the auction design, if he is the auctioneer, or to orient the bidding strategy, if he is the bidder. First, we present the simplest auctions, using intuitive mathematical tools. Then, we consider more realistic setups, such as the existence of risk aversion, and the use of reservation prices. We also study the case where the goods auctioned can be later traded on the market, and those auctions where bidders can benefit from economies of complementarities if they are granted with specific bundles of goods. In both cases, the auctioneer must recognize the risks and opportunities, in order to maximize the economic value of the allocation of goods.
