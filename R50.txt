R50|Does Light Touch Cluster Policy Work? Evaluating the Tech City Programme|Despite academic scepticism, cluster policies remain popular with policymakers. This paper evaluates the causal impact of a flagship UK technology cluster programme. I build a simple framework and identify effects using difference-in-differences and synthetic controls on rich microdata. I further test for timing, cross-space variation, scaling and churn channels. The policy grew and densified the cluster, but has had more mixed effects on tech firm productivity. I also find most policy 'effects' began before rollout, raising questions about the programme's added value.
R50|Sales Taxation, Spatial Agglomeration, and the Internet|Technological innovations facilitating e-commerce have well-documented effects on consumer behavior and firm organization in the retail sector, but the effects of these new transaction technologies on fiscal systems remain unknown. By extending models of commodity tax competition to include urban spatial structure (agglomeration) and online commerce, one can analyze strategic tax-policy interactions among neighboring localities. Consumers buy different types of commodities, sold either by traditional or by online vendors. When the cost of online shopping falls, we show that equilibrium tax rates and revenues increase in small jurisdictions and decrease in large jurisdictions with retail shopping centers. Policy commentators warn that e-commerce erodes tax revenue - true enough for some localities - but, more accurately, changing transaction costs can generate entirely new commercial and fiscal equilibria that ultimately “redistribute” tax revenues from localities with concentrations of traditional vendors toward other, typically smaller, localities.
R50|Communal fees and election cycles: Evidence from German municipalities|The political business cycle theories describe that election-motivated politicians manipulate economic policy-making. Election cycles occur in many fiscal variables, for example tax rates. I examine whether electoral motives influence communal fees in Germany. Fees have to be paid for the use of many public services, for example waste management or sewerage provisions. Fees should be equivalent to the costs of a public service and thus correspond to the benefit principle in public finance. The German municipalities, however, have a leeway to determine fees. I use revenue data for around 7,000 West German municipalities from seven states over the period 1992–2006. The results show that municipalities increase communal fees in election years to a smaller extent than in the middle of the legislative period, while they increase fees more directly after elections. Fees increase in election years by 0.94 euro per capita less and directly after elections by 1.74 euro per capita more than in the middle of the legislative period. The results thus corroborate the predictions of the political business cycle theories.
R50|Do Direct Elections Matter? Quasi-experimental Evidence from Germany|We estimate the causal effect of direct elections on the economic performance of politicians. Candidates running in direct elections to head local governments in the German state of Brandenburg need an absolute majority, and votes for the winner must represent at least 15% of eligible voters. If the quorum is not reached, direct elections are suspended, and local councils appoint the head of government. We examine election outcomes around the quorum, where the form of government is arguably exogenous. Event study results show that the public employment service becomes somewhat more effective under directly elected politicians. However, directly elected politicians do not seem to attract more businesses or expedite administrative acts.
R50|Divided They Fall. Fragmented Parliaments and Government Stability|This paper studies how political fragmentation affects government stability. Exploiting variation in the number of parties induced by a 5% vote share entry threshold in Spanish local councils, we show that the entry of an additional party in Parliament increases the probability of unseating the incumbent by 4 percentage points. We also document that mayors with more resources at their disposal for legislative bargaining are half as likely to be unseated. Challengers are younger, better educated, and more likely to win the following elections, suggesting that instability may induce positive selection on politicians. We interpret our results in light of a two-period bargaining model of coalition formation featuring government instability.
R50|Institutional change and the development of lagging regions in Europe|The success of the policy in delivering greater economic convergence does not hide the fact that we are witnessing a decline in the returns of intervention in the three main growth axes. There is, for example, growing concern about a potential exhaustion of additional investments in transport infrastructure and of improvements in accessibility as drivers of growth in certain lagging regions of Europe (Crescenzi and Rodríguez-Pose, 2012). While this issue remains controversial, the truth is that physical capital, human capital, and technology can explain a waning share of the variation in regional economic growth in Europe. Growth theories that accounted for differences in economic performance relatively well two decades ago are becoming less capable of doing so. The residual factor is growing, meaning that, in spite of improvements in growth theory, we tend to know less about what determines regional growth in Europe.
R50|Does fiscal decentralization affect regional disparities in health? Quasi-experimental evidence from Italy|Recent theories on fiscal decentralization support the view that sub-national governments who finance a larger share of their spending with taxes raised locally by themselves are more accountable towards their citizens. Whilst evidence on improvements in spending efficiency is relatively common, little is known about the effects on inequalities amongst the population. In this paper we exploit a reform aimed at increasing regional tax autonomy in Italy to provide quasi-experimental evidence on the impact of fiscal decentralization on health disparities between- and within-regions. Our findings, robust to a number of robustness checks, support the view that fiscal decentralization does not impact on between-regional inequalities but can help to reduce inequalities within regions. However, this last effect depends on the degree of economic development: richer regions are better than poorer ones in containing inequalities.
R50|Taxes, traffic jam and spillover in the metropolis|This paper studies local governments' public policies in a metropolitan area plagued by traffic congestion, where both residents and workers consume local public goods. We develop a new spatial sub-metropolitan tax competition model which features a central city surrounded by suburban towns linked by mobile capital and mobile residents who commute to work. We show that Pareto-efficiency is achieved if towns can retain their workers using labor subsidies. Otherwise, traffic congestion in the city is inefficiently high and local governments respond by setting inefficient public policies: (1) the city over-taxes capital and under-taxes residents, which leads to too little capital and too many residents in the city; (2) local public goods are under-provided in the city and over-provided in the towns.
R50|Is Super-Fast Broadband Negative? An IV-Estimation of the Broadband Effect on Firms' Sales and Employment Level|This study investigates the relationship between super-fast broadband and firms’ sales and employment level in Sweden. It is important to learn more about this recent technological change and few studies has explored the impact of super-fast broadband on firm outcomes. We use the previous roll-out of second-generation internet access to identify the effect of third-generation internet access. The early investments in optic fiber where largely core broadband network investments paving the way for later investments in third-generation broadband technology. Municipalities choosing providers who prioritized cheap technology (broadband over telephone lines, DSL) targeting the many, thus fell behind municipalities choosing providers investing in optic fiber. We find heterogeneity in the broadband effect, but the overall effect is negative. This effect may be associated with the roll-out of 4G mobile broadband in 2011; mobile broadband services are a byproduct of optic fiber because mobile broadband is transmitted from the same high capacity fiber-optic base stations. We suggest that the negative effect found is related to internet use at work and the mixing of private and work related internet use.
R50|Local territorial reform and regional spending efficiency|We investigate the effect of a local territorial reform, which reduced the number of parishes, on municipality spending efficiency in the period 2011-2016. We build a composite output indicator and use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to compute efficiency scores, which we then analyze through a second stage regression with socio-demographic, economic factors and the reform. We find efficiency gains for around 10% of municipalities overall. In Alentejo and in Centro, more than 50% of the municipalities improved efficiency. The second stage results show that the reform did not improve local spending efficiency in Mainland Portugal, particularly in the Norte region.
R50|Implications of the Polish 1999 Administrative Reform for Regional Socio-Economic Development|On 1 January 1999, four major reforms took effect in Poland in the areas of health, education, pensions and local administration. After 20 years, only in the last case does the original structural design remain essentially unchanged. We examine the implications of this reform from the perspective of the distance of municipalities from their regional administrative capital. We show that despite fears of negative consequences for peripheral regions, the reform did not result in slower socio-economic development for those municipalities that found themselves further from the new administrative centres. We argue that regional inclusiveness in the process of development is likely to be an important factor behind the stability of Poland's administrative design.

R50|Earthquakes, grants and public expenditure: how municipalities respond to natural disasters|We analyze the response of municipalities to the occurrence of natural disasters (earthquakes) in Italy, in terms of spending behavior, use of upper tier transfers and recovery. We find evidence of increasing expenditure for about 12 years after the shock, with asymmetric responses between matching (earthquake-related) and unconditional grants, and heterogeneous flypaper effects across the country. While in Northern municipalities expenditure tends to regress to pre-treatment levels, i.e., before the earthquake occurrence, Southern municipalities react to the drop of grants showing inertia in expenditure levels. This evidence is coupled with a faster recovery of private income and housing prices in Northern municipalities. Our analysis exploits balance sheet data of about 8000 municipalities for the period 2000-2015 and encompasses the universe of earthquake events defined using alternative intensity measures. We apply a matching approach to disentangle earthquake-related grants (mostly matching grants) from other grants, and to define a control group of non-treated municipalities. The spatial and temporal variation in expenditure and transfers between treated and not-treated governments are then examined using panel data models on the universe of municipalities as well as on a matching sample of municipalities.

R50|The Optimal Provision of Information and Communication Technologies in Smart Cities|We exploit the public good attributes of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and theoretically analyze an aggregate economy of two smart cities in which ICTs are provided in either a decentralized or a centralized manner. We first determine the efficient ICT levels that maximize the aggregate surplus from the provision of ICTs in the two cities. Second, we compute the optimal level of ICT provision in the two cities in a decentralized regime in which spending on the ICTs is financed by a uniform tax on the city residents. Third, we ascertain the optimal level of ICT provision in the two cities in a centralized regime subject to equal provision of ICTs and cost sharing. Fourth, we show that if the two cities have the same preference for ICTs then centralization is preferable to decentralization as long as there is a spillover from the provision of ICTs. Finally, we show that if the two cities have dissimilar preferences for ICTs then centralization is preferable to decentralization as long as the spillover exceeds a certain threshold.
R50|Autonomous, Connected, Electric Shared vehicles (ACES) and public finance: an explorative analysis|This paper discusses the implications of autonomous-connected-electric-shared vehicles (ACES) for public finance, which have so far been widely ignored. In OECD countries, 5-12% of federal and up to 30% of local tax revenue are currently from fuel and vehicle taxation. The diffusion of ACES will likely reduce these important sources of government revenues, while also affecting transport-related government expenditures. We argue that the realization of socioeconomic benefits of ACES depends on the implementation of tailored public finance policies. In particular, the introduction of road tolls in line with ‘user pays’ and ‘polluter pays’ principles will become more attractive. Moreover, innovation in taxation schemes to fit the changing technological circumstances may alter the (relative) importance of levels of governance in transport policy making, likely shifting power towards local (in particular urban) governmental levels. We finally argue that due to path-dependencies, and the risk of lock-in effects in sub-optimal public finance regimes, further research and near-term policy action regarding ACES is required.
R50|The effects of China’s growth slowdown on its provinces: Disentangling the sources|Since 2007 China’s growth has fallen from around 10% to about 6-7% per annum. This paper investigates the experience of this slowdown at the provincial level. We use a vector-autoregressive modelling approach and annual data from 1978 to decompose each province’s growth into various factors. We find that (1) all provinces experienced the slowdown; (2) there is considerable variation in this experience across provinces; (3) national factors dominate the provincial slowdown while province-specific factors explain most of the interprovincial variation; (4) when the national factor is separated into supply and demand components, the supply component dominates.
R50|Research for REGI Committee – Externalities of Cohesion Policy|The study investigates the effects of Cohesion Policy (CP) which occur in a country other than the one in which CP resources were actually spent. The study estimates that macroeconomic spillovers significantly contribute to the impact of CP. Spillovers directed to EU countries represent around 9% of the total annual CP expenditure. Other spillovers to Non-EU countries are around 8% of the CP expenditure. Macro and micro spillovers together arrive at 21% of the annual CP expenditure, 67% of which is distributed among EU countries. Around 20% of the CP expenditure can trigger sectoral spillover effects in the environment, transport and higher education sectors. The analysis demonstrates that externalities reinforce EU growth and competitiveness without CP deserting its convergence objective.
R50|Institutional change and the development of lagging regions in Europe|According to the dominant economic theories, economic growth is the result of a combination of three factors – physical capital, human capital or labour, and innovation –plus a residual factor or error term, which represents what we do not know or cannotexplain. Depending on whether a neoclassical growth (Solow, 1956; Swan, 1956) or an endogenous growth approach is adopted (Romer, 1986: Lucas, 1988), the weight attributed to each of the components varies, but they remain, in different guises the fundamental drivers informing development policies across the world. The European Union’s (EU) regional development and cohesion policy has been no exception. The bulk of cohesion investments have been channelled towards improving the infrastructure endowment and accessibility of the least developed regions of the EU, as well as increasing the availability and quality of human resources, and developing the innovative capacity of individuals and firms across lagging areas of Europe.
R50|The Welfare Costs of Tiebout Sorting with True Public Goods|We develop a model of Tiebout sorting based on decentralized income taxation, which allows for spillovers and imperfect rivalry in consumption of the publicly provided good. We identify three sources of welfare loss from decentralization: Imperfect redistribution, inter-jurisdictional free-riding, and inecient residential choice. Whereas the welfare loss from imperfect redistribution decreases and that from free-riding rises unambiguously as the publicly provided good becomes more pure, the welfare loss from the inecient residential choice depends non-monotonically on spillovers and rivalry. The equilibrium can be characterized by relative crowding of either the rich or the poor municipality. Our results imply that the characteristics of the publicly provided good are an important determinant for the welfare costs of decentralization.
R50|Overlapping Climate Clubs under Transaction Costs|We examine the formation of multilateral, hub-and-spoke and bilateral international R&D strategic alliances (overlapping climate clubs) to reduce CO2 emissions. R&D provision in clubs produces two types of positive externalities: a global public good (i.e., reduction of CO2 emissions) and knowledge spillovers in joint R&D agreements. The latter is a club good. It is perfectly excludable. Its (direct) benefits are enjoyed by the club members only. Trust plays a central role in the type of alliance formation, if any at all. Lack of trust generates transaction costs, which increase with the number of R&D collaborators. We utilize the perfectly-coalition-proof-Nash equilibrium (PCPNE) concept to refine the set of Nash equilibria. Multilateral and hub-and-spoke coalitional structures are PCPNE, even in large economies containing all nations in the globe, in the absence of income transfers, for different values of transaction costs. With income transfers, fully participated multilateral coalitional structures are not stable; however, the size of the stable coalition increases as the economy expands.
R50|Interdependencia municipal en regiones metropolitanas: El caso de la Sabana de Bogotá|Con el avance de los procesos de descentralización en América Latina, los gobiernos municipales han recibido mayor autonomía política, administrativa y fiscal para la toma de decisiones de política pública y desarrollo local. La configuración de economías de aglomeración profundiza las interdependencias entre municipios, ya que las dinámicas socioeconómicas y ambientales sobre el territorio trascienden límites político-administrativos y las acciones de un gobierno local producen efectos sobre los municipios vecinos. Estas interdependencias producen externalidades tanto positivas como negativas que cuando no son internalizadas generan necesariamente niveles subóptimos en la provisión de bienes y servicios públicos. La cuantificación de las interdependencias que se producen entre municipios de regiones metropolitanas es determinante para formular políticas que maximicen las oportunidades que aquellas ofrecen o mitiguen las consecuencias negativas, y también es un invaluable aporte para el diseño de arreglos institucionales que gestionen dichas interrelaciones. La metodología propuesta, aplicada a la región de la Sabana de Bogotá (Colombia), dota de un instrumento para la planificación regional y la implementación de intervenciones mancomunadas de carácter estratégico que trasciendan los límites de los municipios, no solo con un enfoque sectorial integral con visión de mediano y largo plazo, sino también como un ejercicio que necesariamente considera las interacciones relevantes entre municipios.
R50|Are local public services better delivered in more autonomous regions? Evidence from European regions using a dose‐response approach|"Does regional autonomy lead to better local public services? We investigate this issue using measures of public service performance and autonomy at the region level in 171 European regions. We introduce a novel dose‐response approach which identifies the pattern of the effect of regional autonomy on the performance of public services. The relationship between the level of regional autonomy and the provision of local public services exhibits a u‐shape: both low and high autonomy lead to better local public services. This speaks against the presence of one optimal level of autonomy and policy recommendations based on the view that more decentralisation is always desirable. It shows that different institutional settings can be economically viable and efficient. ¿Conduce la autonomía regional a mejores servicios públicos locales? Este artículo investiga este tema utilizando medidas de desempeño y autonomía del servicio público a nivel regional en 171 regiones europeas. Se introduce un nuevo enfoque de dosis‐respuesta que identifica el patrón del efecto de la autonomía regional en el desempeño de los servicios públicos. La relación entre el nivel de autonomía regional y la prestación de servicios públicos locales presenta una forma de""u"": tanto la baja como la alta autonomía conducen a mejores servicios públicos locales. Esto contradice la presencia de un nivel óptimo de autonomía y de recomendaciones políticas basadas en la opinión de que siempre es deseable una mayor descentralización. Se demuestra que diferentes marcos institucionales pueden ser económicamente viables y eficientes. 地域の自主性は、地域の公共サービスの改善を導くだろうか? 本稿では、ヨーロッパの171の地域における、地域レベルでの公共サービス実施と自主性を測定して、この問題を検討する。新しい用量反応アプローチを導入し、これにより公共サービスの実施に対する地域の自主性の効果のパターンを確認する。地域の自主性のレベルと地域の公共サービスの実施との関連性はU字型曲線を示し、自主性が高いレベルでも低いレベルでも、いずれも結果的に公共サービスは改善されている。これは、最適な自主性のレベルは一つであることや、自律分散を進めることが絶対的に好ましいという見方に基づいた政策勧告に異を唱えるものである。背景にある制度上の違いは、経済的に実行可能であり、効果的であることを示している。"
R50|Local taxation and tax base mobility: Evidence from a business tax reform in France|This paper investigates the impact of tax base mobility on local taxation. We first develop a theoretical model in order to examine the connection between local business property taxation and tax base mobility within a metropolitan area. We find that decreasing capital intensity in the tax base increases the business property tax rates unambiguously. We then test this result using a French reform, which changes the composition of the main local business tax base in 2010. Estimations using Difference-in-Differences show that the reduction in the mobility of the tax base indeed results in higher business property tax rates. Housing tax rates were not affected by the reform.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

The paper surveys relevant topics on racial and ethnic discrimination and residential segregation, and provides a more detailed discussion of the specific papers in the special issue. The paper primarily focuses on the literatures on discrimination in housing, on-line markets and policing. In terms of racial segregation, the paper discusses work related to the pattern of residential segregation and the causes and consequences of segregation.
R50|Assessing well-being in European regions. Does government quality matter?|This paper contributes a composite indicator of well-being for 168 European regions built with data from 10 well-being domains provided by the OECD Regional Well- being Dataset. Regions are then ranked according to their respective levels of well-being. Furthermore, the role of the quality of regional governments in explaining well-being dis- parities is assessed using data from the Quality of Government EU Regional Dataset. Results reveal notable well-being differences across European regions, especially between core and periphery ones, with the former enjoying higher well-being. In addition, government quali- ty is found to boost regional well-being, although uneven impacts are found for core and periphery regions.
R50|Housing Market Shocks in Italy: a GVAR approach|In this paper, we use a Global Vector Autoregression (GVAR) model to assess the spatio-temporal mechanism of house price spillovers, also known as “ripple effect”, among 93 Italian provincial housing markets, over the period 2004 - 2016. In order to better capture the local housing market dynamics, we use data not only on house prices but also on transaction volumes. In particular, we focus on estimating, to what extent, exogenous shocks, interpreted as negative housing demand shocks, arising from 10 Italian regional capitals, impact on their house prices and sales and how these shocks spill over to neighbours housing markets. The negative housing market demand shock hitting the GVAR model is identified by using theory-driven sign restrictions. The spatio-temporal analysis carried through impulse response functions shows that there is evidence of a “ripple effect” mainly occurring through transaction volumes.
R50|Enhancing governance in Thailand|The Peace pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development encompasses a diverse range of issues including stability and effective governance. Reforming the public sector is high on the government’s agenda, but involves a number of challenges: the gap between planning and implementation of policy objectives remains large; insufficient public participation in policy making is undermining the efficient allocation of resources toward public needs and development goals; under-development of evidence-based regulations is hampering the creation of a business-friendly environment essential to high value-added activities; and high levels of perceived corruption are weakening business confidence and public trust in the government. Thailand’s 12th Economic and Social Development Plan emphasises the importance of public sector reform. It sets out measures to strengthen co-ordination across ministries and agencies aimed at improving implementation of policy programmes, boosting public participation in policy making, improving online access to government services and combating corruption by strengthening integrity measures. The upcoming 20-year National Strategy and the accompanying National Reform Plan are expected to pave the way for future development. However, an inclusive and consultative process will be essential to ensure the success of reform efforts. This Working Paper relates to the Initial Assessment report of the Multi-dimensional Country Review of Thailand. (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/multi-dimensional-review-thailand.htm)
R50|The drivers of regional growth in Russia: A baseline model with applications|Russia is a federation of more than 80 regions spanning across a huge territory. Natural resource endowment, inherited industrial specialization, remoteness and climate conditions contribute to large regional disparities. This paper presents an empirical framework model for assessing determinants of regional growth in Russia between 2004 and 2015 with an extension to include sub-national fiscal policies. Baseline results show convergence rates of regional GDP per capita in line with the 2% “iron law of convergence” between countries. Capital investment, and public investment in particular, is a stronger driver of regional growth than in most OECD countries. Natural-resource rich regions are growing faster, and oil price shocks have little economic impact in these regions, pointing at Russia’s centralized tax and transfer system. Subnational current government expenditure is associated with lower growth and slower regional convergence, suggesting low sub-national spending efficiency. There is also weak evidence that sub-national investment yields higher returns than federal government investment. Transfers have mixed effects depending on their nature. Budget equalization grants tend to slow regional growth as they reduce incentives to improve spending efficiency. On the other hand earmarked matching grants tend to spur growth and convergence as they direct resources towards more productive spending.
R50|Does fiscal oversight matter?|A gradually introduced reform of local government accounting made it temporarily possible for municipalities in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia to avoid the effective control of their budget by the authorities in charge of overseeing local government budgets and enforcing the existing fiscal rules. Using this withdrawal of effective fiscal oversight, we identify the effects of fiscal restraints and their enforcement on fiscal outcomes. We find that the withdrawal of oversight has a significant and sizable effect on per capita debt of local governments that were previously constrained by fiscal oversight. Fiscal restraints are important, and oversight and enforcement are key requirements for their success.

Municipal budget policy and election results|In this paper, the authors examine the impact of municipal budget policy on the percentage of votes for the incumbent majority parties in subsequent elections. They contribute to the academic literature by examining the combined influence of taxes, expenditures and debt. Based on data for Flanders (Belgium) between 1994 and 2012, they find no significant association between these budget variables and the actual election results.
R50|On the optimal design of place-based policies: A structural evaluation of EU regional transfers|We quantify general equilibrium effects of place-based policies in a multi-region framework with population mobility, trade and agglomeration economies. Using detailed data on EU transfers, we infer the local effects of different transfer types on productivity, income and transportation cost. Based on these estimates and the general equilibrium model we derive the spatial distribution of economic activity and the resulting aggregate welfare effects if (i) no transfers were paid and taxes set to zero, (ii) transfers were distributed uniformly, (iii) transfers were welfare-optimally distributed. Characterizing the optimal distributions, we reveal complementarities between transfer types and between transfers and local endowments.

Para ello, se ha recurrido a la aplicación de una serie de indicadores estadísticos particulares en el estudio de la geografía espacial, entre los que se destacan el análisis factorial bajo el método de componentes principales para explicar la orientación productiva regional; asimismo, se utilizaron en forma complementaria los índices sintéticos de especialización productiva regional, para analizar la dinámica de la diversificación productiva departamental. Los resultados de la presente investigación muestran que buena parte de las regiones colombianas han venido diversificando su actividad económica en franca orientación a las actividades de servicios, entre las que, sin embargo, son representativos los servicios de gobierno y de no mercado producidos por estas instituciones, dejando progresivamente de depender de unas escasas y concentradas fuentes de crecimiento, contrario a otras en las que ha sido y sigue siendo el sector primario particularmente el minero— el eje dinamizador de las estructuras productivas. Con ello, se ha retrasado el proceso de diversificación acorde con las demandas locales y un orden económico internacional que las requiere, en la medida del paso del tiempo, con mayor intensidad.******This document is directed to responding if Colombian regional economies restructured their productive activities from 2000 to 2014, and if so,illustrate the way that process has been effective in the different departments from the results and dynamics of their economic activities. For developing this exercise, we used a set of statistical indicators of spatial geography, among which is the factorial analysis, specifically the method of principal components, whose purpose was to identify the set activities whose performance explains more clearly the productive orientation of the departments, and complementary synthetic regional specialization indexes were employed in order to identify the degree and the changes of economic diversification, presented in those indicators. The results of this research shows that most of the Colombian regions have diversified their economic activity, with focus on service activities, among which are representative government and non-market services produced by those institutions, nowadays less dependent on few sources of growth. However, in other regions the primary sector, mainly mining activity, for many years has been the most important activity of production structures, affecting the process of full diversification, which is close to current local demands and international economic order the requests with greater intensity.******Este artigo procura responder se as economias regionais colombianas foram objeto de reconstituição de suas estruturas produtivas entre 2000 e 2014, e, se sim, representar em que sentido esse processo foi eficiente para os diferentes estados, a partir dos resultados e da dinâmica de suas atividades econômicas. Para isso, recorreu-se à aplicação de uma série de indicadores estatísticos particulares no estudo da geografia espacial, entre os quais se destacam a análise fatorial sob o método de componentes principais e os índices sintéticos de especialização produtiva regional.

Com isso, tem sido atrasado o processo de diversificação plena em consonância com as demandas locais e com uma ordem econômica internacional que as demanda, com o passar do tempo, com maior intensidade.
R50|Analysis of the job creation process in metropolitan areas: A spatial perspective|This paper seeks to challenge the view that metropolitan areas are characterized by a general positive trend in the job creation process. It rests upon an empirical analysis of the 13 French metropolitan areas over the 2004-2010 period. The estimations of employment growth run using spatial econometrics modeling techniques show that spatial spillover effects intervene in the growth process of the areas under review and that density matters in determining the employment growth rate. We have been unable to identify a unique model of metropolitan dynamics. Indeed, each metropolitan area is characterized by a specific combination of explanatory variables which, finally, attests of the variety of the metropolitan frameworks.
R50|Optimal rationing of productive public services under tax competition|Oates and Schwab (1991) advocate capital-tax financing of public services that support the production process under the assumption that these services are rationed to private firms according to their capital employment. This paper makes the rationing scheme for public services endogenous and demonstrates that the Oates–Schwab scheme is actually the optimal policy choice. We also consider the rationing scheme when labor taxation, instead of or in addition to capital taxation, is imposed.
R50|Instruments of Investment Attraction in Order to Fulfill the Structural Priorities of Sustainable Regional Development (Study Based on the Rostov Region)|The aim of the study is devoted to defining most effective tools of investment funds attraction. These funds can be used in implementation of strategic priorities for socio-economic regional development requiring, in areas that are in need of economic restructuring. The authors have selected the Rostov region as the research target, the economy of which is in need of structural change in the direction of increasing innovational, high-tech and scientific production, in order to reduce import dependency and move closer towards the post-industrial model of economic development. The study considers currently available instruments of attraction of private sector closer to solving the stated problems of Rostov region, analyzing their regulatory, financial and organizational consulting security on both state and federal level. Main directions of economic restructuring of Rostov region are also defined. Authors also outline the main problems that private enterprises come across while doing business in the investigated area. On the basis of the research, investigating federal and regional instruments of private sector involvement authors form a number of proposals and recommendations focusing on regional improvement. As a result of the conducted study, the authors reached the conclusion, that there is a number of strategic measures that should be performed in the Rostov region. These don't only include the improvement of financial instruments, but also best available technologies, national technology initiative, and clustering.
R50|Not in My Backyard? Not So Fast. The Effect of Marijuana Legalization on Neighborhood Crime|This paper studies the effects of marijuana legalization on neighborhood crime using unique geospatial data from Denver, Colorado. We construct a highly local panel data set that includes changes in the location of marijuana dispensaries and changes in neighborhood crime. To account for endogenous retail dispensary locations, we use a novel identification strategy that exploits exogenous changes in demand across different locations. The change in geographic demand arises from the increased importance of access to external markets caused by a change in state and local policy. The results imply that retail dispensaries lead to reduced crime in the neighborhoods where they are located. Reductions in crime are highly localized, with no evidence of benefits for adjacent neighborhoods. The spatial extent of these effects are consistent with a policing or security response, and analysis of detailed crime categories provides indirect evidence that the reduction in crime arises from a disruption of illicit markets.
R50|The ambiguous effects of public assistance to youth and female start-ups between job creation and entrepreneurship enhancement|Public support to start-ups often has the dual ambition of fostering self-employment of disadvantaged individuals while nurturing entrepreneurship. In this paper we evaluate a female and youth start-up program recently implemented in Tuscany (Italy), which provides public guarantees and subsidized interest rates to new firms. Under the assumption of strong ignorability of the assignment mechanism, we use a propensity score matching approach to draw inference on causal effects of the program on firmsâ€™ survival and job creation. Results suggest that public support in this area may have rather ambiguous effects. It helps females and young people escape unemployment or inactivity, and may lead to further job creation. Unfortunately, all this occurs at the price of committing public resources towards entrepreneurial projects that hardly gain efficiency over time.
R50|Birth of a (very) large french region La Nouvelle-Aquitaine, one year later (January 2017)|The aim of this exercise is twofold: to give, without further ado, students and representatives of life in the regions some clues in order to understand the birth of nouvelle-Aquitaine; and to leave for future researchers in regional economies an account from one who has observed (and lived through) the establishment of territorial reform 2014-2016. To this end, the first section retraces how we have moved on from more than half a century of stable French regional authorities to a reduction, in less than one year, of their number from 22 to 13. The second section sets out an initial synthetic vision of Nouvelle-Aquitaine emphasising two distinct characteristics: its enormous size and the evident hierarchy of its towns and cities. The third section, written, as it were, on the spot and thus without, perhaps, the required detachment, concerns the analysis of the first year “of transition” and poses questions on the future of this territorial reform.
R50|Local taxation and tax base mobility: Evidence from a business tax reform in France|This paper investigates the impact of tax base mobility on local taxation. We first develop a theoretical model in order to examine the connection between local business property taxation and tax base mobility within a metropolitan area. We find that decreasing capital intensity in the tax base increases the business property tax rates unambiguously. We then test this result using a French reform, which changes the composition of the main local business tax base in 2010. Estimations using Difference-in-Differences show that the reduction in the mobility of the tax base indeed results in higher business property tax rates. Housing tax rates were not affected by the reform.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R50|Det koster at være lille. Grønlands hjemtagelser 1980 til 1993 og smådriftsulemper (version 2)|After home rule in 1979 Greenland gradually takes over expenditure of general government from Denmark during the 1980ies. Step by step Denmark gives a subsidy to Greenland covering what were the Danish expenditures. Nearly the entire subsidy comes in four lumps, 1980, 1985, 1987 and 1992. Subsequently the subsidies have been regulated according to the increase in costs for the Danish general government in providing services. Supposing government expenditures being a constant fraction of GDP, we calculate what would have been the hypothetical Danish expenditures to the four areas and then compare these to the actual Greenlandic expenditures in 1994 and 2014. Actual expenditures are much higher than the projected Danish ones. Especially this is true for general public services and education where the level is more than twice the projection. The article’s point of view is that a large part of the overshooting is due to small scale diseconomies.
R50|Producción y exportación de vino en España: El caso de Castilla y León/Spains?s Wine Production and Exports: The Case of Castile and Leon|La industria agroalimentaria (IAA) constituye una de las principales ramas del sector manufacturero en Castilla y León y en España y una de las actividades que mejor comportamiento ha venido registrando en estos últimos años de dura crisis económica. Tales circunstancias confieren a este sector la condición de importante motor de desarrollo económico territorial. Dentro de la IAA, el subsector del vino ha experimentado un considerable dinamismo, hasta colocar a España como principal país exportador a nivel mundial. El objetivo fundamental del presente trabajo es reflejar la andadura del subsector vinícola en la región de Castilla y León, con particular referencia a su actividad exportadora. Para ello, se examinará la posición de la industria española del vino a escala mundial, su relevancia en el contexto agroalimentario nacional y su comportamiento en los últimos años. Después, se analizará el caso particular de esta rama manufacturera en Castilla y León, haciendo hincapié en sus potencialidades como vehículo de internacionalización, merced a la creciente exportación, y como elemento de desarrollo local/rural. The agrofood industry (AFI) is one of the main branches of the manufacturing sector in Castile and Leon and Spain and one of the best performing activities in recent years of severe economic crisis. In these circumstances this industry appears as an important factor for territorial economic development. Within the AFI, the wine subsector has experienced considerable dynamism, placing Spain as the main exporting country worldwide in volume. The main objective of this work is to analyze the evolution of the wine subsector in the region of Castile and Leon, with particular reference to its export activity. In order to achieve this purpose, the position of the Spanish wine industry at the global level, its relevance in the national agrofood context and its performance in recent years are examined. After that, the particular case of this manufacturing sector in Castile and Leon will be analyzed, emphasizing its potential as a vehicle for both internationalization, thanks to the increasing export, and local/rural development.
R50|What Makes Cities More Productive? Agglomeration Economies and the Role of Urban Governance: Evidence from 5 OECD Countries|This paper estimates agglomeration benefits across five OECD countries, and represents the first empirical analysis that combines evidence on agglomeration benefits and the productivity impact of metropolitan governance structures, while taking into account the potential sorting of individuals across cities. The comparability of results in a multi-country setting is supported through the use of a new internationally-harmonised definition of cities based on economic linkages rather than administrative boundaries. In line with the literature, the analysis confirms that city productivity increases with city size but finds that cities with fragmented governance structures tend to have lower levels of productivity. This effect is mitigated by the existence of a metropolitan governance body.
R50|Administrative fragmentation and economic performance of OECD TL2 regions|The present work investigates the relationship between administrative fragmentation and regional per capita GDP growth rate, using a panel of OECD TL2 regions in the period 1996-2011. According to the fiscal decentralisation literature, fragmentation should enhance growth as local governments can implement policies that better match citizens’ needs, thus providing services and public goods in a more efficient way. The presence of many local governments, however, may result in overlapping functions, (dis)economies of scale, and uncoordinated policies.
R50|Civic Crowdfunding: A collective option for local public goods?|This paper investigates the potential of civic crowdfunding as an innovative and collective option for contributing to the production of local public goods. It is articulated around two pillars. The first section provides a general understanding of crowdfunding practices and focuses principally on its civic component. Civic crowdfunding should be distinguished from other types of crowdfunding since it pursues an objective of general interest and mainly concerns place-based projects instigated by citizens and civil society organisations. The aim of this section is to better understand this field, from the general principles to the specific characteristics of actors and their motivations. The second section goes a step further towards the analysis of this practice with regards to the provision of local public goods. Crowdfunded local public goods usually belong to a specific category of public goods, “urban commons”, which generate significant challenges in terms of production, governance and sustainability. Building on the theory of contracts to better understand the interaction among stakeholders in this process, a new model of co-production relying on civic crowdfunding is proposed. Subnational governments would have a key role to play in enabling this practice and facilitating citizen empowerment through the mobilisation of platforms assets. Civic crowdfunding can provide opportunities for subnational governments in terms of citizens/user information, funding, communication, trust and territorial attractiveness. This paper outlines a series of key questions to guide policy makers in experimenting this practice.
R50|“Decentralization” of income per capita and its relationship to administrative decentralization in the context of European Union members|"In this research we tried to define, for the first time, the concept of ""decentralization"" of per capita income and its position among other constructions, similar to or associated with it. In this direction, we tried to give decentralization a definition as clear as possible, using existing concepts to identify it, but also to associate it with its most likely cause, administrative decentralization. Besides the theoretical documentation we, additionally, attempted to put this relationship under an econometric test, which indicates some trends but, because of the difficulties in measuring some variables, we were not able to extract absolutely reliable conclusions."
R50|Does Corruption Ease the Burden of Regulation? National and Subnational Evidence|Does corruption ease the burden of regulation? We test this question using survey data on business managers’ experience of dealing with regulation and corruption. We find that there is substantial within-country variation in the burden of regulation and that corruption is associated with worse regulatory outcomes across a range of indicators at the country and subnational level. Our results, which hold over a number of specifications, are inconsistent with the hypothesis that corruption greases the wheels of commerce by easing the burden of regulation on the average firm in poor regulatory environments. Rather, our results suggest that corruption increases the burden and imposes large costs on businesses
R50|Researches regarding the confirmation of sunflower hibrises by influence of technological verifications in the south water area of Romania|The main purpose of this paper is to determine the best sunflower hybrids (Helianthus annuus) suitable for the southern part of Romania, which under different conditions of fertilization and technology will lead to the achievement of large and stable productions. The experience was located at INCDA Fundulea, on a uniform chernozem soil in terms of fertility and microrelief. The experimental module was of the trifactor type and was arranged according to the subdivision parcel method in three rehearsals. The cultivation of the plants was carried out under optimum conditions, specific to the culture area, in the non-irrigated version, the genotypes taken into study consisting of three hybrids: Performer, Barolo RO and PR64A89. The conclusions are to determine the associated influence of three crop factors, namely plant density, fertilization and hybrid influence on sunflower production under the climatic year 2013.
R50|On the Optimal Design of Place-Based Policies: A Structural Evaluation of EU Regional Transfers|We quantify general equilibrium effects of place-based policies in a multi-region framework with mobility, trade and agglomeration economies. Using detailed data on EU transfers, we infer the local effects of different transfer types on productivity, income and transportation cost. Based on these estimates and the general equilibrium model we derive the spatial distribution of economic activity and the resulting aggregate welfare effects if (i) no transfers were paid and taxes set to zero, (ii) transfers were distributed uniformly, (iii) transfers were welfare-optimally distributed. Characterizing the optimal distributions, we reveal complementarities between transfer types and between transfers and local endowments.
R50|The Effect of a Second Home Construction Ban on Real Estate Prices|In 2012, a drastic regulation prohibiting the construction of holiday and investment homes in touristic municipalities in Switzerland was surprisingly introduced. I investigate the causal effect of such a construction limitation on real estate prices. The regulation does not affect all municipalities, which provides a unique possibility to separate the municipalities into treatment and control groups. I apply the synthetic control method to estimate the causal effect of the regulation. Unlike the classic synthetic control method literature, I deal with multiple heterogeneous treatment units. This allows me to compute statistical significance precisely and construct confidence intervals. I demonstrate a salient drop in real estate prices of between - 10% and -18% three to five years after the intervention. These results are highly significant. However, no effect on prices in the first two years after the intervention is found. The decrease in prices is shown to be caused by indirect channels such as adverse effects on local economies and legal uncertainty.
R50|Are Perceptions of Corruption Matching Reality? Theory and Evidence from Microdata|Some criticism has been raised on the actual capability of corruption perception-based indices to gauge the essence of concepts they aim to measure. One can argue that perceptions about corruption are not matching reality and could be the re?ection of distorted truth. Based on this evidence we provide a theoretical ground for the corruption decision-making process (objective corruption) and the corruption perception-making process (subjective corruption) which accounts for the role of media attention. From the theoretical model we are able to derive testable implications for the empirical analysis, i.e. whether socio and cultural norms can explain the gap between the two measures of corruption across Europe. We employ a generalised setting of the structural equation models to build latent indices of objective and subjective corruption from our microdata exploiting the information on various economic, geographic and socio-demographic factors that can a¤ect the perception and the experience of corruption practices. The resulting indices allow us to define country rankings for both types of corruption and draw a geopolitical picture of the phenomenon across Europe. We also show that countries where the quality of media is higher are associated with lower di¤erences between perceived and real corruption.

R50|Economic Challenges of Lagging Regions II: Recent Structural Reforms, Outstanding Needs and Governance Issues|This report is concerned with analysing, for eight EU Member States with lagging regions, the main structural reforms carried out over the past five to ten years, essentially those which are relevant for the European Structural and Investment Funds. Furthermore it provides an overview of the remaining structural reforms needed, including to the system and operation of governance, and their relevance for lagging regions. The identification of the remaining reforms needed is based on a detailed analysis of the main indicators that can be identified to assess the situation in each of the eight countries concerned and, so far as possible, in the lagging regions in them. An additional concern is to gauge the effects of the reforms carried out with a particular focus on the lagging regions. The first subsection of the report briefly sets out the structural reforms covered by the analysis and the rationale for choosing these from among all those subject to the European Council’s Country-Specific Recommendations. It then presents for each of the eight countries and the lagging regions the main structural imbalances in the form of a concise summary bringing out the main points emerging from the detailed analysis for each country. The second sub-section assesses the effects of labour market reforms on investment, productivity and competitiveness. A third sub-section examines the business environment in each of the countries and the lagging regions within these as well as the structure of enterprises and business demography, and attempts to relate this to the business environment. It also considers the reforms which have been carried out over recent years which have been aimed at improving the situation in which businesses operate.
R50|Impactos Económicos Regionales del “Shale Gas” en la Reforma Energética de México|El estudio tiene como objetivo estimar los impactos económicos de algunos aspectos de la Reforma Energética de 2013 en el Noreste de México, particularmente los relacionados con los recursos de gas de esquisto (lutitas) o de “shale gas”. En específico, el reporte presenta estimaciones preliminares de los efectos de los nuevos proyectos de construcción y operación de gasoductos en la región Noreste. Para medir dichos impactos se construyeron matrices insumo-producto y de contabilidad social regionales. Para ello, se partió de las matrices nacionales del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía para el año 2012. Al análisis tradicional de insumo-producto se le ha añadido información de cuentas sociales que presentan las transacciones no sólo entre sectores industriales sino que además incluyen a instituciones como los hogares, las sociedades y los trabajadores por cuenta propia.
R50|Taxes in an e-commerce generation|Abstract Rapid growth in e-commerce has altered the ability of jurisdictions to enforce commodity taxes on a destination basis. This results in different effective tax rates depending on the way in which goods and services are purchased and the characteristics of both the products and the sellers. We discuss the arguments for the destination principle as the appropriate place-of-taxation rule for consumption taxation of cross-border trade. We analyze various recent reforms to the value-added tax in the European Union in response to e-commerce. We then examine various policy options in the USA—maintaining the status quo, changing nexus rules, states adopting information reporting, and national reforms that require firms to remit taxes regardless of physical presence—and relate them to the recent European reforms. We conclude based on our analysis and the recent European Union experience that reforms at the national level appear to be the important next step to enforcing commodity taxes at destination in the USA.
R50|Decentralized Leadership|This paper studies the efficiency of decentralized leadership in federations where selfish regional governments provide regional and federal public goods and the benevolent central government implements interregional earmarked and income transfers. Without residential mobility, unlimited decentralized leadership is efficient only if the center implements redistributive interregional income and earmarked transfers to equate consumption of private and regional public goods across regions. Such policies perfectly align the incentives of the selfish regional governments. With imperfect residential mobility, decentralized leadership is efficient if the center adopts redistributive interregional income and earmarked policies and there is a common labor market in the federation.
R50|Leerstand von Einfamilienhäusern: Ein dörfliches Problem?|Ein großer Teil des Leerstands im Einfamilienhaussegment lässt sich durch strukturelle Regionsmerkmale erklären. Das Ausmaß des Leerstands in einer Gemeinde hängt darüber hinaus von den baulichen Eigenschaften ab, die den Einfamilienhausbestand der Region charakterisieren. Dabei kommt es insbesondere darauf an, wie alt und wie groß die Wohnungen im Einfamilienhausbestand einer Gemeinde sind.
R50|Postura fiscal y crecimiento económico regional en Colombia|Este documento estudia la forma en que ha incidido el gasto público en la actividad económica de los departamentos en Colombia durante el periodo 2000-2013, a partir de la aplicación de diferentes técnicas derivadas de medición económica cuyos resultados se confrontan para explicar la intencionalidad de la postura fiscal de los gobiernos territoriales en sus economías. En este sentido, se desea representar cómo ha influido el gasto público en el producto regional y en qué magnitud los departamentos han aportado al PIB nacional, identificando los rasgos fiscales distintivos de dicho impacto, con el fin de explicar en qué sentido dicha asignación es eficiente para las regiones. Entre las diferentes herramientas empleadas se combinan técnicas de MCO, con aportes relativos al crecimiento, índices de localización y/o especialización del gasto público, de la formación bruta de capital fijo y del valor agregado, evaluados con su desempeño fiscal particular durante toda la serie. Los resultados muestran que las regiones que han aprovechado mejor la asignación de recursos públicos en Colombia, sin importar el nivel del gasto, han obtenido mejor desempeño de sus economías, contrario a las tesis que plantean que el gasto público por sí sólo es un dinamizador de la actividad. ****** This paper studies how public spending has affected the economic activity of the departments in Colombia during the period 2000-2013, from the application of different techniques derived from economic measurement whose results are compared to explain the intent of the fiscal stance of territorial governments in their economies. In this sense, we want to represent how it has influenced public spending on the regional product; and to what extent departments have contributed to national GDP identifying such impact´s distinctive tax traits in order to explain the reason this allocation is efficient for regions. Among the different tools used MCO techniques are combined with contributions related to growth, rates of localization and / or specialization of public expenditure, the fixed capital´s gross formation and added value. They are evaluated with its particular fiscal performance throughout the series. The results show that the regions that have better utilized the allocation of public resources in Colombia, regardless of the level of spending, they have obtained better performance of their economies, contrary to the arguments posed that public spending alone is an active catalyst
R50|Comunidad, conectividad y movimiento regional en la Patagonia: evolución del capital social en la Región de Aysén, Chile|Las pequeñas comunidades rurales de la Región de Aysén, Chile, evidencian una variedad de formas y tipos de capital social. La forma específica de capital social que predomina ha evolucionado según cambios en el contexto nacional y la progresiva integración comunicacional. Tras haber sido ejemplo de cooperación comunitaria, las comunidades rurales enfrentaron el desafío de relacionarse con actores sociales de mayor poder, en el escenario ampliado de la sociedad civil regional. En muchos casos, este cambio conllevó una menor autonomía y la captura de facciones comunitarias en cadenas de clientelismo. Sin embargo, en 2012 emergió el movimiento “Tu problema es mi problema” para enfrentar la marginación percibida en sus relaciones asimétricas con el gobierno central. Este evento masivo de desobediencia civil se basó en tres formas de capital social y marcó la emergencia de una ciudadanía de alcance regional, cumpliendo una de las condiciones para una descentralización plenamente democrática.
R50|Community, connectivity and the regional movement in Patagonia: the evolution of social capital in the Aysén Region of Chile|Small rural communities in the Aysén Region of Chile evince a variety of forms and types of social capital. The predominant form of social capital has evolved in accordance with changes in the national context and the gradual integration through communications. Having been an example of community cooperation, rural communities were faced with the challenge of relating to more powerful social actors on the broader stage of the region’s civil society. This change often resulted in autonomy declining and community factions being caught up in chains of clientelism. In 2012, however, the “Your problem is my problem” movement emerged to address the marginalization perceived in the region’s asymmetrical relations with central government. The mass civil disobedience this involved was grounded in three types of social capital and marked the emergence of a citizenship that spanned the region, thus meeting one of the conditions for fully democratic decentralization.
R50|Local fiscal competition: An application to sales taxation with multiple federations|Local sales tax rates influence the location of retail activity. This paper develops a theory and empirical identification strategy for studying sales tax competition with “multiple federations,” as exemplified by multiple counties each containing several cities. In addition to strategic interactions with nearby cities and a city’s own county, city tax rates are influenced by the tax rates of neighboring counties. Cities react heterogeneously to own-county sales tax rates depending on distance to the county border. Using data on the driving time to county borders and a comprehensive cross-section of local sales tax rates, I exploit variation in proximity to county borders to identify vertical fiscal competition. Cities located near county borders react more intensely to their county’s tax rate in comparison to towns at the interior. An increase in the neighboring county tax rate raises city tax rates in nearby counties.
R50|Fewer vacants, fewer crimes? Impacts of neighborhood revitalization policies on crime|The relationship between neighborhood physical environment and social disorder, particularly crime, is of critical interest to urban economists and sociologists, as well as local governments. Over the past 50years, various policy interventions to improve physical conditions in distressed neighborhoods have also been heralded for their potential to reduce crime. Urban renewal programs in the mid-20th century and public housing redevelopment in the 1990s both subscribed to the idea that signs of physical disorder invite social disorder. More recently, the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) provided funding for local policymakers to rehabilitate or demolish foreclosed and vacant properties, in order to mitigate negative spillovers—including crime—on surrounding neighborhoods. In this paper, we investigate the impact of NSP investments on localized crime patterns in Cleveland, Chicago and Denver. Results suggest that demolition activity in Cleveland decreased burglary and theft, but do not find measurable impacts of property rehabilitation investments—although the precision of these estimates are limited by the number of rehabilitation activities.
R50|Sub-metropolitan tax competition with household and capital mobility|Abstract This paper investigates the efficiency properties of tax competition between sub-metropolitan jurisdictions when capital, residents and workers are mobile, and both households and firms compete for local land markets. We analyze two decentralized equilibria: (1) With a local tax on residents and two separate local taxes on capital and land inputs, efficiency is achieved and the existence of a marginal fiscal cost due to residents’ mobility is revealed; (2) Combination of the taxes on capital and land inputs into a single business property tax leads local authorities to charge inefficiently high taxation on capital. We show that capital mobility induces a reduction in the business land taxation and local public inputs are used to offset the distorting effects of the property tax, accounting for the distorting impact of workers’ mobility.
R50|The Portfolio Rebalancing Channel of Quantitative Easing|This paper analyzes the portfolio rebalancing channel of Quantitative Easing (QE hereafter) interventions. First, we identify the effects of a QE shock using a Bayesian VAR on US data using a sign and zero restrictions identification scheme. We find that QE shocks have substantial effects on corporate spreads with different ratings, supportive of a portfolio rebalancing channel. Second, we build a DSGE model with a securitzation mechanism. We confront the resulting impulse response functions to those uncovered by our VAR analysis, and find a fairly good match. Finally, we show that the portfolio rebalancing channel crucially affects the transmission of QE shocks to real economy.
R50|The growth and variability of local taxes: An application to the Italian regions|This paper investigates the short- and long-run responses of tax bases used by sub-central governments with regard to regional GDP. The methodology is applied to the two main taxes levied by the Italian regions over the period 2001-2012, the surtax on the personal income tax (RPIT) and the regional tax on productive activities (RTPA). Our results suggest that both tax bases do not exhibit long-run potential growth and that they are pro-cyclical. Furthermore, this pro-cyclicality is higher in the case of RTPA and during recession periods in all regions. The results cast some doubts on the adequacy of these two bases to provide an adequate financing source to provide health and other regional public services, normally highly demanded during business cycle contractions.
R50|Public housing magnets: public housing supply and immigrants’ location choices|This article investigates how a reform allowing immigrants with children in France access to public housing during the 1970s influenced their initial location choices across local labour markets. We find that cities with higher public housing supplies have a large ‘magnetic effect’ on the location choice of new immigrants with children. The estimated effect is substantial and quantitatively similar to the effect of the size of the ethnic group in the urban area. In cities with higher public housing supply, these immigrants tend to benefit from better housing conditions, but non-European immigrants are also more likely to be unemployed.
R50|Determinantes del rendimiento académico en regiones desarrolladas y en desarrollo de Colombia: una aproximación a partir de un modelo de combinación de corte transversal|En este trabajo se analizan los determinantes del rendimiento académico de la educación media, comparando los resultados en el área de matemáticas de la prueba saber 11° de los estudiantes de grado once de las regiones con mayor y menor nivel de desarrollo socioeconómico de Colombia. La metodología utilizada se desarrolló a través de la aplicación de un Modelo de Combinación de Corte Transversal para el periodo de estudio de 2008 a 2013. Los resultados muestran que existen importantes diferencias entre los determinantes del rendimiento académico en regiones con mayor y menor nivel de desarrollo socioeconómico, las características personas de los estudiantes, tales como la edad y la etnia, así como las características de las escuela, tienen mayor impacto sobre los estudiantes de las regiones con menor nivel de desarrollo; mientras que las características familiares y del hogar, tales como educación de los padres, disponer de computador en casa y los ingresos familiares, presentan un mayor impacto sobre el rendimiento académico de los estudiantes de regiones con mayor nivel de desarrollo socioeconómico./In this study the determinants of academic performance is analyzed by comparing the results of the mathematical knowledge test Saber 11 of eleventh grade students of the regions with higher and lower levels of socioeconomic development in Colombia. The main objective of this research is to determine the factors influencing academic performance of secondary education, comparing regions under development and economic growth regions more favorable socioeconomic contexts. The methodology was developed through the application of a combined model cutaway which allows the individual to analyze combinations of units of study temporal, cross-sectional units for the study period 2008-2013. The results show that there are significant differences between the determinants of academic performance in regions with higher and lower levels of socioeconomic development. The personal characteristics of students, such as age and ethnicity, as well as school characteristics have a greater impact on students of regions of lower development; meanwhile, other determinants related to family and household characteristics such as parental education, technological accessibility and household incomes, have a greater impact on the academic performance of students in regions with higher levels of socioeconomic development.
R50|Does Private Schooling Increase Adult Earnings? Cohort-Level Evidence for U.S. States|Public schooling in the U.S. has numerous critics, many of whom suggest that alternatives such as providing vouchers for private schools may be more effective. This paper combines decennial census and American Community Survey data for various years to examine the relationship between cohort-level private-schooling rates and later earnings during adulthood. We also explore differences by sex and examine the role played by the quantity of education completed and occupational attainment. We find a significant positive relationship between private-schooling rates and adult earnings for women but a small relationship for men.
R50|Local governments’ efficiency: A systematic literature review – Part I|The efficient management of the available resources in local governments has been a topic of high interest in the field of public sector. We provide an extensive and comprehensive review of the existing literature on local governments’ efficiency from a global point of view, covering all articles from 1990 to August 2016. This paper is the first of two. It covers the basic aspects related to local governments’ efficiency measurement not taking into account the effect of environmental conditions. First we show a detailed overview of the studies investigating public sector efficiency across various countries, comparing the data and samples employed, and the main results obtained. Second, we describe which techniques have been used for measuring efficiency in the context of local governments. Third, we summarise the inputs and outputs used. Finally, we discuss some operative directions and considerations for further research in the field.

R50|Economic and political determinants of central fiscal transfers in India: A dynamic panel analysis of state level data|This article empirically examines economic and political determinants of the aggregated as well as the channel-specific Central transfers to states in a developing country like India. An annual panel data set for 22 Indian States for the period of 1980-81 to 2010-11 is used for this purpose. Considering non-availability of continuous data for the study period, States like Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Jharkhand, Mizoram and Uttaranchal are not considered in the study. Dynamic panel regression equations are specified to analyze the determinants of Central transfers. Various components of Central transfers are alternatively regressed on a set of economic-demographic and political variables like per-capita gross state domestic product, population, literacy rate, area, fiscal dependency, loyal voter, State election year dummy, political alignment and bargaining power. State-specific dummies are included in all models to control for the unobserved time-invariant State specific effects. Linear time trend (year) is also included in all equations, as some of time series variables used are found to be trend stationary. System generalized methods of moments (GMM) estimator with heteroskedastic corrected robust standard error is used to obtain coefficients. Post-estimation tests like the Sargan test for over-identifying restrictions and Arellano Bond autocorrelation tests at first differenced error are used for verifying the validity of model. The results suggest that all categories of Central transfers are affected by political factors, besides economic-demographic variables. The states having partisan alignment with the Centre and greater political bargaining power tend to receive larger per capita central transfers. While loyal voter variable has significant and positive effect on per capita discretionary grant, state election year dummy never emerges to be statistically significant. This indicates that the transfers in Indian case are mainly targeted to core voters than to create swing. Among the economic variables, potential influence arises from the fiscal requirement and level of service provisions in the state. Findings of the study are observed to be robust and immune to change of specifications from linear to log-linear and omission of special category states from the data set. Recommending formula-based transfers, bringing all components of transfers into formula net, objective assessment of non-plan revenue deficit grant and co-ordination among resource recommending agencies in designing weights and criteria would help to check political influence.
R50|Do government preferences matter for tax competition?|This paper explores how government preferences affect capital tax decisions of a country. We develop a model in which governments, differentiating in their preferences for economic development and income equality, compete for mobile capital over corporation taxes. The key prediction of the model, borne out in data from OECD countries over the years 1990–2012, is that an increase in government preferences for pursuing economic development relative to income equality makes countries’ horizontal tax reactions stronger. Unlike the existing studies, our result contributes to the tax competition literature by highlighting the importance of government preferences in determining the extent of tax competition among countries and so offering a novel explanation for the widely observed heterogeneous tax policies across countries.

The authors of the article have also analysed the structure of income from assets owned by the poviat. The study covers the period from 2011 to 2014. In the paper the method of static analysis and the analysis of sources are used.
R50|Caricatura y metáfora sobre la crisis del euro en la prensa económica europea/Caricature and Metaphor About the Euro Crisis in the European Economic Press|Este artículo analiza el papel de la metáfora, una de las figuras retóricas más importantes del lenguaje económico, que sirve para explicar conceptos abstractos con imágenes físicas. Las principales metáforas conceptuales de la economía se aplican a la descripción de metáforas lingüísticas frecuentes de que se ha servido, sobre todo la prensa en inglés, en caricaturas y titulares, para hablar de la crisis económica actual. Se lleva a cabo una valoración de dicha crisis que sirve, al mismo tiempo, para aplicar y traducir esas metáforas al español, descubrir las connotaciones semánticas asociadas con estas metáforas, así como las semejanzas y diferencias entre las dos concepciones lingüísticas en este sentido. This article analyzes the role of metaphor, one of the most important rhetorical figures of the economic language, which serves to explain abstract concepts with physical images. The main conceptual metaphors of economy are applied to the description of frequent linguistic metaphors used in the English press, in caricatures and headlines, to discuss the current economic crisis. It is carried out an economic analysis of that crisis that serves, at the same time, to apply and translate those metaphors into Spanish, to find out the semantic connotations conveyed by them, as well as the similarities and differences between the two linguistic conceptions in this respect.
R50|Policy Challenges for Agriculture and Rural Areas in Norway|Norwegian policy gives high priority to supporting rural communities, with support for agriculture receiving particular attention. It is broadly successful in terms of maintaining rural communities, and urban-rural gaps in a range of well-being indicators are comparatively narrow. However, the cost-efficiency and sustainability of the policy mechanisms are questionable. Agriculture and rural policy in Norway needs to focus more strongly on economic sustainability alongside social sustainability. Agricultural support remains overly concentrated on maintaining the status quo and has seen little reform compared with policies elsewhere in the OECD. In contrast, the fishing industry has reformed much further towards economic sustainability, aquaculture has seen considerable success and there is potential for more rural tourism. Supporting rural communities also requires attention to the quality of public services in rural areas, and this report draws particular attention to inefficiencies arising from small-scale municipalities, and supports efforts to encourage mergers towards larger units, paving the way for greater operational leeway for municipal government.This working paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of Norway (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-norway.htm). Agriculture et zones rurales en Norvège : enjeux pour l'action publique Les pouvoirs publics norvégiens s’emploient de manière prioritaire à soutenir les communautés rurales, le soutien à l’agriculture bénéficiant d’une attention particulière. Cette politique porte largement ses fruits en ce qui concerne le maintien des communautés rurales, et pour tout un éventail d’indicateurs du bien-être, les écarts entre les zones urbaines et les zones rurales sont relativement modestes. Toutefois, on peut s’interroger sur le rapport coût-efficience et sur la viabilité d’une telle stratégie. Les politiques agricoles et rurales de la Norvège devraient mettre davantage l’accent sur la viabilité économique parallèlement à la viabilité sociale. Le soutien à l’agriculture reste excessivement concentré sur le maintien du statu quo et les réformes ont été peu nombreuses par comparaison avec les politiques menées dans d’autres pays de l’OCDE. En revanche, l’industrie halieutique a été bien davantage réformée dans le sens de la viabilité économique, l’aquaculture a enregistré des réussites considérables et il existe un potentiel de développement du tourisme rural. Le soutien apporté aux communautés rurales doit également prendre en compte la qualité des services publics dans les zones rurales ; la présente Étude souligne en particulier les inefficiences liées aux municipalités de petite taille et soutient les efforts déployés pour encourager les fusions visant à constituer des collectivités plus larges, ce qui permettrait de ménager aux autorités municipales de plus grandes marges de manoeuvre opérationnelles. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de la Norvège 2015 (www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-norvege.htm).
R50|Are the Investments from Structural Funds Meeting the Citizens’ Expectations? – Evidence from Sofia and Bucharest|In 2007, t he Cohesion policy promised to improve the attractiveness of cities across the European Union, addressing issues such as their accessibility, adequate services and environment preservation. Now that the programming period is concluding, achievements made in this direction must be scrutinized in order to assess if indeed the expectations of citizens living in these cities were met or not. In this context, the paper focuses on the capital cities of 2 countries for which 2007-2013 was the first programming exercise of structural and cohesion funds, namely Sofia and Bucharest. The paper presents an analysis of the projects implemented in these cities by the local authorities, comparing the results to the expectations of their citizens as reflected by the main conclusions of the surveys regarding the quality of life published by the European Commission in 2007. The analysis aims to contribute to the further improvement of the future Cohesion policy.
R50|Competition for Foreign Capital under Asymmetric Revenue-Orientation|This paper develops a model of inter-regional competition for mobile capital considering that regions may have different revenue-orientations. It shows that, if regions are asymmetric in terms of revenue-orientation, the less revenue-orientated region obtains higher tax-revenue and higher social welfare in the equilibrium than the more revenue-oriented region. However, if regions are symmetric, the equilibrium tax-revenue and social welfare are higher in the case of greater revenue-orientation of regions. Moreover, regions spend on public-investment and end up with Pareto-inferior equilibrium outcome, regardless of whether regions are symmetric or asymmetric. It also analyses implications of public-investment spill-over on equilibrium outcomes.
R50|The Evolution Of State Aid In Romania. Analysis Of The Automotive Sector 2007-2015|This study, according to our knowledge is among the few ones dealing with the analysis of state aid impact and of the way it was used at national level. Firstly, the goal of our study is to analyze the evolution of state aid in Romania, the impact on regional development, on creating jobs and value added. Secondly it is intented to see the contribution of automotive sector which received the highest amount of state aid to the trade balance from the current account between 2008-2015. Automotive sector is a key sector for the development of Romanian economy in the last 10 years for the manufacturing and assembly of cars and for companies producing equipment or auto parts. The paper is structured in seven parts which deal with topics like the state aid in the European Union and Romania, state aid schemes and funded sectors in Romania, sectorial and geographical distribution of the state aid, the analysis of the automotive sector for Romania.
R50|Fiscal equalization schemes and subcentral government borrowing|Examining the cases of Canada, Germany, and Spain, the role played by fiscal equalization schemes in determining subnational borrowing was analyzed, and the link between regional governmentsâ€™ primary fiscal balances and gross domestic product per capita was tested econometrically. The study results show that either poor or rich regions can display higher regional public borrowing on average, and these results can be linked to the institutional design of regional equalization systems in place. Particular elements, such as tax efforts and fiscal capacities, also play relevant roles in this regard. Reforms of these schemes can therefore prove instrumental in reducing regional heterogeneity in public borrowing.
R50|Taxable Capacity, Tax Efforts and Structural Break: Do the Child States Follow Their Respective Parents?|The present article makes an attempt to test the hypothesis whether smaller states have better fiscal efficiency in terms of own tax revenue collections or not. This has been tested by taking the case of three states Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar with their child states Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, respectively. For this purpose tax buoyancy, tax capacity and efforts, and structural break modelsâ€”Chow test (with known break points) and Quandt likelihood ratio (QLR) test (with unknown break points), to see the impact of value added tax (VAT) on own tax revenue (OTR)â€”have been estimated. Log-log regression model was adopted for both calculating tax buoyancies and taxable capacity of each parent and child state. However, we did not find any conclusive evidence that child states have better tax buoyancy or tax efforts. On the basis of our observations, we concluded that the size of the state is not a major determinant affecting revenue efficiency of the state. Other supplementary policies like efficient tax administration, developed industrial sector, reduced exemptions and concessions, broad-based and effective tax rates are equally important.

R50|The relevance of commuting zones for regional spending efficiency| We use data envelopment analysis (DEA) efficiency scores to show that clustering municipalities into encompassing regional clusters improves spending efficiency of single stand-alone municipalities. We propose a new geographic aggregation based on municipalities-to-municipalities commuting flows, defined using hierarchical cluster analysis. Our example for Portugal shows that from an output-oriented perspective between 83% and 98% of municipalities would increase their efficiency scores, while from an input-oriented perspective between 86% and 98% of municipalities would also be better off in terms of efficiency. Then using a linear regression model, we find that population increases positively affects the efficient scores (via scale economies). Also, increases in the share of high-educated and poorer residents leads to higher efficiency scores.
R50|Output Shocks In China: Do The Distributional Effects Depend On The Regional Source?|The tension between growth and inequality in the process of economic development has been recognised in the research literature as well as in policy-making circles for many decades. In few countries in the modern world is this problem more acute than in China where inter-provincial disparities are large by world standards and where remarkable economic growth in the past three decades has tended sooner to widen than to narrow them. Not surprisingly, the source of such inter-provincial disparities in China has been the subject of considerable research. Yet we have relatively little empirical knowledge of the effects on the provincial distribution of output of shocks to macroeconomic variables such as GDP. This is an important gap in the empirical literature: macroeconomic shocks are likely to have a differential impact on the provincial economies and so affect the provincial output distribution. Policy-makers need to know the sign, size and timing of such effects before making policy decisions designed to influence output at the national or regional level. In this paper we focus on the regional source of national shocks and ask whether the effect at the provincial level depends on the regional source of the shock. We use two alternative methods for this. The first is one recently employed by Chen and Groenewold (2015) to analyse the provincial effects of shocks to national output and investment using a restricted VAR model due to Lastrapes (2005). The method extends their work by disaggregating national GDP into three regional outputs – for the coastal, central and western regions of China. Our second method uses a sequence of VAR models, each with three regional outputs and one provincial output. We find that the two methods give remarkably similar results – both provide strong evidence that a shock to a particular region’s output has its main effects on the provinces in that region, although this is more marked in the short run than in the long run and differs somewhat across regions. In particular, a shock to national output which originates in the coastal region has an affect mainly on the coastal provinces in both the short and long runs. Such a shock is therefore likely to exacerbate existing inter-provincial disparities. However, there is more diffusion of the effects of a central shock, particularly in the long run which may help alleviate disparities. A shock to the western region also generates spillover effects in the long run although these are to the coastal provinces and will therefore likely widen existing disparities.
R50|Understanding the distribution of economic benefits from improving coastal and marine ecosystems|The ecological status of coastal and marine waterbodies world-wide is threatened by multiple stressors, including nutrient inputs from various sources and increasing occurrences of invasive alien species. These stressors impact the environmental quality of the Baltic Sea. Each Baltic Sea country contributes to the stressors and, at the same time, is affected by their negative impacts on water quality. Understanding who benefits from improvements in coastal and marine waters is key to assessing public support for policies aimed at achieving such changes. We propose a new approach to account for variability in benefits related to differences in socio-demographics of respondents, by using a structural model of discrete choice. Our method (1) provides a convenient way of incorporating a wide range of socio-demographics as explanatory variables in conditional multinomial logit models without the risk of collinearity, and (2) is more statistically efficient than the alternative, typically used approaches. The new technique is applied in a study which examines the preferences of Latvian citizens towards improvements of the coastal and marine environment quality that could help the Baltic Sea waters of Latvia reach Good Environmental Status as required by the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Applying the discrete choice experiment method, we find that overall, Latvians are willing to pay for reducing losses of biodiversity, for improving water quality for recreation by reduced eutrophication, and for reducing new occurrences of invasive alien species. A significant group within the sample seems not to value environmental improvements in the Baltic Sea, and, thus,is unwilling to support costly measures for achieving such improvements. The structural model of discrete choice reveals substantial heterogeneity among Latvians towards changes in the quality of coastal and marine waters of Latvia.
R50|A spatial analysis of inter-regional patient mobility in Italy|Free patient mobility among autonomous providers has been often considered an effective stimulus for enhancing healthcare. However, some jurisdictions may underperform due to the existence of economies of scale and spatial spillovers. Where regions assume the costs of providing care to residents, this could challenge the sustainability of regional budgets in a decentralised National Health Service (NHS) and put at risk universalism and equity of health care. We use a ten years (2001-2010) panel of Italian data on hospital discharges to assess the determinants of inter-regional mobility and to distinguish between factors related with policies pursued by the regional health authorities from extra-regional (neighbouring regions or national-level) factors. Data on hospital discharges are merged with a set of variables on salient features of hospital care services in each Regional Health System (RHS) and with information on demographic and economic characteristics of Italian regions. We analyse bilateral Origin-to-Destination (OD) flows between any two regions by means of a gravity regression model that includes a rich set of push and pull factors. Compared to previous studies, mainly performed on cross-section samples, the longitudinal dimension of the data enables us to estimate a nonlinear conditionally correlated random effects dynamic model that accounts for region-pair-specific unobservable heterogeneity. Moreover, we address the issue of cross-regional dependence arising from the existence of regional spillovers by applying recent advances in spatial econometrics (Elhorst, 2014; Vega and Elhorst, 2015). The model is estimated for total inter-regional patient flows and for specific types of hospital admission, namely surgery, medicine and cancers. Finally, the estimation results are used to analyse specific what-if scenarios relevant to the health authorities for the national and sub-national management of services. Our main results suggest that, beside regional population and income, local supply factors such as hospital capacity and technology endowment, clinical specialization and performance indicators are important drivers of patient mobility. Moreover, geography matters and spatial proximity plays a relevant role in reinforcing inter-regional mobility patterns. Our econometric analysis has also detected a mildly explosive dynamics in inter-regional patient mobility over time. This result, coupled with the significant role played by factors not directly controlled by regional policy-makers and RHS managers (e.g. population, GDP per capita and spatial spillovers), might induce a polarisation between the group of the richest, most populated and best performing regions, which are increasingly capable of attracting more patients, and the group of the weakest regions, with growing patient outflows and severe financial and organizational problems. These considerations call for a thorough assessment of the long-run sustainability of the current decentralised NHS. RHS budget autonomy could not be entirely consistent with free patient choice. This opens a more general discussion on whether and to what extent the health financing system would require the introduction of appropriate equalising compensation schemes aimed at neutralising the financial consequences of mobility and, eventually, at guaranteeing universalism and equity in healthcare.
R50|Climate change related risks, opportunities and adaptation actions in European cities - Insights from responses to the CDP cities program|Cities, home to more than half of the world's population and important economic hubs, are vulnerable to impacts of climate change and worthy to protect. To address these challenges, implementing climate change adaptation measures is inevitable. The paper provides insights into climate change related risks, opportunities and adaptation actions based on responses by 40 European cities to the 2014 CDP Cities Information Request. The analysis shows that 92.5% of the responding European cities report that they face physical risks arising from climate change and that they identify more intense rainfall as the most relevant physical risk. Furthermore, more than half of the participants indicate that they are facing social risks due to climate change with increased risk to already vulnerable populations being the most important one. However, 72.5% of the cities report that they see economic opportunities arising from climate change. Already, 55% of the observed European cities indicate that they have implemented adaptation action plans and 82.5% of all cities are putting adaptation action into practice. The results point out that city governments show great awareness, interest and knowledge in addressing climate change issues, but however there is still demand for information and guidance. Moreover, the variety of answers shows that there is no 'one-size fits all solution' for cities to adapt to climate change. Thus, the findings can also serve as an innovative starting point for further research as well as the design and practical implementation of adaptation measures.
R50|Im Fokus: Interkommunale Kooperation ist deutlich im Kommen – Ergebnisse einer Kommunalbefragung des IWH und der Universität Kassel|Interkommunale Kooperation wird vielfach als ein Mittel angesehen, mit dem speziell Städte und Gemeinden außerhalb der großen Ballungsräume die Folgen des demographischen Wandels und des zunehmenden interregionalen Standortwettbewerbs besser bewältigen könnten. Obschon immer mehr Gemeinden bei ihrer Aufgabenerfüllung zusammenarbeiten, fehlen für Deutschland bislang großflächige empirische Untersuchungen zum Phänomen der interkommunalen Kooperation. Der vorliegende Beitrag stellt Ergebnisse aus einer Befragung von 6 745 Gemeinden abseits der großen Ballungsräume zu ihrem Kooperationsverhalten in den Aufgabenbereichen Allgemeine Verwaltung, Bauhof und Tourismusmarketing vor. Die Auswertung der 1 321 Antworten gewährt aktuelle Einblicke in Merkmale und Tendenzen der interkommunalen Zusammenarbeit. Es werden unter anderem Befunde zum räumlichen, zeitlichen und thematischen Auftreten sowie zu den dahinterstehenden Rechtsformen und Motiven vorgestellt. Abschließend wird ein Ausblick auf die Möglichkeiten gegeben, mit den erhobenen Daten die Fragen nach den Wirkungen und den Bedingungen für das Zustandekommen von interkommunaler Kooperation zu beantworten.
R50|Vetoing and inaugurating policy like others do: evidence on spatial interactions in voter initiatives|Abstract A sizeable literature studies strategic interactions between governments. In this paper, we ask whether, in the presence of direct democratic institutions, voters’ actions in vetoing a decision or inaugurating a policy by a binding initiative in their jurisdiction have spillover effects on the actions of voters in neighboring jurisdictions. We collect (and make available) data on 3300 initiatives in German towns from 2002 to 2014 and match these to panel data on the towns’ sociodemographic and fiscal characteristics. We apply an instrumental variables approach and find that a jurisdiction’s probability of hosting an initiative is positively driven by the neighbors’ direct democratic activity. The size of the estimated average effect peaks around a 20 km neighborhood—where a standard deviation change of neighbors’ activity increases the probability of hosting an initiative by 5 percentage points—then gradually declines and fades away after around 60 km. This effect is driven by spillovers in similar policy areas and by successful initiatives, and is stronger in towns with relatively more information flows (measured by newspaper consumption and commuter flows).
R50|Do Political Parties Matter? - Evidence from German Communities|The paper aims to test whether partisanship affects policy outcomes at the local level. While the literature has presented comprehensive evidence for partisan effects on policy outcomes at the state and federal level, recent findings suggest that partisan effects may be absent at the city and municipality level. Using detailed data on public goods and service spending, we assess the link between the partisanship of local councils and the composition of public good spending of German localities. Firstly, we estimate panel data models assessing whether changes in partisanship impact per-capita-spending in different spending-categories. Secondly, we investigate whether left-wing or right-wing communities differ in their spending response to exogenous revenue shocks during their legislative term (among others induced by changes of the personal income tax base assigned to communities). Using propensity score matching and weighting, the approach compares responses in comparable municipalities, which differ in the partisan composition of their local council. Based on both strategies, we find moderate partisan effects only.
R50|What Makes Cities More Productive? Evidence from 5 OECD Countries on the Role of Urban Governance|In estimating agglomeration benefits across five OECD countries, this paper represents the first empirical analysis that contrasts cross-country evidence on agglomeration benefits with the productivity impact of metropolitan governance structures, while taking into account the potential sorting of individuals across cities. The comparability of results in a multi-country setting is supported through the use of a new internationally-harmonised definition of cities based on economic linkages rather than administrative boundaries. The analysis finds that cities with fragmented governance structures tend to have lower levels of productivity. The estimated elasticity for an increase in the number of local jurisdiction is 0.06, which is halved by the existence of a metropolitan governance body. The effect is sizeable, as the analysis confirms the result in the literature that city productivity increases with city size with an elasticity in the range of 0.02 to 0.05.
R50|Da Regulamentação à Promoção – o rural nos planos nacionais de turismo (1985-2011)| National Tourism Plans (NTP) are important documents for a better understanding of representations and social meanings of rural and rural tourism in Portugal. This paper, aiming to discuss these issues, is based on the detailed content analysis of the NTP over the last 30 years, namely, the NTP for the periods 1985-1988 and 1989-1992 and the National Strategic Plan for Tourism for the periods of 2007-2010 and 2011-2015. The content analysis performed was supported by a comprehensive analysis grid containing multiple categories (and corresponding values) identified based on the review of national and international literature on the rural world, its representations and meanings, as well as on rural tourism and policies and strategies implemented in the European Union (EU) and implemented in Portugal. The choice of this time period has referred to the date of the first NTP (1985) and Portugal’s entry in the European Economic Community (EEC) (1986). Based on the content analysis, we identified the main definitions, characteristics and products of Rural Tourism (RT) associated with each of the NTP, allowing to group a set of images and representations of rural and RT.
R50|Function Follows Form|Urban policy visibly molds city shape. This paper's interest is in how city shape (less visibly) molds urban policy. The paper finds: A sufficiently skewed city will look after its center. That is, the more skewed a city's shape towards the city periphery, the more likely an urban majority against any policy that could take away from the city center. This, when broadly interpreted, complements Sullivan's (1896) ''form follows function'' view prominent in architectural theory. Function (building uses) also follows form (building contours). Ultimately combining both views may help explain further how, and when, cities sprawl.
R50|A Compensating Differential Approach To Valuing The Social Benefit Of Minor League Baseball|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12080-abs-0001""> This research utilizes a compensating differential framework to measure the social benefits of minor league baseball teams. Consistent with findings at the major league level, individual housing observations from 138 metropolitan areas between 1993 and 2005 show that affiliated teams are associated with a significant 6 to 8% increase in rents in mid-sized markets ranging from 0.4 to 1.4 million people. On the other hand, independent teams and stadiums are associated with insignificant effects on rents. The positive effect of affiliated minor league teams suggests they are a valuable urban amenity that can contribute to local quality of life. (JEL H23, H41, H71, R50, L83 )"
R50|Contracting for Infrastructure Projects as Credence Goods| Large infrastructure projects are a major responsibility of urban and regional governments, who usually lack expertise to fully specify the demanded projects. Contractors, typically experts on such projects due to experience with similar projects, advise of the needed design as well as the cost of construction in their bids. Producing the right design is costly. We model such infrastructure projects taking into account their credence goods feature and the costly design effort they require and examine the performance of commonly used contracting methods. We show that when building costs are homogeneous and public information, simultaneous bidding involving shortlisting of two contractors and contingent compensation of both contractors on design efforts outperforms sequential search. If building costs are private information of the contractors and are revealed to them after design cost is sunk, sequential search may be superior to simultaneous bidding.
R50|The Effects of Changes in Property Tax Rates and School Spending on Residential and Business Property Value Growth|" type=""main""> In this article, we examine the effects of changes in property tax rates and school spending on residential and business property value growth in southeast Michigan. We use panel data for 152 communities in the five counties surrounding Detroit between the years 1983 and 2002, a period during which state government mandated major changes to school finance. Using the mandated changes to identify causality, we find that: (1) residential property values are more responsive to school spending changes than property tax rate changes; (2) business property values are more responsive to tax rate changes than school spending changes; and (3) business property values are more sensitive to changes in tax rates as compared to residential property. We also examine tax competition effects on property value growth, showing that tax competition plays an important role in property value growth in the southeast Michigan region."
R50|What makes cities more productive? Agglomeration economies and the role of urban governance: evidence from 5 OECD countries|This paper estimates agglomeration benefits across five OECD countries, and represents the first empirical analysis that combines evidence on agglomeration benefits and the productivity impact of metropolitan governance structures, while taking into account the potential sorting of individuals across cities. The comparability of results in a multi-country setting is supported through the use of a new internationally-harmonised definition of cities based on economic linkages rather than administrative boundaries. In line with the literature, the analysis confirms that city productivity increases with city size but finds that cities with fragmented governance structures tend to have lower levels of productivity. This effect is mitigated by the existence of a metropolitan governance body.

R50|Public debt and growth in German federal states: What can Europe learn?|While there is ample evidence on the linkage between public debt and economic growth for national economies, far fewer investigations have been carried out at the subnational level. In this paper, we therefore study the long- and short-term relationship between regional public debt intensities and economic output (growth) for German federal states between 1970 and 2010. We estimate dynamic error correction models, which account for heterogeneous transmission mechanisms among federal states and the presence of unobserved common factors such as global macroeconomic shocks. Our findings hint at a significantly negative relationship between regional public debt and per capita GDP in the long run. We further demonstrate that this negative long-term effect is not negligible for the interregional differences in per capita GDP levels. Linking our empirical findings to the current policy debate on fiscal consolidation, we show along the lines of the German case that the decision of enacting a constitutional debt brake for subnational governments to limit the degree of discretionary spending policies together with supplementary measures – such as joint capital market operations by the central and state-level governments to lower borrowing costs – may provide new stimuli for a European-wide debate on the feasibility of solid fiscal consolidation.
R50|Competition and property tax limit overrides: Revisiting Massachusetts' Proposition 2½|This paper looks at the role of spatial proximity of other towns' decisions to hold an override vote on the decision of a Massachusetts town to hold an initial override vote under Proposition 2½. We find that if a neighboring town has already held a vote at some point in the past, a town's likelihood of holding an initial vote increases by 10–15%. A prior vote being successful has a strong impact, whereas losing votes are relatively ignored. The presence of spatial dependence remains when we look at the specific purpose of override vote, or at the annual number of votes that have occurred between 1982 and 2010. This result is consistent across weighting schemes.

This skin consists of a sensored and metered urban environment. The urban world is becoming a platform for generating data on the workings of human society, human interactions with the physical environment and manifold economic, political and social processes. The advent of the digital skin opens up many questions for urban theory and research, and many new issues for public and urban policy, which are explored in this article.
R50|Development policies and partnerships in Greece: experiences from Thessaloniki|Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the importance of specific local development policies and partnerships for SME enterprises in Thessaloniki one of the metropolis of south Europe. The two main research questions are: first, what are the most important development policies for firms’ development? and second, in what level these policies receive different significance from firms belonging in different production sectors? Design/methodology/approach - – In order to achieve the aims of the paper and answer the research questions, the study uses an extensive use of bibliography, and field research that has been implemented by administering questionnaires on a representative sample of 227 enterprises. The study comes up to valuable conclusions for the firms and the city through the use of exploratory factor analysis, reliability analysis and clustering. Findings - – The present research brings on important issues and questions about local economic development because it presents directly the estimations and views of a large number of local enterprises that reflect the image of local economy. Finally, this research gives a satisfactory overview of the inner growth of Thessaloniki and further the results could lead to an evaluation, planning, implementation, rejection or reconstruction of specific actions and policies locally. Research limitations/implications - – The analysis is constrained by weakness since the sample of enterprises is rather small and the results concern only the enterprises located in Thessaloniki. Based on this fact, general conclusions can be drawed for other regions as well as for the whole Greece. This is subjected to more analysis. Practical implications - – The added value of this research is essential since there are only few similar researches in South-East Europe and in Greece. Especially, the relationship between local development policies and firms’ development competitiveness has not been studied enough in the area under consideration. Social implications - – Enterprises understand and designate the importance of specific policies that affect their development while at the same time through their evaluations they outline the character and dynamics of these policies in a unique dynamic, geographical and productive city like this of Thessaloniki. Originality/value - – The analysis showed that enterprises recognize as positive factor the effort of the local authorities to set the area as a business pole in favour of enterprises and the broader area but policy problems of organization and planning arise that concern mainly the operation and support of local enterprises and specific those from the tourist and service sector. This image raises issues of competence on planning and organization of development polices by the local authorities focusing on specific productive sectors so as the effect of these policies to be effective with positive results for enterprises.
R50|Electoral Cycles in Public Expenditures: Evidence from Czech Local Governments|The paper analyzes local political cycle in Czech municipalities over the period between 1997 and 2013. We apply the system and the difference GMM estimators to detect electoral manipulation in current and capital expenditures in electoral and pre-electoral years. Primarily, we estimate the effects for expenditure levels but to check the robustness we re-estimate the model for spending shares. We have found that the size of municipalities matters, and unsurprisingly, small municipalities do not increase spending in such an extent as bigger municipalities, though big municipalities tend to have lower share of capital spending before elections. Leftist governments tend to attract votes by increasing current expenditures, while rightist governments increase rather capital expenditures. On the one hand, the share of votes of the mayor's party in previous elections increases pre-election capital spending, on the other hand, its winning margin works in the opposite direction. Finally, the more terms a mayor has been in office, the lower is capital spending in pre-electoral year.
R50|One or Two Tiers of Local Government? â€“ The Cost Effects of a Regional Experiment| This paper evaluates the cost effects of a Finnish regional self-government experiment. The experiment introduced a new intermediate tier of local administration that was given the responsibility to organize 60 per cent of public services. These services include e.g. basic health care, the majority of social services and secondary education, services that are typically provided by municipalities in Finland. Follow-up reports suggest that the experiment has resulted in massive cost-saving, especially in the social and health sectors. This paper puts previous findings under scrutiny by utilizing a synthetic control method for comparative case studies. Our findings cast serious doubts on the magnitude of the cost savings.
R50|Which Way to Recovery? Housing Market Outcomes and the Neighborhood Stabilization Program|To help communities recover from the foreclosure crisis, Congress enacted a set of policies known as the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP). NSP's objective was to mitigate the impact of foreclosures on neighboring properties, through reducing the stock of distressed properties and removing sources of visual blight. This paper presents evidence on production outcomes achieved through the second round of NSP funding (NSP2), and discusses the housing market context under which the program operated from 2010 to 2013. Two key findings emerge. First, local grantees undertook quite different approaches to NSP2. The type and scale of activity, expenditures per property and spatial concentration vary widely across grantees. Second, census tracts that received NSP2 investment had poor economic and housing market conditions prior to the program, but generally saw improved housing markets during the program's implementation period, as did non-NSP2 tracts in the same counties. Based on these findings, we outline topics and suggested approaches for additional research.
R50|Identification of regions with less developed research and innovation systems|The aim of this working paper is to contribute to the debate on how to identify regions with less developed research and innovation systems. We look at both conceptual and empirical approaches that figure prominently in scholarly work on regional innovation systems. Based on a critical review and discussion of the literature we shed light on a large number and variety of barriers and weaknesses that may hamper regional innovation and industrial change. It is shown in this paper that the regional innovation system concept can essentially inform the current debate on the design and implementation of smart specialisation strategies. It offers rich insights into various dimensions of regional innovation systems that may be weakly developed and allows for the development of typologies that capture the heterogeneity of these systems. We also demonstrate that empirical approaches to identify regions with less-developed research and innovation systems fall short of taking account of the conceptual advances made in the recent past.
R50|The Challenge of Combinatorial Knowledge Dynamics to Study of Institutions, Towards an Actor-centric Bottom-up View of Institutions|This paper argues that obstruction of agency, intention and interest is a weakness in institutional studies in geography. There is a need to systematically anchor a role for agency in institutionally oriented combinatorial knowledge dynamics studies, and thus to reach beyond snapshots of top-down institutions, and to produce a more nuanced view on institutions bottom up. Without in-depth studies on how actors perceive institutions, reflect upon them and either comply with them or aim to push for institutional change, it may impossible to fully understand the true impact of them. The aim here is to construct a link between agency and institutions in the context of combinatorial knowledge dynamics. To elaborate the conceptual link between institutions and combinatorial knowledge dynamics, this paper discusses three intertwined theoretical lenses. First, a conceptual distinction between cumulative and combinatorial knowledge dynamics is introduced; second, the basic tenets of institutions in regional economic development are discussed; and, third, a conceptual framework to study institutions in the context of combinatorial knowledge dynamics is constructed. The main scientific motivation here is to open a bottom-up view on institutions by linking them to the combinatorial knowledge dynamics approach by using agency as an intermediating framework.
R50|Cluster policy: Renewal through the integration of institutional variety|The literature on cluster evolution suggests that heterogeneity of firm capabilities and openness of network structures are essential for the renewal of mature and declining clusters. This chapter argues that the regional and institutional context in which clusters are embedded plays an important role for the renewal of clusters. It elaborates how the integration of institutional variety can stimulate the combination of different types of knowledge, learning and modes of innovation, thereby promoting cluster renewal. The conceptual argument is illustrated with a case study of the maritime cluster in MÃ¸re og Romsdal, Norway, which is one of the globally leading clusters in this industry. We find that key actors and policy play an important role in integrating institutional variety. Additionally, the case shows that institutional variety and the integration thereof can be a driving force for cluster renewal even in specialized and semi-peripheral locations.
R50|Understanding Cluster Evolution|The past few years have seen an increasing popularity of cluster life cycle approaches. These models, however, suggest a rather deterministic view, are indifferent with respect to context and suffer from biological connotations. This chapter intends to go beyond the cluster life cycle models. We review the literature on industrial districts, innovative milieu and regional innovation systems and investigate how these alternative approaches contribute to the development of a more context-sensitive approach to cluster change. We argue that future research may benefit from developing theoretically relevant categorizations of different cluster types and from carrying out comparative empirical studies.
R50|Le economiste in Italia negli anni ‘50: Il caso di Vera Cao Pinna|Si propone l’analisi del contributo delle economiste italiane alla professione da una prospettiva storica andando ad analizzare la produzione scientifica delle donne in dodici riviste di settore negli anni ’50. Ci si sofferma poi su una figura femminile di rilievo in quegli anni in Italia, quasi del tutto dimenticata: Vera Cao Pinna. Cao Pinna ha dato un forte contributo alla ricerca economica quantitativa quale supporto alla politica economica nel processo di ricostruzione in Italia. Per prima utilizzò modelli econometrici formalizzati, al fine di rappresentare i fattori che influiscono sulle variabili economiche per fare previsioni, o meglio affinò e adattò alla realtà sia italiana che europea il modello basato sulle relazioni tra i settori di attività economica ricavabili attraverso una tavola a doppia entrata input-output. Attraverso le testimonianze di ex allievi, colleghi, collaboratori insieme alla consultazione di archivi storici, è stato possibile tracciare il profilo dell’attività di ricerca svolta e dei contributi resi portando ad una amara riflessione sul contributo storico delle donne economiste che rischia di andare perso.
R50|Debt Repayment Capacity Of Local Government Sector In Poland During The 2008-2013 Economic Slowdown Period|The crisis, which began in 2008, had a negative impact on the financial condition of local governments across the European Union. In Poland, the debt of the local government sector increased from 2.3% of GDP in 2008 to 4.2% of GDP in 2013. The growing indebtedness influenced the scope of countercyclical policies of local governments. At present, such policies appear as hardly sustainable in the context of future debt repayments and the required deleveraging process. The paper shows simulations concerning the ability of local governments to service their accumulated debt. In a moderately optimistic scenario when there is no new borrowing, over 25% of local governments will need more than 15 years to repay their existing debts. Although in 2013 the financial indicators showed sufficient space for debt servicing for 95% of local governments, the sector remains highly vulnerable to future adverse scenarios. The use of random sampling computational algorithms (Monte Carlo method) applied to the local government financial ratios based on free operating cash flow and net debt confirms the sectorâ€™s negative credit risk exposure. Even modestly adverse scenarios show that ca. 20 percent of local governments will reach alarmingly low levels of their debt service indicators in the near future. The larger municipalities appear to be the local government subcategory with the highest credit risk exposure.
R50|La qualite de la vie urbaine. Les indicateurs de la qualite environnementale urbaine|L'urbanisation est un processus qui vise, généralement, la croissance de la qualité de vie en créant un environnement ou l'acces aux équipements de qualité supérieure économique et social est facile. L'espace urbain a conduit a l'évolution du mode de vie, mais sa qualité est une question qui mérite l'attention, en raison de son déclin dans les grandes agglomérations. La qualité de vie est un élément fondateur des préoccupations a la fois politiques et sociétales et fait partie des enjeux urbains actuels. L'exigence de qualité devient la tâche du processus « Benchmarking », en intégrant la meilleure pratique par le quel peut etre mesurée et la compétitivité urbaine. Dans ce travail, les indicateurs urbains sont étudiés dans le contexte du rapport Observatoire Urbain, réalisée en 2010, par IRES, qui est une approche de recherche qui vise a déterminer et mesurer les indicateurs de qualité de vie dans les grandes villes, en Roumanie. L'étude se concentre sur les dimensions clés, pour déterminer la perception des citoyens urbains sur un ensemble fondamental d'indicateurs de la qualité de vie. Les informations obtenues au moyen d'entrevues, la méthode CATI, permettent la description de l'état actuel de la communauté urbaine selon les indicateurs de la qualité de vie sélectionnés pour construire une gestion efficace de l'administration locale. Le but des données obtenues se traduit par une bonne gouvernance communautaire, aux fins de son développement et de co-participation des citoyens a la vie communautaire.

R50|Entrepreneurial networking capacity of cluster firms: a social network perspective on how shared resources enhance firm performance|This paper examines the entrepreneurial networking capacity of firms in leveraging shared resources in clusters to achieve market performance. Defining industrial clusters from a social network perspective and entrepreneurial networking capacity as the capacity of firms in orchestrating relational-based resources to achieve enhanced performance and build competitive advantage, this paper analysed the influences of regional shared resources derived from entrepreneurial networking capacity on firm market performance. This paper used the primary data collected from the 65 wine regions (GIs) in Australia and tested the proposed hypotheses using structural equation modeling. The results show the unique roles of different types of cluster shared resources in enhancing firm market performance. We contribute to further development of the social network theory, the resource-based view, entrepreneurship and cluster theory and provide grounds for closer examination of how the context of industrial clusters influences the resource-based competitive advantage of firms.

R50|Regional development and capital structure of SMEs| [EN] This article studies the influence of regional institutional environment, measured as regional development, on capital structure of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Furthermore, the standard firm-factor determinants and the business sector of the firm are also incorporated. To this end, a sample of 6,560 Spanish firms for 2007 is analysed, where all regions of Spain and all sectors, except the financial sector, are considered. Spain provides a suitable and unexplored laboratory for the analysis of regional differences in the financial structure of SMEs, since, on the one hand, SMEs constitute the most relevant firms in this country, and on the other hand, Spain shows regional disparities at various levels. Moreover, the empirical analysis uses Partial Least Squares (PLS), a variance-based structural equation modelling (SEM). In this respect, PLS has several clear advantages to multiple linear regression (MLR). Thanks to this study, how each of these factors explains the variation in the capital structure could be shown. Moreover, the results show that although firm factors and the business sector explain a large proportion of the variance of capital structure of SMEs, it is important to take into account the regional institutional environment to better ascertain the level of debt of SMEs in a single country.
R50|Climate change related risks, opportunities and adaptation actions in European cities – Insights from responses to the CDP cities program|Cities, home to more than half of the world’s population and important economic hubs, are vulnerable to climate change and worthy to protect. To address these challenges, implementing adaptation measures is inevitable. The paper provides insights into climate change related risks, opportunities and adaptation actions based on responses by 40 European cities to the 2014 CDP Cities Information Request. The analysis shows that 92.5% of the responding European cities report that they face physical risks arising from climate change and that they identify more intense rainfall as the most relevant physical risk. Furthermore, more than half of the participants indicate that they are facing social risks due to climate change with increased risk to already vulnerable populations being the most important one. However, 72.5% of the cities report that they see economic opportunities arising from climate change. Already, 55% of the observed European cities indicate that they have implemented adaptation action plans and 82.5% of all cities are putting adaptation action into practice. City governments show great awareness, interest and knowledge in addressing climate change issues, yet there is still demand for information and guidance. Moreover, the variety of answers shows that there is no “one-size fits all solution” for cities to adapt to climate change. Thus, the findings can also serve as an innovative starting point for further research as well as the practical implementation of adaptation measures.
R50|Developing an Inventory and Typology of Land-Use Planning Systems and Policy Instruments in OECD Countries|This report provides an overview of spatial and land-use planning systems in OECD countries1 focusing on: (i) the governance systems across countries, (ii) the institutional and legal frameworks for spatial planning, and (iii) the various policy instruments used at different levels of territorial governance to articulate spatial development objectives, manage physical development and protect the environment. The report draws on available academic literature and policy documents. The analysis shows a strong relationship between governance models and authority and competences for spatial planning. Spatial plans at various spatial scales are used to create the preconditions for harmonising socio-economic development goals with environmental protection imperatives. Environmental assessment constitutes another key regulatory instrument. National plans, programmes, regional development and land-use plans as well as sector plans and policies are subjected to Strategic Environmental Assessment. Individual projects resulting from these policy instruments are subjected to Environmental Impact Assessment in most countries. In all countries, environmentally-related permits work together with environmental assessments to ensure that environmental considerations are taken into account in the siting of industrial installations and mega-infrastructure projects that would have significant impacts on the environment. The main challenges associated with environmental assessment in most countries include the political nature of the assessment process, the cost (time and money) of assessment particularly to businesses, limited consultation periods, limited technical capacity of institutions, the endeavour for independence and quality of the assessment and the absence of robust legislative frameworks. Ce rapport propose un tour d’horizon des systèmes d’aménagement de l’espace et d’urbanisme dans les pays de l’OCDE2, qui met l’accent sur : (i) les systèmes de gouvernance des différents pays, (ii) les cadres institutionnels et juridiques de l’aménagement de l’espace, et (iii) les divers instruments employés aux différents échelons de gouvernance territoriale pour définir les objectifs de développement territorial, gérer le milieu physique et protéger l’environnement. Le rapport fait fond sur les travaux universitaires publiés et les documents d’orientation disponibles. L’analyse montre un lien étroit entre les modèles de gouvernance et l’autorité et les compétences en matière d’aménagement de l’espace. Les plans d’aménagement sont appliqués aux niveaux national et infranational pour intégrer les considérations sociales, économiques et environnementales dans les décisions d’allocation des ressources foncières et de répartition des activités. L’évaluation environnementale constitue un autre instrument réglementaire essentiel. Les plans et programmes nationaux, les plans régionaux d’aménagement et d’urbanisme ainsi que les politiques et plans sectoriels sont soumis à une évaluation environnementale stratégique. Les différents projets qui résultent de ces instruments font quant à eux l’objet d’une étude d’impact sur l’environnement dans la plupart des pays. Tous les pays ont couplé les autorisations liées à l’environnement à des évaluations environnementales, afin de faire en sorte que les considérations d’environnement entrent en ligne de compte dans le choix du site d’implantation des installations industrielles et des grandes infrastructures susceptibles d’avoir des incidences significatives sur l’environnement. Dans la plupart des pays, les difficultés que soulève l’évaluation environnementale tiennent surtout à la nature politique du processus d’évaluation, aux coûts qu’il induit (en temps et en argent), notamment pour les entreprises, à la brièveté des périodes de consultation, aux capacités techniques limitées des institutions et à l’absence de cadres législatifs solides.
R50|Municipal fragmentation and economic performance in OECD TL2 regions|The present work looks at the relationship between institutional structure and economic performance at the regional level. The work focuses on one particular aspect, the number of municipalities in a given region (municipal fragmentation) and the impact on regional development measured as GDP per capita growth. The impact of municipal fragmentation on regional development is not clear a priori. The theory of fiscal decentralisation maintains that institutions closer to citizens can better deal with their needs, thus providing services and public goods in a more efficient way. This closeness, however, implies the presence of many local governments (e.g., municipalities), which may create problems in terms of policy spillovers and (dis)economies of scale. The present work tests the impact of municipal fragmentation on a sample of OECD TL2 regions, in the period 1996-2011. The analysis shows that the impact of fragmentation on regional performance depends on regional territorial characteristics. In particular, the negative impact of fragmentation increases with the share of regional population living in urban areas. In fact, for ?rural? regions the effect is small or even positive where a high share of the population lives in rural areas. This is because the costs and benefits of decentralisation have a different impact in urban and rural regions. In urban regions, the benefit of internalising policy spillovers (and reducing transaction costs) is higher than the loss of proximity, because population is geographically concentrated and commutes more than population in rural areas, where policy spillovers are smaller and the costs associated with the loss of proximity higher. The implications for countries? economic policies are threefold. Firstly, countries should not consider the degree of administrative fragmentation per se, it is important to weight it for the rural index at the regional level. For instance, when considering France as a whole the level of municipal fragmentation is the second highest among OECD countries, but most of this fragmentation stems from rural regions. Secondly, the analysis implicitly recognises the importance of dealing with governance gaps in urban regions; for instance, the lack of co-operation in transport policies is especially detrimental for the performance of metropolitan areas. Thirdly, the overall effect of a reduction of municipal fragmentation would depend on the types of regions within each country. To sum-up, the present work shows the importance of territorial characteristics for administrative performance, thus advocating for a place-based approach to institutional reforms.

R50|Financing the endogenous development at regional and county levels. Particularities, trends and challenges|The paper focuses on the complex dialectics between endogenous and exogenous components of local and territorial economic development, emphasizing the idea of the particular consistency of internal growth factors and the importance, in this context, of financial means for activating the endogenous potential in the case of Romania. The county was considered as statistical observation unit for the period of analysis 2007-2013 and the data were disaggregated on bank loans, FDI, research and development expenditures, European structural and cohesion funds, local budgets expenditures. It was found that the more developed counties have better chances to achieve higher performances of endogenous development. The study highlighted the need of a policy mix that would support the development of counties with a relatively low development level, actually most of them, under the circumstances of a polycentric regional development. An optimal combination between top-down and bottom-up interventions may prove to be the most successful, offering an effective compatibility of decentralization with the coordination and monitoring requirements, supporting the smart specialization at county level, not excluding spillover effects at community and national levels.

Η εφαρμογή των μεταρρυθμίσεων του «Καποδίστρια» και του «Καλλικράτη», δημιούργησε νέες συνθήκες τυπικής και άτυπης συνεργασίας μεταξύ τοπικών δρώντων. Η μεταβίβαση αρμοδιοτήτων από την κεντρική κυβέρνηση προς την τοπική και την περιφερειακή αυτοδιοίκηση, καθώς και οι συγχωνεύσεις δήμων και κοινοτήτων, δημιούργησαν ένα νέο θεσμικό πλαίσιο.

R50|Decentralization, Growth And Optimal Government Size In The Italian Regional Framework|The aim of this study is to empirically assess the existence of the BARS curve (Barro, Armey, Rahn, and Scully), as well as the relationship between public expenditure and decentralization, for Italian regions in the 1997-2009 period. Using panel data methodologies, we inspect the nexus between Regional government size (measured by the share of public expenditure on GDP) and the economic growth rate. The main results are twofold. First, when the degree of decentralization is reasonably low (below the 31% of expenditure decentralization), a BARS curve has been successfully discovered, and the optimal government size remains almost constant, assuming a value close to the 52%. The second one concerns the fact that, even though the optimal government size is almost constant, decentralization has a positive effect on economic activity. Finally, decentralization attenuates the negative impact of sub-optimal expenditure policy on growth process. Therefore, our results suggest that decentralization exerts a positive impact on public sector efficiency, contributing to stimulate the income growth.

R50|The Impact of Economic Freedom on the Unemployment Rate in O.E.C.D. Nations: An Exploratory Study Accepting the Validity of Okun’s Law - L’impatto della libertà economica sul tasso di disoccupazione nei paesi Ocse: uno studio esplorativo sulla base dell’accettazione della legge di Okun|This exploratory study empirically investigates the hypothesis that the higher the degree of economic freedom in a nation, the lower the unemployment rate in that nation, ceteris paribus. This hypothesis is based on the idea that greater economic freedom leads to greater real GDP growth, which in turn reduces the unemployment rate. As such, it represents a de facto acceptance (in principle) of Okun’s Law. The framework studied consists of a dataset for the member nations of the OECD (except Iceland) during the period 2003 to 2007, which precedes the Great Recession. The model in this exploratory study, which integrates a measure of the tax burden, a long term interest rate, and a measure of political stability, along with a measure of overall economic freedom, provides estimations finding that the unemployment rate is a decreasing function of the overall average level of economic freedom. Robustness testing, which involves narrowing the definition of the economic freedom measure and introducing a variable reflecting regulatory quality, leads to same conclusion, namely, that greater economic freedom reduces the unemployment rate. - Questo studio presenta una verifica empirica sull’ipotesi secondo cui, a parità di condizioni, maggiore è il livello di libertà economica in un paese, minore sarà il tasso di disoccupazione. Tale ipotesi si basa sull’idea che una maggiore libertà economica porti ad una maggior crescita del PIL reale, che a sua volta riduce il tasso di disoccupazione. Ciò rappresenta l’accettazione de facto della legge di Okun. Il modello si basa su un dataset per i paesi Ocse (esclusa l’Islanda) durante il periodo 2003-2007, cioè prima della grande crisi. Questo modello, che si basa su un indice di pressione fiscale, sul tasso di interesse a lungo termine e su un indicatore di stabilità politica, insieme a un indice della apertura economica generale, fornisce stime che evidenziano che il tasso di disoccupazione è una funzione decrescente del livello generale medio della libertà economica. I test di robustezza, che includono una definizione più ristretta di libertà economica e l’introduzione di una variabile che riflette la qualità dei controlli, porta alla stessa conclusione: una maggiore libertà economica riduce la disoccupazione.

R50|Entrepreneurship and economic development in cities|Policy makers have identified the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development. Yet, little is known about how this relationship varies over time in cities with different market sizes. This study examines the link between entrepreneurship and economic development using a panel of 127 European cities between 1994 and 2009. We found that the immediate economic development impact of new firm start-ups is positive for both small-/medium-size cities and large cities. The relationship is U-shaped for large cities, with the indirect effect taking 7 years, but the indirect effect does not occur in small-/medium-size cities. We offer useful information for policy makers, practitioners, and scholars. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
R50|Local quality of government and voting with one’s feet|In this paper, we investigate the impact of local quality of government on regional attractiveness to migrants inferred from individual revealed preferences and net migration. The analysis is based on panel data estimations of 254 European regions for the period between 1995 and 2009. Different instrumental variable techniques have been employed in order to assess the extent to which differences in local government quality affect preference rankings for different locations and to account for potential endogeneity concerns. The results point towards an important influence of specific factors related to the regional quality of government, such as the fight against corruption or government effectiveness, on the ability of European regions to position themselves as attractive places for future residents.

R50|The institutional and economic foundations of regional proto-federations|In the present paper we analyse the ancient Greek regional proto-federations of free-democratic city-states. We examine their political institutions and policies like common defence, representative federal bodies such as popular assemblies, parliament, state and regional organization, federal finance ministers as well as their economic institutions: common currency, federal budget and federal revenues. We address in more detail the case of the Aetolian League, or Federation, comparing it with some of today’s federal states and the European Union and conclude that in some respects, the proto-federation was more advanced than the EU, and thus can serve as a benchmark in addressing current European integration issues.

R50|Perspectives on Cluster Evolution: Critical Review and Future Research Issues|" The past two decades have witnessed an ever-growing scholarly interest in regional clusters. The focus of research has mainly been on exploring why clusters exist and what characteristics ""functioning"" clusters possess. Although the interest in more dynamic views on clusters is not new, in recent years, however, greater attention has been paid to providing better explanations of how clusters change and develop over time, giving rise to an increasing popularity of the cluster life-cycle approach. This paper discusses the key ideas and arguments put forward by the main protagonists of this approach and identifies several missing elements, such as indifference to place-specific factors, neglect of multi-scalar impacts and underappreciation of the role of human agency. Based on this critical assessment, a number of suggestions for future research are made. We argue that there is a need to study the influence of the wider regional environment on cluster evolution and to explore how cluster development paths are influenced by a multiplicity of factors and processes at various spatial scales. Finally, it is claimed that future research should pay more attention to the role of human agents and the ways they shape the long-term development of regional clusters. We outline how future studies can tackle these issues."
R50|How does fiscal decentralization affect within-regional disparities in well-being? Evidence from health inequalities in Italy|This paper aims at investigating empirically the impact of fiscal decentralization reforms on inequality in well-being. In particular, we look at the effects on health inequalities following the assignment of larger tax power to the Italian Regions for financing their health expenditure, starting from the end of the Nineties. Exploiting large differences in the size of the tax base across Regions, we find that fiscal decentralization processes that attribute a greater tax power to lower government tiers, besides reducing inefficiencies of healthcare policies, seem to be effective in reducing also within-regional disparities in health outcomes. However, thedegree of economic development â€“ on which depends the actual fiscal autonomy from Central government â€“ significantly affects the effectiveness of these reforms and highlights the importance to take properly into account the specific features of the context where the decentralization of power is implemented.
R50|Substituting Existing Federal/State/Local control and managed Homeland Security Services with Regional Governance: A Public Choice Approach|This paper suggests how to improve both the governing, and managing of natural and terrorist caused disasters, including ordinary homeland security services, by a regional competitive structure. It presents disaster experiences of failed such services, analyzes the reasons for such failures and suggests how a competitive system that relies on private and volunteer leaders, personnel and capital can improve response and recovery efforts over the existing monopolistic government system. Public Choice model is utilized to explain the reasons for failed experiences and how regional governance is socially more efficient than existing Federal and state control and locally managed disaster system. The paper suggests that the federal role changes from both funding and supplying aid to disasters to merely funding for damaged public goods. Regionally available businesses and government resources can be utilized under a competitive system instead of federal and state inventories and emergency personnel. A regionally controlled and managed entity which which develops its own financial resources is a major key for success.
R50|The regional effects of macroeconomic shocks in China|The extent and persistence of the inequality of regional output is an important policy issue in China and its sources have been the subject of considerable empirical research. Yet we have relatively little empirical knowledge of the effects on the regional distribution of output of shocks to national macroeconomic variables such as GDP and investment. This is an important gap in the empirical literature since much government macroeconomic policy seeks to influence GDP using instruments such as investment expenditure. It is likely that such national shocks will have differential regional impacts and so affect the regional output distribution. Policy-makers need to know the sign, size and timing of such effects before making policy decisions at the national level. We simulate the effects of aggregate shocks on individual provinces' GDP within the framework of a vector autoregressive (VAR) model restricted in a manner following Lastrapes (Economics Letters, 2005). We use annual data from 1980 to 2012 to estimate the model which includes 28 of China's provinces and simulate the effects on provincial outputs of shocks to aggregate output and investment. We find great diversity of effects across the provinces with discernible geographic patterns. There is evidence that output shocks benefit coastal provinces with developed industrial structure, export-exposure and less reliance on SOEs; the opposite is found for the effects of an investment shock and we conjecture that this is likely to have been the result of the strong bias in central government investment policy in favour of the interior provinces during a substantial part of our sample period.
R50|Institutional context for local economic development in Mexico, 1990-2015. A need for change?|People?s quality of life in specific places is affected by their territories? characteristics and local agents? actions and interactions, as well as their responses to external influences. Formal and informal institutions contribute to shape those actions, interactions and responses. Following North (1990) and Storper (1995), the economic performance of places is influenced by their particular institutional setting; and, therefore, by the way a particular society is organised. Hence, the political and social dimensions acquire special importance. Relating those ideas to the bottom-up approach towards development, and its positive effect on the development of Mexican municipalities found by Rodriguez-Pose and Palavicini-Corona (2013), it is relevant and interesting to analyse if, in the Mexican context, formal and informal institutions have facilitated or not economic development at the local level. As the basis of the development from below approach stems from its proximity to local characteristics and agents, the lowest level of government jurisdiction is the focus of analysis. Two municipalities located in a Mexican state with a long presence of institutions and resulting mechanisms closer to citizens were selected in order to further assess the role of institutions. The hypothesis tested is that the general formal institutional context in Mexico has a relevant propitious role in LED. In relation to the case studies, the hypothesis is that a more favourable effect in one of the studied municipalities than the other is due to differences in the functioning of their formal institutions and the particularities of their informal ones. It was found that the national and sub-national formal institutional setting has allowed and, at some degree, stimulated municipalities to plan and execute local economic development actions during the period of analysis (1990-2015). However, abiding to the law and enforcing it are the main aspects to be addressed in this Latin American country. As far as the case studies are concerned, significant differences in their informal institutions affected the presence of the LED approach and their development performance from 1990 to 2010. Finally, in light of the concrete findings, I present a set of proposals to both introduce some adjustments to the legal framework and make the best of current formal and informal institutions prevailing in Mexico, in general, and the studied municipalities, in particular.
R50|Municipal Fragmentation and Economic Performance of OECD TL2 Regions|The present work investigates the relationship between municipal fragmentation and regional per capita GDP growth rate, using a panel of OECD TL2 regions in the period 1996-2011. According to the fiscal decentralisation literature, fragmentation should enhance growth as local government closer to citizens can implement policies that better match their needs, thus providing services and public goods in a more efficient way. The presence of many local governments, however, may create problems in terms of overlapping functions, (dis)economies of scale, and policy fragmentation. The results of the empirical analysis show that municipal fragmentation has a negative impact on per capita GDP growth, thus supporting the view that costs prevail on benefits. The introduction of regional territorial characteristic – namely, the share of population living in rural areas – provides a different picture, however. The negative impact of fragmentation decreases with the share of population living in rural areas. Indeed, in extremely “rural” regions the effect turns mildly positive. This is because the costs and benefits of fragmentation have a different weight in urban and rural regions. The key insight is the different distribution of the population over the territory: more concentrated in urban than in rural regions. This implies that, for a given level of municipal fragmentation overlapping of function is more severe in urban regions (where people are likely to commute over municipal boundaries) than in rural area. In the same vein, for the same level of municipal fragmentation access to the local government is more difficult in rural areas (where people is sparsely located within municipal boundaries) than in urban areas. The policy implications of the analysis are twofold. Firstly, reducing municipal fragmentation may have a heterogeneous impact within the country, thus raising concern for one-size-fits-all policies of municipal agglomeration in favour of a place-based approach to institutional reform. For instance, the principle guiding municipal amalgamation should not be the average municipal size at the country level, but it should be weighted for the rural/urban characteristics of each region. Secondly, the analysis suggests that processes of agglomeration of people should be accompanied by a consistent amalgamation of the local administration, otherwise representing an obstacle to the full realisation of agglomeration economies.
R50|Electoral Cycles in Public Expenditures: Evidence from Czech Local Governments|This paper analyzes local political cycle in Czech municipalities over the period between 1997 and 2013. We apply the system GMM and the difference GMM estimators to identify distortion in current and capital expenditures per capita in electoral and pre-electoral years, while focusing on various spending groups (infrastructure, leisure, housing, education, etc.). We also test specific effects of local governments' characteristics (partisanship, strength, experience). In general, municipalities increase capital spending (primarily on infrastructure, housing, leisure activities) and decrease current spending (administration) before elections. Rightist governments target leisure activities and save more on administration, whereas leftist governments target current spending on social services. Stronger governments and those with newly elected mayors have lower incentive to create an electoral cycle. Voters' involvement in local policies and also success of ruling local (and parliamentary) parties in nat ional parliamentary elections diminish local electoral cycles.
R50|How does fiscal decentralization affect within-regional disparities in well-being? Evidence from health inequalities in Italy|This paper aims at investigating empirically the impact of fiscal decentralization reforms on inequality in well-being. In particular, we look at the effects on health inequalities following the assignment of larger tax power to the Italian Regions for financing their health expenditure, starting from the end of the Nineties. Exploiting large differences in the size of the tax base across Regions, we find that fiscal decentralization processes that attribute a greater tax power to lower government tiers, besides reducing inefficiencies of healthcare policies, seem to be effective in reducing also within-regional disparities in health outcomes. However, the degree of economic development � on which depends the actual fiscal autonomy from Central government � significantly affects the effectiveness of these reforms and highlights the importance to take properly into account the specific features of the context where the decentralization of power is implemented.
R50|Activismo local y parsimonia regional frente a la despoblación en Aragón: una explicación desde la economía política|In Aragón, regional policies against depopulation are very meticulous but hardly been implemented. Conversely, the most urgent repopulation strategies have been performed from local governments. The explanation for this difference lies in the ex-ante stage design, analyzed mainly according to market failures and non-market failures inherent to depopulation, which are not attributed to the appropriate level of government. Depopulation is essentially a local phenomenon, it becomes a public good whose scale has to fit political action and provide community leadership to reduce the failures inherent to its design rule. Political Economy is, therefore, essential to interpreting their effectiveness
R50|What determines entepreneurial failure: taking advantage of the institutional context|Most management literature has been devoted to explaining business success. However, empirical evidence shows that one of the main problems of new ventures is precisely failure. A simple Google search for “business success” provides 986 million results, while “business failure” finds approximately ten times fewer. The same is found in the academic literature, which has been less interested in explaining the determinants of entrepreneurial failure. In this paper, we contribute to the entrepreneurship literature by offering new theoretical insights into and empirical evidence on the determinants of entrepreneurial failure. Our results confirm that both the quality of formal institutions and high-impact entrepreneurship reduce failure and, more importantly, that these two variables reinforce each other. As a consequence, a greater development of formal institutions strengthens the negative relationship between high-impact entrepreneurship and failure.
R50|Anbieter von günstigem Wohnraum - eine Analyse für zehn Großstädte in NRW. In Kooperation mit der LEG Immobilien AG|Die Frage nach bezahlbarem Wohnraum ist derzeit omnipräsent in der Politik. Insbesondere wird dabei gefragt, wie die Mietendynamik reduziert und durch Transfers und Subvention die Wohnkosten gesenkt werden können. Bislang kaum adressiert wurde jedoch die Frage, welche Anbietergruppen günstigen Wohnraum anbieten. Aufbauend auf einer Auswertung von 300.000 Angebotsinseraten für die zehn größten Städte in Nordrhein-Westfalen zeigt diese Untersuchung, dass vor allem große Wohnungsunternehmen günstige Wohnungen anbieten. Neben Genossenschaften und kommunalen Wohnungsgesellschaften sind dies vor allem große private Wohnungsunternehmen. Diese privaten Wohnungsunternehmen stellen teilweise ein deutliches größeres Wohnungsangebot zur Verfügung als Genossenschaften oder öffentliche Anbieter. Die Preisunterschiede zwischen den Gruppen zeigen sich nicht nur bei den Durchschnittsmieten, sondern auch im Rahmen einer ökonometrischen Analyse. Bei gleichen Lagen und Wohnungsqualitäten liegen die Mieten der Genossenschaften 16 Prozent und die der kommunalen Wohnungsgesellschaften 5,7 Prozent unter dem Mietenniveau der anderen Wohnungsunternehmen und der anderen privaten Vermieter (Kleinvermieter). Große Wohnungsunternehmen ordnen sich mit einem Wert von 6,5 Prozent zwischen den Genossenschaften und den kommunalen Wohnungsgesellschaften ein. Ursächlich für die Mietpreisvorteile sind vor allem Größenvorteile. Diese Kostenvorteile erlauben es den Unternehmen günstigere Mieten anzubieten. Die Ergebnisse der Studie legen nahe, dass die Politik zur Sicherstellung bezahlbaren Wohnraums nicht nur auf kommunale Gesellschaften setzen sollte, sondern auch große private Wohnungsunternehmen berücksichtigen sollte.
R50|Function Follows Form|Ever since Victor Gruen opened Northland in a Detroit suburb, thousands of shopping centers and office parks have sprung up along city peripheries. While automobile travel is necessary for this transition from the monocentric to the polycentric city, car travel alone, so this paper argues, is not sufficient. Instead, the decentralization of shops and jobs (two important “urban functions”) hinges on the initial spatial distribution of the urban electorate, as embodied by the original city’s shape (“urban form”). The electorate is more likely to tilt in favor of decentralization the less skewed is original city shape. Hence “function follows form”. Given that “form follows function” eventually, too, cities either remain centralized and skewed in the long run, or shed all three: central jobs, central shops, and skew. We turn to a sample of U.S. metropolitan areas to illustrate these ideas.
R50|Tendencias y coyunturas agrarias del Litoral rioplatense, 1760-1800: un análisis cuantitativo|Este trabajo presenta una estimación del producto agrario por habitante en la segunda mitad del siglo XVIII para la región que se ha denominado «Litoral rioplatense atlántico». Con base en fuentes primarias y secundarias, el texto hace una reconstrucción del producto agrario total y por habitante que resulta de considerar los 2 componentes principales de la producción agraria regional: la producción de alimentos para el mercado interno y la producción de cueros para exportación. Los resultados muestran que el producto agrario se triplicó sobradamente entre 1760-1800, impulsado en primer lugar por un importante crecimiento demográfico acompañado de una expansión de la frontera agraria, y en segundo lugar por el desarrollo que experimentó la producción de cueros para el comercio atlántico. Finalmente, se muestra que la trayectoria del producto agrario de Buenos Aires y Montevideo presentó heterogeneidades territoriales, temporales y entre segmentos de la producción agraria.

R50|Elections and de facto Expenditure Decentralization in Canada|This paper empirically investigates the underlying determinants of expenditure decentralization, based on the predictions of a new political economy model of partial decentralization. The analysis is based on an agency model, in which two levels of government are involved in the provision of a public good and voters are imperfectly informed about each government's contribution to the good, creating a shared accountability problem. Under shared expenditure responsibility, the degree of decentralization is endogenous and depends on the relative political conditions prevailing at each level of government. Consistent with the model's predictions, empirical results from a panel of Canadian provinces show that decentralization in a province increases with the electoral strength of the provincial government and decreases with the electoral strength of the federal government, in addition to being affected significantly by the partisan affiliation of both levels of government. A series of alternative empirical specifications, including an IV regression exploiting campaign spending data, are presented to assess the robustness of these results.
R50|LOST in America: Evidence on local sales taxes from national panel data|This paper studies comprehensive national panel data of local option sales taxes at the monthly frequency. I calculate state-by-month population weighted averages and standard deviations of local sales tax rates. I document ten stylized facts concerning the time series patterns and spatial dynamics of local sales tax rates. The paper then proposes a “tax system” approach to tax competition where states compete on a variety of margins – including restrictions on localities' tax setting authority – that are often ignored by the standard focus on tax rates. Using spatial panel data techniques and the state-by-month population weighted averages, I find a significant association between one state's tax system and its neighboring states' tax systems.
R50|Conditions, Means Of Optimisation And The Limits Of Local Autonomy|The principle of local autonomy, as right and capacity of local authorities to address and manage public issues, on behalf of and in the interests of the local communities they represent, requires meeting the following cumulative conditions: recognition of the legal personality of the local communities and the election of their administrative authorities. The author brings arguments relevant to point out that local authorities must have the power of self-regulation, contractual freedom and adequate financial resources. Local autonomy limits are imposed by the need to respect the character of the decentralised unitary State and are guaranteed through the administrative control exercised by the central power. The originality of this article lies in the fact that the analysis of the legal texts was done in correlation with how they have been applied by the courts, particular relevance being given by the decisions of the Constitutional Court of Romania.
R50|Implementación de las Políticas de Desarrollo Productivo en Colombia: Una Visión desde las Regiones|En este documento se hace un análisis de la implementación de las Políticas de Desarrollo Productivo (PDP) del gobierno central a nivel regional en Colombia y se estudia en detalle la experiencia de un par de departamentos, uno con una experiencia económica positiva y otro con una experiencia negativa. Nuestro análisis muestra que la percepción en las regiones es que las PDP son diseñadas desde el gobierno central sin tener en cuenta sus necesidades. No obstante, las regiones pueden aprovechar estas políticas si logran una mejor organización interna de sus actores públicos y privados. Nuestro análisis identifica tensiones institucionales y políticas que complican la implementación regional de las PDP. También identifica la falta de incentivos de los departamentos para consolidar las Comisiones Regionales de Competitividad y para poner en marcha sus respectivos planes de competitividad. Algunas recomendaciones son sugeridas.
R50|Impacto del gasto público en la dinámica económica regional|Se estudia el impacto que tiene el gasto y la inversión pública en el crecimiento económico de los departamentos en Colombia, utilizando los resultados de las Cuentas Nacionales para el periodo 2000-2011, estimando la cuenta de producción departamental por rama de actividad con el fin de identificar la estructura productiva de dichas regiones, así como sus cambios a lo largo del tiempo y se consolida información de la formación bruta de capital fijo pública, datos con los cuales se especifica un modelo estadístico que estime dichos efectos. Entre las diferentes alternativas instrumentales es diseñado un modelo de panel de datos de efectos fijos que refleja de manera adecuada las diferencias existentes entre los departamentos y captura mejor el impacto del gasto y la inversión con la temporalidad e información disponible. Los resultados indican que el gasto y la inversión públicos inciden directamente en la dinámica económica departamental y se evidencia que su efecto tiende a ser mejor aprovechado por las economías grandes más ricas en mayor medida que por las economías departamentales pequeñas y pobres.******The impact that public spending and investment have upon economic growth in the departments of Colombia is examined using the results of national accounts for the years 2000-2011. Figures for departmental production by activity, along with change over the period and information for the gross public capital are brought together to create a statistical model to assess effects. A data panel model is chosen to relate the existing differences between departments and compare the impact of spending and investment between departments using the available information. Results indicate that public spending and investment play an important role in departmental economic dynamic and that its effect is greater in larger and wealthier departments.

Este artículo presenta evidencia empírica sobre el impacto que tiene el gasto público sobre el crecimiento económico regional, en 24 departamentos de Colombia, durante el periodo 1984 – 2012, con el fin de determinar si la relación se sustenta por el enfoque keynesiano o el enfoque wagneriano. A través de un modelo de datos panel cointegrado se estima esta relación y se obtienen los coeficientes de la relación de equilibrio de largo plazo. Los resultados empíricos muestran un efecto positivo y significativo del gasto público primario sobre el PIB, y esto confirma y da robustez a la hipótesis de que el gasto público contribuye al crecimiento económico, la cual va en la vía del enfoque keynesiano.
R50|The European Union EU co-deciding and co-governing authorities – knowledge and evaluation in the opinion of the Poles|This study concerns the co-decision and co-governing system basing on the European Commission (EC) and the European Parliament (EP) as an example. However, it is not a direct description of functions of these institutions but a presentation of results of empirical studies, including respondents’ knowledge about the EC and EP functioning. In the study the following thesis were verified: awareness and knowledge of the EU institutions is greater in the border regions because of participation in the process of euroregionalisation; level of knowledge about the integration is related to education, the higher and more comprehensive it is, the greater the understanding of the institutionalization of integration; residents of urban areas have greater knowledge about integration than people who live in rural areas.
R50|Local quality of government and migration. Evidence for European regions|In this paper we investigate the impact of local quality of government on the attractiveness of European regions to migrants. The analysis is based on panel data estimations of 254 regions for the period between 1995 and 2009. Different instrumental variable techniques have been employed in order to assess the extent to which differences in local quality of government affect migration decisions and to account for potential endogeneity concerns. The results point towards an important influence of specific factors related to the regional quality of government, such as the fight against corruption or government effectiveness, on the ability of European regions to attract future residents.
R50|The Effect of Local Crime on Well-Being: Evidence for Germany|This paper investigates the effect of local crime on well-being in Germany, using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and a novel data set constructed from official police crime statistics, covering both counties and urban districts for the time period between 1994 and 2012. We find that local area crime has a significantly negative impact on life satisfaction, makes residents worry more frequently, and worry more about crime in Germany. In particular, a 1% increase in the crime frequency ratio results in a 0.043 standard deviation decrease in life satisfaction. This effect is driven almost exclusively by violent crimes, while property crimes and other crimes have no significant impact on well-being.
R50|The origins of the public debt of Italy: Geographically dispersed interests?|In this paper we reconstruct the macro regional government deficits of Italy and find that the aggregate deficit resulting from our estimates captures quite well the entire dynamics of the Italian national public deficit. This new data set shows that the ultimate cause of the accumulation of public debt of Italy lies in the extraordinary fiscal imbalance of the Southern regions. The new data allow us to test empirically a simple Common Pool model, augmented by a variable measuring the political influence of each macro region in the Government, to verify the existence of a geographically dispersed interests issue for the Italian case. Our measure of political influence turns out to significantly explain the regions’ deficits also when controlling for population and income gaps. In addition, using a J-test approach, we find that including the predictions of the Common Pool–Pork Barrel regional model into a general model of the Italian national deficit turns out to greatly increase its explanatory power. The results call for deep institutional reforms of the fiscal decentralization so far implemented in Italy.
R50|Understanding inappropriateness in health spending: The role of regional policies and institutions in caesarean deliveries|We analyze the determinants of caesarean sections and the role that regional policies and institutions can play in controlling for inappropriateness in healthcare. We consider Italy as a case study, given that: at the national level caesarean sections are above OECD average but regional variation is significant; almost all childbirths are managed within the National Health Service, in a public or a private hospital; regional governments are in charge of managing and funding (at least partially) health care services. Controlling for average patients' characteristics and the riskiness of births, in the attempt to separate “appropriate” from “inappropriate” treatments, we find that regional policies and institutions do matter. In particular, our results suggest that decentralised DRG tariffs might be an effective policy tool to control inappropriateness, once the role of private providers is taken into account. Also the degree of fiscal autonomy in funding regional health expenditure, and the experience of regional government's president are important.
R50|Competing for firms under agglomeration: Policy timing and welfare|This article studies government tax competition for firms under agglomeration effects. Agglomeration forces avert races to the bottom. They also eliminate the need to harmonize policy if large regions set policy first. However, if regions set policy at the same time, harmonization can still improve welfare. The case against harmonization thus rests on the assumed timing of policy-formation, not on agglomeration itself. Tax floors, an often advocated alternative to harmonization may not form Pareto-improvements: that depend on the effects of local policy outside the own region.
R50|The influence of decentralized taxes and intergovernmental grants on local spending volatility| The influence of decentralized taxes and intergovernmental grants on local spending volatility. Regional Studies. This paper studies what affects the volatility of sub-central public spending in 20 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. The evidence based on data from 1972 to 2007 shows that the volatility of intergovernmental grants from upper levels is positively associated with the volatility of local expenditure. On the other hand, the volatility of local tax revenues – mainly that of property taxes – exerts the opposite effect. These findings suggest that making local governments rely more on grants than own tax revenues adversely affects their spending stability. Allowing them to levy autonomously taxes relying on responsive tax bases provides incentives to smooth their expenditure.
R50|YIMBY or NIMBY? Municipalities' reaction to disaster waste from the Great East Japan Earthquake|This study investigates the determinants of transfer of waste between the affected areas and other municipalities that resulted from the Great East Japan Earthquake. In particular we investigate to what extent economic factors, but also other factors such as reciprocity and pro-social concerns affect municipalities decision to accept disaster waste. The results show that the amount donated to the victims of the disaster, the capacity of disposal sites, and the intentions of the prefecture positively affected the decision to accept the disaster waste. On the other hand, municipalities with a higher number of workers in agriculture did not accept disaster waste. Thus, both economic and social factors were important determinants of the decision.
R50|Intermediaries and Regional Innovation Systemic behavior: A typology for Spain|Interaction is a central feature of well-functioning and integrated Regional Innovation Systems. However, it does not necessarily occur in an automatic fashion, denoting the existence of various system problems that may block learning and other crucial innovation processes. “Intermediaries” are organizations that encompass an increasing role in overcoming these problems. Still, they have not been adequately framed and assessed. The paper meets this need and presents a number of developments. First, we identify and categorize intermediaries according to some specific Innovation System problems they tap into, while we also include them in a novel intermediary component. Second, we operationalize sets of quantitative variables that permit new preliminary assessments. This methodology also permits new empirical insights that help framing more specific policy tools. The empirical analysis roots on an ad hoc data exploitation stemming from various surveys conducted by the Spanish Official Statistical Institute (INE) and the Spanish Venture Capital Association (ASCRI). We conduct multivariate techniques such as Multiple Factor and Cluster Analysis. The methodology creates a new typology that sorts Spanish regions according to the presence -or absence- of intermediaries when dealing with system problems. We find dissimilar outputs across regions. The latter might demand that their intermediary components are provided with strategic recommendations in response to specific system requirements.
R50|The character of innovative places: entrepreneurial strategy, economic development, and prosperity|Why do investments in certain places yield jobs, growth, and prosperity while similar investments made in seemingly identical places fail to produce the desired results? Starting with the observation that innovation clusters spatially across a broad spectrum of industries, my work seeks to understand the mechanisms and institutions that promote the creation of useful knowledge. In my conceptualization, entrepreneurs, as the agents who recognize opportunity, mobilize resources, and create value, are key to the creation of institutions and the building of capacity that will sustain regional economic development. Entrepreneurs benefit from location. But entrepreneurs are also pivotal as agents of change that can transform local communities. The initial event or entrepreneurial spark that gives rise to prosperous regions is not deterministic nor do they automatically set in motion path dependencies that automatically yield successful places. What matters most is human agency—the building of institutions and the myriad public and private decisions that determine what I call the character of place—a spirit of authenticity, engagement, and common purpose.

R50|NIMBY or YIMBY? Municipalities' reaction to disaster waste from the Great East Japan Earthquake|This study investigates the determinants of transfer of waste between the affected areas and other municipalities that resulted from the Great East Japan Earthquake. In particular, we investigate to what extent economic factors, but also social factors such as reciprocity and pro-social concerns, affect municipalities’ decision to accept disaster waste. We find some evidence that economic factors affect the decision, but the main factors that explain the decision are related to concerns about radiation and social concerns about the affected area. Our results suggest that it is primarily social concerns, both about the own municipality but also about the affected municipalities that explain behavior.

R50|State Fiscal Policies and Regional Economic Activity|In this paper, I estimate a structural panel vector autoregression to study the consequences of changes in U.S. state government fiscal policies for local economic activity in the short-term. My main result is that the state-level spending multiplier is relatively small and the tax multiplier relatively large. After four years, the government spending multiplier is 0.6 and the tax multiplier -2.62. This conclusion is found to be robust across different model specifications. I also find that both state spending and state revenue shocks increase out of state output.

It provides brief descriptions of the typical structures of metropolitan governance, with a particular focus on the involved organisations. It points out metropolitan areas that have unusual governance arrangements, but generally does not emphasise individual cases. The paper aims to give a descriptive overview of governance structures while abstaining from evaluating their performance. Ce rapport offre un panorama des approches spécifiques que les pays adoptent face à la gouvernance métropolitaine. Il fournit une brève description des structures typiques de gouvernance métropolitaine, avec un accent particulier sur les organisations impliquées. Le papier souligne les régions métropolitaines dotées de dispositifs inhabituels de gouvernance, mais ne s’étend pas sur les cas individuels. L’objectif du papier consiste à fournir un aperçu descriptif des structures de gouvernance sans évaluer leurs performances.
R50|The OECD Metropolitan Governance Survey: A Quantitative Description of Governance Structures in large Urban Agglomerations|Even though metropolitan areas account for half of the population, and an even larger share of economic activity of OECD countries, almost no systematic information on governance structures in these areas exists. This study – based on a novel data set – gives an overview of governance arrangements in OECD metropolitan areas. It shows that organisations dedicated to metropolitan area governance are common, but often have little powers. Nevertheless, the existence of such organisations is related with better performance on a range of important outcome variables, such as public transport systems, environmental issues, and urban sprawl.
R50|What Makes Cities More Productive? Evidence on the Role of Urban Governance from Five OECD Countries|This paper estimates agglomeration benefits based on city productivity differentials across five OECD countries (Germany, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States). It highlights the relationship between cities’ governmental fragmentation and productivity, and represents the first empirical analysis of how metropolitan governance structures affect this relationship. The comparability of results in a multi-country setting is supported through the use of Functional Urban Areas – an internationally harmonised definition of cities based on economic linkages rather than administrative boundaries. In line with the previous literature, the analysis confirms that city productivity tends to increase with city size; doubling city size is found to be associated with an increase in productivity of between two and five percent. What is more, city productivity is positively associated with the population size of nearby cities. On the governance side, the paper finds that cities with fragmented governance structures tend to have lower levels of productivity. For a given population size, a metropolitan area with twice the number of municipalities is associated with around six percent lower productivity; an effect that is mitigated by almost half by the existence of a governance body at the metropolitan level.
R50|Territorial Pact in context of Europe 2020|According to general acceptation, territorial pact is a contract between a different country's level of government (local, regional, national), a formalized local partnership on different market. This contract represents the relationship between governance and widespread participation of different social group, for different objectives (economic, social, and cultural). In the context of an enlarged European Union and Strategy 2020, cultural/natural heritage plays an important and clear role in at least four initiatives: innovation union, the digital agenda, and an industrial policy for the globalisation era and an agenda for new skills and jobs. The one important instrument for sustain these initiatives is territorial pact, also, a new mode of governance in European Union.This paper presents the general specification concerning to relation between heritage and territorial pacts in context of Europe 2020.
R50|Regional convergence – theoretical approaches|Within theoretical economic approaches, the convergence concept generated a great scientific literature elaborated at international , national and regional level . Also, the numerous studies from another field (economy , geography , history , sociology , and political science ) have an important impact of answers regarding the origin, evolution emergence, persistence, deepening, and more noticeable spatial inequalities in the field of incomes and standard living. The issues regarding convergence and dynamics of spatial distribution have an important role in the present economic literature, even though the approach of these topics remains still insufficiently explored and analysed. The regional convergence (along with nominal and institutional convergence) presents a special interest, considering the important gap between the new and old regions of EU Member-States. In this paper we limit approaching the field to main theoretical aspects regarding to regional convergence.
R50|Региональная Проблема Социалистической Югославии В 1945–1991 Гг<BR>[Regional Problem in Socialist Yugoslavia 1945‒1991]|В статье рассматриваются региональные и межнациональные проблемы в социалистической Югославии в период 1945–1991 гг. После Второй мировой войны Югославия возобновилась, однако, учитывая предшествующий опыт, не в виде унитарного, централистски организованного государства, а как Федерация шести республик (к тому же с двумя автономными краями в одной из них). Несмотря на то что в развитии нового государства региональные цели и региональная политика стояли на первом месте, в своей основе они рассматривались как межнациональная проблема, мало отличавшаяся от аналогичной проблемы в первой Югославии. Этому способствовали и статус республик (и автономных краев) как макрорегионов, и редуцирование региональной политики на присовокупление и распределение так называемых дополнительных средств для развития неразвитых регионов. Когда в середине 1960-х гг. просторно координированная система регионального развития сменилась на просторно некоординированную, региональные проблемы усилились, а страна в целом, как и все её части, потерпела большие ущербы. Именно региональная, т. е. межнациональная, проблема стала одной из самых острых, в немалой степени способствуя развалу страны. The paper considers regional and ethnic problems in socialist Yugoslavia during the period 1945‒1991. After the World War II Yugoslavia was renewed, but according to previous experience not as an unitary, centrally organized state, but as the federal state of six republics (with two autonomous provinces in one of them). In the development of the new state regional goals and regional policy were constantly one of the most important purposes, but they were considered as the inter-national problem, so they were little different from these problems in the first Yugoslavia. To them contributed also the status of republics (and autonomous provinces) as macro-regions and reductions of the regional policy to the collection and distribution of the additional assets for the development of the underdeveloped. In mid 1960’s, when the spatial coordinate system of regional development was replaced with the spatial non-coordinate system, regional problems multiplied, and the country and its parts suffered losses. It was the regional, i.e. ethnic problem the one that got overly serious and lead to the destruction of the country.

R50|Evaluación de la fragmentación en los Sistemas Regionales de Innovación: Una tipología para el caso de España|El presente artículo tiene por objeto la realización de una estimación de la conectividad de los Sistemas Regionales de Innovación (SRI) españoles. Para ello, evaluamos el fenómeno de la fragmentación explicada en términos de «fallos de sistema», los cuales habían sido descritos de forma fundamentalmente teórica. Por el contrario, nuestra aproximación emplea cuatro conjuntos de indicadores cuantitativos integrados en un marco interpretativo formado por los principales subsistemas del SRI. Así, los denominados: «brechas directivas», «brechas estructurales », «brechas de innovación» y el «valle de la muerte», son situados en el marco presentado para ser posteriormente analizados sobre los SRI de las Comunidades Autónomas españolas a partir de indicadores basados en datos explotados ad hoc por parte del Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) y de la Asociación Española de Entidades de Capital Riesgo (ASCRI). Simplificamos la dimensionalidad de la tabla resultante a través de la aplicación de técnicas multivariantes como el Análisis Factorial Múltiple (AFM) o el análisis clúster, las cuales nos conducen a la presentación de una nueva tipología para el caso de España. Descubrimos comportamientos asimétricos en lo que respecta a los «fallos de sistema» expuestos; lo cual podría justificar el diseño de medidas exclusivas para su corrección en atención a la singularidad manifestada por cada sistema observado. This article is intended to estimate the inner connectivity of Spanish Regional Innovation Systems (RISs). In order to do so, we appraise their inner fragmentation with regards to certain system problems that so far have mainly been described in a theoretical fashion. Instead, we make use of four sets of quantitative indicators which are integrated into an interpretive framework composed of the main subsystems of RISs. Consequently, the so-called «managerial gaps», «structural holes», «innovation gaps» and the «valley of death» are placed together in this framework as a means to be further studied across the Spanish autonomous communities’ RISs. The empirical analysis is based on an ad hoc data exploitation which stems from various surveys conducted by the Spanish Official Statistical Institute (INE) and the Spanish Venture Capital Association (ASCRI). We conduct multivariate techniques such as Multiple Factor Analyses (MFA) and Cluster Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of our database, leading us to the presentation of a new typology for Spain. We find asymmetric responses with regards to these problems, which might demand for the design of individual corrective measures adapted to the specificities of each system observed. Keywords: regions; Innovation Systems; fragmentation; Spain; Multiple Factor Analysis.
R50|An exploratory analysis of disabled people accessibility to urban public transport: the use of Geographical Information Systems|The potential information available in administrative records managed by Public Administrations is vast for its value in improving the social and economic research and its utility to evaluate, judge and plan the public policies. An advance in the standardization and coordination of the information records and systems would reduce the marginal cost of operations and would update data in order to avoid the fraud and improve the transparency. Thus, the aim of this paper is merging three independent public databases that they refer to people with disabilities, their location and their accessibility to urban transport. To do this, a new and unique database is built using a Geographic Information System (GIS). It is the ability of GIS to reconcile spatial data from different sources that allows the creation of new data sets. This framework may improve the availability of needed data, promote integration of technology and encourage collaboration among firms and the public sector what would allow Public Administrations’ decision making taking into account the economic and social characteristics of the registered disabled people.
R50|Evolving A Composite Development Index Of States: A Critique|The Raghuram Rajan Committee was appointed by the Government of India to suggest methods for identifying backward States and to recommend the criteria for allocation of funds from the Central Government to the States. It is argued in this paper that the index of underdevelopment of states prepared by the Committee suffers from serious conceptual and methodological inadequacies. The choice of indicators and their specification used for preparing composite index of development by the Committee are quite flawed both on account of exclusion of some critical indicators and improper specification of individual sub-index. The methodology of combing the indicators into a composite index by giving equal weights to the indicators is questionable. Moreover, the allocation formula suggested by the Committee drastically upsets the present scheme of things and will not be politically acceptable to most of the states. The report of the Committee is, thus, likely to prove an exercise in futility.

R50|Scotland's Economic Performance and the Fiscal Implications of Moving to Independence|Scotland's economic performance and fiscal make-up are key elements in the debate leading up to the forthcoming referendum on independence. However, in terms of understanding Scotland's economic performance, the situation is complicated by the high degree of overseas ownership, especially with regards to North Sea activity, and the importance of a natural commodity, oil. This makes the use of traditional measures of economic performance, like GDP or GDP per capita, less relevant than for most countries and suggests a greater need to use both constant price and cash GNI, neither of which are currently available. In terms of its fiscal balance, Scotland's independence would require taxes derived from its offshore (North Sea) activity to be sufficient to offset the extra monies (in per head terms) currently transferred from the rest of the UK (via the Barnett formula system) in order to pay for the current level of public services. Based on current projections, such North Sea related tax revenues would amount to less than the likely Barnett transfer, leading to a net loss in funding at the time of independence. Under such circumstances the question of whether or not Scotland could afford to initiate the building up of an â€˜Oil Fund', is largely a redundant one. However, uncertainties over both future oil and gas revenues and over the continuation of the existing Barnett system make it difficult to predict with any great certainty whether Scotland would see a longer-term net fiscal gain or loss post-independence. Apparent inconsistencies between official GNI and Scottish revenue figures also means that the existing fiscal balance position remains open to question.
R50|Pro-poor tax policy and yardstick competition: a spatial investigation for VAT relief on food in Brazil|This paper investigates whether a pro-poor tax policy follows yardstick competition in the value-added tax (VAT) base in Brazilian states. We explore an institutional arrangement that allows lower levels of government to set tax relief (tax cuts and exemptions) for food goods in a so-called basic basket food. Next, we examine the relationship between the VAT and the ‘Fund Against Poverty’ (FAP) financed by VAT rate increases on cigarettes and gas. Our findings indicate that the state tax function responds positively to the neighbour’s redistributive policy. Moreover, we estimate that the degree of spatial tax interaction among states has increased since the establishment of the FAP, suggesting that FAP resources are viewed as a complementary pro-poor policy rather than either a fiscal equalisation (substitute policy) or a possible slackness in the constraint of redistributive policies.

R50|On the definition of W in empirical models of yardstick competition|Theoretical models of strategic interaction between local governments are often implemented empirically using spatial econometric techniques. In order to empirically discriminate between different theoretical explanations for strategic interactions, it is important to ensure that the spatial weights matrix W reflects the theoretical mechanisms behind the interaction of interest. However, researchers do not usually have the information required to adequately define its elements in such a way. Here, we present a method for defining these elements that captures the interest of one jurisdiction’s inhabitants in the local politics of their neighboring jurisdictions even when this information is not directly available to the researcher. The method is suitable for use in empirical models of strategic interaction between local jurisdictions and can be used to define spatial weights matrices for spatial econometric models that will be used to test or control for yardstick competition across jurisdictions.

R50|Lâ€™agenzia per la coesione territoriale, quale strumento della governance multilivello volta ad una piÃ¹ efficiente ed efficace attuazione in Italia della politica di coesione dellâ€™UE|In this paper it has been analysed whether and how the Agency for Territorial Cohesion, just recently established and intended to replace the Department for Development and Cohesion Policies, can fit in the complex system of multilevel governance envisaged as per the Community rules for the 2014-2020 programming period, which sees the participation of many individuals, both public and private, operating at different levels of Government: central, regional and also strictly local. In particular, it seeks to ascertain to what extent the solution adopted by the Italian Government for promoting a more effective coordination among all actors involved, directly and indirectly, in the implementation of the cohesion policy in our country in order to comply with the proposals that had been presented â€“ at both national and international level â€“ by experts of the different disciplines, which shall be considered for carrying appropriately out a critical â€˜ex anteâ€™ analysis of the system in question from a scientific point of view.
R50|Cross-border delivery of public services: How useful are EGTCs?|The European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC) is a European legal instrument designed to facilitate and promote cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation. It was introduced in 2006 to enable public authorities of various Member States to team up and deliver joint services, without requiring a prior international agreement to be signed and ratified by national parliaments. At the end of 2013, 45 EGTCs had been established, and 15-20 EGTCs were under consideration (Committee of the Regions, EGTC Monitoring Report 2013). EGTCs in operation differ considerably in terms of size and activities, but some patterns can be discerned: most EGTCs are located in the Southern and Eastern part of the EU, and most deal with strategic cooperation for economic development (including spatial planning) rather than with concrete cross-border public service provision. Recently, EGTCs have been given a more prominent role in the institutional set-up of EU Cohesion Policy for 2014-2020. This all raises the question whether the instrument of EGTC is used for what it was originally intended for. This paper provides such an evaluation and looks at the possibilities and obstacles for cross-border cooperation in general, and in public service provision in particular, within and outside of the EGTC framework.
R50|Break-ups of municipal health centre federations: Expenditure and efficiency effects|Empirical evidence on economies of scale in healthcare is mostly based on the cost effects of hospital mergers. In contrast to earlier studies, this paper approaches the economies of scale issue by analysing the break-ups of municipal health centre federations. We use the difference-in-difference models to evaluate the break-up impacts on costs, outputs and efficiency of health centres in Finland between 1990 and 2003. To address potential non-random or endogenous treatment assignment we also utilize propensity score difference-in-difference approach. For cost efficiency estimation we use the non-parametric order-alpha method that is more suitable for small samples than the traditional efficiency estimators. Our results show that healthcare costs have grown considerably faster for the seceded health centres than for the similar non-seceded ones, while outputs have increased more for the former than for the latter group. Interestingly, we find the impact of break-ups to be insignificant on the productive efficiency of health centres.
R50|High Speed Rail System and the Tourism Market: Between Accessibility, Image and Coordination Tool|the aim of this P is to propose a state-of-the-art concerning the interaction between High-Speed Rail systems and the tourism market, in order to identify the possible best practices aiming to enhance the value of the tourist activities. This question arises because there are many projects of High-Speed Rail and others are ongoing, whose economic justification is based on the benefits deriving from them. In November 2013 there were 21.472 km of High Speed Railways (i.e., whose speed is greater than 250 km / h) in the world, 13964 km were under construction and 16347 km were scheduled by 2025. In 2025, 51784 km should be operational (UIC 2013), as in Germany, Belgium, Brazil, China, the United States, France, Iran, Morocco, and Portugal. Because of increase in accessibility, which the territories served benefit, the actors involved expect a dynamic economy, in general, and of the tourism in particular. Although expectations are important in France as abroad, a literature review of studies carried out ex-post shows that the effects are not systematic. Indeed, there is not a systematic dynamism because of the implementation of the High-Speed service. More specifically, we show that different types of tourism are variously impacted by High-Speed Rail service. Urban and business tourism are the most impacted ones. Specifically, we show the importance of the prior existence of famous cities. These last ones must offer a basket of tourist products and services that benefit a good accessibility from being served by a High Speed Rail station. But it can be noted also that, if the high speed allows, in some circumstances, the increase in the number of tourists, a decrease of stay is also possible. Moreover, as the number of cities served by High Speed Rail increases, High Speed Rail can be itself a differentiation asset to develop tourism market. The role of high speed should also be related to accessibility, understood both as attractiveness of the destination such as coordination of the actors in order to propose a coordinated and renewed supply.
R50|Greater Paris: A Plan for a Global City|"Over the last decade or so, the debate on the planning and development of the Paris (ÃŽle-de-France) region has revolved around two little words: ""Grand Paris"", or Greater Paris. Despite existing political and scientific controversies surrounding the future of the capital region, three major issues, different but interdependent in nature, have emerged. The first is the economic development of Paris and its place on the world stage (section 1); the second is socio-spatial justice and quality of life in the region (Section 2); and the third is governance (Section 3). These three issues, in our opinion, are key to understanding the processes currently under way in the ÃŽle-de-France region in connection with the concept of a Greater Paris. The aim of this paper is to stimulate scientific discussion by exploring each of these issues on the basis of the key stylized facts and the rationales of the various stakeholders."
R50|Public policies, growth, and agglomeration|This paper analyzes within a two-region endogenous growth model how different types of public policies affect the equilibrium spatial distribution of economic activity. Integration is modeled as a continuum and enables firms to access the public input of the respective other region. Given a dominance of agglomeration forces, multiple equilibria arise at which spreading becomes unstable and the stable equilibrium is characterized by a core-periphery structure. If only partial coordination of the two goverments decisions is realized, the positive productivity impact of one region s public input on the other region s marginal capital return becomes a positive externality. Then, the concentration of public inputs may end up to be suboptimally high or low, depending on the degree of scale effects. We perform numerical simulations to derive the equilibrium capital distribution and to disentangle the impact of the various determinants on equilibrium agglomeration.
R50|Optimal Regional Policies to Control Manure Nutrients to Surface and Ground Waters| Current day large animal facilities generate more manure than they need on their own feed production areas. Excessive nutrient applications deteriorate groundwater (nitrogen) and surface water quality (nitrogen and/or phosphorus). Due to differences in environmental and economic characteristics, adjacent regions may have differing objectives for nitrogen and phosphorus abatement. We postulate an analytical model of upstream agricultural and downstream recreational regions, and analyze optimal policies that consider both regions. We show that depending on the environmental and economic characteristics, tightening upstream regulation with respect to loading of one nutrient only might increase the downstream loading of the other. As the prevailing regulatory tool for livestock production is the Nutrient Management Plan based on nitrogen standard; and because livestock production is the main source of man-made nutrient loads to environment, the model is of high importance. Our model contributes to literature by i) differentiating (the impacts of) manure regulation between the livestock farm and the adjacent crop production farm ii) showing how this differentiation is carried over to relative and absolute amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus loading due to changes in nutrient application and uptake; and due to changes in application areas iii) allowing for regional differences in abatement objectives.

R50|Dutch Disease , factor mobility, and the Alberta Effect : the case of federations|Do reduced costs of factor mobility mitigate Dutch Disease effects to the extent that they are reversed? The case of federations provides an indication they do. We observe resource blessing (curse) effects at the provincial (federal) level, and argue the difference in outcomes stems from the difference in factor mobility costs. We construct a simple tax competition model which shows that if factor mobility costs are sufficiently low, a resourceboom triggers an Alberta Effect that mitigates, and possibly reverses, Dutch Disease symptoms. The paper concludes with empirical evidence for the main implications of the model.
R50|Does Urbanization Mean Bigger Governments?|In this paper, we introduce urbanization as an important driver of government size. Using panel data for 175 countries from 1960 to 2010, we find that there is a close link between urbanization and the size of the public sector, especially when looking at education, health care, and social issues. Various robustness checks confirm this finding. An analysis of state‐level public spending in Colombia and Germany confirms our hypothesis on the subnational level. On the microeconomic level, people in urban areas acknowledge that governments should take more responsibility, and they are more in favor of redistribution. This finding can help to explain the evolution of government size, and it can also predict the present and future needs of urbanizing areas.
R50|Finanzas públicas y desarrollo local. El caso de los municipios del departamento de Antioquia, Colombia (2001-2011)|Tradicionalmente, el desarrollo ha sido entendido como un conjunto de factores tendientes a mejorar la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos de un país o una localidad. Al interior de estos elementos, la calidad de la administración local y el manejo de los recursos públicos presentan un rol importante. Este artículo brinda elementos de discusión sobre la incidencia que tiene un manejo adecuado de la hacienda pública local sobre la calidad de vida y el desarrollo local. Para probar esta hipótesis de trabajo, el estudio presenta un conjunto de correlaciones entre el manejo fiscal y algunos indicadores de desarrollo para los municipios del departamento de Antioquia. La conclusión principal es que ciertamente el buen estado de las finanzas públicas locales, incide positivamente en la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos.
R50|Mercado laboral en las subregiones del departamento de Antioquia: Diagnóstico y recomendaciones de política para el Oriente y el Urabá|Resumen: Este artículo tiene como objetivo principal realizar un análisis comparativo del mercado laboral entre las subregiones del Oriente y del Urabá antioqueño. Para cumplir con dicho objetivo y dado que no existe información para el ámbito local, el Grupo de Macroeconomía Aplicada, de la Universidad de Antioquia se ha puesto en la tarea de recoger la información para dos subregiones del departamento: Oriente y Urabá. Esto ha sido posible gracias al apoyo de la Mesa de Educación del Oriente y a la RED ORMET. Los resultados indican que el desempleo en ambas subregiones es más alto que el promedio nacional y de Medellín, los jóvenes y las mujeres son dos grupos altamente vulnerables y se presenta en ambos casos desempleo estructural, siendo mucho mayor en el Urabá. A modo de recomendaciones se sugiere trabajar en programas de educación superior más pertinentes y de mayor calidad, en conectar las necesidades de oferentes y demandantes y trabajar en la consolidación de nuevas cadenas productivas.
R50|Impacto del gasto público en la dinámica económica regional|La dinámica económica de un país es sin duda uno de los temas de estudio más importantes en la actualidad. En Colombia, diariamente se busca encontrar las razones del rezago en el crecimiento del país, por lo cual surge la necesidad de realizar un análisis sobre el desarrollo y dinámica económica regional y cómo estos factores se ven influenciados por la inversión y el Gasto Público. La información de gasto e inversión pública no se encuentra especificada ni disponible en las cuentas departamentales elaboradas por el Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística (DANE) por lo tanto ésta investigación genera un gran aporte en cuanto a medición y análisis económico regional para el país se refiere. Con base en el Sistema de Cuentas Nacionales Unidas 2008 y en las Cuentas Departamentales Nacionales se elabora una base de datos para el periodo de tiempo 2000 – 2011 que incluye entre otras, las estimaciones del Consumo intermedio, Producción departamental estimada y Gasto Público para los 32 departamentos del país más Bogotá. Los resultados obtenidos indican que el gasto público y la inversión son variables que afectan de forma directa la dinámica económica departamental del país y, contrario a lo esperado, se concluye que, aunque el Gasto Publico tiene una influencia enorme en la dinámica económica de todos los departamentos, ésta es menor en aquellos con economías pequeñas que en los que poseen economías medianas y grandes.******The impact that public spending and investment have upon economic growth in the departments of Colombia is examined using the results of national accounts for the years 2000-2011. Figures for departmental production by activity, along with change over the period and information for the gross public capital are brought together to create a statistical model to assess effects. A data panel model is chosen to relate the existing differences between departments and compare the impact of spending and investment between departments using the available information. Results indicate that public spending and investment play an important role in departmental economic dynamic and that its effect is greater in larger and wealthier departments.
R50|Examining the cost efficiency of Chinese hydroelectric companies using a finite mixture model|This paper evaluates the operational activities of Chinese hydroelectric power companies over the period 2000–2010 using a finite mixture model that controls for unobserved heterogeneity. In so doing, a stochastic frontier latent class model, which allows for the existence of different technologies, is adopted to estimate cost frontiers. This procedure not only enables us to identify different groups among the hydro-power companies analysed, but also permits the analysis of their cost efficiency. The main result is that three groups are identified in the sample, each equipped with different technologies, suggesting that distinct business strategies need to be adapted to the characteristics of China's hydro-power companies. Some managerial implications are developed.
R50|Locally most powerful tests for spatial interactions in the simultaneous SAR Tobit model|The simultaneous SAR Tobit model is useful to analyze censored data in a spatial or social interaction setting. This paper focuses on three classical tests of spatial interactions in the simultaneous SAR Tobit model. We derive the asymptotic distributions of those three tests under the null and the local alternative hypotheses, establish their asymptotic equivalence and local efficiency, and study finite sample properties by the Monte Carlo simulation. The tests are applied to an empirical example on the presence of competition among school districts on school district income tax in Iowa.
R50|Do Single-Party and Coalition Governments Differ in their Economic Outcomes? Evidence from Finnish Municipalities| Even though Finland has proportional elections, single-party control in Finnish local councils is not uncommon contrary to what one might expect. The largest party holds more than half of the seats in every third Finnish local council and is thus likely to govern alone. This study investigates whether single-party and coalition governed municipalities differ in their economic outcomes. Common pool models predict that when there is a governing coalition, all the parties aim to target some spending at their core constituents, while costs are shared equally across all parties. This would mean that coalition governments result in higher spending. Using data from 445 Finnish municipalities for the years 1980â€“2010, I provide causal evidence that is consistent with the predictions of common pool models. Estimates suggest that single-party control decreases total expenditures and revenues by around 200â€“300 euros per capita. I also analyze the effect in several areas of spending and revenues, but do not find any clear results. I exploit close elections as a source of exogenous variation using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) approach tailored for proportional elections.
R50|The long road to recovery: New York Schools in the aftermath of the Great Recession|Schools play a crucial role in human capital development, and were one of the many elements of government adversely affected by the Great Recession. Using a rich panel data set of New York State school districts and a trend-shift analysis, we examine how the funding and expenditure dynamics of districts have changed in the four years since the recession hit. We find that although the stimulus prevented major cuts to expenditures while it was in place, once the stimulus funding was used up districts faced strong budget constraints and made deep cuts to their expenditures. While state and local funding continue to be below trend, the role of funding schools has shifted more to local governments because of a cutback in state and federal aid. Breaking up expenditure into its primary categories, we see that instructional spending was preserved with the help of the stimulus money in 2010, but by 2012 instructional expenditure experienced a statistically and economically significant downward shift. We also examine heterogeneities in the effects by metropolitan area, looking at the major MSAs of New York. We find that Nassau sustained the largest cuts, while Buffalo sustained the smallest. These findings are instructive in that they shed light on how recessions and fiscal policy can affect school finance dynamics, and provide important lessons/insight for future policy and experiences of schools in financial distress.
R50|Stockholm – from ugly duckling to Europe’s first green capital|The European Commission named Stockholm Europe’s first Green Capital City in 2010. Important reasons for the award were: a reduction of CO2 emissions by 25 percent per capita since 1990 and the establishment of an administrative system integrating environmental aspects in the planning, budgeting and management of all the various activities governed by the city. This paper describes the main features of the economic, environmental and political development in Stockholm since 1850. The main idea is simply to provide a historical perspective on the city´s environmental policy but we also want to shed light on the extent to which historical decisions and processes exert an influence on current ambitions and measures to strengthen Stockholm´s sustainability. In addition to pointing at the long-lasting influence of earlier infrastructure investments we also indicate the importance of the political pragmatism and social-engineering attitude developed since the 1930´s. However, Stockholm´s recently adopted action plan for reducing the emission of greenhouse gases indicates that this institutional capital might have eroded somewhat. If this is true, Stockholm might face more difficulties in becoming greener than usually expected considering its current ranking as a leading European capital in terms of intellectual capital and rate of innovation.
