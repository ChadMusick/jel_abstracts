C21|Asymptotic Theory And Wild Bootstrap Inference With Clustered Errors|We study asymptotic inference based on cluster-robust variance estimators for regression models with clustered errors, focusing on the wild cluster bootstrap and the ordinary wild bootstrap. We stateconditions under which both asymptotic and bootstrap tests and confidence intervals will be asymptotically valid. These conditions put limits on the rates at which the cluster sizes can increase as the number of clusters tends to infinity. To include power in the analysis, we allow the data to be generated under sequences of local alternatives. Under a somewhat stronger set of conditions, we also derive formal Edgeworth expansions for the asymptotic and bootstrap test statistics. Simulation experiments illustrate the theoretical results, and the Edgeworth expansions explain the overrejection of the asymptotic test and shed light on the choice of auxiliary distribution for the wild bootstrap.
C21|Reconsideration of a simple approach to quantile regression for panel data: a comment on the Canay (2011) fixed effects estimator|Estimation of individual effects in quantile regression can be difficult in large panel datasets, but a solution is apparently offered by a computationally simple estimator by Ivan Canay (2011, The Econometrics Journal) for quantile-independent individual effects. The Canay estimator is widely used by practitioners and is often cited in the theoretical literature. However, our paper discusses two fallacies in Canay's approach. We formally prove that Canay's assumptions can entail severe bias or even non-existence of the limiting distribution for the estimator of the vector of coefficients, leading to incorrect inference. A second problem is incorrect asymptotic standard error of the estimator of the constant term. In an attempt to improve Canay's estimator, we propose a simple correction which may reduce the bias. Regarding the constant term, we focus on the fact that finding a sqrt(nT) consistent first step estimator may be problematic. Finally, we give recommendations to practitioners in terms of different values of n=T, and conduct a meta-review of applied papers, which use Canay's estimator.
C21|Natural disasters and mental health: A quantile approach|This article investigates heterogeneity in the effect of experiencing natural disasters on mental health. Using Australian longitudinal data, we find that home owners generally show a reduction in mental health score after a disaster. There is a strong negative effect in the lowest two quantiles of the distribution for non-owners.
C21|The Effect of Aspirations on Inequality: Evidence from the German Reunification using Bayesian Growth Incidence Curves|A long-standing literature has investigated the formation of aspirations and how they shape human behaviours but a recent interest has been devoted on the interplay between aspirations and inequality. Because aspirations are socially determined, household investment decisions tend to be reproduced according to the social context which fosters inequality to persist. We empirically examine the role of aspirations on inequality using a natural experiment. We exploit an exogenous variation of social aspirations determined by the exposure to Western German TV broadcasts in the GDR before the reunification. We measure the treatment effect on wage inequality by comparing inequality changes between the treatment and the control regions after reunification. We use an heteroskedastic parametric model for income with a treatment effect and sample selection into the labour market. We derive analytical formulae for the growth incidence curve of Ravallion and Chen (2003) and poverty growth curve of Son (2004) for the log-normal distribution. Based on those curves, we provide Bayesian inference and a set of tests related to stochastic dominance criteria. We find evidences that aspirations-through exposure to Western German broadcasts-have significantly affected inequality. We find that this effect was detrimental in terms of inequality and poverty. However, we cannot conclude about the persistence of the effect after 1995.
C21|On binscatter|Binscatter is very popular in applied microeconomics. It provides a flexible, yet parsimonious way of visualizing and summarizing “big data” in regression settings, and it is often used for informal testing of substantive hypotheses such as linearity or monotonicity of the regression function. This paper presents a foundational, thorough analysis of binscatter: We give an array of theoretical and practical results that aid both in understanding current practices (that is, their validity or lack thereof) and in offering theory-based guidance for future applications. Our main results include principled number of bins selection, confidence intervals and bands, hypothesis tests for parametric and shape restrictions of the regression function, and several other new methods, applicable to canonical binscatter as well as higher-order polynomial, covariate-adjusted, and smoothness-restricted extensions thereof. In particular, we highlight important methodological problems related to covariate adjustment methods used in current practice. We also discuss extensions to clustered data. Our results are illustrated with simulated and real data throughout. Companion general-purpose software packages for Stata and R are provided. Finally, from a technical perspective, new theoretical results for partitioning-based series estimation are obtained that may be of independent interest.
C21|Technological Learning and Innovation Gestation Lags at the Frontier of Science: from CERN Procurement to Patents|This paper contributes to the literature on the impact of Big Science Centres on technological innovation. We exploit a unique dataset with information on CERN’s procurement orders to study the collaborative innovation process between CERN and its industrial partners, mostly European firms. Since 19 out of the 23 Member Countries of CERN belong to the EU, public procurement for innovation through CERN can be seen as factor contributing to European innovation policies. After a qualitative discussion of case studies, survival and count data models are estimated; the impact of CERN procurement on suppliers’ innovation is captured by the number of patent applications. The fact that firms in our sample received their first order over a long time span (1995-2008) delivers a natural partition of industrial partners into “suppliers” and “not yet suppliers”. This allows estimating the impact of CERN on the hazard to file a patent for the first time and on the number of patent applications, as well as the time needed for these effects to show up. We find that a “CERN effect” does exist: being an industrial partner of CERN is associated with an increase in the hazard to file a patent for the first time and in the number of patent applications. These effects require a significant “gestation lag” in the range of five to eight years, pointing to a relatively slow process of absorption of new ideas.
C21|Inference in Differences-in-Differences: How Much Should We Trust in Independent Clusters?|We analyze the conditions in which ignoring spatial correlation is problematic for inference in differences-in-differences (DID) models. Assuming that the spatial correlation structure follows a linear factor model, we show that inference ignoring such correlation remains reliable when either (i) the second moment of the difference between the pre- and post-treatment averages of common factors is low, or (ii) the distribution of factor loadings has the same expected values for treated and control groups, and do not exhibit significant spatial correlation. We present simulation results with real datasets that corroborate these conclusions. Our results provide important guidelines on how to minimize inference problems due to spatial correlation in DID applications.
C21|Matching Estimators with Few Treated and Many Control Observations|We analyze the properties of matching estimators when the number of treated observations is fixed while the number of treated observations is large. We show that, under standard assumptions, the nearest neighbor matching estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated is asymptotically unbiased, even though this estimator is not consistent. We also provide a test based on the theory of randomization tests under approximate symmetry developed in Canay et al. (2014) that is asymptotically valid when the number of control observations goes to infinity. This is important because large sample inferential techniques developed in Abadie and Imbens (2006) would not be valid in this setting.
C21|State-Dependent Effect on Voter Turnout: The Case of US House Elections|In models of voter participation, the effects of election margin and campaign expenditure can be shown to be state-dependent – varying with low/high turnout. We empirically assess these implications for observed turnout, employing data from US House elections from 2000 to 2008 by means of quantile regression analysis. We document that the effects of expected election margin and campaign spending on turnout are statedependent: the later is positive and decreasing, whereas the former is negative and Ushaped. Other determinants’ influence on turnout (e.g. education, population density) is also shown to vary across the conditional distribution of turnout rate. Our findings are robust to a number of extensions.
C21|A regression discontinuity design for categorical ordered running variables with an application to central bank purchases of corporate bonds|We propose a regression discontinuity design which can be employed when assignment to a treatment is determined by an ordinal variable. The proposal first requires an ordered probit model for the ordinal running variable to be estimated. The estimated probability of being assigned to a treatment is then adopted as a latent continuous running variable and used to identify a covariate-balanced subsample around the threshold. Assuming the local unconfoundedness of the treatment in the subsample, an estimate of the effect of the programme is obtained by employing a weighted estimator of the average treatment effect. We apply our methodology to estimate the causal effect of the corporate sector purchase programme of the European Central Bank on bond spreads.
C21|Modelos hedónicos con efectos espaciales: una aproximación al cálculo de índices de precios de vivienda para Bogotá|En este documento se estima un índice de precios de vivienda nueva para la ciudad de Bogotá empleando la base de datos de La Galería Inmobiliaria, empresa dedicada a la recolección de información del mercado inmobiliario en Colombia. La metodología de precios hedónicos aquí propuesta presenta tres ventajas con respecto a los índices de vivienda que se calculan en la actualidad para esta ciudad: i) considera que un inmueble es un bien diferenciado, cuyo precio está definido en función de sus características, ii) incorpora de manera parsimoniosa la ubicación de las viviendas por medio de un modelo de econometría espacial, y iii) utiliza una ventana de tiempo para la estimación del índice, haciendo que no sea susceptible a modificaciones ante incorporaciones de nuevos datos. Los resultados muestran que la bondad de ajuste del índice resultante es significativamente mayor a la de los que se producen en la actualidad, que los coeficientes presentan el comportamiento esperado y son estables en el tiempo, y que el índice es robusto a cambios en la participación de inmuebles que se ubican en las colas de la distribución de precios, gracias a la modelación de vecindarios en la estimación espacial. **** ABSTRACT: In this document a new housing price index is calculated for Bogota using data from La Galería Inmobiliaria, company dedicated to the collection of information from the real estate market in Colombia. The hedonic price methodology proposed here presents three advantages over the housing price indexes which are currently produced for the city: i) it considers that a dwelling is a differentiated good, whose price is defined as a function of its characteristics, ii) incorporates in an parsimonious fashion the location of the residences through a spatial econometric model, and iii) it uses a rolling time window to produce the index, making it not susceptible to changes after including new data. The results show that the goodness of fit of the resulting index is significantly higher than the observed in the current indexes, the coefficients presents the expected behavior and are stable over time, and the results are robust to changes in the participation of dwellings located in the tails of the price distribution.
C21|Disease management in diabetes care: when involving GPs improves patient compliance and health outcomes|Although the study of the association between interventions in primary care and health outcomes continues to produce mixed findings, programs designed to promote the greater compliance of General Practitioners and their diabetic patients with treatment guidelines have been increasingly introduced worldwide, in an attempt to achieve better quality diabetes care through the enhanced standardisation of patient supervision. In this study we use clinical data taken from the Diabetes Register of one Local Health Authority (LHAs) in Italy’s Emilia-Romagna Region for the period 2014-2015. Firstly, we test to see whether the monitoring activities prescribed for diabetics by regional diabetes guidelines, actually have a positive impact on patients’ health outcomes and increase appropriateness in health care utilization. Secondly, we investigate whether GPs’ participation in the local Diabetes Management Program (DMP) leads to improved patient compliance with regional guidelines. Our results show that such a program, which aims to increase GPs’ involvement and cooperation in following regional guidelines for best practices, achieves its goal of improved patient compliance with the prescribed actions. In turn, through the implementation of the DMP and the greater involvement of physicians, regional policies have succeeded in promoting better health outcomes and the improved appropriateness of health care utilization.
C21|Not Just a Work Permit: EU Citizenship and the Consumption Behavior of Documented and Undocumented Immigrants|This paper explores the impact of the 2007 European Union enlargement on the consumption behavior of immigrant households. Using data from a unique Italian survey and a difference-in-differences approach, we find that the enlargement induced a significant consumption increase for the immigrant households from new member states both in the short- and in the medium-run. This enlargement effect cannot be attributed to the mere legalization as it concerns both undocumented and documented immigrants, albeit through different channels. Detailed information on immigrants' legal status (undocumented/documented) and sector of employment (informal/formal) allows us to shed light on the exact mechanisms. Following the enlargement, previously undocumented immigrants experienced an increase in the labor income by moving from the informal towards the formal economy, whereas immigrants who were already working legally in Italy benefitted from the increased probability of getting a permanent contract. Enhanced employment stability in turn reduced the uncertainty about future labor income leading to an increase in documented immigrants' consumption expenditure.
C21|Affordability, Financial Innovation and the Start of the Housing Boom|At their peak in 2005, roughly 60 percent of all purchase mortgage loans originated in the United States contained at least one non-traditional feature. These features, which allowed borrowers easier access to credit through teaser interest rates, interest-only or negative amortization periods, and extended payment terms, have been the subject of much regulatory and popular criticism. In this paper, we construct a novel county-level dataset to analyze the relationship between rising house prices and non-traditional features of mortgage contracts. We apply a break-point methodology and find that in housing markets with breaks in the mid-2000s, a strong rise in the use of non-traditional mortgages preceded the start of the housing boom. Furthermore, their rise was coupled with declining denial rates and a shift from FHA to subprime mortgages. Our findings support the view that a change in mortgage contract availability and a shift toward subprime borrowers helped to fuel the rise of house prices during the last decade.
C21|Political Risk and Real Exchange Rate: What can we Learn from Recent Developments in Panel Data Econometrics for Emerging and Developing Countries?|This paper focuses on the analysis of the long-run response of the Real Exchange Rate (RER) to political risks and tests whether non-economic variables have an impact on RER in 31 emerging and developing countries. We use annual data from the International Country Risk Guide database over the 1984 to 2016 period. Based on the recently developed method of Cross- Sectionally Augmented ARDL approach of Chudik and Pesaran (2015b), and the panel threshold estimation of Chudik et al. (2017) our main findings are the following: i) countries experiencing a high degree of corruption, a high risk to investment, or a high degree of political instability tend to experience a real exchange rate depreciation, ii) there exists strong evidence for a threshold effect on the relationship between investment profile-RER, corruption-RER and political instability-RER. Specifically, political instability and corruption adversely affect real exchange rate especially when they exceed the threshold. iii) the effects of bureaucracy, law, and order seem to be statistically insignificant on the RER. Our findings are robust to the inclusion of the Balassa-Samuelson effect in the estimated equations.
C21|Estimation and inference for spatial models with heterogeneous coefficients: an application to U.S. house prices|This paper considers the problem of identification, estimation and inference in the case of spatial panel data models with heterogeneous spatial lag coefficients, with and without (weakly) exogenous regressors, and subject to heteroskedastic errors. A quasi maximum likelihood (QML) estimation procedure is developed and the conditions for identification of spatial coefficients are derived. Regularity conditions are established for the QML estimators of individual spatial coefficients, as well as their means (the mean group estimators), to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Small sample properties of the proposed estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo simulations for Gaussian and non-Gaussian errors, and with spatial weight matrices of differing degrees of sparsity. The simulation results are in line with the paper's key theoretical findings even for panels with moderate time dimensions, irrespective of the number of cross section units. An empirical application to U.S. house price changes during the 1975-2014 period shows a significant degree of heterogeneity in spill-over effects over the 338 Metropolitan Statistical Areas considered.
C21|Estimation and inference in spatial models with dominant units|Estimation and inference in the spatial econometrics literature are carried out assuming that the matrix of spatial or network connections has uniformly bounded absolute column sums in the number of cross-section units, n. In this paper, we consider spatial models where this restriction is relaxed. The linear-quadratic central limit theorem of Kelejian and Prucha (2001) is generalized and then used to establish the asymptotic properties of the GMM estimator due to Lee (2007) in the presence of dominant units. A new Bias-Corrected Method of Moments estimator is also proposed that avoids the problem of weak instruments by self-instrumenting the spatially lagged dependent variable. Both estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, depending on the rate at which the maximum column sum of the weights matrix rises with n. The small sample properties of the estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments and shown to be satisfactory. An empirical application to sectoral price changes in the US over the pre- and post-2008 financial crisis is also provided. It is shown that the share of capital can be estimated reasonably well from the degree of sectoral interdependence using the input-output tables, despite the evidence of dominant sectors being present in the US economy.
C21|Direct and Indirect Effects Based on Changes-in-Changes|We propose a novel approach for causal mediation analysis based on changes-in-changes assumptions restricting unobserved heterogeneity over time. This allows disentangling the causal effect of a binary treatment on a continuous outcome into an indirect effect operating through a binary intermediate variable (called mediator) and a direct effect running via other causal mechanisms. We identify average and quantile direct and indirect effects for various subgroups under the condition that the outcome is monotonic in the unobserved heterogeneity and that the distribution of the latter does not change over time conditional on the treatment and the mediator. We also provide a simulation study and an empirical application to the Jobs II programme.
C21|Reconsideration of a simple approach to quantile regression for panel data: a comment on the Canay (2011) fixed effects estimator|The paper discusses two errors in the approach proposed in Canay (2011) for constructing a computationally simple two-step estimator in a quantile regression model with quantile-independent fixed effects. Firstly, we show that Canay's assumption about n/T^s --> 0 for some s>1 is not strong enough and can entail severe bias or even non-existence of the limiting distribution for the estimator of the vector of coefficients. The condition n/T --> 0 appears to be closer to the required set of restrictions. These problems are likely to cause incorrect inference in applied papers with large n/T, but the impact is less in applications with small n/T. In an attempt to improve Canay's estimator, we propose a simple correction which may reduce the bias. The second error concerns incorrect asymptotic standard error of the estimator of the constant term. We show that contrary to Canay's assumption, the within estimator has an influence function that is not i.i.d. and this affects inference. Moreover, the constant term is unlikely to be estimable at rate sqrt{nT}, so a different estimator may not be available. However, the issue concerning the constant term does not have an effect on slope coefficients. Finally, we give recommendations to practitioners and conduct a meta-review of applied papers that use Canay's estimator.
C21|Mostly Harmless Simulations? Using Monte Carlo Studies for Estimator Selection|We consider two recent suggestions for how to perform an empirically motivated Monte Carlo study to help select a treatment effect estimator under unconfoundedness. We show theoretically that neither is likely to be informative except under restrictive conditions that are unlikely to be satisfied in many contexts. To test empirical relevance, we also apply the approaches to a real-world setting where estimator performance is known. Both approaches are worse than random at selecting estimators which minimise absolute bias. They are better when selecting estimators that minimise mean squared error. However, using a simple bootstrap is at least as good and often better. For now researchers would be best advised to use a range of estimators and compare estimates for robustness.
C21|Saddlepoint Approximations for Spatial Panel Data Models|We develop new higher-order asymptotic techniques for the Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator of the parameters in a spatial panel data model, with fixed effects, time-varying covariates, and spatially correlated errors. We introduce a new saddlepoint density and tail area approximation to improve on the accuracy of the extant asymptotics. It features relative error of order O(m to the power of -1) for m = n(T -1) with n being the cross-sectional dimension and T the time-series dimension. The main theoretical tool is the tilted-Edgeworth technique. It yields a density approximation that is always non-negative, does not need resampling, and is accurate in the tails. We provide an algorithm to implement our saddlepoint approximation and we illustrate the good performance of our method via numerical examples. Monte Carlo experiments show that, for the spatial panel data model with fixed effects and T = 2, the saddlepoint approximation yields accuracy improvements over the routinely applied first-order asymptotics and Edgeworth expansions, in small to moderate sample sizes, while preserving analytical tractability. An empirical application on the investment-saving relationship in OECD countries shows disagreement between testing results based on first-order asymptotics and saddlepoint techniques, which questions some implications based on the former.
C21|Shaping individual preferences for social protection: the case of platform workers|Workers who perform their occupations through platforms are becoming an increasing share of the labour force. The debate is polarized between those arguing for platforms as an instrument to increase flexibility and labor force participation, and those who see it as a further mechanism to increase Non Standard Work (NSW). This debate is policy relevant because in either case, platform participation is associated to a difference in terms of willingness to contribute to the social security system. Nevertheless, the evidence is scant because we lack reliable data sources. In this contribution, we use a dedicated survey to estimate Willingness to Pay (WTP) for social security and estimate the causal impact of platform participation using a selection on observable strategy. We found that platform workers are less disposed to contribute to social security, although perception of accessibility and adequacy are not affected. Results are robust to specifications and multiple hypotheses testing.
C21|How Effective are Innovation Support Programs to Stimulate Innovation? Evidence from Paraguay|In this paper we evaluate the impact of two programs to support innovation in micro, small and medium enterprises in Paraguay. This article has two contributions to literature. First, the evidence on the impact of this type of programs in developing countries is still scarce. Second, we evaluate the impacts on some variables that have been largely overlooked in the literature, such as innovation activities other than R&D. The evaluation finds positive and significant effects on the probability of carrying out various innovation activities, on the probability of achieving different types of innovation and on the incorporation of technical personnel to the firms. A negative effect on R&D was found, which might be showing a displacement effect of this innovation activity by others. The most robust results are those related to the impact of the program on process and product innovation. The impacts on innovation activities and employment are less robust to alternative specifications and samples.
C21|The impact of age at arrival on education and mental health|Given the importance of education and mental health for labor market performance, we study how these outcomes are affected by the age at which refugees arrive in the country. We identify the causal impact of age at arrival by comparing siblings who share the same family background characteristics, but arrive at different ages. Given the importance of education and mental health for labor market performance, we study how these outcomes are affected by the age at which refugees arrive in the country. We identify the causal impact of age at arrival by comparing siblings who share the same family background characteristics, but arrive at different ages. We find significant and meaningful impacts of age at arrival on educational attainment, but not on mental health. Arriving one year earlier increases the probability to obtain a higher educational degree by 3.6 percentage points. We find this impact to be stronger for girls than for boys. We do not find evidence suggesting that the impact of age at arrival becomes more pronounced after a specific age. Our findings carry important policy implications for the allocation of scarce resources available for integration of refugees as we show that refugee children who arrive at an older age will have substantially reduced educational outcomes compared to those who arrive at a younger age. This also implies that child refugees arriving via family reunification would benefit substantially from reductions in asylum application processing time, even if realized reductions are small.
C21|Modified Causal Forests for Estimating Heterogeneous Causal Effects|Uncovering the heterogeneity of causal effects of policies and business decisions at various levels of granularity provides substantial value to decision makers. This paper develops new estimation and inference procedures for multiple treatment models in a selection-on-observables frame-work by modifying the Causal Forest approach suggested by Wager and Athey (2018). The new estimators have desirable theoretical and computational properties for various aggregation levels of the causal effects. An Empirical Monte Carlo study shows that they may outperform previously suggested estimators. Inference tends to be accurate for effects relating to larger groups and conservative for effects relating to fine levels of granularity. An application to the evaluation of an active labour market programme shows the value of the new methods for applied research.
C21|A Field Experiment on Labor Market Speeddates for Unemployed Workers|We conduct a field experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of labor market speeddates where unemployed workers meet temporary employment agencies. Our analysis shows that participation in such events increases immediate job finding by 6-7 percentage points. In the subsequent months, employment effects diminish again, suggesting that vacancies mediated through temporary employment agencies have no long-lasting effect on employment prospects. While the intervention is cost effective for the UI administration, higher labor earnings of treated job seekers do not fully compensate for the decline in benefit payments. Additional survey evidence shows that speeddate participation increases job search motivation and reduces reservation wages.
C21|Treatment Effects with Heterogeneous Externalities|This paper proposes a new method for estimating heterogeneous externalities in policy analysis when social interactions take the linear-in-means form. We establish that the parameters of interest can be identified and consistently estimated using specific functions of the share of the eligible population. We also study the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators using Monte Carlo simulations. The method is illustrated using data on the PROGRESA program. We find that more than 50 percent of the effects of the program on schooling attendance are due to externalities, which are heterogeneous within and between poor and nonpoor households.
C21|Breaking Ties: Regression Discontinuity Design Meets Market Design|Centralized school assignment algorithms must distinguish between applicants with the same preferences and priorities. This is done with randomly assigned lottery numbers, non-lottery tie-breakers like test scores, or both. The New York City public high school match illustrates the latter, using test scores, grades, and interviews to rank applicants to screened schools, combined with lottery tie-breaking at unscreened schools. We show how to identify causal effects of school attendance in such settings. Our approach generalizes regression discontinuity designs to allow for multiple treatments and multiple running variables, some of which are randomly assigned. Lotteries generate assignment risk at screened as well as unscreened schools. Centralized assignment also identifies screened school effects away from screened school cutoffs. These features of centralized assignment are used to assess the predictive value of New York City’s school report cards. Grade A schools improve SAT math scores and increase the likelihood of graduating, though by less than OLS estimates suggest. Selection bias in OLS estimates is egregious for Grade A screened schools.
C21|My neighbourâ€™s war: Spatial dependence of conflict incidence in West Africa|Although recent empirical literature acknowledges that organized violence tends to cluster geographically, the limited use of disaggregated data and of accurate spatial estimation techniques fail in explaining the spatial structure of conflict events. In this paper we analyse conflict incidence in West Africa through the provision of an illustrative case (the Mano River Region) by: (i) performing the analysis with the smallest possible sub-national disaggregated areas; (ii) taking into account the location of valuable resources (lootable diamonds and gold); and (iii) applying the most suitable spatial econometric specifications. Our results show the existence of relevant cross-border spillover effects of conflict events; and confirm that natural valuable resources are strong predictors of organized violence location. Moreover, we demonstrate that events concerning incompatibilities on government and/or territory are more strongly related to diamonds location, whereas events between no-state armed groups are indifferently connected to the location of both valuable resources.
C21|Of Trees and Monkeys. The evolution of technological specialization of European regions|The question about how regions develop and evolve along their productive and technological path is central in many scientific fields from international economics, to economic geography, from industrial economics to regional science. Within an evolutionary perspective, we believe that a region is most likely to develop new industries or new technologies, which are closer to its pre-existing specialization. Our research builds on an empirical stream of literature, started by Hausmann and Klinger (2007) and Hidalgo et al. (2007), aimed at tracing the evolution of industrial specialisation at the country level following the evolution of export portfolios. We refocus this line of analysis on the regional European technology/knowledge space along the research avenue started by Kogler et al. (2017). We aim at investigating the pattern and the evolution of regional specialisation in the EU in terms of the interaction of (i) endogenous processes of knowledge recombination and localised technological change, (ii) exogenous technological paradigm shifts and (iii) trans-regional spatial and technological spillovers and networking dynamics. More specifically, our paper maps the technological trajectories of 198 EU regions over the period 1986-2010 by using data on 121 patent sectors in the NUTS2 regions of the 11 most innovative EU countries, plus Switzerland and Norway. We map the knowledge space following two approaches: a micro level one, based on co-classification information contained in patent documents (Engelsman and Van Raan, 1992; Kogler et al., 2017), and a macro level, based on conditional co-specialisations of regions in the same patent classes (Hidalgo et al., 2007). These two representations of the knowledge space serve as a basis for understanding the evolution of regional technological specialization, measured in terms of the sector-region relative technological advantage (RTA), and for modelling its dynamics as a function of spatial, technological and socio-cognitive proximity. Preliminary results show that regional technological paths display a significant level of path dependence in, which the technological specialization is significantly shaped by both localised technological change and recombinant innovation. We also find evidence of local spillover spillovers induced by both geographic and technological proximity.
C21|The War in Europe: Economic Costs of the Ukrainian Conflict|With more than ten thousand casualties, the 2014 Ukrainian war between pro-Russian separatists and the government in the Donbass region, Ukraine's productive core, has taken a severe toll on the country. Using cross-country panel data over the period 1995-2017, this paper quantifies the short-term causal effects of the Donbass war on Ukraine's GDP. Results from the counterfactual estimation by the synthetic control method show that Ukraine's per capita GDP foregone due to the war amounts to 15.1% on average for 2013-2017. Separate analysis for the affected provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk indicate an average causal effect of 43% for 2013-2016. Confoundedness checks obtained by iteratively estimating synthetic controls on the pre-war period to account for previous Ukrainian-Russian disputes show robustness of the results.

First, we highlight the spatial heterogeneity of the participants using their zip code. Second, we use an econometric approach to assess the local determinants of the general participation and the participation on each of the four topics of the ""Grand débat"". The results show that the median standard of living and the education level are the main determinants of the general participation, whereas some specific variables explain the participation of each of the four topics.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
C21|Assessing Macroeconomic Tail Risk|What drives macroeconomic tail risk? To answer this question, we borrow a definition of macroeconomic risk from Adrian et al. (2019) by studying (left-tail) percentiles of the forecast distribution of GDP growth. We use local projections (Jordà, 2005) to assess how this measure of risk moves in response to economic shocks to the level of technology, monetary policy, and financial conditions. Furthermore, by studying various percentiles jointly, we study how the overall economic outlook-as characterized by the entire forecast distribution of GDP growth-shifts in response to shocks. We find that contractionary shocks disproportionately increase downside risk, independently of what shock we look at.

C21|A review of causal mediation analysis for assessing direct and indirect treatment effects|Mediation analysis aims at evaluating the causal mechanisms through which a treatment or intervention affects an outcome of interest. The goal is to disentangle the total treatment effect into an indirect effect operating through one or several observed intermediate variables, the so-called mediators, as well as a direct effect reflecting any impact not captured by the observed mediator(s). This paper reviews methodological advancements with a particular focus on applications in economics. It defines the parameters of interest, covers various identification strategies, e.g. based on control variables or instruments, and presents sensitivity checks. Furthermore, it discusses several extensions of the standard mediation framework, such as multivalued treatments, mismeasured mediators, and outcome attrition.
C21|An introduction to flexible methods for policy evaluation|This chapter covers different approaches to policy evaluation for assessing the causal effect of a treatment or intervention on an outcome of interest. As an introduction to causal inference, the discussion starts with the experimental evaluation of a randomized treatment. It then reviews evaluation methods based on selection on observables (assuming a quasi-random treatment given observed covariates), instrumental variables (inducing a quasi-random shift in the treatment), difference-in-differences and changes-in-changes (exploiting changes in outcomes over time), as well as regression discontinuities and kinks (using changes in the treatment assignment at some threshold of a running variable). The chapter discusses methods particularly suited for data with many observations for a flexible (i.e. semi- or nonparametric) modeling of treatment effects, and/or many (i.e. high dimensional) observed covariates by applying machine learning to select and control for covariates in a data-driven way. This is not only useful for tackling confounding by controlling for instance for factors jointly affecting the treatment and the outcome, but also for learning effect heterogeneities across subgroups defined upon observable covariates and optimally targeting those groups for which the treatment is most effective.
C21|A Substantial Discount on Ski Passes: A Synthetic Control Analysis|The synthetic control method serves as an appropriate and promising approach to do quantitative comparison research. However, the method is rarely used in the context of tourism. We fill this research gap by applying the method to the case of a Swiss mountain destination. Alpine tourist destinations have suffered from a declining demand in the last decade. Fewer tourist visit ski resorts. Consequently, the tourism industry in these destinations is under pressure to seek for solutions to face this falling demand. Saas-Fee, a Swiss mountain destination particularly hard hit by the decline of visitors has come up with an innovative offer: A substantial price discount on ski passes. In this present study, we aim to estimate the causal effect of the price discount in Saas-Fee. We adopt the synthetic control method to analyze the impact of the destinations’ policy on tourism demand. Further, we perform placebo tests on all units in our donor pool to evaluate the significance our results. Finally, we show how to assess the assumptions of the synthetic control method in the context of tourism.
C21|Direct and Indirect Effects based on Changes-in- Changes|We propose a novel approach for causal mediation analysis based on changes-in-changes assumptions restricting unobserved heterogeneity over time. This allows disentangling the causal effect of a binary treatment on a continuous outcome into an indirect effect operating through a binary intermediate variable (called mediator) and a direct effect running via other causal mechanisms. We identify average and quantile direct and indirect effects for various subgroups under the condition that the outcome is monotonic in the unobserved heterogeneity and that the distribution of the latter does not change over time conditional on the treatment and the mediator. We also provide a simulation study and an empirical application to the Jobs II programme.
C21|Animate the cluster or subsidize collaborative R&D? A multiple overlapping treatments approach to assess the impact of the French cluster policy|This paper examines the effectiveness of the French competitiveness cluster policy on participating SMEs in terms of innovation and economic performance. Using an original dataset, we construct different measures of treatment with crossover designs. The findings indicate substantial additionality effects on R&D and employment and weak or insignificant effects on other types of economic performance. While only adhering to clusters induces much stronger positive impacts on SMEs than only participating in R&D collaborative projects, the policy is most effective when the two treatments are simultaneously used. To achieve its impact on SMEs, the cluster policy should not overlook low-cost instruments such as animation actions and common services.
C21|What Fosters Firm-Level Labour Productivity In Eastern European And Central Asian Countries?|This study examines labour productivity performance and its determinants in Eastern European and Central Asian (EECA) firms using micro-level data. We find significant differences in labour productivity among members of the European Union in Eastern Europe and other Eastern European and Central Asian countries. We also confirm the important impact of foreign ownership, exporter status, and highly skilled workers on productivity levels. However, we reveal a non-linear relationship between firm age and their labour productivity. Additionally, significant differences in labour productivity determinants between the services and manufacturing are found. The productivity of service firms, unlike manufacturing firms, is much more sensitive to changes in productivity factors.
C21|Interaction matrix selection in spatial autoregressive models with an application to growth theory|The interaction matrix, or spatial weight matrix, is the fundamental tool to model cross-sectional interdependence between observations in spatial autoregressive models. However, it is most of the time not derived from theory, as it should be ideally, but chosen on an ad hoc basis. In this paper, we propose a modified version of the J test to formally select the interaction matrix. Our methodology is based on the application of the robust against unknown heteroskedasticity GMM estimation method, developed by Lin and Lee (2010). We then implement the testing procedure developed by Hagemann (2012) to overcome the decision problem inherent to non-nested models tests. An application of the testing procedure is presented for the Schumpeterian growth model with worldwide interactions developed by Ertur and Koch (2011) using three different types of interaction matrices: genealogic distance, linguistic distance and bilateral trade flows. We find that the interaction matrix based on trade flows is the most adequate.
C21|Les déterminants locaux de la participation numérique au Grand débat national : une analyse économétrique|"This paper analyses the local determinants of the electronic participation to the ""Grand débat"". First, we highlight the spatial heterogeneity of the participants using their zip code. Second, we use an econometric approach to assess the local determinants of the general participation and the participation on each of the four topics of the ""Grand débat"". The results show that the median standard of living and the education level are the main determinants of the general participation, whereas some specific variables explain the participation of each of the four topics."
C21|Does inequality matter for the consumption-wealth channel? Empirical evidence|This paper studies the heterogeneity of the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth based on French household surveys. This heterogeneity is driven by differences in both wealth composition and wealth levels. We find a decreasing marginal propensity to consume out of wealth across the wealth distribution for all net wealth components. The marginal propensity to consume out of financial assets tends to be higher compared with the effect of housing assets, except at the top of the wealth distribution. The marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth increases with debt pressure and depends on debt composition.
C21|Structural Change In City Systems Evolution: City Growth In Sweden 1810-2010|This paper analyses city system dynamics, based on a theoretical framework relating interaction potentials to agglomeration economies and density externalities. It employs new historical time series data on population size of cities in Sweden over two centuries (1810-2010) and introduces two schematic growth factors: (i) the intra-city potential and (ii) the extra-city potential located in in rings encircling each city. The first factor is measured by each city’s population size, while the second is a vector of distance discounted population size for each of a city’s urban rings. In this way we can explain a city’s growth as a function of its interaction potential inside the city, s well as inside the first, second hand third ring. A robust finding is that cities with large ring potentials follow different development paths than those with small ring potentials. We also find clear evidence of structural change between the two centuries (1810-1910 and 1910-2010. In the first period, city growth is positively impacted by the size of the intra-city potential, whereas the same potential dampens or reduces the growth in the second period. Moreover, the Ring I and Ring II potentials tend to switch from having negative growth stimulation in the first period to having positive stimulation in the second period. The regressions are checked for robustness by yielding consistent results when growth is measured as relative as well as absolute change.
C21|The impact of sanctions for young welfare recipients on transitions to work and wages and on dropping out|The reintegration of young welfare recipients into the labor market is a major policy goal in many European countries. In this context monitoring and sanctions are important policy tools. In this paper, we analyze the impact of strict sanctions on job search outcomes for young welfare recipients in Germany. The German benefit system is characterized by harsh sanctions for this group. Strict sanctions effectively take away the benefits for three months if young welfare recipients do not comply with their job search requirements. We jointly analyze the impact of these sanctions on job search outcomes and on dropping out of the labor force based on administrative data on a large inflow sample of young male jobseekers into welfare. We estimate multivariate duration models taking selection based on unobservables into account. Our results indicate that there is a trade off between an increased job entry rate and an increased withdrawal from the labor force as well as lower entry wages. Sanctions increase the probability of finding a job, but these jobs go along with lower earnings. Moreover, sanctions significantly increase the probability of dropping out.
C21|The relationship between property transaction prices, turnover rates and buyers' and sellers' reservation price distributions|This paper analyzes the relationship between movements in property transaction prices and movements in the underlying reservation price distributions of buyers and sellers and how these movements are linked to time varying turnover rate. A main conclusion in previous research is that transaction prices lag changes in buyers’ reservation price distribution and that an index tracking transaction prices is less volatile than an index tracking buyer reserves. We show that our less restrictive model of search and price formation reverses the volatility result in previous papers in realistic scenarios, i.e., transaction prices may be more volatile than underlying buyer reserves. We model transaction prices and turnover rates as functions of the moments of buyers’ and sellers’ reservation price distributions, the search intensity and the average bargaining power among buyers and sellers respectively. We derive the probability density function of transaction prices as a function of these parameters and hence a Maximum-likelihood estimator of the parameters, which serves as a new method of estimating indexes tracking movements in reservation price distributions from transaction data. We perform simulations where we show that the Maximum-likelihood estimator works as intended.
C21|Unemployed or Disabled? Disability Screening and Labor Market Outcomes of Youths|This paper examines the effect of being granted temporary disability insurance (TDI), as opposed to a non-health related benefit, on later labor market outcomes of youths who are seeking temporary income support from the state. In Norway, there has been a development over time towards a more lenient screening to TDI, and this development has been more pronounced in some municipalities than in others. Using local screening leniency as an instrument for TDI receipt, I find that being granted TDI benefits significantly reduces later labor market attachment of youths whose benefit receipt would differ according to their municipality of residence, and the year of entry to the benefit system.
C21|Intended and unintended effects of public incentives for innovation. Quasi-experimental evidence from Italy|This paper provides an extensive empirical evaluation of a policy introduced in Italy at the end of 2012 to incentivize young innovative start-up firms. Using a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) we estimate the causal effects of the policy on the firms’ share of intangible assets, turnover, number of employees, and number of partners. Our results indicate that two years after its implementation the policy was effective only in increasing the number of partners, thus attracting private investments, but failed, at least in the short run, in boosting innovation or increasing employment. It follows that the new investors generated by the policy might have been attracted only by the tax benefit and had little interest in innovation.
C21|Breaking Ties: Regression Discontinuity Design Meets Market Design|Centralized school assignment algorithms must distinguish between applicants with the same preferences and priorities. This is done with randomly assigned lottery numbers, nonlottery tie-breakers like test scores, or both. The New York City public high school match illustrates the latter, using test scores, grades, and interviews to rank applicants to screened schools, combined with lottery tie-breaking at unscreened schools. We show how to identify causal effects of school attendance in such settings. Our approach generalizes regression discontinuity designs to allow for multiple treatments and multiple running variables, some of which are randomly assigned. Lotteries generate assignment risk at screened as well as unscreened schools. Centralized assignment also identifies screened school effects away from screened school cutoffs. These features of centralized assignment are used to assess the predictive value of New York City’s school report cards. Grade A schools improve SAT math scores and increase the likelihood of graduating, though by less than OLS estimates suggest. Selection bias in OLS estimates is egregious for Grade A screened schools.
C21|Partial Identification of Population Average and Quantile Treatment Effects in Observational Data under Sample Selection|We partially identify population treatment effects in observational data under sample selection, without the benefit of random treatment assignment. We provide bounds both for the average and the quantile population treatment effects, combining assumptions for the selected and the non-selected subsamples. We show how different assumptions help narrow identification regions, and illustrate our methods by partially identifying the effect of maternal education on the 2015 PISA math test scores in Brazil. We find that while sample selection increases considerably the uncertainty around the effect of maternal education, it is still possible to calculate informative identification regions.
C21|Shaping Individual Preferences for Social Protection: The Case of Platform Workers|Workers who perform their occupations through platforms are becoming an increasing share of the labour force. The debate is polarized between those arguing for platforms as an instrument to increase flexibility and labor force participation, and those who see it as a further mechanism to increase Non Standard Work (NSW). This debate is policy relevant because in either case, platform participation is associated to a difference in terms of willingness to contribute to the social security system. Nevertheless, the evidence is scant because we lack reliable data sources. In this contribution, we use a dedicated survey to estimate Willingness to Pay (WTP) for social security and estimate the causal impact of platform participation using a selection on observable strategy. We found that platform workers are less disposed to contribute to social security, although perception of accessibility and adequacy are not affected. Results are robust to specifications and multiple hypotheses testing. *** Los trabajadores que realizan sus ocupaciones a través de plataformas se están convirtiendo en una parte cada vez mayor de la fuerza laboral. El debate está polarizado entre los que abogan por las plataformas como instrumento para aumentar la flexibilidad y la participación de la fuerza laboral, y los que las ven como un mecanismo más para aumentar el trabajo no estándar. Este debate es relevante para la política porque, en cualquier caso, la participación en la plataforma está asociada a una diferencia en términos de voluntad de contribuir al sistema de seguridad social. Sin embargo, las pruebas son escasas porque carecemos de fuentes de datos fiables. En esta contribución, utilizamos una encuesta dedicada para estimar la Disposición de Pago de la seguridad social y estimamos el impacto causal de la participación en la plataforma utilizando una estrategia de selección por variables observables. Encontramos que los trabajadores de las plataformas están menos dispuestos a contribuir a la seguridad social, aunque la percepción de accesibilidad y adecuación no se ve afectada. Los resultados son robustos a las especificaciones y a las pruebas de hipótesis múltiples.
C21|Challenges in predicting poverty trends using survey to survey imputation. Experiences from Malawi|Poverty in low-income countries is usually measured with large and infrequent household surveys. A challenge is to find methods to measure poverty more frequently. The objective of this study is to test a method for predicting poverty, based upon a statistical model utilizing consumption surveys and light annual surveys. A decade of poverty predictions and regular poverty estimates in Malawi provides us with a unique real-life experience to better understand the suitability of such approaches to monitor trends in poverty. The analysis from Malawi suggests that a modelling approach works per se, given that information on the household’s demographic composition is included in the model. The main challenge when predicting onto other surveys seems to be related to comparability between the surveys. Differences in implementation, questionnaire design and survey sample size are aspects that may contribute to incomparability of data collected between the surveys.
C21|Heterogeneous Effects of Job Displacement on Earnings|This paper considers how the effect of job displacement varies across different individuals. In particular, our interest centers on features of the distribution of the individual-level effect of job displacement. Identifying features of this distribution is particularly challenging - e.g., even if we could randomly assign workers to be displaced or not, many of the parameters that we consider would not be point identified. We exploit our access to panel data, and our approach relies on comparing outcomes of displaced workers to outcomes the same workers would have experienced if they had not been displaced and if they maintained the same rank in the distribution of earnings as they had before they were displaced. Using data from the Displaced Workers Survey, we find that displaced workers earn about $157 per week less than they would have earned if they had not been displaced. We also find that there is substantial heterogeneity. We estimate that 42% of workers have higher earnings than they would have had if they had not been displaced and that a large fraction of workers have substantially lower earnings than the average effect of displacement. Finally, we also document major differences in the distribution of the effect of job displacement across education levels, sex, age, and counterfactual earnings levels. Throughout the paper, we rely heavily on quantile regression. First, we use quantile regression as a flexible (yet feasible) first step estimator of conditional distributions and quantile functions that our main results build on. We also use quantile regression to study how covariates affect the distribution of the individual-level effect of job displacement.
C21|Decomposing Immigrant Differences in Physical and Mental Health: A 'Beyond the Mean' Analysis|This paper takes a â€˜beyond the meanâ€™ perspective on physical and mental health differences between natives and immigrants and among immigrants themselves. We test the â€˜healthy immigrant effectâ€™ (HIE) and assess its deterioration, focusing on the evolution of the entire health distributions over time. Indeed, mean differ- ences can have very different consequences in terms of health care costs and health inequalities, according to the underlying differences at the top and at the bottom of the health distribution. Using unconditional quantile regressions on data from the Italian Health Condition Survey, we find a HIE for both physical and mental health, which is mainly due to large differences in the lowest quartiles. Detailed decompositions show that observed characteristics (such as age, gender, and occu- pation) are associated with better health for both natives and long-stay immigrants compared to short-stay immigrants. At the bottom of both physical and mental health distributions, these gains are more than offset by the negative impact of some unobserved characteristics. Our results point towards the need of improving the data collection on health determinants, especially among immigrants, in order to uncover what is behind the unobserved component.
C21|Anatomy of Regional Price Differentials: Evidence From Micro Price Data|Our paper uses micro price data collected from Germany’s Consumer Price Index to compile a highly disaggregated regional price index for the 402 counties and cities of Germany. We introduce a multi-stage version of the weighted Country-Product-Dummy method. The unique quality of our price data allows us to depart from previous spatial price comparisons and to compare only exactly identical products. We find that the price levels are spatially autocorrelated and largely driven by the cost of housing. The price level in the most expensive region is about 27 percent higher than in the cheapest region.
C21|Residential Property Price Indexes: Spatial Coordinates versus Neighbourhood Dummy Variables|The paper addresses the following question: can satisfactory residential property price indexes be constructed using hedonic regression techniques where location effects are modeled using local neighbourhood dummy variables or is it necessary to use spatial coordinates to model location effects. Hill and Scholz (2018) addressed this question and found, using their hedonic regression model, that it was not necessary to use spatial coordinates to obtain satisfactory property price indexes for Sydney. However, their hedonic regression model did not estimate separate land and structure price indexes for residential properties. In order to construct national balance sheet estimates, it is necessary to have separate land and structure price indexes. The present paper addresses the Hill and Scholz question in the context of providing satisfactory residential land price indexes. The spatial coordinate model used in the present paper is a modification of Colwellâ€™s (1998) spatial interpolation method. The modification can be viewed as a general nonparametric method for estimating a function of two variables.
C21|Knocking on Employment´s Door: Internships and Job Attainment|Undergraduate internships have gained popularity among students, universities, government and firms since the creation of the European Higher Education Area. However, empirical research on the relationship between internships and labour market performance of graduates is still scarce, particularly in Spain. This paper examines whether internships improve the job attainment in the short run (first employment after graduation) and in the medium /long term (employment four years later). We use the first Spanish University Graduate Job Placement Survey (2014) to estimate linear probability models and probit models. A novel econometric technique is also implemented to evaluate the sensitivity of our findings to omitted variable bias. We disentangle the internship effect on: (i) the speed to find the first job; (ii) the vertical, horizontal and skill/competence matching with the first job; (iii) being employed in the medium/ long term; (iv) the vertical and horizontal matching with the current employment; and (v) wage quintiles of the current job. Our results show that the internship experience smooths the university-to-work transition for Spanish graduates. Although internships effects on employment do not vanish in the medium/long term, there is weak evidence of positive effects on matching or wages four years after graduation.
C21|What Time Use Surveys Can (And Cannot) Tell Us about Labor Supply|It has been widely acknowledged that the measurement of labor supply in the Current Population Survey (CPS) and other conventional microeconomic surveys has nonclassical measurement error, which will bias the estimates of crucial parameters in labor economics, such as labor supply elasticity. Time diary studies, such as the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), only have accurate measurement of hours worked on a single day, hence the weekly hours worked are unobserved. Despite the missing data problem, we provide several consistent estimators of the parameters in weekly labor supply equation using the information in the time use surveys. The consistency of our estimators does not require more conditions beyond those for a usual two stage least square (2SLS) estimator when the true weekly hours worked are observed. We also show that it is impossible to recover the weekly number of hours worked or its distribution function from time use surveys like the ATUS. In our empirical application we find considerable evidence of nonclassical measurement error in the hours worked in the CPS, and illustrate the consequences of using mismeasured weekly hours worked in empirical studies.
C21|Testing for Attrition Bias in Field Experiments|We approach attrition in field experiments with baseline outcome data as an identification problem in a panel model. A systematic review of the literature indicates that there is no consensus on how to test for attrition bias. We establish identifying assumptions for treatment effects for both the respondent subpopulation and the study population. We then derive their sharp testable implications on the baseline outcome distribution and propose randomization procedures to test them. We demonstrate that the most commonly used test does not control size in general when internal validity holds. Simulations and applications illustrate the empirical relevance of our analysis.
C21|Do local public expenditures on sports facilities affect sports participation in Germany?|This paper analyzes the effect of local public expenditures on sports facilities on sports participation in Germany. To this end, we construct a new database containing public expenditures at the municipality level and link this information with individual level data. We form locally weighted averages of expenditures based on geographic distances since people also benefit from expenditures of neighboring municipalities. We analyze how effects of sports facility expenditures change with different expenditures levels (“dose-response relationship”) and find no effect of local public expenditures on sports facilities on the probability to practice sports. These findings are robust across different age groups and municipality sizes.
C21|Does the Estimation of the Propensity Score by Machine Learning Improve Matching Estimation? The Case of Germany's Programmes for Long Term Unemployed|"Matching-type estimators using the propensity score are the major workhorse in active labour market policy evaluation. This work investigates if machine learning algorithms for estimating the propensity score lead to more credible estimation of average treatment effects on the treated using a radius matching framework. Considering two popular methods, the results are ambiguous: We find that using LASSO based logit models to estimate the propensity score delivers more credible results than conventional methods in small and medium sized high dimensional datasets. However, the usage of Random Forests to estimate the propensity score may lead to a deterioration of the performance in situations with a low treatment share. The application reveals a positive effect of the training programme on days in employment for long-term unemployed. While the choice of the ""first stage"" is highly relevant for settings with low number of observations and few treated, machine learning and conventional estimation becomes more similar in larger samples and higher treatment shares."
C21|Hidden Networks within the European Parliament: a Spatial Econometrics Approach|The European political spectrum can be modelled as a two-dimensional space, whose interpretation has been investigated in the spatial voting literature by regression analysis. However, data on legislators' positions display spatial clustering that is not explained by the standard models. We account for correlation among legislators by modelling spatial dependence across countries, using a new sets of geopolitical and cultural metrics. We confirm the well known result that the first dimension of the European political space is mainly explained by the Members of European Parliament's ideological position on a left-right scale, although correlation across legislators cannot be neglected. We show that spatial correlation plays instead a central role when interpreting the more controversial second dimension of the political spectrum. The most relevant proximity measures are based on geographical proximity, institutional similarities and on three cultural metrics related to which issues play a central role in the political debate.
C21|Civil War and International Migration from Nepal: Evidence from a Spatial Durbin Model|A growing literature studies microeconomic effects of war on human capital formation and labour market activity. A common research design is to relate spatially aggregated data on conflict rates at the first or second sub-national level to more spatially disaggregated survey data on outcomes of interest. Several studies focus on Nepal’s civil war, that ran for a decade from 1996, and use conflict-related deaths in Nepal’s 75 districts (the second sub-national level). Variation in the conflict-related death rate within Nepal’s districts is more than three times higher than the variation between districts. Consequently, using district-level conflict data creates a measurement error on the right-hand side of regression models, making the conflict seem more widespread, and biases econometric estimates of conflict impacts. Prior studies also ignore spatial spillovers, where local conflict may affect outcomes not only locally but also in surrounding areas. To deal with these biases, we use measures of conflict intensity for Nepal’s 3982 localities in a spatial Durbin model of the change in emigration rates between the 2001 and 2011. We distinguish emigration to India, which is informal and long-standing, from emigration to other countries that is a recent development for Nepal and requires formal recruitment and visa processes. Higher local conflict intensity is associated with slower local growth in the emigration rate between 2001 and 2011. It is mainly indirect impacts, based on the spatial lags, which matter and it is emigration to destinations other than India that was deterred by the conflict. The estimated impacts would be substantially distorted if conflict intensity was measured at the more aggregated, district-level, as in the existing literature.
C21|Enhancing customer retention in case of service elimination? An empirical investigation in telecommunications| Generally, service industries require a rapid innovation of service portfolios to gain and maintain a competitive advantage. In this context, service elimination is a tool of portfolio renewal, where customer retention is a strategic priority for companies. This is especially so because service elimination usually causes higher churn rates than an average churn in telecommunications. Thus, customer retention is seen as a major aspect in enhancing service elimination success. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors that increase customer churn in the case of service elimination. We use one of the three Hungarian telecommunication operator’s databases containing usage data three months before and after service elimination in the course of a major service package reform. Contract-related information and demographics of 10 065 customers are used to differentiate between high and low churn factors, taking care of a possible sample selection problem. The results show that in the course of service elimination there is a significant positive relationship between price decrease, tenure, interaction intensity on the one, and customer retention on the other side. Besides these, demographics (age and residence) also play an important role in explaining churn rates during service elimination. Furthermore, we find that a higher monthly fee after elimination increases the customer’s usage intensity. This research aims to contribute both to service elimination, as well as to customer retention literature, by hierarchical modeling of retention and usage during service elimination with practical implications for decision-makers in rapidly innovating telecommunication markets.
C21|Dealing with Endogenous Shocks in Dynamic Friendship Network|Different types of shocks, or the treatment of one of the players in a specific network, may influence not only the future performance of themselves but also affect their network connections. It is crucial to explore the behaviour of the whole network in response to such an event. This paper focuses on the cases of endogenously formed shock. The logic used in the peer effect literature is adopted to develop the dynamic model and accounts for the endogeneity of the shock. The model allows us to predict the endogenous part of the shock and use the remaining unexpected component to estimate the effect of the shock on the changes in the performance of network connections. The identification conditions for effect are derived, and the consistent estimation procedure is proposed.
C21|Endogenous Shocks in Social Networks: Exam Failures and Friends' Future Performance|Exam failures of the students in a specific network may influence not only the future performance of the student but also all students from their friendship networks, affecting the overall cohort's performance. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how the whole network responses to failure. The difficulty of such analysis is incorporated in the probability of the failures being highly endogenous. In this paper, I am applying the novel identification and estimation approach to deal with such endogeneity. I am exploring the dynamic data on the students' networks in HSE, Nizhniy Novgorod. The results suggest that, on average, the exam failure of the friend have a negative effect on future performance.

C21|Human capital consequences of missing out on a grammar school education|What is the value added of grammar schools? This paper disentangles the effect of selection into an academic rather than a vocational track from that of individual background on long-term human capital. Identification relies on a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, using entry test scores for grammar schools, selective secondary schools in England, and estimating discontinuities in school assignment directly from the data. We find that for the marginal admitted student, grammar attendance positively affects educational attainment, likely due to higher-ability peers, while adult labour market outcomes and health are not affected. Observed differences in human capital by school type can largely be traced back to background.
C21|Explaining the causal effect of adherence to medication on cholesterol through the marginal patient|This paper investigates the relation between adherence to prescribed medication and reduction of cholesterol in Italy, by taking into account the possible sorting of patients into treatment and the heterogeneity of the effect. As predicted by a theoretical model, I find that patients who benefit most from medication are more likely to adhere to prescribed regime than those who benefit least. These results are used to study the effects of three hypothetical policies that aim at increasing the share of patients adherent to prescribed medication: one is directed towards patients, one towards physicians, and one is a policy mix. For each policy, the observable characteristics of patients switched into treatment are described. Although the most effective policy is directed towards patients, the policies differ substantially with respect to the population affected. Therefore, a less effective policy that targets best the desired population may be preferred to the most effective policy. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that even the most expensive policy would be cost-effective.
C21|Regression Discontinuity with Integer Running Variable and Non-Integer Cutoff: Dental Care Program Effect on Expenditure|In regression discontinuity (RD), the treatment is determined by a continuous running variable G crossing a known cutoff c or not. However, often G is observed only as a rounded-down integer S (e.g., birth year observed instead of birth date), and c is not an integer. In this case, the â€œcutoff sampleâ€ (the observations with the same S value around c) cannot be used, because it is not clear whether their G actually crossed c or not. This paper shows that if the distribution of the measurement error e â‰¡ G âˆ’ S is specified, then despite non-integer c, the cutoff sample can be used fruitfully in estimating the treatment effect and in testing for the distributional assumption on e. Particularly, there are good reasons to believe that e is uniform on [0,1], not least because e is close to a popular way how pseudo uniform random numbers are generated in simulation studies. Also, whereas two-step estimation has been proposed in the RD literature, we show that the treatment effect can be estimated with single-step OLS/IVE as in typical RD with G observed. A simulation study and an empirical analysis for effects of a dental care support program on dental expenditure are provided.
C21|Estimating and Decomposing Conditional Average Treatment Effects: The Smoking Ban in England|We develop a practical method for estimating and decomposing conditional average treatment effects using locally-weighted regressions. We illustrate with an application to the smoking ban in England using a regression discontinuity design, based on Health Survey for England data. We estimate average treatment effects conditional on socioeconomic status and decompose these effects by smoking location. Results show, the ban had no effect on the level of active smoking, but significantly reduced average exposure to second-hand smoke among non-smokers by 1.38 hours per week. Our method reveals a complex relationship between socioeconomic status and the effect on passive smoking. Decomposition analysis shows that these effects stem primarily from exposure reductions in pubs, but also from workplace exposure reductions for high socioeconomic status individuals.
C21|Exploiting ergodicity in forecasts of corporate profitability|Theory suggests that competition tends to equalize profit rates through the process of capital reallocation, and numerous studies have confirmed that profit rates are indeed persistent and mean-reverting. Recent empirical evidence further shows that fluctuations in the profitability of surviving corporations are well approximated by a stationary Laplace distribution. Here we show that a parsimonious diffusion process of corporate profitability that accounts for all three features of the data achieves better out-of-sample forecasting performance across different time horizons than previously suggested time series and panel data models. As a consequence of replicating the empirical distribution of profit rate fluctuations, the model prescribes a particular strength or speed for the mean-reversion of all profit rates, which leads to superior forecasts of individual time series when we exploit information from the cross-sectional collection of firms. The new model should appeal to managers, analysts, investors and other groups of corporate stakeholders who are interested in accurate forecasts of profitability. To the extent that mean-reversion in profitability is the source of predictable variation in earnings, our approach can also be used in forecasts of earnings and is thus useful for firm valuation.
C21|Anatomy of regional price differentials: Evidence from micro price data|Over the last three decades the supply of economic statistics has vastly improved. Unfortunately, statistics on regional price levels (sub-national purchasing power parities) have been exempt from this positive trend, even though they are indispensable for meaningful spatial comparisons of regional output, income, wages, productivity, standards of living, and poverty. To improve the situation, our paper demonstrates that a highly disaggregated and reliable regional price index can be compiled from data that already exist. We use the micro price data that have been collected for Germany's Consumer Price Index in May 2016. For the computation we introduce a multi-stage version of the Country-Product-Dummy method. The unique quality of our price data set allows us to depart from previous spatial price comparisons and to compare only exactly identical products. We find that the price levels of the 402 counties and cities of Germany are largely driven by the cost of housing and to a much lesser degree by the prices of goods and services. The overall price level in the most expensive region, Munich, is about 27 percent higher than in the cheapest region. Our results also reveal strong spatial autocorrelation.
C21|The effects of the eurosystem's APP on euro area bank lending: Letting different data speak|We study the implications of the Eurosystem's expanded Asset Purchase Programme (APP) for the bank lending business of euro area banks with euro area non-financial corporations (NFCs) using microeconometric matching techniques. Based on confidential bank-level data on quantitative balance sheet items and interest rates as well as on qualitative survey responses to the Eurosystem's Bank Lending Survey, we identify the exposure of banks to the APP and corresponding effects on loan growth. We find that the APP was effective in stimulating the lending activity with NFCs for a subset of relatively sound banks. At the same time, our results show that there is a non-negligible number of banks with less healthy balance sheets which could not transfer the APP stimulus into more lending. Instead, such banks appear to have used the APP stimulus for consolidating their balance sheets, thereby also reducing their lending business with NFCs. This confirms the importance of accounting for the large degree of heterogeneity in the euro area banking sector in analyses of the effectiveness of monetary policy measures.
C21|The impact of election information shocks on populist party preferences: Evidence from Germany|Despite controversial debates about the social acceptability of its nationalist program, the rightwing populist AfD has recently entered all state parliaments as well as the federal parliament in Germany. Although professed AfD voters faced a likely risk of social stigmatization, electoral support followed a clear upward trend. In order to explain these dynamics, we analyze the impact of information shocks with respect to aggregate-level AfD support on individual party choices. Unexpectedly high aggregate support for a populist party may indicate a higher social acceptance of its platform and reduce the social desirability bias in self-reported party preferences. Consequently, the likelihood to reveal an AfD preference increases. We test this mechanism in an event-study approach, exploiting quasi-random variation in survey interviews conducted closely around German state elections. We define election information shocks as deviations of actual AfD vote shares from pre-election polls and link these to the individual disposition to report an AfD preference in subsequent survey interviews. Our results suggest that exposure to higher-than expected AfD support significantly increases the individual probability to report an AfD vote intention by up to 3 percentage points.
C21|Marshallian vs Jacobs Effects: Which One Is Stronger? Evidence for Russia Unemployment Dynamics|This paper is devoted to the study of diversification and specialization influence on one of the main indicators of Russian labour market, the unemployment growth. The purpose of the work is to find out which effects dominate in the Russian regions, Marshallian or Jacobs, and whether this predominance is stable for different time intervals. The following hypotheses were empirically tested: 1) the dependence of the unemployment rate on the degree of concentration or diversification is non-monotonic due to possible overlapping effects of urbanization and localization; 2) the influence of the degree of concentration or diversification on the level of unemployment depends on the time period. To test these hypotheses nonparametric additive models with spatial effects were used. Both hypotheses found empirical confirmation. It was shown that in Russia, depending on the period, various effects dominated: in 2008-2010, and 2013-2016 Marshallian effects predominated, while in 2010-2013, Jacobs effects dominated.
C21|What Is the Value Added by Using Causal Machine Learning Methods in a Welfare Experiment Evaluation?|Recent studies have proposed causal machine learning (CML) methods to estimate conditional average treatment effects (CATEs). In this study, I investigate whether CML methods add value compared to conventional CATE estimators by re-evaluating Connecticut's Jobs First welfare experiment. This experiment entails a mix of positive and negative work incentives. Previous studies show that it is hard to tackle the effect heterogeneity of Jobs First by means of CATEs. I report evidence that CML methods can provide support for the theoretical labor supply predictions. Furthermore, I document reasons why some conventional CATE estimators fail and discuss the limitations of CML methods.
C21|Erreichbarkeit von Kindergärten in Deutschland: Kennzahlen und Karten|Kindergärten sind ein wichtiger Teilbereich der Daseinsvorsorge, da sie als Einrichtungen der frühkindlichen Bildung sowie der Kindertagesbetreuung, die Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf erleichtern beziehungsweise zum Teil sogar erst ermöglichen. Um eine Datengrundlage für die Diskussion zur Erreichbarkeit von Kindergärten zu schaffen, wurde deren regionale Erreichbarkeit anhand des Thünen-Erreichbarkeitsmodells analysiert. Die Ergebnisse geben kleinräumig und flächendeckend einen Hinweis darauf, wo in Deutschland die Erreichbarkeit von Kindergärten heute problematisch ist und wo Erreichbarkeitsprobleme auftreten würden, wenn der nächste Kindergarten geschlossen würde. Das Erreichbarkeitsmodell zeigt, dass aktuell Kindergärten mit dem PKW in allen Bundesländern und Typen ländlicher Räume gut erreichbar sind. Keiner benötigt dazu mehr als 15 Minuten. Zu Fuß können deutschlandweit immerhin noch ca. 81 % der Bevölkerung fußläufig innerhalb von 15 Minuten einen Kindergarten erreichen. Sowohl innerhalb der Länder als auch zwischen den Regionstypen variiert der Prozentsatz der Bevölkerung, der fußläufig in 15 Minuten den nächsten Kindergarten erreichen kann, stark. Zum Teil benötigt ein relativ großer Prozentsatz zu Fuß sogar deutlich mehr als 30 Minuten.
C21|Multiple Testing and the Distributional Effects of Accountability Incentives in Education|Economic theory that underlies many empirical microeconomic applications predicts that treatment responses depend on individuals’ characteristics and location on the outcome distribution. Using data from a large-scale Pakistani school report card experiment, we consider tests for treatment effect heterogeneity that make corrections for multiple testing to avoid an overestimation of positive treatment effects. These tests uncover evidence of policy-relevant heterogeneous effects from information provision on child test scores. Further, our analysis reinforces the importance of preventing the inflation of false positive conclusions since over 65% of the estimated statistically significant quantile treatment effects become insignificant once these corrections are applied.
C21|Employment and performance effects of circular economy innovations|Circular economy (CE) describes an economic concept that aims at saving resources by minimizing the use of material and energy over the entire life-cycle or products, including repair, reuse and recycling. CE innovations help to realize the goals of a sustainable development and target both the environmental, economic and social dimensions of sustainability. This paper looks at the economic and social dimensions by investigating the performance and employment effects of CE innovations at the firm level. CE innovations such as the reduction of energy and material consumption or the recycling of waste, water or material may lead to cost savings which in turn can increase the competitiveness of the firm and raise demand for a firm's products. Our econometric analysis uses data of two waves of the German part of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS). The performance effects of CE innovations measured by the financial standing of a firm and by turnover growth tend to be positive. The results of quantile regressions show that this is also the case for employment effects.
C21|Size matters? Impact evaluation of business development grants on SME performance|Many international organisations emphasize the need of public grant schemes evaluations. An evaluation provides the opportunity to assess the socio-economic impact achieved by the grant and allows for a refinement of such policy instruments in order to make public funding more effective in achieving the objectives. In this paper, we investigate the effects of a business development grant scheme. More specifically we question whether firmsâ€™ performance measures increased after participating in this grant scheme. Methodically, we match grant receiving firms with grant non-receivers and estimate the average treatment effect on the treated using a two way fixed effects regression. Our results point towards a positive effect of the grant scheme, which is particularly evident for firms of smaller size. Our estimated dose-response functions show that the share of grant amount in firm profits needs to be high enough for the grants to be effective. According to back-of-the envelope analysis, benefits outweigh the direct scheme costs.
C21|Evaluation of Language Training Programs in Luxembourg using Principal Stratification|In a world increasingly globalized, multiple language skills can create more employment opportunities. Several countries include language training programs in active labor market programs for the unemployed. We analyze the effects of a language training program on the re-employment probability and hourly wages of the unemployed simultaneously, using highquality administrative data from Luxembourg. We address selection into training by exploiting the rich administrative information available, and account for the complication that wages are “truncated” by unemployment by adopting a principal stratification framework. Estimation is undertaken with a mixture model likelihood-based approach. To improve inference, we use the individual’s hours worked as a secondary outcome and a stochastic dominance assumption. These two features considerably ameliorate the multimodality problem commonly encountered in mixture models. We also conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the unconfoundedness assumption employed. Our results strongly suggest a positive effect (of up to 12.7 percent) of the language training programs on the re-employment probability, but no effects on wages for those who are observed employed regardless of training participation. It appears that, in the context of an open and multilingual economy, language training improve employability but the language skills acquired are not sufficiently rewarded to be reflected in higher wages.
C21|The Impact of Migration on Family Left Behind: Estimation in Presence of Intra-Household Selection of Migrants|This paper reexamines the literature on the impact of migration on household members left behind at origin. The empirical problem previous studies address is the self-selection of households into migration, i.e. the endogenous decision as to whether or not send a migrant. Yet, the subsequent selection of which family members migrate and which stay behind generates additional identification problems that have remained largely ignored. To tackle this second form of selectivity within the households, I model the behavior of families using latent stratification and potential outcome (Imbens and Angrist, 1994; Rubin, 1974). I show that the point-identification of the causal impact of migration requires strong behavioral assumptions rarely satisfied even with ideal experimental data. As a practical solution, I derive non parametric bounds under different sets of weaker assumptions. Using Mexican panel data, I show that standard estimates ignoring the intra-household selection into migration may suffer from substantial bias.
C21|A Field Experiment on Labor Market Speeddates for Unemployed Workers|We conduct a field experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of labor market speeddates where unemployed workers meet temporary employment agencies. Our analysis shows that participation in such events increases immediate job finding by 6-7 percentage points. In the subsequent months, employment effects diminish again, suggesting that vacancies mediated through temporary employment agencies have no long-lasting effect on employment prospects. While the intervention is cost effective for the UI administration, higher labor earnings of treated job seekers do not fully compensate for the decline in benefit payments. Additional survey evidence shows that speeddate participation increases job search motivation and reduces reservation wages.
C21|Vote Influence in Group Decision-Making: The Changing Role of Justices' Peers on the Supreme Court|We consider the voting behavior of Supreme Court Justices, finding evidence of co-dependencies in their votes. Coincident with changes in the party imbalance of the Court over time, sharp discontinuities in these dependencies are evident. Overall, the patterns suggest a tradeoff between co-dependencies around political affiliations and individual ideologies, with more-equal party representation on the Court encouraging greater party awareness in Justice voting, and less-equal party representation allowing Justices across party lines but with similar ideologies to inform each other's votes.
C21|A Correction for Regression Discontinuity Designs with Group-Specific Mismeasurement of the Running Variable|"When the running variable in a regression discontinuity (RD) design is measured with error, identification of the local average treatment effect of interest will typically fail. While the form of this measurement error varies across applications, in many cases the measurement error structure is heterogeneous across different groups of observations. We develop a novel measurement error correction procedure capable of addressing heterogeneous mismeasurement structures by leveraging auxiliary information. We also provide adjusted asymptotic variance and standard errors that take into consideration the variability introduced by the estimation of nuisance parameters, and honest confidence intervals that account for potential misspecification. Simulations provide evidence that the proposed procedure corrects the bias introduced by heterogeneous measurement error and achieves empirical coverage closer to nominal test size than ""naïve"" alternatives. Two empirical illustrations demonstrate that correcting for measurement error can either reinforce the results of a study or provide a new empirical perspective on the data."
C21|Three Revolutions of the Modern Era|The emergence and evolution of modern science since the 17th century has led to three major breakthroughs in the human condition. The first, the Industrial Revolution, started in the late 18th century and is based chiefly on developments associated with the rise of the natural sciences. The second, the Demographic Revolution, began in the latter half of the 19th century and is largely the result of progress in the life sciences. The third is a Happiness Revolution that commenced in the late 20th century and is the outgrowth of the social sciences. The first two revolutions, both familiar concepts, are summarized briefly; this paper develops the rationale for the third, the Happiness Revolution. It also notes the implications of this perspective for the interpretation of international cross-section studies.
C21|Estimating Selection Models without Instrument with Stata|This article presents the eqregsel command for implementing the estimation and bootstrap inference of sample selection models via extremal quantile regression. The command estimates a semiparametric sample selection model without instrument or large support regressor, and outputs the point estimates of the homogenous linear coefficients, their bootstrap standard errors, as well as the p-value for a specification test.
C21|Does the estimation of the propensity score by machine learning improve matching estimation? The case of Germany’s programmes for long term unemployed|Matching-type estimators using the propensity score are the major workhorse in active labour market policy evaluation. This work investigates if machine learning algorithms for estimating the propensity score lead to more credible estimation of average treatment effects on the treated using a radius matching framework. Considering two popular methods, the results are ambiguous: We find that using LASSO based logit models to estimate the propensity score delivers more credible results than conventional methods in small and medium sized high dimensional datasets. However, the usage of Random Forests to estimate the propensity score may lead to a deterioration of the performance in situations with a low treatment share. The application reveals a positive effect of the training programme on days in employment for longterm unemployed. While the choice of the “first stage” is highly relevant for settings with low number of observations and few treated, machine learning and conventional estimation becomes more similar in larger samples and higher treatment shares.
C21|Cost-Effective Public Daycare in a Low-Income Economy Benefits Children and Mothers|This paper evaluates the impacts of a public program that introduced access to part-time childcare centers for children younger than four years of age in poor urban areas in Nicaragua. We explore the effects of this program on several measures of children's and parental outcomes. Our identification strategy exploits the original randomization and the distance to the centers, using Instrumental Variables (IV) and Marginal Treatment Effects (MTE) methods to tackle imperfect compliance with the original treatment assignments. We present a theoretical model to rationalize our IV assumptions. We find a positive impact of 0.35 standard deviations on the personal-social domain of a widely used development test, and an impact of 14 percentage points on mothers' work participation. Our results are robust to different econometric specifications. We also find suggestive evidence that quality greatly matters for the impacts at the child level, but not at the mother level.
C21|Employment Effect of Innovation|The present paper estimates and decomposes the employment effect of innovation by R&D intensity levels. Our microeconometric analysis is based on a large international panel data set from the EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard. Employing flexible semi-parametric methods - the generalised propensity score - allows us to recover the full functional relationship between R&D investment and firm employment, and to address important econometric issues, which is not possible in the standard estimation approach used in the previous literature. Our results suggest that modest innovators do not create and may even destruct jobs by raising their R&D expenditures. Most of the jobs in the economy are created by innovation followers: increasing innovation by 1% may increase employment up to 0.7%. The job creation effect of innovation reaches its peak when R&D intensity is around 100% of the total capital expenditure, after which the positive employment effect declines and becomes statistically insignificant. Innovation leaders do not create jobs by further increasing their R&D expenditures, which are already very high.
C21|The Eﬀect of a Compressed High School Curriculum on University Performance|A recent education reform in Germany reduced the duration of academic high school education by one year but left the curriculum, and total class time unchanged. We use a unique data set of university students to investigate the eﬀects of this reduction in years of schooling on academic achievements at the tertiary level. By exploiting variation in the implementation of the reform across school types over time, we isolate the reform eﬀect from cohort, state, and school type eﬀects. Our results suggest that the reform lowers the opportunity costs of schooling and facilitates an earlier labor market entry as we ﬁnd no detrimental eﬀects while students are one year younger on average.
C21|Estimation of Industry-level Productivity with Cross-sectional Dependence by Using Spatial Analysis|We examine aggregate productivity in the presence of inter-sectoral linkages. Cross-sectional dependence is inevitable among industries, in which each sector serves as a supplier to the other sectors. However, the chains of such interconnections cause indirect relationship among industries. Spatial analysis is one of the approaches to address cross-sectional dependence by using a priori a specified spatial weights matrix. We exploit the linkage patterns from the input-output tables and use them to assign spatial weights to describe the economic interdependencies. By using the spatial weights matrix, we can estimate the industry-level production functions and productivity of the U.S. from 1947 to 2010. Cross-sectional dependencies are the consequences of indirect effects, and they reflect the interactions among industries linked via their supply chain networks result in larger output elasticities as well as scale effects for the networked production processes. However, productivity growth estimates are reportedly comparable across various spatial and non-spatial model specications.
C21|House Prices, (Un)Affordability and Systemic Risk|This is the first paper to examine the role of the real estate sector and housing unaffordability in the determination of systemic risk. We measure the systemic risk of the UK by employing the CoVaR method developed by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011, 2016), and we explore both its cross-sectional and time series behaviour. Regarding the former, we show that when the real estate sector is under distress the tail risk of the entire financial system increases significantly. With respect to the latter, the findings of our dynamic model suggest that sustainable house prices positively contribute to the stability of the financial sector; whilst house price exuberance and rapid increases in housing unaffordability amplify systemic risk. Finally, we examine the conjecture that the banking sector comprises a transmission channel from the housing market to the systemic risk of the financial system. Our empirical results are in line with this argument and highlight the key role of housing unaffordability.
C21|Welfare Effects of a Non-Contributory Old Age Pension: Experimental Evidence for Ekiti State, Nigeria|Many countries in the developing world have implemented non-contributory old-age pensions. Evidence of the impact of such policies on the elderly in Sub-Saharan Africa is scarce, however. In this paper, we provide the first evidence from a randomized evaluation of an unconditional, non-contributory pension scheme targeted at the elderly in Ekiti State, Nigeria. Our findings show that treated beneficiaries self-reported better quality of life, more stable mental health, and better general health. We also provide evidence of spillover effects on labor outcomes and on household expenditure patterns as well as support for demand- side interventions aimed at improving the welfare of elderly poor citizens and other household members.
C21|State-Dependent Effect on Voter Turnout: The Case of US House Elections|In models of voter participation, the effects of election margin and campaign expenditure can be shown to be state-dependent - varying with low/high turnout. We empirically assess these implications for observed turnout, employing data from US House elections from 2000 to 2008 by means of quantile regression analysis. We document that the effects of expected election margin and campaign spending on turnout are state-dependent: the later is positive and decreasing, whereas the former is negative and U-shaped. Other determinants' influence on turnout (e.g. education, population density) is also shown to vary across the conditional distribution of turnout rate. Our findings are robust to a number of extensions.
C21|Technological Learning and Innovation Gestation Lags at the Frontier of Science: from CERN Procurement to Patent|"This paper contributes to the literature on the impact of Big Science Centres on technological innovation. We exploit a unique dataset with information on CERN's procurement orders to study the collaborative innovation process between CERN and its industrial partners. After a qualitative discussion of case studies, survival and count data models are estimated; the impact of CERN procurement on suppliers' innovation is captured by the number of patent applications. The fact that firms in our sample received their first order over a long time span (1995-2008) delivers a natural partition of industrial partners into ""suppliers"" and ""not yet suppliers"". This allows estimating the impact of CERN on the hazard to file a patent for the first time and on the number of patent applications, as well as the time needed for these effects to show up. We find that a ""CERN effect"" does exist: being an industrial partner of CERN is associated with an increase in the hazard to file a patent for the first time and in the number of patent applications. These effects require a significant ""gestation lag"" in the range of five to eight years, pointing to a relatively slow process of absorption of new ideas."
C21|Procurement in Big Science Centres: politics or technology? Evidence from CERN|Procurement from Big Science Centers (BSC) yields a variety of spillover effects that can ultimately have growth enhancing consequences for their partner countries. We study the determinants of procurement for the biggest research infrastructure ever built: the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Using a unique cross-section database of firms that have registered to become industrial partners of the LHC program, we estimate the determinants for potential suppliers of receiving an order from CERN. We compare the relative weight of firms’ technological features and CERN’s procurement rules aimed at securing a juste retour for its Member States. Our results point to a strong impact of technological factors, while also highlighting the importance of political constraints related with CERN’s procurement rules as well as the presence of a home bias. Since the constraints related with the achievement of a juste retour affect–directly or indirectly–the procurement policy of many European BSCs, our results have policy implications that go beyond the CERN case study.
C21|A Near Unit Root Test for High-Dimensional Nonstationary Time Series|"This paper considers a p-dimensional time series model of the form x(t)-δ(t)=φ(x(t-1)-δ(t-1))+Σ^(1/2)y(t), 1≤t≤T, where y(t) = (y(t1),...,y(tp)) and and Σ^(1/2) is the square root of a symmetric positive definite matrix. Here φ≤1 and T(1-φ) is bounded and the linear processes y(tj) is of the form Σb(k)z(t-k,j) where Σ|bi| < infinity and {z(ij)} are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with E(z(ij))=0, E|z(ij)|^2=1 and E|z(ij)|^4< infinity. We first investigate the asymptotic behavior of the first k largest eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrices of the time series model. We then propose an estimator of φ and use it to test for near unit roots. Simulations and empirical applications are also conducted to demonstrate the performance of the statistic."
C21|An Integrated Panel Data Approach to Modelling Economic Growth|Accurate estimation for extent of cross-sectional dependence in large panel data analysis is paramount to further statistical analysis on the data under study. Grouping more data with weak relations (cross-sectional dependence) together often results in less efficient dimension reduction and worse forecasting. This paper describes cross-sectional dependence among a large number of objects (time series) via a factor model and parametrizes its extent in terms of strength of factor loadings. A new joint estimation method, benefiting from unique feature of dimension reduction for high dimensional time series, is proposed for the parameter representing the extent and some other parameters involved in the estimation procedure. Moreover, a joint asymptotic distribution for a pair of estimators is established. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation method in the finite sample performance. Applications in cross-country macro-variables and stock returns from S&P 500 are studied.
C21|Investigating Treatment Effects of Participating Jointly in SNAP and WIC when the Treatment is Validated Only for SNAP|USDA operates several food assistance programs aimed at alleviating food insecurity. We study whether participation in both SNAP and WIC alleviates food insecurity compared with participation in SNAP alone. We bound underlying causal effects by applying nonparametric treatment effect methods that allow for endogenous selection and underrepresented program participation when validation data are available for one program (treatment) but not the other. We estimate average treatment effects using data from the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS). FoodAPS includes administrative data to validate SNAP participation. Information on local food prices allows us to construct a food expenditure-based monotone instrumental variable that does not require a typical IV exclusion restriction. Under relatively weak monotonicity assumptions, we identify that the impact of participating in both programs relative to SNAP alone is strictly positive, suggesting that the programs are nonredundant. This evidence can support improved design and targeting of food programs.
C21|Errors in the Dependent Variable of Quantile Regression Models|The popular quantile regression estimator of Koenker and Bassett (1978) is biased if there is an additive error term. Approaching this problem as an errors-in-variables problem where the dependent variable suffers from classical measurement error, we present a sieve maximum-likelihood approach that is robust to left-hand side measurement error. After providing sufficient conditions for identification, we demonstrate that when the number of knots in the quantile grid is chosen to grow at an adequate speed, the sieve maximum-likelihood estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal, permitting inference via bootstrapping. We verify our theoretical results with Monte Carlo simulations and illustrate our estimator with an application to the returns to education highlighting changes over time in the returns to education that have previously been masked by measurement-error bias.
C21|Estimating Selection Models without Instrument with Stata|This article presents the eqregsel command for implementing the estimation and bootstrap inference of sample selection models via extremal quantile regression. The command estimates a semiparametric sample selection model without instrument or large support regressor, and outputs the point estimates of the homogenous linear coefficients, their bootstrap standard errors, as well as the p-value for a specification test.
C21|Two-way Fixed Effects Estimators with Heterogeneous Treatment Effects|Linear regressions with period and group fixed effects are widely used to estimate treatment effects. We show that they identify weighted sums of the average treatment effects (ATE) in each group and period, with weights that may be negative. Due to the negative weights, the linear regression estimand may for instance be negative while all the ATEs are positive. In two articles that have used those regressions, half of the weights are negative. We propose another estimator that solves this issue. In one of the articles we revisit, it is of a different sign than the linear regression estimator.
C21|The Marginal Labor Supply Disincentives of Welfare Reforms|Existing research on the static effects of the manipulation of welfare program benefit parameters on labor supply has allowed only restrictive forms of heterogeneity in preferences. Yet preference heterogeneity implies that the marginal effects of welfare reforms on labor supply may differ in different time periods with different populations and which sweep out different portions of the marginal distribution of preferences. A new examination of the heavily studied AFDC program examines changes in its tax rates in 1967, 1981, and 1996 and estimates the marginal effects on labor supply of a change in participation in each of those reform years. The estimates are based on a theory-consistent reduced form model which allows for a nonparametric specification of how changes in welfare program participation affect labor supply on the margin. Estimates of the model using a form of local instrumental variables show that the marginal treatment effects are quadratic, rising and then falling as participation rates rise. Applying the estimates to the three historical reform periods shows that marginal responses differed in each period because of differences in the composition of who was on the program and who was not.
C21|SeaTE: Subjective ex ante Treatment Effect of Health on Retirement|This paper develops an innovative approach to measuring the effect of health on retirement. The approach elicits subjective probabilities of working at specified time horizons fixing health level. Using a treatment-effect framework, within-individual differences in elicited probabilities of working given health yield individual-level estimates of the causal effect of health (the treatment) on working (the outcome). We call this effect the Subjective ex ante Treatment Effect (SeaTE). The paper then develops a dynamic programming framework for the SeaTE. This framework allows measurement of individual-level value functions that map directly into the dynamic programming model commonly used in structural microeconometric analysis of retirement. The paper analyzes conditional probabilities elicited in the Vanguard Research Initiative (VRI)—a survey of older Americans with positive assets. Among workers 58 and older, a shift from high to low health would on average reduce the odds of working by 28.5 percentage points at a two-year horizon and 25.7 percentage points at a four-year horizon. There is substantial variability across individuals around these average SeaTEs, so there is substantial heterogeneity in taste for work or returns to work. This heterogeneity would be normally unobservable and hard to disentangle from other determinants of retirement in data on realized labor supply decisions and health states. The paper’s approach can overcome the problem that estimates of the effect of health on labor supply based on behavioral (realizations) data can easily overstate the effect of health on retirement whenever less healthy workers tend to retire earlier for reasons other than health.
C21|Estimating the effect of treatments allocated by randomized waiting lists|Oversubscribed treatments are often allocated using randomized waiting lists. Applicants are ranked randomly, and treatment offers are made following that ranking until all seats are filled. To estimate causal effects, researchers often compare applicants getting and not getting an offer. We show that those two groups are not statistically comparable. Therefore, the estimator arising from that comparison is inconsistent. We propose a new estimator, and show that it is consistent. Finally, we revisit an application, and we show that using our estimator can lead to sizably different results from those obtained using the commonly used estimator.
C21|Level Leverage decisions and manager characteristics|This study assess how manager’s characteristics may influence leverage decisions. Using data from European banks, the results show that younger managers are risk-prone and less conservative in leverage decisions. Moreover, it is observed that for higher levels of leverage more experienced managers tend to increase leverage. This is also true for managers with a longer tenure as they may bring their personal preferences towards risk and in this sense they will be more able to increase leverage. However, this effect differs according to the level of leverage at the manager’s appointment date. The inclusion of the decision horizon seems to validate the idea that a short-term managerial horizon enhances the self-interested behaviour of the manager and this may be reflected on capital structure decisions.
C21|Explaining the evolution of ethnicity differentials in academic achievements: The role of time investments|Children of Asian immigrants in most English-speaking destinations have better academic outcomes, yet the underlying causes of their advantages are under-studied. We employ panel time-use diaries by two cohorts of children observed over a decade to present new evidence that children of Asian immigrants begin spending more time than their peers on educational activities from school entry; and, that the ethnicity gap in the time allocated to educational activities increases over time. By specifying an augmented value-added model and invoking a quantile decomposition method, we find that the academic advantage of children of Asian immigrants is attributable mainly to their allocating more time to educational activities or their favorable initial cognitive abilities and not to socio-demographics or parenting styles. Furthermore, our results show substantial heterogeneity in the contributions of initial cognitive abilities and time allocations by test subjects, test ages and points of the test score distribution.
C21| Peru's Regional Growth and Convergence in 1979-2017: An Empirical Spatial Panel Data Analysis| This paper analyzes the process of spatial convergence of growth in Peru’s 24 regions over 1979-2017. We perform an exploratory analysis of spatial data with global and local statistics, such as Moran I, to provide empirical evidence of spatial dependencies in regional per capita GDP. We then estimate the convergence equation using spatial panel models that control for spatial heterogeneity and spatial interdependence, as well as other structural economic features at the regional level. The empirical results show that spatial convergence is a very reliable conclusion over this period, and prove that spatial regional per capita GDP spillovers play an essential role in determining growth at the local level. Furthermore, the Spatial Durbin model is preferred in the formation of four clusters of convergence. The first cluster is highly productive and dynamic; the second cluster is composed by Jungle and negative-productivity regions; the third cluster is formed by moderately productive and Coast regions; and the fourth cluster is composed by stagnating and Highland regions. Finally, these results may be instrumental in giving greater focus to long-run government policies targeting stagnant and poor regions. JEL Classification-JEL: C21, C23, R11
C21|Assessing job quality in the French labour market: decompositions of the native/migrant wage gap|"Having a job, and particularly having a job of good quality, is an important determinant of people’s well-being. In many countries, inequality starts in the labour market. Indeed, changes in the distribution of wages are found to be the key factors behind recent inequality trends (ILO 2015). A high level of inequality can create divisions within society, reduce opportunity and social mobility: it could weaken the social cohesion and reduce household consumptions with low rates of economic growth. All these issues can threaten the political stability. In this study, we contribute to the literature on immigrants in the French labour market by analysing the earnings differentials between workers born in France and workers born abroad. We used the wage indicator of job quality by using the 2013 French Working condition survey carried out by DARES (Directorate for Research, Studies and Statistics). Given the importance of the immigration phenomenon in the EU countries and in particular in the French labour market context, the aim of the paper is to explain the differences between immigrant and native workers in terms of wage by using decomposition techniques, controlling for a large set of covariates. The decomposition methods allow us to decompose mean differences in two components: the ""explained"" and the ""unexplained"" part (the second one is often used as a measure for discrimination). In particular, as an extension to the classical decomposition method, proposed by Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973), we applied the decomposition method proposed by Firpo et al. (2007, 2009) to consider the ways in which various characteristics of immigrants and natives affect the wage gap along the whole distribution of wages, at points other than the mean."
C21|Spatial dependence in museum services: An analysis of the Italian case|In this paper we investigate whether the services offered by museums are affected by the choices of neighbors, and we discuss whether the evidence can document that competition processes are at work. Specifically, we take into account the Italian case, where governmental and private museums co-exist. Resorting to Spatial Autoregressive Models, we show that a significant influence of neighbors’ choice concerning service supply does emerge. However, we cast several doubts that this piece of evidence can be solely due to sound competition among museums.
C21|Analysing the glass ceiling and sticky floor effects in Bangladesh: Evidence, extent and elements|With deep-seated gender imbalances prevalent in Bangladesh, it is compelling to understand how those women, who do manage to get employed, are faring in terms of equity. A popular approach involves analysing the gender wage gap across the entire distribution. With the assistance of data from QLFS 2016-17, the Mincerian model is estimated under various specifications, and then the final model decomposed using Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method. Using these analyses at the mean as benchmarks, the entire distribution is examined by employing the conditional quantile regression model and Quantile Counterfactual Decomposition technique. The paper has then proceeded to posit the existence of a strong sticky floor effect and a weaker glass ceiling effect in Bangladesh, with discriminatory rewards to observed characteristics being the dominant feature of the observed wage gap across the entire distribution. Policy prescriptions and potential avenues for further scope concerning the paper are also mentioned in the end.
C21|Inference in Differences-in-Differences: How Much Should We Trust in Independent Clusters?|We analyze the conditions in which ignoring spatial correlation is problematic for inference in differences-in-differences (DID) models. Assuming that the spatial correlation structure follows a linear factor model, we show that inference ignoring such correlation remains reliable when either (i) the second moment of the difference between the pre- and post-treatment averages of common factors is low, or (ii) the distribution of factor loadings has the same expected values for treated and control groups, and do not exhibit significant spatial correlation. We present simulations with real datasets that corroborate these conclusions. Our results provide important guidelines on how to minimize inference problems due to spatial correlation in DID applications.
C21|Knocking on employment’s door: internships and job attainment<BR>[Llamando a las puertas del Empleo: prácticas en empresa e inserción laboral]|Las prácticas académicas externas (PAEs) han ganado mucha popularidad entre los estudiantes, universidades, gobiernos y empresas desde la creación del Espacio Europeo de Educación Superior. Sin embargo, la evidencia empírica acerca de la relación entre las PAEs y la inserción laboral de los graduados es todavía muy escasa, particularmente en España. Este trabajo analiza si las PAEs mejoran los resultados en el mercado laboral tanto en el corto plazo (primer empleo después de graduarse) como en el medio/largo plazo (empleo 4 años después de la graduación). Para ello, se estiman modelos de probabilidad lineal y modelos probit a partir de los datos de la Encuesta de Inserción Laboral de los Titulados Universitarios 2014 del INE. Adicionalmente se implementa una técnica econométrica novedosa para evaluar la sensibilidad de los resultados al sesgo de variables omitidas en las estimaciones. En concreto, se analiza el efecto de las PAEs en: (i) la velocidad de encontrar el primer empleo; (ii) la adecuación horizontal, vertical y de habilidades técnicas con el primer empleo; (iii) la probabilidad de estar empleado en el medio y largo plazo; (iv) la adecuación horizontal y vertical con el empleo actual; y (v) los quintiles de salario del empleo actual. Los resultados muestran que las prácticas académicas en empresas suavizan y favorecen la transición de la universidad al mercado laboral de los graduados españoles. Aunque los efectos de las PAEs no desaparecen totalmente en el medio y largo plazo, existe una débil evidencia de efectos positivos en la adecuación al trabajo actual y en los salarios de los graduados tras 4 años de graduación.
C21|Are Uncertainties across the World Convergent?|We analyse the convergence of a news-based measure of uncertainty across 143 countries (spanning 99 percent of world GDP) over the quarterly period of 1996:01 to 2018:03. We apply a panel data-based unit root test, which controls for both nonlinearity and cross-sectional dependence, to the ratio of the uncertainty of individual countries relative to that of global uncertainty. We find overwhelming evidence of stationarity in 141 of the cross-sectional units, leading to a rejection of the null of a unit root for the entire panel. Our results provide strong evidence of convergence and hence, the spillover of uncertainty spillover across the economies of the world. Given this, policymakers need to be alert all the time to counteract the negative impact on the domestic economy in the wake of uncertainty increases around the world.
C21|Wild Bootstrap and Asymptotic Inference with Multiway Clustering|We study two cluster-robust variance estimators (CRVEs) for regression models with clustering in two dimensions and give conditions under which t-statistics based on each of them yield asymptotically valid inferences. In particular, one of the CRVEs requires stronger assumptions about the nature of the intra-cluster correlations. We then propose several wild bootstrap procedures and state conditions under which they are asymptotically valid for each type of t-statistic. Extensive simulations suggest that using certain bootstrap procedures with one of the t-statistics generally performs very well. An empirical example confirms that bootstrap inferences can differ substantially from conventional ones
C21|When and How to Deal with Clustered Errors in Regression Models|We discuss when and how to deal with possibly clustered errors in linear regression models. Specifically, we discuss situations in which a regression model may plausibly be treated as having error terms that are arbitrarily correlated within known clusters but uncorrelated across them. The methods we discuss include various covariance matrix estimators, possibly combined with various methods of obtaining critical values, several bootstrap procedures, and randomization inference. Special attention is given to models with few treated clusters and clusters that vary in size, where inference may be problematic. Two empirical examples and a simulation experiment illustrate the methods we discuss and the concerns we raise.
C21|Books or babies? Incapacitation and human capital effects of extended compulsory schooling on the teenage fertility of ethnic minority women|This paper examines the effects of an increase in the compulsory school-leaving (CSL) age on the teenage fertility of Roma women, a disadvantaged ethnic minority in Hungary. We use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) identification strategy and show that raising the CSL age from 16 to 18 decreased the probability of teenage motherhood among Roma women by 6.8 percentage points and delayed early motherhood by two years. We contribute to the literature by exploiting a database that covers live births, miscarriages, abortions, and still births, and contains information on the time of conception precise to the week to separate the incapacitation and human capital effects of education on fertility. We find that higher CSL age decreases the probability of getting pregnant during the school year but not during summer and Christmas breaks, which suggests that the estimated effects are generated mostly through the incapacitation channel.
C21|Investment Responses to Tax Policy under Uncertainty|"How does economic uncertainty affect the impact of tax policy? To answer this question, we exploit a unique natural experiment, in which two very similar investment subsidies were implemented in the same country, two years apart: once during a period of economic stability, and once during a period of very high uncertainty. The experiment features sharp discontinuities in firm eligibility, and we conduct our analysis using tax returns (corporate and VAT) and trade data for the universe of corporations. We find that, under low uncertainty, tax incentives have strong positive effects on investment, both on the extensive and intensive margins. This aligns with the findings in several recent empirical papers. Under high uncertainty, however, the story is very different: the effect at the intensive margin is still present, but the effect at the extensive margin disappears. Together, these results suggest that: (1) some firms ""wait and see"" during periods of high uncertainty, even in the presence of generous incentives; and (2) periods of stability offer an important policy opportunity to encourage investment."
C21|Specification Tests for Temporal Heterogeneity in Spatial Panel Models with Fixed Effects|We propose score type tests for testing the existence of temporal heterogeneity in slope and spatial parameters in spatial panel data (SPD) models, allowing for the presence of individual-specific and/or time-specific fixed effects (or in general intercept heterogeneity). The SPD model with spatial lag effect is treated in detail by first considering the model with individual-specific effects only, and then extending it to the model with both individual and time specific effects. Two types of tests (naive and robust) are proposed, and their asymptotic properties are presented. These tests are then fully extended to an SPD model with both spatial lag and spatial error effects. Monte Carlo results show that the robust tests have much superior finite and large sample properties than the naive tests. Thus, the proposed robust tests provide reliable tools for identifying possible existence of temporal heterogeneity in regression and spatial coefficients. Empirical illustrations of the proposed tests are given.
C21|Anatomy of Regional Price Differentials: Evidence From Micro Price Data|Over the last three decades the supply of economic statistics has vastly improved. Unfortunately, statistics on regional price levels (sub- national purchasing power parities) have been exempt from this positive trend, even though they are indispensable for meaningful spatial comparisons of regional output, income, wages, productivity, standards of living, and poverty. To improve the situation, our paper demonstrates that a highly disaggregated and reliable regional price index can be compiled from data that already exist. We use the micro price data that have been collected for Germany’s Consumer Price Index in May 2016. For the computation we introduce a multi-stage version of the Country-Product-Dummy method. The unique quality of our price data set allows us to depart from previous spatial price comparisons and to compare only exactly identical products. We find that the price levels of the 402 counties and cities of Germany are largely driven by the cost of housing and to a much lesser degree by the prices of goods and services. The overall price level in the most expensive region, Munich, is about 27 percent higher than in the cheapest region. Our results also reveal strong spatial autocorrelation.
C21|Electoral Reform and Public Sector Efficiency. Some Evidence From Italian Municipalities|We study the effect of Law 81/1993, which introduced a different electoral rule for the election of the mayor, on the technical efficiency of Italian cities. Since 1993, municipalities below 15,000 inhabitants vote with a single-ballot system, whereas cities above 15,000 inhabitants threshold are subject to a double ballot. We first estimate the technical efficiency in 1994 (taken as a pre-change year), and 1999 and 2004 for a sample of Italian municipalities, through a non-parametric DEA, and then we perform on both input and output oriented efficiency scores a difference-in-differences analysis, through various panel techniques. We find evidence that, after the reform, municipalities voting under a double-ballot show low levels of efficiency compared to cities voting under a single-ballot, by about 16 (input oriented) and 4 percentage points (output oriented). We speculate that the difference in the level of efficiency among cities voting under a different electoral rule is essentially driven by a lower average quality of politicians elected under a double ballot compared to those elected with a single ballot.
C21|A Principled Approach to Assessing Missing-Wage Induced Selection Bias|Multiple imputation (MI) techniques are applied to simulate missing wage rates of non-working wives under the missing-at-random (MAR) condition. The assumed selection effect of the labour force participation decision is framed as deviations of the imputed wage rates from MAR. By varying the deviations, we assess the severity of subsequent selection bias in standard human capital models through sensitivity analyses (SA). Our experiments show that the bias remains largely insignificant. While similar findings are possibly attainable through the Heckman procedure, SA under the MI approach provides a more structured and principled approach to assessing selection bias.
C21|Sectoral proximity in manufacturing: an empirical application of cognitive and technological skills|This study proposes analyze the proximity in productive and technological terms between manufacturing sectors offering a new measure of cognitive proximity. There are three innovative contributions: an unprecedented production matrix created with information on multiproduct plants; a new index that captures productive and technological skills related to workerâ€™s occupation; and methods of spatial econometrics were used in an innovative way to evaluate the proximity between productive sectors. Was used unpublished information from a special tabulation of PIA Empresa/IBGE, and RAIS. Statistical analyzes confirmed the existence of proximity between manufacturing sectors verified through the productive and technological skills of workerâ€™s occupations. The neighborhood network was more dense among sectors that have occupations with the same skills and also between sectors of the same technological level. Sectoral spillovers were found on the neighborhood in the form of positive marginal effects on productivity and investment.
C21|Evaluating the impact of the selection process of principals in Brazilian public schools|Educational quality in Brazil has improved at a slow pace despite continued public policy efforts. The international literature has noted the importance of school management and the principal's profile on students' performance, but this discussion is recent in Brazil. In this study, we investigate the effects of the selection process of principals on students' performance from public state schools in Brazil. We conclude that while the â€œselection processâ€ channel is not clear, the â€œprincipal quality effectâ€ indicates that the more democratic and technical selection methods tend to select most qualified principals in terms of leadership and managerial abilities. The principal who has time to implement changes, who adopts management practices to encourage teachers and has experience being the leader of the school present better results in terms of studentâ€™s performance. Therefore, it is important that the principal selection process choose professionals with the skills mentioned.
C21|Limited impact of UPPs over criminality|The effects of the implementation of UPPs have not yet been evaluated for its entire period. This paper aims to evaluate the impact on crime rates in the city of Rio de Janeiro using as control group districts of the city of SÃ£o Paulo. Then, a difference-in-difference model is combined with a propensity score analysis. The results indicate that the UPPs were successful only in the initial years. The cost-effectiveness analysis of the program indicates an economic benefit of R$460 million, but net benefits are expected to vanish due to the limited effects of the policy.
C21|A convenient omitted variable bias formula for treatment effect models|Generally, determining the size and magnitude of the omitted variable bias (OVB) in regression models is challenging when multiple included and omitted variables are present. Here, I describe a convenient OVB formula for treatment effect models with potentially many included and omitted variables. I show that in these circumstances it is simple to infer the direction, and potentially the magnitude, of the bias. In a simple setting, this OVB is based on mutually exclusive binary variables, however I provide an extension which loosens the need for mutual exclusivity of variables, deriving the bias in difference-in-differences style models with an arbitrary number of included and excluded “treatment” indicators.
C21|Local policy effects at a time of economic crisis|Regional inequalities are large and have widened during the Great Recession. As they prompt people and economic activities to migrate from lagging regions, central governments around the world transfer large amounts of resources in order to prevent these phenomena from occurring. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of the most extensive and long-lived experiment of income redistribution across regions and countries, i.e., the EU regional policy, at a time of economic crisis. Exploiting geographic discontinuities in funds eligibility and using a spatial regression discontinuity design, we analyze comprehensive data on all publicly funded Italian projects at the municipality level. We find a positive and significant impact on employment and number of plants in the least developed regions. However, the impact turns largely negligible when the gap between more and less intensively treated areas is relatively small. Moreover, the EU regional policy appears not to have had any effect on local average income.
C21|Robust analysis of convergence in per capita GDP in BRICS economies|Whilst the issue of whether or not per capita GDP adheres to the convergence theory continues to draw increasing attention within the academic paradigm, with very little consensus having been reached in the literature thus far. Our study contributes to the literature by examining the stationarity of per capita GDP for BRICS countries using annual data collected between 1971 and 2015. Considering that our sample covers a period underlying a number of crisis and structural breaks within and amongst the BRICS countries, we rely on a robust nonlinear unit root testing procedure which captures a series of unobserved structural breaks. Our results confirm on Brazil and China being the only two BRICS economies who present the most convincing evidence of per capita GDP converging back to it’s natural equilibrium after an economic shock, whilst Russia and South Africa provide less convincing evidence of convergence dynamics in the time series and India having the weakest convergence properties.
C21|Can regional policies shape migration flows?|We consider how two groups of regions, which differ in productivity and public good endowments, compete in tax and public goods to attract or reject migrants. In our framework the less productive regions receive public transfers which increase their panoply of public goods. We find that, whenever public transfers are sufficiently high, migration to the less productive regions is observed only in the case when the productivity gap between regions is not extremely wide. We then employ a regression discontinuity design to empirically assess the causal relationship between the reception of large amounts of public funds and migration flows in the EU-15 regions. The theoretical predictions are broadly confirmed as we find a wide expansion in the share of foreign citizens in the highlysubsidized regions, when compared to low-subsidized regions with similar pre-treatment characteristics.
C21|Unobserved structural shifts and asymmetries in the random walk model for stock returns in African frontier markets|The purpose of this study is to examine the weak-form market efficiency hypothesis (EMH) for 8 African Frontier markets (Nairobi Securities Exchange of Kenya, the Nigerian Stock Exchange of Nigeria, Botswana Stock Exchange of Botswana, Zimbabwe Stock Exchange of Zimbabwe, Johannesburg Stock Exchange of South Africa, Egyptian Exchange of Egypt, Casablanca Stock Exchange of Morocco, the Tunis Stock Exchange of Tunisia). To achieve this purpose we employ unit root testing procedures which are robust to both nonlinearities and smooth structural breaks. To further allow for vigorousness in our empirical analysis we employ two time series datasets for each of the capital markets, namely daily and weekly time series. To the best of our knowledge, our study becomes the first, to investigate the weak-form EMH for all 8 African frontier markets whilst simultaneously accounting for asymmetries and smooth structural breaks. Our empirical findings suggest that most African frontier markets are not market efficient, in the weak sense form, with the exception of the Kenyan stock market and to a very much lesser extent the Botswana and South African stock series. Important policy and investor implications are drawn in our study.
C21|Concentration Based Inference in High Dimensional Generalized Regression Models (I: Statistical Guarantees)|"We develop simple and non-asymptotically justified methods for hypothesis testing about the coefficients ($\theta^{*}\in\mathbb{R}^{p}$) in the high dimensional generalized regression models where $p$ can exceed the sample size. Given a function $h:\,\mathbb{R}^{p}\mapsto\mathbb{R}^{m}$, we consider $H_{0}:\,h(\theta^{*})=\mathbf{0}_{m}$ against $H_{1}:\,h(\theta^{*})\neq\mathbf{0}_{m}$, where $m$ can be any integer in $\left[1,\,p\right]$ and $h$ can be nonlinear in $\theta^{*}$. Our test statistics is based on the sample ``quasi score'' vector evaluated at an estimate $\hat{\theta}_{\alpha}$ that satisfies $h(\hat{\theta}_{\alpha})=\mathbf{0}_{m}$, where $\alpha$ is the prespecified Type I error. By exploiting the concentration phenomenon in Lipschitz functions, the key component reflecting the dimension complexity in our non-asymptotic thresholds uses a Monte-Carlo approximation to mimic the expectation that is concentrated around and automatically captures the dependencies between the coordinates. We provide probabilistic guarantees in terms of the Type I and Type II errors for the quasi score test. Confidence regions are also constructed for the population quasi-score vector evaluated at $\theta^{*}$. The first set of our results are specific to the standard Gaussian linear regression models; the second set allow for reasonably flexible forms of non-Gaussian responses, heteroscedastic noise, and nonlinearity in the regression coefficients, while only requiring the correct specification of $\mathbb{E}\left(Y_{i}|X_{i}\right)$s. The novelty of our methods is that their validity does not rely on good behavior of $\left\Vert \hat{\theta}_{\alpha}-\theta^{*}\right\Vert _{2}$ (or even $n^{-1/2}\left\Vert X\left(\hat{\theta}_{\alpha}-\theta^{*}\right)\right\Vert _{2}$ in the linear regression case) nonasymptotically or asymptotically."
C21|A Short Course on Spatial Econometrics and GIS|This resource gives a brief overview of a website and playlist of YouTube videos using open source software (R, GeoDa, and QGIS) designed to help get scholars up and running with analyzing their own data using Spatial Econometrics. Sample data, handouts, code, and map files are provided for ease of replication. The course covers the basics of integrating data into a spatial data set, contiguity and spatial correlation, doing basic spatial regressions in GeoDa, and doing more sophisticated specification tests and regressions in R.
C21|Conditional cash transfers, spillovers and informal health care: Evidence from Peru|The use of low-quality informal health-care providers (IHCPs) is still prominent in developing countries despite the efforts of their governments to expand institutional services. The use of conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs have become instrumental in encouraging the use of formal health services, but little is known about their direct effect on the use of IHCPs. We use a large survey of rural households and a regression discontinuity design to estimate the effects of the Peruvian CCT program on the demand for IHCP. We find a sizeable reduction in the use of IHCPs not only in targeted but also in non-targeted members of treated households. This finding indicates the existence of spillover effects within the household. We also provide evidence that beyond the direct increase in income, the availability of better information about institutional services is a potential mechanism that drives these effects. We also find a corresponding improvement in the self-perception of health status. Our results are robust to a number of sensitivity analyses.
C21|Is Swaziland on a path of convergence towards her main trading partners?|The Kingdom of Swaziland is a small, open economy which is heavily dependent on trade activity with neighboring and other industrialized countries. This study implements the recently-developed fractional frequency flexible Fourier form (FFFFF) unit root to examine the income convergence hypothesis for a dataset of per capita income differences between Swaziland and 5 of her main trading partners over a period of 1950 to 2016. With the exception of Japan, the empirical evidence indicates non-convergence of Swaziland towards her main trading partners.
C21|Dollarization and the “unbundling” of globalization in sub-Saharan Africa|This study contributes to the dollarization literature by expanding its determinants to account for different dimensions of globalization, using the widely employed KOF index of globalization. Specifically, globalization is “unbundled” into three different layers namely: economic, social and political dimensions. The study focuses on 25 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries for the period 2001–2012. Using the Tobit regression approach, the following findings are established. First, from both economic and statistical relevance, the social and political dimensions of globalization constitute the key dollarization amplifiers, while the explanatory power of the economic component is weaker on dollarization. Second, consistent with the theoretical underpinnings, macroeconomic instabilities (such as inflation and exchange rate volatilities) have the positive expected signs. Third, the positive association between the accumulation of international reserves and dollarization is also apparent. Policy implications are discussed.
C21|What happens when the income tax increases?|This paper exploits a sudden income tax rate increase in a large Italian region to examine whether this induced taxpayers to change their tax-related behavior. By using a spatial regression discontinuity design and a detailed dataset at the municipality level, we find a sizable and persistent decrease in declared income only for the self-employed and entrepreneurs.
C21|Male-Female wage gap and informal employment in Bangladesh: A quantile regression approach|This article undertakes an examination of Bangladesh’s latest available Quarterly Labour Force Survey 2015-2016 data to draw indepth insights as regards gender wage gap and wage discrimination in Bangladesh labour market. Mean wage decomposition shows that an average woman in Bangladesh earns 12.2 per cent lower wage than man, and about half of the wage gap can be explained by labour market discrimination against women. Quantile Counterfactual Decomposition shows that women are subjected to higher wage penalty at the lower deciles of the wage distribution with the wage gap varying between 8.3 per cent to 19.4 per cent at different deciles. We established that at lower deciles a significant part of the gender wage gap is on account of the relatively larger presence of informal employment. Conditional quantile estimates further reveals that formally employed female workers earn higher wage than their male counterparts at the first decile but suffer from wage penalty at the top deciles.
C21|Returns to schooling in Bangladesh revisited: An instrumental variable quantile regression approach|The paper focuses on estimation of returns to schooling in the Bangladesh context. Earlier articles which tried to quantify the returns were constrained by a number of limitations including measurement techniques that were deployed. The present article revisits the issue and makes an attempt to build on the earlier studies by making use of quantile regression and instrumental variable quantile regression methods. The paper finds that endogeneity problem leads to underestimation of the returns to schooling and the returns tend to vary along the wage distribution, which mean regression models fail to capture. The analysis shows that average returns to schooling for female is higher than that of male. The analysis also shows that returns to schooling tends to be higher as one moves along higher percentiles of wage distribution and this is true for both male and female.
C21|Why is the relative preference for government jobs on the rise in Bangladesh? Evidence from labour force surveys|This article examines the underlying factors contributing to the changing scenario concerning relative attractiveness of public sector jobs in Bangladesh vis-à-vis private sector jobs. The article quantifies wage differentials between the public and the private sector, and examines the changes as regards earnings inequalities between group (public versus private) and within group (within private sector employees), in response to the new pay scale introduced for public sector employees in Bangladesh. The analysis reveals that following salary scale revision of particularly 2015, public sector jobs in the country have become more attractive for job seekers looking for salaried employment. Whilst there has been a shift favouring the entire range of wage distribution curve, it is more evident for jobs at the entry level. Although the higher-paid private sector employees appear to have been able to adjust their salaries in response to government pay scale revision, the relatively low-paid ones in the private sector have not been able to. Additionally, public sector jobs have the added advantage of non-wage benefits of larger coverage compared to the private sector. All these factors have combined to bring a shift in preference in favour of public sector jobs in Bangladesh. The article has argued that the recent ‘quota movement’ in Bangladesh, with the demand to revise the existing quota system in the country, reflects this shifting preference on the part of those entering the job market in recent times.
C21|Family Ties and Children Obesity in Italy|This paper estimates the influence of overweight family members on weight outcomes of Italian children aged 6 to 14 years. We use a new dataset matching the 2012 cross sections of the Italian Multipurpose Household Survey and the Household Budget Survey. Endogenous peer groups within the family are accounted for using a set of instrumental variables. We find evidence of a strong, positive effect of both overweight adults and peer children in the family on children weight outcomes. The impact of overweight peer children in the household is larger than the impact of adults. These findings can help identifying the main factors driving the rise in Italian children obesity in the past few decades.
C21|Climate Friendly Goods and Technology Trade: Climate Mitigation Strategy of India|This study focuses on India’s climate change mitigation strategy through trade and how India gradually moves forward towards the goal of sustainable development path. The paper highlights trade performances of climate friendly goods and technology (CFGT) in India during 2002-20017 and suggests possible solution through trade channels that might mitigate climate change through disseminating and exchanging the low carbon and clean technologies, which improve energy efficiency and minimizes environmental impacts. The products associated with clean technologies which have relatively less adverse impact on the environment. This paper attempts to realize India’s CFGT export and import, and quantify trade opportunities of CFGT in India. With these it also identifies constrains and helps to widen capacity and strengthen its capability in the advancement of capturing new opportunities in production and trade in CFGT. India should adopt few policies to improve and raise CFGT production while trade ensures availability of technologies
C21|Geographical Distributions and Equilibrium in Social Norm-Related Behavior in the United States|This research examines the geographical distribution of behavior in line with social norms that are spread and maintained primarily by the effect of social conformity. These include widely held norms that good citizens vote, don’t commit crimes, get flu vaccinations, abstain from binge drinking, and comply with census reporting. A partial differential equation model is used to determine whether such behavior may have attained a geospatial equilibrium in the United States. An equilibrium, as the end state of a diffusion process, has definitive mathematical properties that can be used to test for equilibrium. This is done using recent data for the 48 contiguous states. Results confirm that behavior for several important social norms fits the equilibrium model geographically. Policy implications are briefly discussed.
C21|Wild Bootstrap Randomization Inference For Few Treated Clusters|When there are few treated clusters in a pure treatment or difference-in-differences setting, t tests based on a cluster-robust variance estimator (CRVE) can severely over-reject. Although procedures based on the wild cluster bootstrap often work well when the number of treated clusters is not too small, they can either over-reject or under-reject seriously when it is. In a previous paper, we showed that procedures based on randomization inference (RI) can work well in such cases. However, RI can be impractical when the number of possible randomizations is small. We propose a bootstrap-based alternative to randomization inference, whichmitigates the discrete nature of RI P values in the few-clusters case. We also compare it to two other procedures. None of them works perfectly when the number of clusters is very small, but they can worksurprisingly well.
C21|Fast and wild: Bootstrap inference in Stata using boottest|The wild bootstrap was originally developed for regression models with heteroskedasticity of unknown form. Over the past 30 years, it has been extended to models estimated by instrumental variables and maximum likelihood and to ones where the error terms are (perhaps multiway) clustered. Like boot- strap methods in general, the wild bootstrap is especially useful when conventional inference methods are unreliable because large-sample assumptions do not hold. For example, there may be few clusters, few treated clusters, or weak instruments. The package boottest can perform a wide variety of wild bootstrap tests, often at remarkable speed. It can also invert these tests to construct confidence sets. As a postestimation command, boottest works after linear estimation commands, in- cluding regress, cnsreg, ivregress, ivreg2, areg, and reghdfe, as well as many estimation commands based on maximum likelihood. Although it is designed to perform the wild cluster bootstrap, boottest can also perform the ordinary (non- clustered) version. Wrappers offer classical Wald, score/Lagrange multiplier, and Anderson–Rubin tests, optionally with (multiway) clustering. We review the main ideas of the wild cluster bootstrap, offer tips for use, explain why it is particularly amenable to computational optimization, state the syntax of boottest, artest, scoretest, and waldtest, and present several empirical examples.
C21|Dissecting between-plant and within-plant wage dispersion - Evidence from Germany|We analyze the most important drivers of the recent rise in overall German wage dispersion and pin down the relative contribution of central establishment and worker characteristics. Moreover, we separately investigate the drivers of between as well as within establishment wage dispersion. Using rich linked employer-employee data for the German manufacturing sector between 1996 and 2010, we explicitly account for the role of a plant’s collective bargaining regime, its technological status and its export behavior. In order to disentangle the contribution of each single variable to the rise in wage dispersion, relative to other variables, requires a rich and comprehensive framework. To this end we apply a state-of-the-art decomposition method which is based on recentered influence function (RIF) regressions. We find that the decline in collective bargaining coverage as well as changes in the skill- and occupation-related wage structure are main sources of increased overall wage dispersion. Regional employment shifts, differences between collectively covered and uncovered plants and increased sorting play a key role for changes in between establishment wage dispersion, while the technology intenstiy of a plant is the most important driver of within plant wage inequality
C21|The Effects of an Education-Leave Program on Educational Attainment and Labor-Market Outcomes|Abstract I study the effect of an education leave subsidy for the employed on labor-market outcomes and educational attainment using Finnish administrative linked employer-employee panel data and matching methods. The adult education allowance is available to employees with at least eight years of work experience and allows them to take a leave for 2–18 months to participate in an education program while being compensated for a substantial part of their forgone earnings. I find large positive treatment effects on educational attainment and changing occupation. The treatment effects on earnings and employment are negative during the lock-in period and close to zero afterward. Treatment effects on pseudo-outcomes are small and with one exception not statistically significant, which supports the credibility of the identification strategy. Sensitivity analyses show that unobserved variables should have a fairly large effect on treatment assignment to change the results.
C21|Was Higher Education a Major Channel through which the United States Became an Economic Superpower in the 20th Century?|We offer a thesis for why the United States (US) overtook the United Kingdom (UK) and other European countries in the 20th century in both aggregate and per capita GDP as a case study of recent models of endogenous growth, where “human capital” is the engine of growth. By human capital we mean an intangible asset, best thought of as a stock of embodied and disembodied knowledge comprising education, information, entrepreneurship, and productive and innovative skills, which is formed through investments in schooling, job training, and health as well as through research and development projects and informal knowledge transfers (cf. Ehrlich and Murphy 2007). The conjecture is that the ascendancy of the US as an economic superpower in the 20th century owes considerably to its faster human capital formation relative to that of the UK and “old Europe.” We assess whether the thesis has legs to stand on through both stylized facts and a supplementary quasi-experimental empirical analysis. The stylized facts indicate that the US led other major developed countries in schooling attainments per adult population member, beginning in the latter part of the 19th century and lasting throughout the 20th century, especially at the secondary and tertiary levels. The quasi-experimental analysis constitutes the first attempt to test the hypothesis that the US’s ascendancy to a major economic power stems largely from the impact of the first Morrill Act of 1862, which launched the public higher education movement in the US through the establishment of land grant colleges and universities across the nation during the latter part of the 19th century.
C21|Diagnostic Tests for Homoskedasticity in Spatial Cross-Sectional or Panel Models|We propose tests for homoskedasticity in spatial econometric models, based on joint or concentrated score functions and an Outer-Product-of-Martingale-Difference (OPMD) estimate of the variance of the joint or concentrated score functions. Versions of these tests robust against non-normality are also given. Asymptotic properties of the proposed tests are formally examined using a cross-section model and a panel model with fixed effects. Monte Carlo results show that the proposed tests based on the concentrated score function have good finite sample properties. Finally, the generality of the proposed approach in constructing tests for homoskedasticity is further demonstrated using a spatial dynamic panel data model with short panels.
C21|Spatial Dynamic Panel Data Models with Correlated Random Effects|In this paper, M-estimation and inference methods are developed for spatial dynamic panel data models with correlated random effects, based on short panels. The unobserved individual-specific effects are assumed to be correlated with the observed time-varying regressors linearly or in a linearizable way, giving the so-called correlated random effects model, which allows the estimation of effects of time-invariant regressors. The unbiased estimating functions are obtained by adjusting the conditional quasi-scores given the initial observations, leading to M-estimators that are consistent, asymptotically normal, and free from the initial conditions except the process starting time. By decomposing the estimating functions into sums of terms uncorrelated given idiosyncratic errors, a hybrid method is developed for consistently estimating the variance-covariance matrix of the M-estimators, which again depends only on the process starting time. Monte Carlo results demonstrate that the proposed methods perform well in finite sample.
C21|Measuring herding behavior in the Russian stock market|This paper attempts to examine herding behavior in the Russian stock market by implementing four different methods designed to test for herding by Chang et al. (2000), Christie&Huang (1995), Hwang&Salmon (2001) and Torrecillas et al (2016). The main goal is to investigate the implications of the interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations for the stock market efficiency. The results of the work help to identify the sources of herding behavior in the Russian stock market.Employing different approaches towards measuring herding, it is possible to determine whether individuals copy each other?s actions (Torrecillas et al (2016)) or herd towards market views about market index (Chang et al. (2000), Christie&Huang (1995), Hwang&Salmon (2001)). This paper starts by the establishing the transition from efficient-market behavior to herding behavior by using Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (Torrecillas et al (2016)) applied to MICEX closing prices within the period from September 1997 to December 2017. The DFA reveals the presence of persistent herding behavior during the 2007-2009 crisis. Next, Christie and Huang?s CSSD measure of stock returns is used to capture if herding related to the firm-specific risk in the portfolio is present at the market. Consistent with results of the previous studies, the method fails to establish traces of herding. Christie and Huang?s improved measure of CSSD with non-linear trend by Chang et al. (2000) yields evidence of herding in the down market during monetary policy announcements. The results of the Hwang and Salmon?s state space models help to demonstrate herding related to the market risk by analyzing relative dispersion of the time-varying betas for assets. The main finding is that changes in the betas can?t be explained by movements in fundamentals, which indicates intentional herding. Therefore, bad news for the stock market (interest rate increase and currency depreciation) induce intentional herding in the Russian stock market. Intentional herding during market stress has important implications for portfolio diversification for both diversified and undiversified investors.
C21|An analysis of the distributive effects of public policies and their spillovers|The purpose of this work is to define and identify the effects of treatment saturation on the several quantiles of the outcome variable in the presence of treatment spillover. Exploring the variation resulting from two stage randomization, we propose and estimator that depends on the proportion of treated individuals allowing estimate quantile direct, indirect and saturation treatment effects. In addition we also defined and identified que unconditional quantile private and spillover effects which is similar to the average effects of Phillipson (2000).
C21|Euroscepticism and EU Cohesion Policy: The Impact of Micro-Level Policy Effectiveness on Voting Behaviour|This study investigates whether there is a link between the successful implementation of European cohesion policy and the voters' attitudes towards the EU. Using the French presidential elections in 2017 as a case study, we do not solely consider regional funds expenditures but also its induced effects in a region as further potential determinant of pro-European or eurosceptic voting behaviour. In order to measure the effectiveness of EU structural funds and Cohesion Fund assignment, firm-level employment effects in French NUTS-2 regions stemming from project allocation during the multi-financial framework 2007-2013 are estimated. The obtained average treatment effects are, in a next step, used together with other regional characteristics to capture the citizens' perceived exposure to the EU in an empirical voting model for the French presidential election in 2017. The estimation results reveal a significant negative relationship between the effectiveness of EU funds allocation and the vote share of the eurosceptic candidate Marine Le Pen.
C21|Tracking pupils into adulthood: selective schools and long-term well-being in the 1958 British cohort|We explore the effect of tracking pupils by ability into different secondary schools on adult health, well-being and labour outcomes in England. We address selection bias by balancing individual pre-treatment characteristics via entropy matching, followed by parametric regressions estimated via OLS and IV approaches. Ability tracking does not affect long-term health and well-being, while it marginally raises hourly wages for low-ability pupils, compared to a mixed-ability system. Cognitive and non-cognitive abilities measured prior to secondary school are more significant and positive predictors of adult outcomes. Particularly, non-cognitive skills may have a protective role for adult health for lower cognitive ability children.
C21|Explaining Divorce Gaps in Cognitive and Noncognitive Skills of Children|To what extent does parental selection into divorce explain the gap in skills between children of intact and disrupted families? Using the UK Millennium Cohort Study this paper shows that the disadvantage in skills typically found among children of divorce mainly reflects the selection effect, whereby more disadvantaged parents are more likely to divorce. In an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition of children’s cognitive and noncognitive skills up until age 11, evidence indicates that pre-divorce characteristics, namely parents’ education, family financial resources and interparental conflicts are the most important factors accounting for the divorce gaps in children’s skills, implying a negligible impact of divorce itself. Interparental conflicts are often neglected in the literature but are shown to play a major role particularly for noncognitive skills of children. These results suggest that to reduce the disadvantage in skills among children of divorce, interventions targeting these pre-divorce characteristics would be potentially more effective than policies discouraging divorce.
C21|Radioinactive: Are nuclear power plant outages in France contagious to the German electricity price?|Are nuclear power plant outages in France contagious to the German electricity price? In the case of the extensive inspections from October 2016 to February 2017 in 12 French nuclear power plants: Yes. This capacity shock increased the French electricity spot market price by 14.15 Euros per MWh. The German-Austrian electricity spot market price was affected, with an increase of 1.72 Euros per MWh through cross-border trade. Hence, the current market integration between France and Germany to balance supply and demand in times of capacity shocks is limited. These results derive from a quasi-experimental approach based on coarsened exact matching. Thereby, the exogenous nature of the capacity shock is exploited as a random treatment in order to identify causal effects.
C21|Alternatives to polynomial trend-corrected differences-in-differences models| A common problem with differences-in-differences (DD) estimates is the failure of the parallel-trend assumption. To cope with this, most authors include polynomial (linear, quadratic…) trends among the regressors, and estimate the treatment effect as a once-in-a-time trend shift. In practice, that strategy does not work very well, because inter alia the estimation of the trend uses post-treatment data. An extreme case is when sample covers only one period before treatment and many after. Then the trend’s estimate relies almost completely on post-treatment developments, and absorbs most of the treatment effect. What is needed is a method that i) uses pretreatment observations to capture linear or nonlinear trend differences, and ii) extrapolates these to compute the treatment effect. This article shows how this can be achieved using a fully flexible version of the canonical DD equation. It also contains an illustration using data on a 1994–2000 EU programme that was implemented in the Belgian province of Hainaut.
C21|Public versus Private Sector Wage Gap in Egypt: Evidence from Quantile Regression on Panel Data|This paper considers the public and private sector wage earners in Egypt and examines their wage distribution during 1998-2012 using Egyptian Labor Market Panel Survey. We estimate the public-private sector wage gap with Mincer wage equations both at the mean and at different quantiles of the wage distribution. In this process we take into account observable and unobservable characteristics of the individuals using the panel feature of the data with a fixed effects model. We address sector of employment selection issue for both males and females. We find that there is very little evidence of sample selection in our data. Therefore, we present both the selection corrected results and the results with no selection correction. We find a persistent public sector wage penalty for males and public sector wage premium for females in the face of extensive sensitivity checks. They are larger when unobserved heterogeneity is taken into account for males but insignificant for females. They are similar across the quantiles for males but, smaller at the top than at the bottom of the conditional wage distribution for females. We further examine the public sector wage gap over time and in different sub-groups according to age and education. The public sector wage penalty for males has decreased recently over time and is larger for the better educated and younger. We also find substantial regional differences in public sector wage gap for males.
C21|Evaluation of Language Training Programs in Luxembourg Using Principal Stratification|"In a world increasingly globalized, multiple language skills can create more employment opportunities. Several countries include language training programs in active labor market programs for the unemployed. We analyze the effects of a language training program on the re-employment probability and hourly wages of the unemployed simultaneously, using high-quality administrative data from Luxembourg. We address selection into training by exploiting the rich administrative information available, and account for the complication that wages are ""truncated"" by unemployment by adopting a principal stratification framework. Estimation is undertaken with a mixture model likelihood-based approach. To improve inference, we use the individual's hours worked as a secondary outcome and a stochastic dominance assumption. These two features considerably ameliorate the multimodality problem commonly encountered in mixture models. We also conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the unconfoundedness assumption employed. Our results strongly suggest a positive effect (of up to 12.7 percent) of the language training programs on the re-employment probability, but no effects on wages for those who are observed employed regardless of training participation. It appears that, in the context of an open and multilingual economy, language training improve employability but the language skills acquired are not sufficiently rewarded to be reflected in higher wages."
C21|Erreichbarkeit von Regelschulen in Deutschland: Eine Betrachtung des ersten Bildungswegs nach Primarstufe, Sekundarstufe 1 und Sekundarstufe 2|Bildungseinrichtungen, und hier insbesondere allgemeinbildende Regelschulen des ersten Bildungswegs, sind ein wichtiger Teilbereich der Daseinsvorsorge. Um eine Datengrundlage für die Diskussion zur Erreichbarkeit von Regelschulen des ersten Bildungswegs zu schaffen, wurde deren regionale Erreichbarkeit, gegliedert nach Primarstufe, Sekundarstufe 1 und Sekundarstufe 2, anhand des Thünen-Erreichbarkeitsmodells analysiert. Die Ergebnisse zeigen kleinräumig (in einem 250 m x 250 m - Raster) und flächendeckend für Deutschland wie lange es dauert, die nächste Regelschule des ersten Bildungsweges per zu Fuß, mit dem Fahrrad oder per Pkw zu erreichen. Aktuell sind alle untersuchten Schulen mit dem Pkw gut - d. h. in maximal 30 Minuten erreichbar. Grundschulen sowie Schulen mit Sekundarstufe 1 sind mit dem Fahrrad zu großen Teilen gut erreichbar: In 15 Minuten können 91 % der Bevölkerung eine Grundschule mit dem Fahrrad erreichen und 77 % der Bevölkerung eine Schule mit Sekundarstufe 1. Zu Fuß sind die untersuchten Regelschulen - die Siedlungsschwerpunkte ausgenommen - in weiten Teilen der ländlichen Räume kaum erreichbar.
C21|The Effects of a Parenting Program on Maternal Well-Being: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial|This paper evaluates how the Triple P parenting program affects maternal well-being. We analyze data from a randomized controlled trial and a separate sample of mothers from a deprived neighborhood without a control group. For the latter, we generate a control group using SOEP survey data and evaluate the validity of this procedure. Overall, our results show a positive effect of Triple P on maternal well-being – with the largest effects appearing three years after treatment. Thus, we illustrate that maternal well-being is an additional channel through which parenting programs, as examples of early childhood interventions, benefit families.
C21|Identification of Causal Intensive Margin Effects by Difference-in-Difference Methods|This paper discusses identification of causal intensive margin effects. The causal intensive margin effect is defined as the treatment effect on the outcome of individuals with a positive outcome irrespective of whether they are treated or not (always-takers or participants). A potential selection problem arises when conditioning on positive outcomes, even if treatment is randomly assigned. We propose to use difference-in-difference methods - conditional on positive outcomes - to estimate causal intensive margin effects. We derive sufficient conditions under which the difference-in-difference methods identify the causal intensive margin effect in a setting with random treatment.
C21|The role of individual preferences to explain the energy performance gap|The aim of this research is to understand the role of socio-economic characteristics and individual preferences to explain the energy performance gap in the residential sector. The gap reflects the difference between theoretical energy consumption of home assessed by engineering models and real energy consumption. Using the ratio of the two consumptions as a measure of the gap, we perform a quantile regression to tease out the effects of preferences on the entire distribution of the energy performance gap spectrum instead of focusing on the conditional average. As a result, this research provides an original contribution: depending on the sense of the gap, our findings suggest that some significant drivers are individual preferences for comfort over economy, explaining until 12% of the gap variability, and poverty. In such a context, some warnings to public authorities are provided regarding the issues of rebound effect and household welfare.
C21|Energy Consumption in the French Residential Sector: How Much do Individual Preferences Matter?|The aim of this research is to understand the impact of preference heterogeneity in explaining energy consumption in French homes. Using a discrete-continuous model and the conditional mixed-process estimator (CMP) enable us to address two potential endogeneities in residential energy consumption: energy prices and the choice of home energy characteristics. As a key contribution, we provide evidence that a preference for comfort over saving energy does have significant direct and indirect impacts on energy consumption (through the choice of dwelling), particularly for high-income households. Preferring comfort over economy or one additional degree of heating implies an average energy overconsumption of 10% and 7.8% respectively, up to 18% for high-income households. Our results strengthen the belief that household heterogeneity is an important factor in explaining energy consumption and could have meaningful implications for the design of public policy tools aimed at reducing energy consumption in the residential sector.

C21|An Exchange Rate Floor as an Instrument of Monetary Policy: An Ex-post Assessment of the Czech Experience|In November 2013 the Czech National Bank introduced a floor for the Czech koruna exchange rate as its monetary policy instrument. The rationale for this action was to prevent the risk of deflation in a zero-lower-bound environment where policy rates could not be lowered any further. The goal of this paper is to assess ex post the effect of the exchange rate floor on the Czech economy - inflation and the main real aggregates. The paper uses two different approaches. First, the official DSGE forecasting model is used to simulate the counterfactual macroeconomic dynamics of no introduction of a floor. Second, the paper applies an empirical approach: the synthetic control method and its generalised variant are used to estimate these counterfactual trajectories. Both approaches show that the floor prevented inflation from turning negative. Moreover, both methods indicate likely positive effects on macro variables and on various measures of inflation, although strongly statistically significant effects are only obtained for core inflation. The statistical significance for other variables is weaker or zero. We conclude that the introduction of the exchange rate floor was a correct policy action that has retrospectively been successful.
C21|The effect of abortion legalization on fertility, marriage and long-term outcomes for women|We evaluate the short- and long-term effects for women of access to subsidized, legal abortion by exploiting the Spanish legalization of abortion in 1985. Using birth records and survey data, we find robust evidence that the legalization led to an immediate decrease in the number of births to women aged 21 and younger. This effect was driven by provinces with a higher supply of abortion services. In those regions, young women affected by the reform were also less likely to marry. Using data from the Labor Force Survey and exploiting the rollout of abortion clinics across provinces and over time, we find evidence that the affected cohorts of women, who were able to postpone fertility as a result of the legalization of abortion, achieved higher educational attainment and had higher life satisfaction 20 years after the reform. We do not find evidence of increases in the probability of being employed.
C21|Electoral Institutions and Intraparty Cohesion|We study parties' optimal ideological cohesion across electoral rules, when the following trade-off is present: A more heterogenous set of candidates is electorally appealing (catch-all party), yet, it serves policy-related goals less efficiently. When the rule becomes more disproportional, thus inducing a more favorable seat allocation for the winner, the first effect is amplified, incentivizing parties to be less cohesive. We provide empirical support using a unique data-set that records candidates' ideological positions in Finnish municipal elections. Exploiting an exogenous change of electoral rule disproportionality at different population thresholds, we identify the causal effect of electoral rules on parties' cohesion.
C21|Shrinking Networks: A Spatial Analysis of Bank Branch Closures|As more consumers take advantage of online banking services, branch networks are declining across the country. Limited attention has been given to identifying any possible spatial patterns of branch closures and, more importantly, the community demographics where branches close their doors. This analysis uses an innovative spatial statistics concept to study financial services: Using data from 2010 to 2016, a random labelling test is conducted to understand branch closure clustering in the Philadelphia, Chicago, and Baltimore metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). Additionally, spatial autocorrelation is tested, and an MSA-level spatial regression analysis is done to see if there is a pattern to branch closures in metropolitan areas. I find evidence of branch closure clusters in the Chicago and Philadelphia MSAs; however, this spatial pattern is only observable within the suburbs, not the primary city itself. Using a random labelling test is a methodological innovation in regional economic studies and propels our understanding of banking deserts and underserved neighborhoods.
C21|First-Birth Gains and Losses from the First Job in Italy: The Role of Employment Uncertainty|Previous research on the link between employment uncertainty and fertility has focused on the existence of a statistically significant effect of contractual arrangements on fertility, largely disregarding the magnitude of the effect in question. In this article, we address this oversight for Italy using retrospective data from the nationally representative 2009 Family and Social Subjects survey. We adopt the potential outcome approach to causal inference to quantify the net effect of first jobs (temporary or permanent) on the propensity to have a first child within the first five years of employment. We find that 7% of first-birth losses among women and 5% of first-birth losses among men are attributable to employment uncertainty: they would have had a first child if they had had a permanent job. For women, first-birth losses are especially elevated among those with higher education (reaching 16%), while for men first-birth losses are pronounced among those with low and medium educational attainment.
C21|Can contract farming in organic basmati rice be a boon to smallholders? Evidence from India:| Demand for organic basmati rice (OBR), both at home and abroad, coupled with policy reforms in India have given rise to contract farming (CF) production in that nation. OBR production, however, is highly susceptible to weather and pest risks. This study investigates the impact of smallholdersâ€™ perceived production risks on their adoption of CF in OBR farming. We also assess the impact of CF in OBR production on yields, prices received, and the livelihood of OBR producers. We use farm-level data from smallholder basmati rice farms in India and the endogenous switching regression method to account for heterogeneity.
C21|Contract farming, productivity and fertilizer usage: Empirical evidence from specialty crop production| This study investigates the impact of contract farming (CF) in baby corn production on yield, irrigation costs, fertilizer costs and usage of chemical fertilizer. We find that adoption of CF by baby corn smallholders, after controlling for characteristics of both control and treatment groups, leads to higher yields and lower spending on fertilizers and irrigation. Additionally, CF in baby corn farming leads to a reduction in the use of chemical fertilizers (Urea and DAP). Thus, CF intervention benefits the livelihood of smallholders, reduces environmental degradation and reduces stress on groundwater without compromising yield.
C21|Instrument-based estimation with binarized treatments: Issues and tests for the exclusion restriction|When estimating local average and marginal treatment effects using instrumental variables (IV), multivalued endogenous treatments are frequently binarized based on a specific threshold in treatment support. However, such binarization introduces a violation of the IV exclusion if (i) the IV affects the multivalued treatment within support areas below and/or above the threshold and (ii) such IV-induced changes in the multivalued treatment affect the outcome. We discuss assumptions that satisfy the IV exclusion restriction with the binarized treatment and permit identifying the average effect of (i) the binarized treatment and (ii) unit-level increases in the original multivalued treatment among specific compliers. We derive testable implications of these assumptions and propose tests, which we apply to the estimation of the returns to (binary) college graduation instrumented by college proximity.
C21|The causalweight package for causal inference in R|We describe R package “causalweight” for causal inference based on inverse probability weighting (IPW). The “causalweight” package offers a range of semiparametric methods for treatment or impact evaluation and mediation analysis, which incorporates intermediate outcomes for investigating causal mechanisms. Depending on the method, identification relies on selection on observables assumptions or on instrumental variables when selection is on unobservables, approaches that may also be applied to tackle non-random outcome attrition and sample selection. Inference is based on the bootstrap.
C21|Machine learning with screens for detecting bid-rigging cartels|We combine machine learning techniques with statistical screens computed from the distribution of bids in tenders within the Swiss construction sector to predict collusion through bid-rigging cartels. We assess the out of sample performance of this approach and find it to correctly classify more than 84% of the total of bidding processes as collusive or non-collusive. We also discuss tradeoffs in reducing false positive vs. false negative predictions and find that false negative predictions increase much faster in reducing false positive predictions. Finally, we discuss policy implications of our method for competition agencies aiming at detecting bid-rigging cartels.
C21|Direct and indirect effects of continuous treatments based on generalized propensity score weighting|This paper proposes semi- and nonparametric methods for disentangling the total causal effect of a continuous treatment on an outcome variable into its natural direct effect and the indirect effect that operates through one or several intermediate variables or mediators. Our approach is based on weighting observations by the inverse of two versions of the generalized propensity score (GPS), namely the conditional density of treatment either given observed covariates or given covariates and the mediator. Our effect estimators are shown to be asymptotically normal when the GPS is estimated by either a parametric or a nonparametric kernel-based method. We also provide a simulation study and an application to the Job Corps program.
C21|Direct and indirect effects under sample selection and outcome attrition|This paper considers the evaluation of direct and indirect treatment effects, also known as mediation analysis, when outcomes are only observed for a subpopulation due to sample selection or outcome attrition. For identification, we combine sequential conditional independence assumptions on the assignment of the treatment and the mediator, i.e. the variable through which the indirect effect operates, with either selection on observables/missing at random or instrumental variable assumptions on the outcome attrition process. We derive expressions for the effects of interest that are based on inverse probability weighting by specific treatment, mediator, and/or selection propensity scores. We also provide a brief simulation study and an empirical illustration based on U.S. Project STAR data that assesses the direct effect and indirect effect (via absenteeism) of smaller kindergarten classes on math test scores.
C21|On the sensitivity of wage gap decompositions|This paper investigates the sensitivity of average wage gap decompositions to methods resting on different assumptions regarding endogeneity of observed characteristics, sample selection into employment, and estimators’functional form. Applying five distinct decomposition techniques to estimate the gender wage gap in the U.S. using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, we find that the magnitudes of the wage gap components are generally not stable across methods. Furthermore, the definition of the observed characteristics matters: merely including their levels (as frequently seen in wage decompositions) entails smaller explained and larger unexplained components than when including both their levels and histories in the analysis. Given the sensitivity of our results, we advise caution when using wage decompositions for policy recommendations.
C21|A heterogeneous coefficient approach to the knowledge production function| Past literature has used conventional spatial autoregressive panel data models to relate patent production output to knowledge production inputs. However, research conducted on regional innovation systems points to regional disparities in both regions’ ability to turn their knowledge inputs into innovation and to access external knowledge. Applying a heterogeneous coefficients spatial autoregressive panel model, we estimate region-specific knowledge production functions (KPFs) for 94 NUTS-3 regions in France using a panel covering 21 years from 1988 to 2008 and four high-technology industries. A great deal of regional heterogeneity in the KPF relationship exists across regions, providing new insights regarding spatial spillin and spillout effects between regions.
C21|ARE CONSUMER INFLATION EXPECTATIONS AN INTERNATIONAL PHENOMENON? Results of spatial panel regressions models|This study examines the potential drivers and their spatial components of inflation expectations of consumers in 22 European Union countries by using the spatial Durbin model. The potential determinants are drawn from the macrosphere (oil prices, food prices, house prices, industrial production), financial sphere (money market interest rates, nominal effective exchange rate, key policy rate), and economic favourable cognition variables (consumer confidence indicator, short-term inflation volatility, medium–term memory reversal of inflation expectations). The implemented binary spatial weight matrices are based on the geographical and economic distances. The economic distance weights define the European Union global trade partners as the most proximal neighbours. Our results confirm the existence of an inherent spatial component in short-term consumers’ inflation expectations even when excluding effect of inflation rate anchoring. This finding may provide a possible explanation for disruptions found in monetary policy transmission mechanism in small and open economies. From other perspective, the more interlinked consumers’ expectations may open the path to better business cycle synchronisation and strengthen the process of EA convergence, improving the conditions for efficient and effective monetary policy conduct.
C21|Corruption in space: A closer look at the world's subnations| The level of corruption differs not only between countries, but also between subnations within countries. In this paper, we analyze spatial interdependencies in corruption levels for a large sample of 1,232 subnations in 81 countries. Based on a spatial autoregressive model, which additionally corrects for spatial autocorrelation in the error term, we find that a subnation’s corruption level is positively affected by neighboring subnations’ corruption levels. This suggests that subnational corruption levels are strategic complements. Extending the core model and allowing for heterogeneous spatial interdependencies our results indicate that in particular high income subnations and subnations with a relative low corruption level tend to spill in space. This is due to their high degree of connectivity in terms of economic, sociocultural and political exchange with other subnations. Our findings underline the importance to consider not only a subnation’s own characteristics but also their degree of connectivity with other subnations when implementing effective anti-corruption policies on a local level.
C21|Energy Burden Alleviation and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction: Can We Reach Two Objectives With One Policy?|In this article, we assess French current public policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and abate household energy burden, through a simulation of changes in residential sector characteristics over the long run. We build on an existing partial equilibrium model to take into consideration key determinants of excessive energy burden among vulnerable households. This analysis reveals that current public policies are not sufficient to reach the ambitious objectives for reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions in France. Moreover, the decreases that might occur mask significant social disparities across households. The joint implementation of multiple instruments leads to interactions that diminish overall policy outcomes. Overall, current public policies produce estimated free-riding rates of 75%. Energy efficiency measures are thus insufficient in themselves; the government should focus more on monetary poverty as a cause of low home improvement rates and consider subsidizing renovation costs as a potential solution.
C21|Flexible dependence modeling using convex combinations of different types of connectivity structures|There is a great deal of literature regarding use of non-geographically based connectivity matrices or combinations of geographic and non-geographic structures in spatial econometrics models. We explore alternative approaches for constructing convex combinations of different types of dependence between observations. Pace and LeSage (2002) as well as Hazır et al. (2016) use convex combinations of different connectivity matrices to form a single weight matrix that can be used in conventional spatial regression estimation and inference. An example for the case of two weight matrices, W1,W2 reflecting different types of dependence between a cross-section of regions, firms, individuals etc., located in space would be: Wc=γ1W1+(1−γ1)W2,0≤γ1≤1. The matrix Wc reflects a convex combination of the two weight matrices, with the scalar parameter γ1 indicating the relative importance assigned to each type of dependence. We explore issues that arise in producing estimates and inferences from these more general cross-sectional regression relationships in a Bayesian framework. We propose two procedures to estimate such models and assess their finite sample properties through Monte Carlo experiments. We illustrate our methodology in an application to CEO salaries for a sample of nursing homes located in Texas. Two types of weights are considered, one reflecting spatial proximity of nursing homes and the other peer group proximity, which arise from the salary benchmarking literature.
C21|More harm than good? Sorting effects in a compensatory education program|"In this paper, we provide evidence that compensatory education policies that target schools in socially deprived areas are likely to create a negative signal resulting in a sorting effect. We investigate this effect by analyzing the French ""Réseaux ambition réussite"" (RAR) program, which targeted low-achieving and socially disadvantaged junior high schools between 2006 and 2011. We use an original geocoded individual data set and a regression discontinuity identification strategy to assess the causal effect of the RAR program on families’ school choice. We find that individuals do adjust to school-based compensatory education policies, since they tend to avoid schools that enter the RAR program by enrolling in the private sector. We also find that the RAR program increases social segregation across schools, since the most socially advantaged individuals tend to avoid schools that enter the RAR program more than other pupils, by enrolling in the private sector instead.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
C21|Roads and the spread of HIV in Africa|I here use GIS and HIV data from five African countries to estimate the effect of road proximity on HIV infection. I find a negative effect of the distance to the nearest paved road on the probability of being infected with HIV: a one standard-deviation fall in this distance (approximately 2.4 km) increases the probability of infection by 0.6–2.0 percentage points. Using slope as an instrument for road distance continues to produce a negative and significant estimated coefficient. However this relationship may also reflect selection and reverse causality in individual choice of location, and I extensively discuss the role of migration. While the number of lifetime sexual partners is significantly influenced by the presence of roads in some recent years, the effect of road distance on access to protection has disappeared.
C21|Nonlinear impact estimation in spatial autoregressive models|This paper extends the literature on the calculation and interpretation of impacts for spatial autoregressive models. Using a Bayesian framework, we show how the individual direct and indirect impacts associated with an exogenous variable introduced in a nonlinear way in such models can be computed, theoretically and empirically. Rather than averaging the individual impacts, we suggest to graphically analyze them along with their confidence intervals calculated from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We also explicitly derive the form of the gap between individual impacts in the spatial autoregressive model and the corresponding model without a spatial lag and show, in our application on the Boston dataset, that it is higher for spatially highly connected observations.
C21|A scan test for spatial groupwise heteroscedasticity in cross-sectional models with an application on houses prices in Madrid|We propose a scan test for the presence of spatial groupwise heteroskedasticity in cross-sectional data. The scan approach has been used in different fields before, including spatial econometric models, to detect instability in mean values of variables or regression residuals. In this paper, we extend its use to second order moments. Using large Monte Carlo simulations, we check the reliability of the proposed scan procedure to detect instabilities in the variance, the size and power of the test and its accuracy to find spatial clusters of observations with similar variances. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of this test to improve the specification search in a spatial hedonic model, with an empirical application on housing prices in Madrid.
C21|Urban segregation and unemployment: A case study of the urban area of Marseille – Aix-en-Provence (France)|In this paper, we study the effects of the spatial organization of the urban area of Marseille – Aix-en-Provence on unemployment there. More specifically, differences in the characteristics of the residential population induce urban stratification with the result that urban structure may affect the probability of employment. In order to evaluate the effects of spatial structure on unemployment, we implement a spatial probit model to reveal the employment probabilities of young adults still living with their parents. Our results support the hypothesis that living in or near a deprived neighborhood decreases the probability of employment.
C21|Accessibility, local pollution and housing prices. Evidence from Nantes Métropole, France|[eng] In this empirical article, we analyze the extent to which accessibility and environmental variables are capitalized in apartment prices in Nantes Métropole, France. Using a sample of 5,590 transactions in 2002, 2006, 2008 from the Perval database, we estimate a spatial hedonic price model that takes into account spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity. Special attention is also paid to the construction of environmental quality variables (noise exposure, air pollution). We find that apartment prices depend positively on proximity to Nantes city centre but that the public transport network (urban or non-urban) has no significant influence. Noise reduction is valued, but only at low or marginal levels of significance. Last, air quality does not significantly influence apartment prices. These results can be related to good accessibility and environmental quality in Nantes Métropole which probably makes households less sensitive to these issues than in other geographical contexts. This seems to provide little support for sustainable urban mobility plans favoring better accessibility, unless public authorities also target the greater awareness of the use of virtuous modes of transport.
C21|Energy Consumption in the French Residential Sector: How Much do Individual Preferences Matter?|The aim of this research is to understand the weight of preference heterogeneity in explaining energy consumption in French homes. Using a discrete-continuous model and the conditional mixed-process estimator (CMP) allows us to tackle two potential endogeneities in residential energy consumption: energy prices and the choice of equipment. As a major contribution, we provide evidence that preferences for comfort over energy savings do have significant direct and indirect impacts on energy consumption, especially for high-income households. Preferring comfort over economy or one additional degree of heating implies an average energy overconsumption of 10% and 7.8% respectively, up to 36% for high-income households. Our results strengthen the belief that household heterogeneity is a substantial factor in explaining energy consumption and could have meaningful implications for the design of public policy tools aimed at reducing energy consumption in the residential sector
C21|Optimal Cash Transfers with Distribution Regressions: An Application to Egypt at the Dawn of the XXIst Century|Social programmes for poverty alleviation involve eligibility rules and transfer rules that often proxy-means tests. We propose to specify the estimator in connection with the poverty alleviation problem. Three distinct stages emerge from the optimization analysis: the identification of the poor, the ranking of their priorities and the calculus of the optimal transfer amount. These stages are implemented simultaneous by using diverse distribution regression methods to generate fitted-values of living standards plugged into the poverty minimization programme to obtain the transfer amounts. We apply these methods to Egypt in 2013. Recentered Influence Function (RIF) regressions focusing on the poor correspond to the most efficient transfer scheme. Most of the efficiency gain is obtained by making transfer amounts varying across beneficiaries rather than by varying estimation methods. Using RIF regressions instead of quantile regressions delivers only marginal poverty alleviation, although it allows for substantial reduction of the exclusion of the poor.
C21|Increased Compulsory School Leaving Age Affects Secondary School Track Choice and Increases Dropout Rates in Vocational Training Schools|This paper examines the effects of increasing the compulsory school leaving (CSL) age from 16 to 18 in Hungary using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) identification strategy. The new CSL age was introduced for those entering their first year of elementary school in 1998. Identification is based on compliance with the age of elementary school start rule. Compliance with the age rule creates a discontinuity in the probability of starting school under the higher CSL age regime around a cutoff date of birth. The treated cohort had known about the change since age 6. This fact allows for testing on how the increase affected forward-looking decision making about secondary school track choice which occurs at age 14. The legislation change resulted in an increased probability that children would choose the academic high school track instead of vocational training schools. At the same time, those choosing vocational training schools are more likely to drop out under the higher CSL age scheme. Potential explanations of increased dropout rates include a decrease in the quality of teaching in vocational training schools due to supply constraints, and a shift in student composition to include more students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
C21|The Effects of Increased Compulsory School Leaving Age on the Teenage Fertility of Roma Women, a Disadvantaged Ethnic Minority|This paper examines the effects that an increase in compulsory school-leaving (CSL) age has on the teenage fertility (both motherhood and pregnancy) of Roma women, a disadvantaged ethnic minority in Hungary. We use a regression discontinuity design identification strategy based on exact date of birth. Increasing the CSL age from age 16 to 18 decreased the probability of teenage motherhood among Roma women by 6.8 percentage points. The higher CSL age delayed first birth-giving by two years. We exploit a unique database that covers live births, miscarriages, abortions, and still births, and contains information on the time conception precise to the week.We propose that the impact of the legislative change can be explained by the incapacitation effect of education: the higher CSL age decreases the probability of getting pregnant during the school year but not during summer and Christmas breaks.
C21|Instrumental variables based on twin births are by definition not valid|Instrumental variables based on twin births are a well-known and widespread method to find exogenous variation in the number of children when studying the effect on siblings or parents. This paper argues that there are serious problems with all versions of these instruments. Many of these problems have arisen because insufficient care has been given to defining the estimated causal effect. This paper discusses this definition and then applies the potential outcomes framework to reveal that instrumental variables based on twin birth violate the exclusion restriction, the independence assumption and one part of the stable unit treatment value assumption. These violations as well as the characteristics of the populations studied have contributed to hiding any true effect of the number of children. It is time to stop using these instrumental variables and to return to these important questions using other methods.
C21|Nonseparable Sample Selection Models with Censored Selection Rules|We consider identification and estimation of nonseparable sample selection models with censored selection rules. We employ a control function approach and discuss different objects of interest based on (1) local effects conditional on the control function, and (2) global effects obtained from integration over ranges of values of the control function. We provide conditions under which these objects are appropriate for the total population. We also present results regarding the estimation of counterfactual distributions. We derive conditions for identification for these different objects and suggest strategies for estimation. We also provide the associated asymptotic theory. These strategies are illustrated in an empirical investigation of the determinants of female wages and wage growth in the United Kingdom.
C21|Multiple Misbehaving: Loss Averse and Inattentive to Monetary Incentives|We study what determines taxpayers’ deduction behavior when filing tax returns. Preliminary deficits might be viewed as losses assuming zero preliminary balance as reference point. Swedish taxpayers may escape these losses by claiming deductions after receiving information about the preliminary balance. Furthermore, the Swedish income tax system has a substantial kink (20 percentage points) where the central government tax applies. Taxpayers slightly above the governmental tax kink have substantially higher (standard economic) incentives to claim deductions than taxpayers slightly below the kink. Using a regression kink and discontinuity approach with individual fixed effects, we study a panel of 4.1 million Swedish taxpayers in 1999 to 2006. We find strong causal effects of preliminary deficits on the probability of claiming deductions. The initial empirical evidence for a kink in deduction probability at the central government threshold, anticipated by standard economic theory, is weaker but significant. However, a more detailed analysis reveals that the kink at the tax threshold is not likely due to the tax incentives per se. When controlling for the preliminary tax deficit, the kink at the tax threshold disappears. Taxpayers just above the tax kink are namely more likely to run a preliminary tax deficit than those just below it. Hence, the most plausible explanation also for the kink at the tax threshold is therefore loss aversion and not standard economic incentives. The Swedish taxpayers are thus “misbehaving”, in a Thaler (2015) sense, on two separate margins: they are highly loss averse but surprisingly inattentive to standard monetary incentives.
C21|Ethnic Enclaves, Self-Employment and the Economic Performance of Refugees|In this paper I estimate the causal effect of ethnic enclaves on the probability of self-employment. To account for neighborhood selection I make use of a refugee dispersal program. Results indicate that larger ethnic enclaves, measured as the share of self-employed coethnics in the municipality immigrants first arrive into, effects the probability of self-employment positively, while the share of all other coethnics has a negative effect. Results however also indicate that there is a long term economic penalty to being placed with a larger share of self-employed coethnics, an effect which is partly mediated through the choice of selfemployment.
