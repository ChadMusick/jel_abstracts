P26|China's Lost Generation: Changes in Beliefs and their Intergenerational Transmission|Beliefs about whether effort pays off govern some of the most fundamental choices individuals make. This paper uses China’s Cultural Revolution to understand how these beliefs can be affected, how they impact behavior, and how they are transmitted across generations. During the Cultural Revolution, China’s college admission system based on entrance exams was suspended for a decade until 1976, effectively depriving an entire generation of young people of the opportunity to access higher education (the “lost generation”). Using data from a nationally representative survey, we compare cohorts who graduated from high school just before and after the college entrance exam was resumed. We find that members of the “lost generation” who missed out on college because they were born just a year or two too early believe that effort pays off to a much lesser degree, even 40 years into their adulthood. However, they invested more in their children’s education, and transmitted less of their changed beliefs to the next generation, suggesting attempts to safeguard their children from sharing their misfortunes.
P26|Social Ties and the Selection of Chinaâ€™s Political Elite|We study how sharing a hometown or college connection with an incumbent member of Chinaâ€™s Politburo affects a candidateâ€™s likelihood of selection as a new member. In specifications that include fixed effects to absorb quality differences across cities and colleges, we find that hometown and college connections are each associated with 5-9 percentage point reductions in selection probability. This â€œconnections penaltyâ€ is equally strong for retiring Politburo members, arguing against quota-based explanations, and it is much stronger for junior Politburo members, consistent with a role for intra-factional competition. We show that our findings differ sharply from earlier work both because of our more rigorous empirical specification as well as our emphasis on shared hometown and college â€“ rather than shared workplace â€“ connections.
P26|Priority roads: The political economy of Africa's interior-to-coast roads|Africa's interior-to-coast roads are well suited to export natural resources, but not to support regional trade. Are they the optimal resourse to geography and comparative advantage, or the result of suboptimal political distortions? We investigate the political determinants of road paving in West Africa across the 1965-2012 period. Controlling for geography and the endogeneity of democratization, we show that autocracies tend to connect natural resource deposits to ports, while the networks expanded in a less interior-to-coast way in periods of democracy. This result suggests that Africa's interior-to-coast roads are at least in part the result of suboptimal political distortions.
P26|The Unfinished Business of State-owned Enterprise Reform in the People’s Republic of China|This paper examines the progress of state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform in the People’s Republic of China. After defining SOEs and considering their scope of operation within the PRC economy, the focus of the paper is on the major reform waves that followed the deterioration of SOE profitability in the early 1990s. The oil industry serves to illustrate industry-specific SOE reform trends as well as the latest reform developments. Until today, a stable, successful, long-term arrangement of state ownership has remained elusive. SOE reform is incomplete as long as a number of fundamental governance issues are not resolved. But these are difficult to resolve in the context of Party-controlled state-owned enterprises.
P26|The Political Economy of the Prussian Three-class Franchise|Did the Prussian three-class franchise, which politically over-represented the economic elite, affect policy-making? Combining MP-level political orientation, derived from all roll call votes in the Prussian parliament (1867â??1903), with constituency characteristics, we analyze how local vote inequality, determined by tax payments, affected policy-making during Prussia's period of rapid industrialization. Contrary to the predominant view that the franchise system produced a conservative parliament, higher vote inequality is associated with more liberal voting, especially in regions with large-scale industry. We argue that industrialists preferred self-serving liberal policies and were able to coordinate on suitable MPs when vote inequality was high.
P26|Contracting for Counterintelligence: the KGB and Soviet Informers of the 1960s and 1970s|The informer network was a part of the human capital of the communist police state, which had the property of dissolving the freestanding social capital of ordinary citizens. How was it built, and what was the agency of the informers in the process? A few documents from the archives of the Soviet security police allow us to see good practices as the KGB saw them. They show some of the routes by which informers came to the attention of the KGB, their varied motivations, and their social and psychological strengths and weaknesses. The pivot of the process was a contract for counter-intelligence services. The contract itself was partly written, partly verbal or implied, and highly incomplete. Before the contract, searching and due diligence were required to identify potential recruits. After the contract, to turn a recruit into a productive informer involved a further period of training and monitoring, often extending to renegotiation and further investments by both sides in the capabilities of the informer and the relationship of trust with the handler. Trust and deception were two sides of the informer’s coin.

P26|Economía del desarrollo en Colombia. análisis de las coincidencias entre el paradigma propuesto por Rubén D. Utria y el enfoque de Amartya sen en las instituciones y libertades instrumentales|El desarrollo es un fenómeno complejo y dinámico que se refiere al proceso de transformación y evolución de las instituciones y los sistemas por medio de los cuales los individuos de un país se relacionan tanto con sus compatriotas como con las personas del resto del mundo. El enfoque económico predominante ha relegado a un segundo plano el análisis de variables importantes para el estudio del desarrollo, como lo son: el nivel de escolaridad media, la calidad del aire, el nivel de desigualdad, el nivel de confianza, el riesgo político de corrupción dentro de entidades gubernamentales, entre otros. El presente ensayo busca, apoyándose en los aportes teóricos de Amartya Sen y Ruben Darío Utria, analizar el desarrollo en Colombia desde una perspectiva más completa que la ofrecida por la teoría económica tradicional, la cual ha confundido el desarrollo con crecimiento y ha tratado de cuantificar el nivel de desarrollo de los países por medio del Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) per cápita. *** Development is a complex and dynamic phenomenon that refers to the process of transformation and evolution of institutions and systems through which individuals in a country relate both to their compatriots and people in the rest of the world. The dominant economic approach has relegated to the background the analysis of essential variables for the study of development, such as the average level of schooling, air quality, level of inequality, consumer confidence, the political risk of corruption within government entities, among others. The present essay seeks, based on the theoretical contributions of Amartya Sen and Ruben Darío Utria, aims to analyze development in Colombia from a more complete perspective than that offered by traditional economic theory, which has confused development with growth and has tried to quantify the level of development of countries through the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita.

P26|Russia’s socioeconomic policy in 2018: national goals and a model of economic growth|A number of unique anniversaries fell in 2018–2019: 30 years since the collapse of the communist system, 20 years since the start of the Asian economic crisis, 20 years since the introduction of the Euro (the new currency was introduced into noncash circulation on 1 January 1999), and 10 years since the development of the global structural crisis. There is a specific date that is important in the history of the Russian economy and economic policy: in 1999 the ten-year decline changed to economic growth, which led to doubling the GDP and a restoration of the pre-crisis level by 2008. These are not just anniversaries of events that remain in the past but key milestones of socioeconomic development that in many ways formed the priorities and phobias of the political elite of the world’s leading countries, both developed and developing. These events of the past continue to have significant influence of today’s economic policy.
P26|Coups, Regime Transitions, and Institutional Change|Coups and regime transitions are events that typically are intended to change the basic institutional framework of a country. Which specific policies change and the consequences of these changes nevertheless remains largely unknown. Change after a coup or transition implies that some form of political or judiciary barrier has been erected or removed. We therefore focus on what happens to the quality of judicial institutions and political corruption around coup attempts and other types of regime transitions. We hypothesize that when coups are conducted by members of the incumbent political elite, they are likely to remove barriers to change while coup makers outside of the ruling elite are more likely to do the opposite and thus protect themselves from what remains of the elite in the political system. Using the Bjørnskov-Rode coup data, our results suggest that successful coups are associated with degradation of institutions, with successful military coups in particular having a significant negative effect. Results are more varied for civilian coups where we find indications of differences depending on whether the coup makers are part of a political elite or not.
P26|Social Confusion and Corruption: Investigating the Causes and Effects of a Breakdown of Ethics|While studies of transitions to market economies have long focused on the issue of corruption, the perspectives from which their analyses have been based have diverged. Accordingly, this paper employs a systematic review through testing 14 hypotheses from the perspectives of political and economic causes, as well as culture and values, based on 559 works from the literature on the subject. Its findings make it clear that the liberalization and privatization of ownership both expand and contract corruption; the effects of culture and values also should not be overlooked, while mostly rejecting the so-called “greasing-the-wheels” hypothesis.

P26|Does homeownership hinder labor market activity? Evidence from housing privatization and restitution in Brno|We study the effects of homeownership on labor force participation and unemployment. We exploit housing privatization and restitution after the fall of communism as a source exogenous assignment of homeowner/renter status, using a unique dataset from the city of Brno, Czech Republic. We do not find any evidence of homeownership hindering labor force participation. In fact, our estimates suggest that homeownership reduces unemployment by four to six percentage points. Homeownership appears to decrease the risk of unemployment by about one third to one half, relative to renters. The estimated effects on labor force participation are systematically around zero.
P26|The Political Economy Consequences of China's Export Slowdown|We study how adverse economic shocks influence political outcomes in authoritarian regimes in strong states, by examining the 2013-2015 export slowdown in China. We exploit detailed customs data and the variation they reveal about Chinese prefectures’ underlying exposure to the global trade slowdown, in order to implement a shift-share instrumental variables strategy. Prefectures that experienced a more severe export slowdown witnessed a significant increase in incidents of labor strikes. This was accompanied by a heightened emphasis in such prefectures on upholding domestic stability, as evidenced from: (i) textual analysis measures we constructed from official annual work reports using machine-learning algorithms; and (ii) data we gathered on local fiscal expenditures channelled towards public security uses and social spending. The central government was subsequently more likely to replace the party secretary in prefectures that saw a high level of “excess strikes”, above what could be predicted from the observed export slowdown, suggesting that local leaders were held to account on yardsticks related to political stability.

P26|Punjab’s Agricultural Innovation Challenge|Fifty years ago, Punjab embarked on its famous Green Revolution, leading the rest of India in that innovation, and becoming the country's breadbasket. Now its economy and society are struggling by relative, and sometimes even absolute, measures. Using the original Green Revolution as a benchmark, this paper discusses five areas of challenge and promise for a new round of agricultural innovation in Punjab. These are: complexity of the agricultural economy, complementary inputs such as infrastructure, switching costs (including risks), balancing frontier innovation and adaptation, and the relative roles of the public and private sectors.
P26|Theories of Governance and Development: How Does India’s Experience Fit?|This paper takes on the apparent paradox of India’s combination of durable democracy, capable bureaucracy, but a deficient development trajectory. It begins by outlining the nature of the problem. Then it summarizes and compares some significant approaches to drawing connections from governance institutions to development outcomes. Next, it reviews some of the contributions to understanding India’s political economy in the last few decades. Finally, it attempts to draw some lessons from India’s experience for the application of different theories of governance and development. The central lesson is that the paradox recedes when attention is paid to the subnational level, where India’s states encompass considerable variation in initial societal and economic conditions and in development outcomes.
P26|Terrorist attacks and public approval and confidence in the Russian president: Evidence from time series analysis|In this paper we apply time series analysis to examine weekly data of Vladimir Putin’s approval and confidence ratings and their dependence on terrorist attacks. We find that minor terrorist attacks with few or no mortal casualties in Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan increase Putin’s ratings, while major terrorist attacks, with more than four mortal casualties, have a negative impact. There is also evidence that terrorist attacks in other Russian regions reduce Putin’s public approval; however, this evidence is weaker and depends on the model specification. The effects of terrorist attacks on the confidence rating are indistinguishable from the statistical noise. Furthermore, we control for main annual media events with President Putin’s participation: the television Q&A program `Direct Line with V. Putin', address to the Federal Assembly and a large annual conference. All three media events increase the president’s approval, with `Direct Line' having the least effect. Only the large annual conference has a significant positive impact on respondents’ confidence in Putin.
P26|Gorbachev versus Deng: A Review of Chris Miller's 'The Struggle to Save the Soviet Economy'|Chris Miller’s book is a historian’s account of Mikhail Gorbachev’s efforts to save the Soviet economy. Miller focuses on the question of why Gorbachev did not follow Deng Xiaoping and did not manage to reform the economy. Miller argues that it was not for the lack of understanding (Gorbachev did invest in learning China’s approach to reform and did understand it well), nor for the lack of trying. In fact, Gorbachev did try to implement Deng’s agricultural and industrial enterprise reforms. However, Gorbachev’s reforms were blocked by powerful vested interests. An inability to tackle the agricultural and industrial lobbies eventually resulted in the bankruptcy and collapse of the Soviet Union. While I generally agree with the political economy argument, I discuss a number of alternative explanations. I also discuss sources of Gorbachev’s weak state capacity and offer an evaluation of Gorbachev’s and post-Gorbachev reform efforts and mistakes based on the political economy research carried out in the last twenty-five years.
P26|Mostly Harmless Simulations? Using Monte Carlo Studies for Estimator Selection|We consider two recent suggestions for how to perform an empirically motivated Monte Carlo study to help select a treatment effect estimator under unconfoundedness. We show theoretically that neither is likely to be informative except under restrictive conditions that are unlikely to be satisfied in many contexts. To test empirical relevance, we also apply the approaches to a real-world setting where estimator performance is known. Both approaches are worse than random at selecting estimators which minimise absolute bias. They are better when selecting estimators that minimise mean squared error. However, using a simple bootstrap is at least as good and often better. For now researchers would be best advised to use a range of estimators and compare estimates for robustness.
P26|Did sanctions help Putin?|Do sanctions strengthen the targeted regime? I analyze the 2014 imposition of Western sanctions on Russia and its impact on voting. The US and the EU introduced targeted measures against Russian entities and individuals related to Putin's regime. Using polling station-level data I investigate whether Putin gained relatively more support among those local constituencies which were geographically close to a sanctioned firm. I find a significant effect of targeted sanction imposition on the vote share in presidential elections between 2012 and 2018. Putin gained 1.54 percentage points at those polling stations that had a sanctioned firm in immediate vicinity. Targeted sanctions imposition also affected voter turnout. The effect on voting can be explained as rally-around-the-flag in the face of sanctions, as long as voters did not endure economic losses through a decline in some sanctioned firms' economic performance.
P26|The persistent institutional effect of liberal colonialism: Evidence from China's financial policies|The effect of liberal colonialism on the allocation of capital persists to this day. As Lange et al. (Colonialism and development: A comparative analysis of Spanish and British colonies. 2006) define and suggest, the authors exploit the colonial history of China during 1896-1911 with qualitative evidence to measure liberal colonialism. They document that liberal colonialism promotes the subsequent efficiency of financial policies on capital allocation in 2004 through the quality of economic institutions.
P26|Will Ukraine Be Able to Establish Real Property Rights?|Over time, the necessary economic reforms have become so obvious that they have become politically possible in most places. The great problem has become the establishment of real property rights. By and large, Central and Eastern Europe have managed to accomplish that not least thanks to support from the European Union. In the former Soviet Union, however, only Georgia succeeded in that endeavor. The big question today is whether Ukraine will manage to do so, or whether it will be caught in a low-economic-growth trap. The three main elements that are needed are independent courts, autonomous prosecutors, and a law-abiding law enforcement, while no old secret police structures should be allowed to sabotage them.
P26|The mainstream economics interpretation of the local state and central-local relations in Post-Mao China: a critical review|Decentralization and the role of local governments have long been touted as key factors in the Chinese economic miracle. This paper intends to critically assess the chief theories advanced by mainstream economics in its attempt to make sense of these aspects of ChinaÃ­s growth story. Firstly the theoretical underpinnings of fiscal federalism, new institutional economics, and market-preserving federalism approaches will be presented, as these theories offer the bedrock for most of the applied insights in which China is framed through the lenses of the central-local relations debate. Secondly, the idea of Ã«market-preserving federalism, Chinese-styleÃ­ will be critically appraised, highlighting its shortcomings. Thirdly, the paper proceeds by bringing in the mainstream response to these problems, relying on the notion of political incentives and career concerns faced by local cadres. It will be argued that the continual adherence to some core tenets dear to the new institutional economics literature in all previous explanations prevents this broad camp of knowledge to properly grasp the complex dynamics of ChinaÃ­s decentralization drive and the role of local governments in the process. Finally, and in closing, an alternative approach will be offered.
P26|The Internet and the grassroots foundation of civil society in Indochina|It is widely believed that the social contract, credited to Magna Carta of Englandin the 13th century and subsequent thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes, JohnLocke, is the major factor that has empowered the concept of civil society in theworld, starting from the West. This perspective paper suggests that althoughthat still holds to a large extent, the case of Indochina shows a diametrical, andunnatural, difference as civic engagement in social matters of deep influence wasborn out of the state’s necessity to tolerate diverging voices, either bycontrolling, empowering or engaging, in order to cope with social conflicts. Thisobservation gives rise to the need for further studies on the nature of theinformation-power nexus in the age of big data and social networks.
P26|The Institutional Foundations of Religious Politics: Evidence from Indonesia|This paper explores the foundations of religious influence in politics and society. We show that an important Islamic institution fostered the entrenchment of Islamism at a critical juncture in Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim country. In the early 1960s, rural elites transferred large amounts of land into waqf —inalienable charitable trusts in Islamic law—to avoid expropriation by the state. Regions facing a greater threat of expropriation exhibit more prevalent waqf land and Islamic institutions endowed as such, including mosques and religious schools. These endowments provided conservative forces with the capital needed to promote Islamist ideology and mobilize against the secular state. We identify lasting effects on the size of the religious sector, electoral support for Islamist parties, and the adoption of local sharia laws. These effects are shaped by greater demand for religion in government but not by greater piety among the electorate. Waqf assets also impose costs on the local economy, particularly in agriculture where these endowments are associated with lower productivity. Overall, our findings shed new light on the origins and consequences of Islamism.
P26|Growing Up in a War: The Shaping of Trust and Identity After Conflict in Peru|This paper evaluates the effect of conflict over the formation of trust and identity. It finds that Peruvian individuals exposed to violent events during their impressionable years trust less government institutions, and feel less identified with their neighbors, while more identified with religious groups. The effect on identification is heterogeneous by the indigenous origin of the individuals. Individuals who own an agricultural plot embedded in a communal arrangement at the local level exhibit even smaller levels of identification with their local neighbours while higher levels of identification with their ethnic group. In line with recent literature, these findings suggest that conflict has a small but persistent effect on the formation of trust and identity, which is a central feature to understand the interaction between culture and institutions, and ultimately to understand the persistent consequences of wars.
P26|Political Connections and Firms: Network Dimensions|Business and politician interaction is pervasive but has mostly been analysed with a binary approach. Yet the network dimensions of such connections are ubiquitous. We use a unique dataset for seven economies that documents politically exposed persons (PEPs) and their links to companies, political parties and other individuals. With this dataset, we can identify networks of connections, including their scale and composition. We find that all country networks are integrated having a Big Island. They also tend to be marked by small-world properties of high clustering and short path length. Matching our data to firm level information, we examine the association between being connected and firm-level attributes. The originality of our analysis is to identify how location in a network, including extent of ties and centrality, are correlated with firm scale and performance. In a binary approach such network characteristics are omitted and the scale and economic impact of politically connected business may be significantly mis/under-estimated. By comparing results of the binary approach with our network approach, we can also assess the biases that result from ignoring network attributes.
P26|Institutions and Innovation: Evidence from Local Leaders in Chinese Cities|Against the backdrop of China’s transition from fast GDP growth to sustainable development, we explore the role of institutions, meritocracy in particular, in shaping innovative development. With manually-collected patent information and profiles for two types of leaders in 280 prefecture cities during 2001-2014, we find that promoting younger cadre with rich work experiences benefits innovation. In regard to the cadre selection regime, tenure and party competition positively correlate with innovation; the role of turnover differs depending on the leader’s type. Local leaders are more responsive to the central’s long-term innovation strategy in cities with lower GDP performance. These results are robust to the inclusion of other institutional factors such as decentralization, crackdown on corruption, and marketization as well as urban externalities and agglomeration. We provide fresh evidence of the leader’s role in promoting innovative development and generate rich policy implications to study meritocracy in China.
P26|Aristotle vs. Plato: The distributive origins of the Cold War|Competing definitions of justice in Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Politics indicate the existence of two distinct economic systems with different normative priorities. The three-class society of the Platonic economy (guardians, auxiliaries, producers) gives rise to guardians who by virtue are expected to enforce output targets on producers directly or through auxiliaries. The three-class society of the Aristotelian economy (rich, middle, poor) facilitates the emergence of different ruling coalitions and compensates efficiency losses of vertical production processes with political gains derived from representative governance. In the Aristotelian economy, the middle class is better off than in the Platonic economy (auxiliaries), because a just society (polity) is achieved under its rule. I argue that the equilibrium solutions of the Platonic and Aristotelian systems provide the normative foundations for the distinction between plan and market.
P26|Heterogeneous Effects of Property Rights on Housing Investment in Urban Peru|Empirical results reported by Field (2005) indicate that improved property rights tend to raise average housing investment among poor urban households in Peru. We investigate if this effect varies across households with differing incomes, how it evolves over time, and whether heterogeneous expectations about future tenure security matter for the estimated effects. The results indicate that the investment response among the poorest households represented by our sample is weak and not significant. Among households with higher incomes, the response is quantitatively large and statistically highly significant. The results further indicate that it may take several years until the response of long-run investment to reformed property rights can be found in the data. Finally, even though expectation of treatment affects the behaviour of non-treated households, the treatment effect changes only slightly when we take into account expectations in our previous estimations, indicating that our results are robust to this problem.
P26|Democratic development and credit : “Democracy doesn`t come Cheap” But at least credit to its corporations will be|Does democratization reduce the cost of credit? Using global syndicated loan data from 1984 to 2014, we find that democratization has a sizeable negative effect on loan spreads: a one-point increase in the zero-to-ten Polity IV index of democracy shaves at least 19 basis points off spreads, but likely more. Reversals to autocracy hike spreads more strongly. Our findings are robust to the comprehensive inclusion of relevant controls, to the instrumentation with regional waves of democratization, and to a battery of other sensitivity tests. We thus highlight the lower cost of loans as one relevant mechanism through which democratization can affect economic development.
P26|The rise of populism and the collapse of the left-right paradigm: Lessons from the 2017 French presidential election|"We examine the dislocation from the traditional left-right political axis in the 2017 French election, analyze support for populist movements and show that subjective variables are key to understanding it. Votes on the traditional left-right axis are correlated to ideology concerning redistribution, and predicted by socio-economic variables such as income and social status. Votes on the new diagonal opposing ""open vs closed society"" are predicted by individual and subjective variables. More specifically, low well-being predicts anti-system opinions (from the left or from the right) while low interpersonal trust (ITP) predicts right-wing populism."

P26|Economic transition and the rise of alternative institutions : Political connections in Putin's Russia|The economic transition from socialism in Russia has not resulted in the emergence of impersonal, rule‐based institutions. Instead, the natural demand for institutions that protect property rights has led to the emergence of alternative, inefficient institutions such as that of cronyism – the practice of appointing personal acquaintances of the political leader to key positions. A political leader not constrained by institutions appoints cronies, as competent subordinates are more prone to switching allegiance to a potential challenger. As competence makes a bigger difference in a rule‐based environment, such a leader has no interest in any institutional development. In a simple empirical exercise, using a dataset that covers the richest Russians, we find a positive and significant effect of direct connections to the personal circle of President Putin on the wealth of businessmen. The magnitude of the effect varies at different levels of rents available for redistribution and ‘network centrality of a businessman’: it is higher during the years of high oil prices, but is attenuated by the prominence of the businessman in the network.
P26|The Half Life of Economic Injustice|How much of today's income (GDP) is a result of unjust economic transactions? How much is a legacy of past acquisition of wealth (capital) which was itself unjust? To answer that question requires two things: first, a principle to determine what is, and what is not, a just acquisition of wealth or a just source of income; second, a means of using that principle to estimate what fraction of wealth and income is unjust. I use a principle put forward by Robert Nozick to provide the first of these things and then use some calculations based on standard neoclassical models of economic growth to illustrate its implications for the scale of unfairness today.
P26|Plunging into the Sea: Ideological Change, Institutional Environments and Private Entrepreneurship in China|This paper examines the integration of Chinese Communist Party membership and private entrepreneurship in China after 2002, when the Party revised its constitution and officially removed ideological discrimination against private entrepreneurs. Using six waves of a nationwide survey of privately owned enterprises in China from 1997 to 2008, we find that the constitutional change led to an exodus of Party members, and particularly senior officials, into the private sector. On the contrary, very few private entrepreneurs were admitted to the Party. The exodus of Party members was more prominent in regions with weaker market-supporting institutions. After the reform, Party affiliation is also shown to provide considerable private benefits to entrepreneurs, in the form of easier access to loans from state owned banks, reduced government expropriation, improved firms’ performance. These political rents were larger in regions with weaker market-supporting institutions.
P26|Firm-Level and Institutional Determinants of Corporate Capital Structure in Poland: New Evidence from the Warsaw Stock Exchange|This paper discusses how well major capital structure theories incorporate firm-level and institutional factors into short-term firm financing decisions in a specific context, that of a transition economy. Using a new dataset of non-financial companies quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange between 2007-2015, we argue that neither the trade-off nor the pecking order theories fully explain corporate debt policies in Poland. The results of dynamic panel data modelling highlight the importance of the strength of property rights and stock market capitalisation as driving forces behind corporate financing decisions.
P26|At the end of a global crisis: economic problems of 2017–2019|For ten years now the world has been living under the conditions of a structural crisis. This crisis cannot be described merely by fluctuating production rates, macroeconomic unbalance, or political instability. Its essence lies in the deep transformation that has taken over multiple aspects of life in the world’s leading countries, both developed and developing ones. One could say that it is a crisis of socioeconomic and political identity that has led to the formation of new realities (trends) that are likely to dominate the world for the next few decades to come. Over the decade-long duration of the crisis we have seen episodes of both expansion and contraction, of both acceleration and deceleration. But the key feature of this period is the general instability of all trends, especially economic growth, and the drastic increase in uncertainty around the consequences of both technological innovations and economic policy.
P26|The transformation of post-socialist capitalism – from developmental state to clan state?|Various characterisations exist of the model of post-social capitalism exist. While most typologies underscore the prominent role of the state in post-socialist capitalism compared to Western economies, the literature is less clear about what exactly this role consists of. For the case of East Central Europe, some authors underscore the weakness of the state and its ‘capture’ by business interests, while others attribute to the state a benign role in successful industrial restructuring. We show that both views are of limited use to understand the phase of ‘backsliding’ that these economies are currently experiencing. We draw on anthropological models of post-socialist states that focus on elite dynamics within the state and show that this focus allows us to interpret backsliding in Hungary as a reversal of the developmental state into a clan-state.
P26|Private Sector Policymaking|Candidates often tout their private sector experience when running for public office. But do businessperson politicians actually govern differently? This paper argues that given their preferences and managerial expertise, businesspeople in office will adopt policies favorable to the business community and improve government efficiency. To test these claims, I collect data on over 33,000 Russian mayors and legislators and investigate policy outcomes using detailed municipal budgets and over a million procurement contracts. Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that businessperson politicians increase expenditures on roads and transport, while leaving health and education spending untouched. Prioritizing economic over social infrastructure brings immediate benefits to firms, while holding back long-term accumulation of human capital. However, businesspeople do not reduce budget deficits, but rather adopt less competitive methods for selecting contractors, particularly in corruption-ripe construction. In all, businessperson politicians do more to make government run for business, rather than like a business.
P26|From Communism to Capitalism: Private versus Public Property and Inequality in China and Russia|This paper combines national accounts, survey, wealth, and fiscal data (including recently released tax data on high-income taxpayers) in order to provide consistent series on the accumulation and distribution of income and wealth in China and Russia over the 1978–2015 period. We contrast the different privatization strategies implemented in the two countries and observe their impacts on the evolution of inequality.
P26|Strengthened State Capitalism: Nationalized Firms in China|We examine the nationalization of listed firms in China. Using a manually collected data set of 115 cases of ownership transfer from private to state control, we find that nationalization is positively associated with firm performance. When we analyze potential mechanisms through which nationalization may affect firm performance, we find a positive effect on benefits in the form of market power, government subsidies and bank financing. We also identify significant costs in the form of a higher tax burden, higher employment costs, and higher levels of corporate donations following nationalization. Finally, we show that weak local institutions exacerbate the influence nationalization has on firm performance and the benefits and costs tied to a shift to state control. These findings shed light on the effects when the government actively takes a more prominent role in the economy by becoming a controlling shareholder in large companies.
P26|Political connections and firms : network dimensions|Business and politicians'interaction is pervasive but has mostly been analyzed with a binary approach, i.e. either a firm is connected to a politician or not. Yet the network dimensions of such connections are ubiquitous. This paper uses use a unique data set for seven economies that documents politically exposed persons and their links to companies, political parties, and other individuals. The data set is used to identify networks of connections, including their scale and composition. The analysis finds that all country networks are integrated having a Big Island. They also tend to be marked by small-world properties of high clustering and short path length. Matching the data to firm-level information, the paper examines the association between being connected and firm-level attributes. The originality of the analysis is to identify how location in a network, including the extent of ties and centrality, is correlated with firm scale and performance. In a binary approach, such network characteristics are omitted and the scale and economic impact of politically connected business may be significantly mis/under-estimated. By comparing the results of the binary approach with the network approach, the paper also assesses the biases that result from ignoring network attributes.
P26|Homeownership, Political Participation, and Social Capital in Post- Communist Countries and Western Europe|We study whether the positive effects of homeownership on political participation and social capital, found in developed market economies, extend to post-communist countries. We find that homeownership is strongly related to higher participation in local-level and national elections. In post- communist countries, homeownership is also related to higher social trust. However, the positive association between homeownership and volunteering found in developed market economies does not extend to post-communist countries. Together, our results corroborate that homeownership is associated with positive social benefits. However, these effects are highly heterogeneous and context- dependent.
P26|The Institutional Foundations of Religious Politics: Evidence from Indonesia|Why do religious politics thrive in some societies but not others? This paper explores the institutional foundations of this process in Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim democracy. We show that a major Islamic institution, the waqf, fostered the entrenchment of political Islam at a critical historical juncture. In the early 1960s, rural elites transferred large amounts of land into waqf—a type of inalienable charitable trust—to avoid expropriation by the government as part of a major land reform effort. Although the land reform was later undone, the waqf properties remained. We show that greater intensity of the planned reform led to more prevalent waqf land and Islamic institutions endowed as such, including religious schools, which are strongholds of the Islamist movement. We identify lasting effects of the reform on electoral support for Islamist parties, preferences for religious candidates, and the adoption of Islamic legal regulations (sharia). Overall, the land reform contributed to the resilience and eventual rise of political Islam by helping to spread religious institutions, thereby solidifying the alliance between local elites and Islamist groups. These findings shed new light on how religious institutions may shape politics in modern democracies.
P26|Development of Education and Health Services in Asia and the Role of the State|This paper analyses the dramatic spread of education and healthcare in Asia and also the large variations in that spread across and within countries over fifty years. Apart from differences in initial conditions and income levels, the nature of the State has also been an important determinant of these variations. This is because social development has typically been led by the State. But in most countries, public resource constraints and the growing dependence on private provision and private spending have generated a pattern of nested disparities in the access to education and healthcare between rich and poor regions, between rural and urban areas within regions, and between rich and poor households within these areas. However, as the better-off regions, areas, and households approach the upper limits of achievable education and health standards, a process of convergence is also underway as those left behind begin to catch up.
P26|Extra Votes to Signal Loyalty: Regional Political Cycles and National Elections in Russia|Under the system of appointing regional governors by the president, which existed in Russia between 2005–2012, governors’ loyalty to the central government and particularly their ability to deliver satisfactory results to the ruling party in national-level elections were crucial to their likelihood of being re-appointed for the next term. In this paper, we show that governors, anticipating the relationship between loyalty and re-appointments, attempted to increase their likelihood of being re-appointed by delivering additional votes to the ruling party, and that these attempts were subject to regional political cycles. We argue that delivering satisfactory results may have different importance to a governor depending on the stage of his term at which elections are held. If elections are held close to the expiration of a governor’s current term, the results are likely to be pivotal to his further political career. Exploiting variation in the starting and expiry dates of Russian regional governors’ terms of office, we find that the winning margins for a pro-government party across Russian regions in national-level elections held between 2007–2012 were substantially higher when elections were closer to the expiration of a regional governor’s term. However, for elections held between 1999–2004, when governors were subject to a direct vote by the regional population, no similar effect is found. We then implement several exercises to identify the source of the additional votes for the ruling party and demonstrate that governors, while unlikely using the means of electoral fraud, exerted efforts to stimulate turnout among ruling party supporters.
P26|Natural Resource Governance: Does Social Media Matter?|In this paper we study the relationship between communication and ”transparency of information” and governance by exploring the link between social media and natural resource governance. Using a cross-country analysis, we document a robust and statistically significant positive relationship between Facebook penetration (a proxy for social media) and natural resource governance. It follows that countries with higher facebook penetration levels enjoy natural resource governance of better quality than countries with low levels of facebook penetration. The positive effect of facebook is robust to controlling for other determinants of institutional quality, additional controls, outliers, inter alia.
P26|Institutional development in Transition Economies - The role of institutional experience|We examine the institutional development of a set of transition economies since the dissolution of the USSR, with a particular focus on the effect of natural resource dependency, EU accession and institutional experience. In a cross-sectional analysis these factors show a significant association with the different dimensions of institutional quality. To provide a more comprehensive picture of the development and to control for confounding factors, a Hausman-Taylor estimator on panel data is applied. This analysis confirms the positive relationship between institutional experience and institutional development; moreover, it also confirms the positive effects of the EU accession process on institutional development. Finally, resource dependency, although highly significant in the cross-section, has no significant relationship with average institutional quality in the panel. However, the panel results suggest that resource dependency has a negative effect on the quality of political institutions, while it has no significant association with administrative or legal institutions. Overall, the analysis highlights the persistent nature of institutions and indicates that experience of having independent institutions can affect the pace and path of institutional development.

P26|A Model of Tournament Incentives with Corruption| We provide a theory of how growth, corruption, and a low-powered public-sector pay scale coexist in a stable equilibrium in the early stage of China's development. The regionally decentralized authoritarian regime of China features lower-level government officials competing for promotion to a higher level in the government by generating local economic growth, and calls for high-powered incentives to elicit effort from the the officials. However, this is at odds with the generally low-powered public-sector pay scale in China. We propose a principal-agent model, where the principal represents the Chinese people's desire to pursue economic growth and the agents are the government officials delegated with production tasks and organized in a tournament, to address how a low-powered pay scale can effectively elicit effort in a tournament infested with widespread corruption.
P26|"The Distortionary Effects of Incentives in Government: Evidence from China's ""Death Ceiling"" Program"|"We study a 2004 program designed to motivate Chinese bureaucrats to reduce accidental deaths. Each province received a set of ""death ceilings"" that, if exceeded, would impede government officials' promotions. For each category of accidental deaths, we observe a sharp discontinuity in reported deaths at the ceiling, suggestive of manipulation. Provinces with safety incentives for municipal officials experienced larger declines in accidental deaths, suggesting complementarities between incentives at different levels of government. While realized accidental deaths predict the following year's ceiling, we observe no evidence that provinces manipulate deaths upward to avoid ratchet effects in the setting of death ceilings."
P26|Capitalism and Socialism: A Review of Kornai's Dynamism, Rivalry, and the Surplus Economy|Understanding the nature of capitalism has been a central theme of economics. The collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the global financial crisis spurred the reemergence of the political economy as a new frontier and the revival of interest in the nature of capitalism. Janos Kornai's book Dynamism, Rivalry, and the Surplus Economy: Two Essays on the Nature of Capitalism fills an important intellectual gap in understanding the dynamic nature of capitalism by comparing it with its mirror image, socialism. To further develop the themes contained in the book, serious challenges are posed theoretically and empirically, as well as in subjects, such as hybrid capitalism.
P26|Why Does China Allow Freer Social Media? Protests versus Surveillance and Propaganda|In this paper, we document basic facts regarding public debates about controversial political issues on Chinese social media. Our documentation is based on a dataset of 13.2 billion blog posts published on Sina Weibo--the most prominent Chinese microblogging platform--during the 2009-2013 period. Our primary finding is that a shockingly large number of posts on highly sensitive topics were published and circulated on social media. For instance, we find millions of posts discussing protests, and these posts are informative in predicting the occurrence of specific events. We find an even larger number of posts with explicit corruption allegations, and that these posts predict future corruption charges of specific individuals. Our findings challenge a popular view that an authoritarian regime would relentlessly censor or even ban social media. Instead, the interaction of an authoritarian government with social media seems more complex.
P26|Winning Competitive Grants For Regional Development in Albania: The Role of Local Leaders|In post-socialist countries, regional development and decentralization has been a fast process accompanied by strong deregulation and significant institutional changes. Despite the reforms in Albania, local government units (LGUs) are often significantly underfunded, understaffed and depend heavily on grants from the central government. The focus of this study is the Regional Development Fund (RDF), a competitive investment fund which finances LGUs investments. We aim to analyze the factors influencing the LGU access to RDF funds, based on a survey with LGU leaders. Political affiliation of the LGU leader, networking and the knowledge the LGU leader about the RDF procedure are important factors affecting access to RDF funds. Interestingly, however, the factors that correlate with the number of applications are different from those that explain the success rate of those applications. Our findings call for a further institutionalization of the process in order to reduce the (informal) personal and political affiliation based influences in the RDF competition.
P26|Industrial Espionage and Productivity|In this paper, we investigate the economic returns to industrial espionage by linking information from East Germany's foreign intelligence service to sector-specific gaps in total factor productivity (TFP) between West and East Germany. Based on a dataset that comprises the entire flow of information provided by East German informants over the period 1970–1989, we document a significant narrowing of sectoral West-to-East TFP gaps as a result of East Germany's industrial espionage. This central finding holds across a wide range of specifications and is robust to the inclusion of several alternative proxies for technology transfer. We further demonstrate that the economic returns to industrial espionage are primarily driven by relatively few high quality pieces of information and particularly strong in sectors that were closer to the West German technological frontier. Based on our findings, we estimate that the average TFP gap between West and East Germany at the end of the Cold War would have been 6.3 percentage points larger had the East not engaged in industrial espionage.
P26|The Impacts of Rural Property Rights on Urban Unemployment, Wage Inequality, and Welfare in Developing Countries|This paper establishes a three-sector general equilibrium model to explore how rural property rights influence urban unemployment, skilled-unskilled wage inequality and social welfare in developing countries. Strengthened rural property rights generate the rent-gaining effect and the productivity-enhancing effect, and the interaction of these two effects determines the changes of urban unemployment, skilled-unskilled wage inequality and social welfare. In addition to the aforementioned two effects, the agricultural sector’s wage elasticity of unskilled labor demand also matters for the change of wage inequality.
P26|Foreign Aid in Areas of Limited Statehood|We review the aid effectiveness literature to assess whether foreign aid given to areas of limited statehood can be expected to promote economic and social outcomes in the recipient country. We distinguish different types of aid, motives for granting it, recipient country policies and characteristics, and modalities by which aid is delivered, as these factors have been argued to influence the effectiveness of aid. In short, aid is most likely to be successful if given for non-strategic motives, and if given to recipient countries with “good” policies and democratic institutions. Fragmented aid and aid amounts that exceed the absorptive capacity of the recipient reduce the effectiveness of aid. We then compare these properties between recipients most affected by limited statehood and those least affected. This allows us to assess the relative effectiveness of aid in countries with areas of limited statehood. We conclude that on average aid given there is less likely to be effective than elsewhere.
P26|Democracy and Credit “Democracy Doesn`t Come Cheap” But At Least Credit to Its Corporations Will Be|Does democratization reduce the cost of credit? Using global syndicated loan data from 1984 to 2014, we show that democratization has a sizeable negative effect on loan spreads: a one point increase in the zero-to-ten Polity IV index of democracy shaves on average 21 basis points off spreads. Reversals to autocracy hike spreads more strongly. Our results are robust to the comprehensive inclusion of relevant controls, to the instrumentation with regional waves of democratization, and to a battery of sensitivity tests. We thus highlight the lower cost of loans as one relevant mechanism through which democratization may affect economic development.
P26|Can television bring down a dictator? Evidence from Chile’s “No” campaign|Can televised political advertising change voting behavior in elections held in authoritarian regimes? We study the case of Chile, where the opposition used television campaigns weeks before the election that ended the seventeen-year dictatorship known as the Pinochet regime. Using national surveys conducted before the election and administrative electoral data, we provide evidence of a positive effect of television exposure on opposition votes. When compared to similar estimates in democracies, the effect of campaigns in Chile appear large. These results suggest that televised political campaigns can help to defeat dictators at the polls.

P26|The Externalities of Corruption: Evidence from Entrepreneurial Activity in China|We show that corruption affects negatively the performance of small entrepreneurial firms, which compete with corrupted industry peers. We exploit the Chinese anti-corruption campaign to establish causality and identify the channels through which corruption causes negative externalities. Small firms have lower sales growth in industries with high corruption, arguably because demand is diverted to the largest firms in their industries, which spend more in corrupting officials. Small firms also have higher financing costs in industries with high corruption and therefore invest less. Furthermore, corruption decreases the efficiency of labor and capital allocation and deters firm entry.
P26|The signal effect of Government R&D Subsidies in China: Does ownership matter?|R&D subsidies as a policy instrument are used to reduce market failure, apart from its input and output additionality, the notion of behavioural additionality has caused increasingly interest. We focus on the signal/certification effect of behavioural additionality, which means that government grants may serve as a signal for private investors. The signal effect is a certification enhancing a firm's access to external finance. The objective is to examine the impact of different ownership nature to the signal/certification effect. We use data on Chinese listed corporations from 2009 to 2013. The results show that receiving R&D subsidies increases the likelihood that firms will raise external finance, and the state-owned enterprises can receive more subsidies than private enterprises. However, the signal effect of R&D grants is stronger in private enterprises than that in state-owned enterprises of China, indicating that the ownership nature does matter in the R&D subsidies certification effect. This paper enriches current literature of government R&D subsidies by providing empirical evidences in Chinese mixed market.
P26|Nationalism and economic openness: The cross-country evidence revisited|In this paper we examine the empirical relationship between economic openness and nationalism. We replicate and extend the cross-country analysis of Lan and Li (2015) using additional measures of nationalism and additional years of data from the World Values Survey. We fail to find the negative relationship between economic openness and nationalism that Lan and Li (2015) find, even when using the same data sources, years and sample of countries. When we expand the sample of countries and years of the data, we find no statistically significant relationship between economic openness and nationalism.
P26|Rise of ‘Red Zaibatsu’ in China: entrenchment and expansion of large state-owned enterprises, 1990-2016|Ever since Deng Xiaoping’s reforms commencing in the 1980s, how to improve efficiency of state-owned enterprises has been on the government agenda. Progress has been made but more slowly than one expects in the decade. Even worse, against all the odds, China’s large state-owned firms, mega-SOEs, the backbone of Maoist economy previously, have gained exponential growth in the past decade. Reforms of that part of the economy have stalled. Why? To reveal the rationale and mechanisms of the rise of mega-SOEs, this study establishes a two-stage game model for an ‘authoritarian market economy’ (or a ‘market-Leninist economy’) where market monopoly and rent-seeking by state-owned conglomerates is firmly entrenched. Our findings confirm a ‘subgame perfect Nash equilibrium’ in China’s authoritarian market economy that has led the state (the owner or ‘principal’) and the large state-owned firms (the manager or the ‘agent’) to a paradox which prevents continuous reforms towards a Pareto solution for efficiency improvement.
P26|Thou shalt not steal. Taking aversion with legal property claims|Abstract Some recent experimental literature on the taking game (a variation of the dictator game) suggests that human subjects may generally be taking averse, implying that the moral cost of taking exceeds the moral cost of not giving. In our experiment, our subjects could decide to take tangible objects (lottery scratchcards) brought from outside the lab and thus legally owned by other subjects. This legal treatment was compared with a more standard one where subjects earned their scratchcards inside the lab. Evidence is provided of a (weak) taking aversion that is greater when property is established inside the lab via an effort task than when it is pre-existing and legally enforceable outside the lab
P26|Endogenous political turnover and fluctuations in sovereign default risk|A sovereign default model in which the sovereign derives private benefits from public office and contests elections to stay in power is developed. The economy's growth process is modeled as a Markov switching regime, which is shown to be a better description of the data for our set of emerging economies. In the model, consistent with evidence, the sovereign is less likely to be reelected if economic growth is weak. In the low-growth regime, there is higher probability of loss of private benefits due to turnover, which makes the sovereign behave more myopically. This growth-linked variation in effective discount factor is shown to be important in generating volatility in sovereign spreads.
P26|Does corruption hinder investment? Evidence from Russian regions|This paper investigates the relationship between corruption and fixed capital investment in the setting of a corrupt country. Using different measures of corruption – registered cases of bribe taking and incidents of experienced corruption by the population – we find a negative relationship between investment and corruption. We then address the problem of endogeneity of corruption using an instrumental variables approach: when corruption is instrumented with freedom of the press and violations of journalists' rights, we find an even bigger negative effect. Disaggregating investment by ownership-type shows that only private investment is affected by corruption, but not investment made by state-owned companies. The negative effect is larger for companies with full or partial foreign ownership. Additionally, we look at the relationship between corruption and foreign direct investment (FDI): similar to the investment in fixed capital, we find a negative relationship; however, its statistical significance varies across specifications with different data sources for FDI and different corruption measures.
P26|The lessons of stabilization and prospects of growth: Russia’s economic policy in 2016|The world is searching for a new socioeconomic development paradigm, which is sometimes referred to as the “new reality.” Judging by the previous structural crises (in the 1930s and 1970s), this search takes about a decade characterized by volatile economic trends, political crises, and social instability. Past experience should by no means be applied bluntly to the future, and the actual duration of the “turbulent decade” can only be determined by future economic historians. However, it is now evident that the key issue on the political and intellectual agenda is a new economic growth model, its potential rates and sources.
P26|Dictators’ Behavior Under Conditions of Economic Sanctions Cumulative Effect|Economic sanctions, like the most of political events involving numerous states, are almost always explicitly aimed to alter internal policies and affect domestic issues. Sanctions are not a discrete event, rather they are a long lasting insidious process. It is significant to consider not only the state of the country under sanctions or without them, but also the effect of the time under sanctions. Hence, the research question is as follows: How does cumulative effect of sanctions influence the dictators behavior in terms of repressions and co-optation? In order to find a feasible answer to that question, first, we build a theoretical model and draw empirical implications from it. The main argument that we develop in the paper is as follows. The overall effect of sanction is robustly important for the dictator, fostering repressions and co-optation (separately treated) as the ways of buttressing the regime legitimacy. Moreover, cumulative effect of sanctions (i.e. the influence of all the previous periods under sanctions) increases the levels of repressions with decreasing marginal effects.
P26|Ownership dynamics and firm performance in an emerging economy: a meta-analysis of the Russian literature| This paper provides a meta-analysis of studies on the effect of ownership on the performance of Russian firms over 20 years of rapid institutional and economic changes. We review 29 studies extracted from the EconLit and Web of Science databases with a total of 877 relevant estimates. We find that the government negatively affects company performance regardless of its administrative level. In contrast, private ownership is positively associated with firm performance. However, the effect size and statistical significance are notably varied among different types of private ownership. While the effect of insider (employee and management) ownership is comparable to that of foreign investors, the effect of domestic outsider investors is considerably smaller. Our assessment of publication selection bias reveals that the existing literature does not contain genuine evidence for a series of ownership types and, therefore, some of the findings have certain limitations.
P26|Industrial Espionage and Productivity|In this paper, we investigate the economic returns to industrial espionage by linking information from East Germany’s foreign intelligence service to sector-specific gaps in total factor productivity (TFP) between West and East Germany.

We further demonstrate that the economic returns to industrial espionage are primarily driven by relatively few high quality pieces of information and particularly strong in sectors that were closer to the West German technological frontier. Based on our findings, we estimate that the average TFP gap between West and East Germany at the end of the Cold War would have been 9.5% larger had the East not engaged in industrial espionage.
P26|Can More Information Lead to More Voter Polarization? Experimental Evidence from Turkey|Many claim that increased availability of information via both old and new media drives political polarization, possibly undermining democratic institutions. However, rigorous evidence on this topic remains limited. I address this gap by conducting two experiments during a recent Turkish referendum that was on an important institutional change to weaken constraints on the executive. First, I designed a randomized door-to-door campaign. In this campaign, the opposition party gave uniform information on poor economic performance and increased terrorist activity under the incumbent's leadership to more than 130,000 voters. I show that voters, despite receiving the same information, diverged further in their vote choice on aggregate, leading to a significant increase in ideological polarization. The result is consistent with a model where polarization in vote choice is driven by differences in reaction to the same information and not self-segregation to different information sources, as others have assumed. The opposition failed to increase its vote share in this campaign, on aggregate, because it lacked the necessary data to target the subset of constituents that interpreted the information in their favor. In a second experiment with politicians, I confirm that the opposition had inadequate data on voters relative to the incumbent based on an analysis of roughly one million of their tweets. The evidence from both experiments, taken together, suggests that the incumbent party can exploit its access to higher quality data on voters to maintain its grip on power and advance an agenda that weakens democratic checks and balances.
P26|Signal and Political Accountability: Environmental Petitions in China|"Vertical accountability in China has long been considered as essentially indirect or informal. This paper provides evidence that direct local accountability may exist to a greater or lesser degree in China under current political institutions. By using provincial environmental petition data, this paper finds that the number of environmental petitions is positively associated with provincial governments' investments in pollution mitigation. The increased petitions serve as a signal to provincial leaders of the possibility of potential social instability. However, since ""local"" provincial party secretaries are better informed, the signaling effect of the petitions is lessened in these cases."
P26|China's Lost Generation: Changes in Beliefs and their Intergenerational Transmission|"Beliefs about whether effort pays off govern some of the most fundamental choices individual make. This paper uses China's Cultural Revolution to understand how these beliefs can be affected, how they impact behavior, and how they are transmitted across generations. During the Cultural Revolution, China's college admission system based on entrance exams was suspended for a decade until 1976, effectively depriving an entire generation of young people of the opportunity to access higher education (the ""lost generation""). Using data from a nationally representative survey, we compare cohorts who graduated from high school just before and after the college entrance exam was resumed. We find that members of the ""lost generation"" who missed out on college because they were born just a year or two too early believe that effort pays off to a much lesser degree, even 40 years into their adulthood. However, they invested more in their children's education, and transmitted less of their changed beliefs to the next generation, suggesting attempts to safeguard their children from sharing their misfortunes."
P26|Crime, Transition, and Growth|This paper analyses whether the effect of crime on growth depends on the structural changes caused by transition. The result of the simple model suggests that when the structure of economy changes, the cost of economically motivated crime will also change; thus, affecting the impact of crime on economic performance. Using data for some of the republics of the former Soviet Union, we find support for this conjecture.
P26|Half-Forgotten Personalities of Economic Thought - O. R. Lange|O. R. Lange, a Polish economist, statistician, econometrician, sociologist, politician and diplomat was classified as a reformist Marxist. He became famous for studies on planning and socialist economies. Lange demonstrates and proves the possibility of the existence of an effective socialist system. He also analyzed capitalist economy, e.g., the issue of cyclical fluctuations and unemployment.
P26|Toward a Unified Theory of Economic Reform|The dichotomy in the economics of transition literature with regard to the reform speed (Gradualist vs Radical Approach) and reform strategy (incremental reform vs structural reform) fails to capture the essence of the transitional process of a transitional economy that was ever under the control of planned economic system. In this paper, we construct a system dynamics model to provide a unified theoretical framework to illustrate that reform speed and reform strategy are inherently intertwined. We propose 4 optimal reforming combinations between reform speed and reform strategy to track the transitional trajectories of different transitional economies since 1980s. These 4 optimal reforming combinations are: (1) Incremental reform in radical speed. (2) Incremental reform in gradualist speed. (3) Structural reform in radical speed. (4) Structural reform in gradualist speed. In this paper, we demonstrate that a transitional economy would adopt one of the aforementioned 4 optimal reforming combination if and only if it minimizes the reforming cost incurred during the shock period of radical reform as well as the dual track period of gradualist reforms. Several factors in our model affecting these 4 optimal reforming combinations are also discussed. These factors include the spillover effect (both vertical and horizontal) of a newly established reforming promotion sector on other old sectors in a transitional economy, the endogenous reform damping coefficient determined by one transitional economyâ€Ÿs initial conditions and the reform damping coefficient determined by the dual track system during the gradualist reform process.
P26|Relationship between good governance and economic growth - A contribution to the institutional debate about state failure in developing countries|Numbers of economists of development consider that good governance, defined as the quality management and orientation of development policies has a positive influence on economic performance. The question is what content the literature gives to the concept of governance? According to the World Bank, good governance is evaluated by the implementation capacity of governance principles of a country, providing a framework for market development and economic growth. Several econometric studies (Kauffman et al. (1999, 2005), Knack et al. (1999) tested the relationship between good governance in the sense of ”market-enhancing governance” (stimulus institutions market) and showed a positive relationship between good governance and economic growth. However a good governance policy is allows developing countries to achieve minimum economic growth and political reforms in order to reach a level of development similar to that of industrialized countries? We focus on the definition and the work on the concept of good governance made by the World Bank and criticism formulated by Mushtaq Khan (2002.2004), who reconstructed the notion of governance in a broader sense, taking into account the capacity of states to drive structural change in institutional, political, economic and social fields, in order to ensure longterm economic growth. Is good governance can explain economic performance? Or according to the thesis of Mushtaq Khan (2002, 2004), reforms of economic structures and government capabilities are the first step to improve economic performance of developing countries, and in a second step to allow economic growth to enhance good governance? Following several works of neo-institutionalist economists on the relationship between economic growth and good governance (Kauffman D. and al.1999, 2005, Knack S. and Keefer P. 1997, Hall, R. Jones, C.1999, Clague, C. Keefer P., Knack S. and Olson M., 1997, Barro R., 1996, Rodrick D., 1995, 1997, and 2002) emerged two divergent theories of ”state failure” in developing countries: The first thesis (market Enhancing governance) defended by neo-institutionalist authors consider the state as a sovereign role and welfare state. Economically, the proper functioning of markets is correlated to the proper functioning of institutions through efficient practice of state governance, what is commonly called ”good governance”. Therefore, underdevelopment and low economic growth performance of countries could be explained by a ”state failure” and the components of good governance with the increase in corruption, instability of property rights, market distortions, and lack of democracy. The second thesis (growth Enhancing governance) developed in particular by Mushtaq Khan (1995, 2004, 2005, 2006) and partly by Dany Rodrik (1995,1997,2002), concerns the ability of the state to implement social change and a voluntary policy of economic development: The transition of developing countries towards a capitalist system comparable to that of developed countries, can not operate without the establishment of efficient institutions in relation with distribution of political power in these countries. Conversely, those countries would face a state failure, as a result of a mismatch between institutions and economic policy for development. Our research consists first to present the results of an empirical model that we have done based on a panel of developing countries chosen by region (MENA, Latin America, and Asia) and due to their natural resource endowment. The aim is to check if growth rate may or may not be correlated with good governance indicators as defined by the World Bank. The goal is to lead in a second time an analysis of criticism made by Mushtaq Khan on the definition of governance, the causes of state failure and barriers to economic development. Our contribution is to discuss the concept of good governance and the failure of states that take into account the level of development and governance capacity that is based on a structure and distribution of political power that evolves in time and may or may not be positive for growth. The assumption we make here is that the so-called good governance policies are relevant if countries reach a sound level of economic and social development that enable institutions of good governance to boost growth.
P26|Ancestry, Diversity & Finance: Evidence from Transition Economies|In this paper, we analyze the growth effects of historical and biological ancestry, diversity and financial development in transition economies. We show that the common indicators of ethnolinguistic fractionalization, state history and genetic distance yield significant results and to some extent transform the impact of finance on growth in East-Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. Deep ethnolinguistic cleavages produce insignificant results, whereas at intermediate and lower levels of aggregation diversity is likely to significantly improve the effect of finance on growth. Similarly to finer ethnolinguistic cleavages, genetic distance from the United States also favorably increases the relevance of financial development for growth. However, state history as a proxy for long-run ancestral exposure to institutions, political organization and centralization reinforces the negative growth effect of financial development. We argue that financial development is inclined to resolve problems arising from coordination failures and absence of trust in diverse societies by easing liquidity constraints and offering incentives for entrepreneurship to minority groups. In contrast, long state history is likely to generate extractive institutions that facilitate the provision of soft budget constraints. Genetic distance from the United States induces higher reliance on continental rather than Anglo-Saxon financing practices, and therefore increases dependence on banks rather than bonds or equity for external liquidity purposes.
P26|Acequias as Commons|Acequias are a form of commons used to share scarce surface water for agricultural purposes. They have existed in the arid southwestern United States for centuries. In this paper I will argue that acequias are pre-capitalist organizations that convey important lessons for a post-capitalist world. The paper will also discuss La Vega, a grazing commons supported by the Hispanic culture. Both forms of the commons help to sustain low-income households many of whose members do not have regular or full-time wage-labor jobs, and they provide examples of sustainable agriculture in a fragile, high altitude environment. Within the study of political economy, they are an example of political struggles in the arena of material production and reproduction.
P26|Accounting for Inequality|Pikettyâ€™s study of capital and inequality, especially the distribution of the national income through a â€œcapital-labor split,â€ is examined and compared with a model developed from data sets from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Pikettyâ€™s inclusion of executive supersalaries as labor income is questioned as over-estimating laborâ€™s share of national income distribution and laborâ€™s role as a causal factor in the intensification of inequality.
P26|Estrategias y actitudes del poder local ante la privatización de las tierras concejiles en la España interior (Ciudad Real, 1855-1910)|Interest in the issue of communal land and the attitude of rural society and its elites to the disentailment process has increased in recent years. Much progress has been made in learning about what happened in various parts of Spain, but we know very little about the specific case of the interior. This paper aims to fill this historiographical gap through an examination of what happened in the province of Ciudad Real, a territory with important communal assets that virtually disappeared due to the disentailment process. Based on a wide range of sources that are mostly unpublished, this study focuses on the attitudes and strategies of local authorities in relation to the sale of municipal land. The findings indicate that there was no consensus among the local authorities; their range of actions was extremely variable and ranged from positions in favour of disentailment among the most powerful local elites to an attitude of resistance among mid to small-sized towns. The end result of this research offers a model that differs significantly from what happened in other parts of Spain.
P26|El negocio de la trashumancia en el siglo XVIII: la cabaña de Rojas (1746-1808)|This article attempts to clarify how sheep and goat transhumance developed within the Crown of Castile during the second half of the eighteenth century. It analyses the case of the Rojas herd from the accounting and administrative documentation preserved in the Count of Bornos Archive (Nobility Section of the National Historical Archive). The study establishes that although the evolution of prices adversely affected overall income from sheep and goat commerce, it continued to be profitable until the War of Independence. Nevertheless, in order to maintain the total volume of revenue, the decrease in the profit per unit had to be compensated with an increase in the number of heads of cattle, which required access to new pastures. As a result, the social position of the herd owners grew in importance. Moreover, it seems that over the course of this period there was a significant redistribution of the income generated by transhumance, which benefitted large-scale ranchers at the expense of the smaller-scale operations and shepherds.
P26|Vamos a la Playa vs. Standing at the Gates: Beaches in Bulgaria|Beaches at the Bulgarian Black Sea coast were primarily a public good until the mid 1990s. By then the Bulgarian government granted private investors temporary property rights by providing concessions. Consequently, many beaches show characteristics of club goods nowadays. On a national level the process can be considered as a reallocation of public resources, thus affecting the well-being of many. This paper focuses on three aspects of this process and contributes to the ongoing discussion of how to handle public resources by addressing the case of beaches in Bulgaria. Firstly, we describe the process as it could be observed for beaches in Bulgaria in order to provide an analytical basis for further research. Secondly, stakeholders and their interests are identified. Thirdly, the paper points at conflicts between the different types of shareholders.
P26|Precision-Guided or Blunt? The Effects of US Economic Sanctions on Human Rights|We use endogenous treatment-regression models to estimate the causal average treatment effect of US economic sanctions on four types of human rights. In contrast to previous studies, we find no support for adverse effects of sanctions on economic rights, political and civil rights, and basic human rights. With respect to women's rights, our findings even indicate a positive relationship. Emancipatory rights are, on average, strengthened when a country faces sanctions by the US. Our findings are robust when applying various changes to the empirical specification. Most importantly, this study provides strong evidence that the endogeneity of treatment assignment must be modelled when the consequences of sanctions are studied empirically.
P26|Corruption in Russia|We analyze the determinants of corruption in Russia using law enforcement data on corruption incidents for a panel of 79 Russian regions for the period 2004-13. We find that the relative salaries of bureaucrats determine corruption levels: corruption declines as relative salaries rise, yet at strongly diminishing rates. Furthermore, we show that even very limited media freedom helps to curtail corruption. Other important determinants are the strength of law enforcement, education levels, and unemployment rates.
P26|Reassessing the Economic Effects of Post-Socialist Constitutions Using the Synthetic Control Method|In response to the problems of endogeneity and causality in comparative studies with relatively small sample sizes, a new statistical approach has recently been developed, called the synthetic control method. In this paper we apply this method to reassess the effect of constitution-making in post-socialist countries of Europe and Asia on performance of these countries in the field of economic reforms during the post-1989 transition. We first verify the existence of such effects and evaluate their statistical significance. Then we search for the explanation of these effects and their magnitude focusing on the characteristics of these constitutions and the solutions that they envisage (structural provisions, bills of rights and enforcement mechanisms). Thanks to employing this approach we are able to avoid several technical caveats that have arisen in earlier studies and verify the validity of their conclusions. In addition, we obtain country-specific results for each individual post-socialist state, as well as formulate detailed insights regarding the actual mechanisms or channels of influence of the constitutional framework on economic reforms.
P26|Post-Socialist Constitutions: The De Jure - De Facto Gap, Its Effects and Determinants|In this paper we aim to contribute to the debate on constitutional rules and their economic effects by extending the focus to the de jure – de facto constitutional gap. Firstly, we provide evidence that the size of this gap matters as non-compliance lowers the effectiveness of the constitutional commitment mechanism. Secondly, we identify several explanans of this gap, in particular relating to the democratization process, political conflict, age and comprehensiveness of the constitution. We base the conclusions on an empirical study for the unique setting of the post-socialist countries of Europe and Asia, which all enacted new constitutional frameworks after 1989, and argue that the constitutions in these countries acted primarily as blueprints.
P26|Agricultural policies in Kazakhstan| Agriculture plays an important part in Kazakhstan's self-image, and continues to be a significant economic sector, employing about a third of the workforce. In the two decades since independence, agriculture has experienced dramatic swings in performance and in public policy. During the 1990s the sector suffered from external shocks, reduced public support and inchoate land tenure reform, while providing a safety net for families suffering from the transitional recession. Since the turn of the century, the booming economy has seen rural-urban migration and substantial public funds devoted to the agricultural sector. This article illustrates the steps taken to consolidate and improve Kazakhstan's position as a major agricultural producer and exporter, while also highlighting the shortcomings of current policies. It places Kazakhstan's agricultural policy evolution in the broader context of political independence from the Soviet Union and the general course of economic reforms. We highlight the driving forces of agricultural policy evolution from a political economy perspective and give an overview of specific policy measures.
P26|Precision-Guided or Blunt? The Effects of US Economic Sanctions on Human Rights|This study contributes to the literature that analyzes the consequences of economic sanctions for the target country’s human rights situation. We offer a political economy explanation for different types of human rights infringements or improvements in reaction to economic shocks caused by sanctions. Based on this, we derive hypotheses linking sanctions to four types of human rights: economic rights, political and civil rights, basic human rights, and emancipatory rights. We use endogenous treatment regression models to estimate the causal average treatment effect of US economic sanctions on each type of human rights within a uniform empirical framework. In contrast to previous studies, we find no adverse effects of sanctions on economic rights, political and civil rights, and basic human rights, once the endogenous selection into sanctions is modelled. With respect to women’s rights, our findings even indicate a positive relationship. Emancipatory rights are, on average, strengthened when a country experiences sanctions by the US. Our findings are robust and we find little evidence for effect heterogeneity between types of target countries or sanctions. Most importantly, this study shows that the endogeneity of treatment assignment must be modelled when the consequences of sanctions are studied empirically.
P26|The Economic Costs of Mass Surveillance: Insights from Stasi Spying in East Germany|Based on official records from the former East German Ministry for State Security, we quantify the long-term costs of state surveillance on social capital and economic performance. Using county-level variation in the spy density in the 1980s, we exploit discontinuities at state borders to show that higher levels of Stasi surveillance led to lower levels of social capital as measured by interpersonal and institutional trust in post-reunification Germany. We estimate the economic costs of spying by applying a second identification strategy that accounts for county fixed effects. We find that a higher spy density caused lower self-employment rates, fewer patents per capita, higher unemployment rates and larger population losses throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Overall, our results suggest that the social and economic costs of state surveillance are large and persistent.
P26|Popular Attitudes toward Markets and Democracy: Russia and United States Compared 25 Years Later|We repeat a survey we did in the waning days of the Soviet Union (Shiller, Boycko and Korobov, AER 1991) comparing attitudes towards free markets between Moscow and New York. Additional survey questions, from Gibson Duch and Tedin (J. Politics 1992) are added to compare attitudes towards democracy. Two comparisons are made: between countries, and through time, to explore the existence of international differences in allegiance to democratic free-market institutions, and the stability of these differences.
P26|Corruption in Procurement and the Political Cycle in Tunneling: Evidence from Financial Transactions Data|"We provide evidence of corruption in allocation of public procurement and assess its efficiency. Firms with procurement revenue increase tunneling around regional elections, whereas neither tunneling of firms without procurement revenue, nor legitimate business of firms with procurement exhibits a political cycle. Data are consistent with the corruption channel—cash is tunneled to politicians in exchange for procurement contracts—and inconsistent with alternative channels. Using the strength of correlation between procurement revenue and tunneling around elections as a proxy for local corruption, we reject the ""efficient grease"" hypothesis: in more corrupt localities, procurement contracts go to unproductive firms. (JEL D22, D72, H57, K42, P26, P31, P37)"
P26|State and Development: The Need for a Reappraisal of the Current Literature|This essay tries to bring out some of the complexities that are overlooked in the usual treatment of the state in the institutional economics literature and supplement the latter with a discussion of some alternative approaches to looking at the possible developmental role of the state. It refers to a broader range of development goals (including the structural transformation of the economy) and focuses on problems like the resolution of coordination failures and collective-action problems, the conflicting issues of commitment and accountability and the need for balancing the trade-offs they generate, some ingredients of state capacity and political coalition building usually missed in the literature, the possible importance of rent sharing in a political equilibrium, the advantages and problems of political centralization and decentralization, and the multidimensionality of state functions that may not be addressed by markets or private firms.

P26|Central And Eastern Europe’S Transition To A Market Economy And The European Integration: With Special Attention To Mitterrand’S Project Of European Confederation|In 1989 system changes occurred one after another in Central and East European countries. Immediately after the system changes there were two approaches to the problem of what the future of Central and Eastern Europe would be like. One was pan-European confederation proposed by French President Francois Mitterrand, and another was Jeffrey Sachs’ idea proposing a shock therapy and a breakup of the COMECON region. In practice Sachs’s idea, which was supported by the US government, was adopted. The USA, which played a shadow leading actor in the postwar European integration, again played the same role in the transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. Although not adopted, Mitterrand’s project included a grand plan of gradual changes of Central and Eastern Europe based on his historical insight and concern for ethnic problems. Peace has come to Central European and Baltic countries. In contrast, however, the shock therapy affected the Balkans negatively. In the former Yugoslavia the government succeeded in suppressing hyperinflation with the shock therapy, but its damage to the economy was very severe, intensifying conflicts among republics, leading to the breakup of the federation and ethnic conflicts.In South Eastern Europe exactly a Europe of “Sarajevo” that Mitterrand feared was revived.
P26|Privatization In Serbia – An Assesment Before The Last Round|Serbia has had a long history of privatization. It commenced in 1990 and was only fully completed, as defined by the privatization legislation, in 2015. The reasons for this are many and complex and the paper provides a short historical overview. Privatization, however, began in earnest after the democratic revolution of 2000 and the paper analyses the political motives behind the adoption of the current model. The paper goes on to explain the model design, as well as its dynamics and results. The analysis probes more deeply into the specific weaknesses of auction implementation, showing that an alternative approach could have produced better results in terms of revenue. The specific institutional flaws that led to a high failure rate in the privatization of companies are identified and analysed. These weaknesses lie in the design, implementation, and monitoring, which led to results that were not in line with the goals of the privatization process. The designers of the privatization model gave scant attention to broader institutional coherence, which enabled largescale manipulation of the process. In some cases this enabled motives unrelated to the future of the firm being privatized to dominate the process. Finally, the scope of the, last round of privatization in Serbia, which commenced in June 2015, and the probable results are discussed.
P26|The Limits of Career Concerns in Federalism: Evidence from China|Performance-based promotion schemes in administrative hierarchies have limitations. Chinese provincial leaders, despite facing strong career concerns, make different policy decisions depending on their career backgrounds. Provincial party secretaries who have risen from low to high positions within the province they govern (“locals”) spend a higher share of budgetary resources on education and health care and invest less in construction infrastructure than party secretaries who have made their most significant career advancements in other provinces (“outsiders”). Identification comes from variation in central leadership and term limits. As the promotion mechanism rewards infrastructure investments, locals are less likely to be promoted at the end of the term. We explore various mechanisms and provide evidence that the difference between locals and outsiders is not driven by knowledge or experience. Several pieces of evidence suggest that locals cater to low-level provincial elites, who helped them rise to power. Thus, local career trajectories limit the power of career concerns by fostering competing allegiances.

P26|Elections, protest and trust in government: A natural experiment from Russia|How do flawed elections and post-election protest shape political attitudes? Taking advantage of the largely exogenous variation in the timing of a survey conducted in Moscow, we examine the short-term impact of the parliamentary election of December 4th, and the large protest of December 10th on trust in the Russian government. The fraud-marred parliamentary election had little effect on attitudes toward government, perhaps because allegations of vote improprieties were not new information. In contrast, the large protest of December 10th increased trust in government. Heightened trust arises largely from non-supporters of the ruling party updating their beliefs rather than from social desirability bias, a perceived improvement in government performance, or a “halo” effect. This finding is consistent with the view that autocrats can increase trust in government by unexpectedly allowing protest without repression. It also suggests that when evaluating trust in government citizens may cue not off the content of the protest, but off the holding of the protest itself.
P26|Land rights, rental markets and the post-socialist cityscape|Inefficiently organized, factory-dominated cityscapes have been one of the more enduring legacies of the twentieth century experiment with socialist central planning in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Drawing on a unique survey of large, formerly state-owned urban industrial firms in Russia, we explore how land tenure reforms affect the pace at which this legacy is being erased. Specifically, the privatization of plots is shown to promote the development of a rental market that transfers land use rights away from socialist-era industrial users. We address the potential endogeneity of land tenure in two ways, including using a measure of regional variation in urban land policy as an instrumental variable.
P26|"""Get rid of the four olds"": the long-lasting impact of the Chinese Cultural Revolution on Chinese society"|This paper studies the long-term impact of the Chinese Cultural Revolution on interpersonal trust, mental health and perceived equality. The Cultural Revolution was a social upheaval in China between 1966 and 1976 initiated by China’s leader Mao Zedong that resulted in a period of anarchy, violence and chaos as well as a large number of deaths, injuries and much persecution across China and was in particular targeted at intellectuals and the wealthy. The Cultural Revolution is likely to have had a long-lasting impact on social capital and preferences as well as on mental well-being. Using data from the Chinese General Social Survey as well as county level data on the number of abnormal deaths and victims of political persecution between 1966 and 1971 from Walder and Su (2003), I use a difference-in-difference strategy comparing individuals born before the Cultural Revolution with those born thereafter as well as across different counties to estimate the impact of Cultural Revolution intensity measured by victims and abnormal deaths on interpersonal trust, depression and perceived equality. To control for potential endogeneity due to unobservables as well as for measurement error, I instrument Cultural Revolution Intensity with the number of universities in a county at the time of the Cultural Revolution. I find that the Cultural Revolution is associated with lower levels of interpersonal trust, perceived equality and depression for more educated individuals born before the Cultural Revolution. These results are largely robust to a battery of tests. This shows that violence and conflict can have long-lasting effects on societies and that the consequences of the Cultural Revolution persist in China up to today.
P26|The Politics of Partial Liberalization: Cronyism and Non-Tariff Protection in Mubarak's Egypt|This paper provides one of the first systematic empirical assessments of the impact of political connections on trade protection. Based on a unique compilation of sector-level data on non-tariff measures (NTMs) and politically connected businessmen in Mubarak-era Egypt, we explore the within-sector variation in NTMs over time, and show that sectors populated by politically connected businessmen witnessed systematically higher incidence and density of non-tariff protection. Our results suggest that the presence of cronies is a strong predictor of the subsequent introduction of NTMs. Crony presence also shapes the density of NTMs as measured by the share of products subject to NTMs. Our results are derived from the robust empirical methods that simultaneously address temporal dependence, fixed effects and endogeneity concerns. To establish causality, we take advantage of the across the board cut in tariffs in the wake of the EU-Egypt free trade agreement in 2004-05 to show that sectors with crony activity were compensated significantly more by new NTMs than non-crony sectors.
P26|The Impact of Privatization on Economic Growth: The Case of Uzbekistan|This paper clarifies the macroeconomic gains from privatization during the transition period in Uzbekistan. The choice of this country is due to its stable macroeconomics performance beginning from 1996 onwards, and author’s related work experience at The State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan for Privatization. Based on the macroeconomic empirical literature on growth, we supplement the standard model of gross domestic product growth with other transition-specific variables to investigate the impact of privatization on economic growth. In so doing, we found that economic growth was significantly influenced by investment (more importantly investment to the education), and employment growth. Several other institutional components specific to the transition process, particularly the private sector and capital market development, and small-scale privatization were also found to be significant determinants of economic development in Uzbekistan.
P26|Social insurance with Chinese characteristics: The role of communist party in private firms|This paper studies the inter-correlation among the Communist Party of China (CPC), unionization, and social insurance in a sample of Chinese private firms. We find that both Party branch and unionization are positively associated with insurance coverage. We further present evidence that Party branch and unionization are complements in association with better coverage of social insurance. When the Party–union complementarity is taken into account, Party branch alone is no longer positively associated with social insurance, while the correlation between unionization and insurance declines significantly. Our results suggest that the role of the CPC is overlooked in the literature on labor relations in China.
P26|Globalization, political institutions, financial liberalization, and performance of the insurance industry|This paper investigates the impacts of globalization, political institutions, and financial liberalization on the performance and risk-taking of insurance firms covering 1324 individual firms in 30 selected OECD countries. We find that greater globalization and a stable political institution lead insurance companies to exhibit a better performance—i.e., insurers adjust their strategies while being aware of institutional changes. By contrast, financial liberalization has an inverse impact on insurance company performance. Thus, greater globalization and a stable political environment both drive less risk-taking for insurers. These findings are particularly important to insurance markets’ competitors and national policymakers.
P26|Accumulated social capital, institutional quality, and economic performance: Evidence from China|This paper provides evidence from China that historically accumulated social capital affects the current economic performance by improving contemporary institutional quality. Using historical data, we employ the Elites Studying Abroad rates of the years 1847–1949 for each Chinese province as a proxy for accumulated social capital. Our empirical investigation shows that historically accumulated social capital strongly and significantly affects the current economic performance because it can improve current social capital and institutional quality. This argument is strongly robust across multiple controls such as geography information, climates, natural resources, historical economic conditions, and economic policies.
P26|The evolution of firm-level distributions for Ukrainian manufacturing firms|We document rich variation across observed firms’ characteristics, and the accompanying macroeconomic volatility, often related to political turmoil for Ukrainian manufacturing firms. We use a unique annual firm-level data for the period from 2001 to 2009 compiled from the Derzhkomstat. To understand the evolution of distributions we utilize functional principal component analysis while accounting for the effects associated with firms’ region, industry, trade status, and firm turnover. The overall improvements in firm productivity in Ukraine’s manufacturing in 2001–2009 vary substantially by industry, trade status and with firm turnover, while regional effects are less important.
P26|Violence and political outcomes in Ukraine—Evidence from Sloviansk and Kramatorsk|In this paper, we study the effects of violence on political outcomes using a survey of respondents in Sloviansk and Kramatorsk – two cities that were affected heavily by the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. We show that experiencing physical damage goes together with lower turnout, a higher probability of considering elections irrelevant and a lower probability of knowing one's local representatives. We also find that property damage is associated with greater support for pro-Western parties, lower support for keeping Donbas in Ukraine and lower support for compromise as a way to stop the conflict. Our paper thus shows the importance of investigating the impact of different kinds of victimization, as different degrees of victimization can have different, sometimes even conflicting outcomes. Our paper also suggests that one of the more optimistic conclusions of previous studies, that victimization can increase political participation, does not necessarily carry over to Ukraine, which illustrates the importance of country and context-specific studies.
P26|The allocation of entrepreneurial efforts in a rent-seeking society: Evidence from China|This paper considers four types of entrepreneurial efforts: productive activities, aggressive rent seeking, defense against rent extraction, and leisure. It examines how entrepreneurs allocate efforts when facing dual-dealing relationships with politicians in a rent-seeking society: entrepreneurs not only pursue additional benefits through rent seeking, but also try to avoid extortions by politicians. Using unique city-level and firm-level data across China, we demonstrate that Chinese entrepreneurs survive in a twisted world: ordinary entrepreneurs would desire better institutional environment, but if institutional improvement is not available, they would prefer political connections which are often preoccupied by special interest groups and/or large-sized firms.
P26|Inside and outside: The modernized hierarchy that runs China|Describes the process through which China has rebuilt and strengthened its bureaucracy since 1978 without moving toward rule of law. Internally, the bureaucracy has become more rule-governed, and new procedures have been introduced, including regular rules for promotion, credentialing, and turnover, including term limits. However, external accountability is absent. The huge difference between “inside” and “outside” may be a unique feature of the Chinese system.
P26|Political frictions and public policy outcomes|We study the role of political frictions in public policy outcomes. We propose a simple model of fiscal policy that combines a lack of commitment by the government, political turnover, and another political friction that can be interpreted either as political polarization or as public rent-seeking. We show that political turnover increases public debt levels, while political polarization or public rent-seeking leads to higher public spending. We evaluate the importance of different political frictions for fiscal policy outcomes using a sample of twenty developed countries. We find that the data on political instability combined with the data on public rent-seeking explain 25% of the variation in public debt levels.
P26|From one to many central plans: Drug advertising inspections and intra-national protectionism in China|This paper provides the first micro-level evidence for the existence and patterns of intra-national protectionism in China. We demonstrate that drug advertising inspections are used by provincial governments to discriminate against firms from outside the province. We further reveal systematic patterns in the degree of discrimination across firms: those from neighboring areas, those from regions with more economic links to the destination province, those from provinces with a stronger presence in the market, and those with political ties to “allied” provincial governments are less likely to be targeted. Our findings highlight the unique politico-economic structure in China and confirm that giving local governments strong incentives to compete with each other may exacerbate the market distortions inherent in a partially reformed economy.
P26|Religious origins of democracy & dictatorship|Weber considered the Protestant work ethic the foundation of modern capitalism. I extend Weber's theory by arguing that states with predominantly Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Muslim populations have had a stronger inclination toward underdevelopment and dictatorship than states with Protestant or Jewish majorities. This is the case because their respective religious collectives (monastery, tariqa) promote the hierarchical provision of common goods at the expense of market incentives. I define the aforementioned three religions as collectivist, in contrast to Protestantism and Judaism, which I define as individualist. I provide a historical overview that designates the Jewish kibbutz as the collective of democracy and the Eastern Orthodox monastery as the collective of dictatorship. Focusing on collectivist economies, I find that modernization, as a credible commitment to the improved future provision of public goods, occurs when the threat of a radical government is imminent and when the leader has high extraction of rents from the economy. The emergence of radical governments is more likely in collectivist than in individualist economies. Historical illustrations from collectivist economies include the Russian Revolution, the Islamic Revolution in Iran, and the postwar welfare state in Western Europe.
P26|Psychological costs of currency transition: evidence from the euro adoption|This paper assesses the perceived individual psychological costs of adhering to the Euro. We use the difference-in-differences approach (DD), comparing individual levels of satisfaction with the economy in Slovakia immediately before and after the introduction of the Euro, with similar individuals in neighboring Czech Republic, which did not adopt the Euro. Both countries were economically and politically integrated for decades, and display similar macroeconomic behavior before and after the currency change in Slovakia. What we assess is not the actual, economic, costs stemming from the Euro adoption, but the change in utility as perceived by the individuals. There is evidence of substantial psychological costs associated with currency transition, especially for the old, the unemployed, the poorly educated and households with children. Our results are robust to the use of alternative control groups and to estimation procedures using the DD matching approach. The significant perceived costs uncovered in this paper suggest policy-makers should not ignore them when considering a sweeping economic change such as the adoption of a new currency.
P26|State capacity, redistributive compensation and the political economy of economic policy reform|If governments can compensate “losers” from large-scale economic reform, such as trade liberalization, by redistributing some of the “winners'” gains, then any potentially Pareto-improving reform should be implemented. However, in many economies, the state's capacity to identify and tax winners is limited. How do such limitations impact the adoption of reforms? We show that for reforms where the distribution of winners and losers is exogenously given, higher state capacity unambiguously helps the adoption of Pareto-improving reforms. However, for reforms which require individual investment decisions by potential winners, better state capacity may not always translate into higher political support for reform.
P26|A rational path towards a Pareto optimum for reforms of large state-owned enterprise in China, past, present and future|Since Deng Xiaoping’s historic move towards a market economy in post-Mao China during the 1980s, by far, the most challenging task in China’s reforms has been that related to the moribund state-owned sector due to a range of ideological, political, as well as economic reasons. Such reforms have so far been slow and hesitant, moving forward and backward with mixed results. This paper tackles the pros and cons of such reforms and aims to square a rational strategy based on what has been done so far in the state sector. Unlike a narrow approach currently prevailing in the literature, this paper establishes a partial equilibrium model which incorporates the principal-agent problem into a mixed oligopoly model to explore an optimal strategy for state-owned enterprise reforms in China. We argue that ceteris paribus the current illnesses of low efficiency and rent-seeking commonly suffered by China’s state-owned sector can be cured by a two-pronged strategy in which the importance of property rights holds the key. We have identified two ‘Coase Property Right Points’ in the commonly known choices of institutional changes in a reforming Soviet economy to firstly, make it more efficient, and then Pareto optimal. One institutional change is a ‘joint-stock reform’; the other, a ‘full privatisation reform’. In particular, this study regards ‘social-extra policy burdens’ as the main obstacle to improve much needed efficiency in the state sector. Coase Property Right Points show the necessity for a reduction of the social-extra policy burdens vis-à-vis the state sector’s true comparative advantage
P26|Thou shalt not steal (from hard-working people)An experiment on respect for property claims|Abstract The institution of property is void without legal and social enforcement against theft. To address wasteful competition over resources, societies have long developed strategies that encompass -inter alia- behavioral traits, social norms and legal institutions to promote the respect and enforcement of property rights. On the other hand, a growing body of biological and ethological evidence suggests that several other animal species establish and respect some forms of property even in the absence of institutions. Would human beings respect others' property in the absence of institutions? Do people posses some innate sense of property, or do they respect property only because of legal and social enforcement? In this study, we explore this issue with a lab experiment that resembles a famous thought experiment proposed by Plato. As Plato sought to understand how one ought to behave when he or sheis completely shielded by the consequences of his actions,we study whether people respect property once full anonymity is granted. In this experiment, we implement a Free-Form Dictator game where participants can both give and take up to five scratchcards from a passive counterpart that they have either previously bought outside the lab with their own money (legal treatments) or gained inside the lab via an effort task (effortful treatments). In conclusion to the experiment, evidence is provided of a (weak) sense of property. We also provide evidence that property in the lab is better established through an effort tasks than through the use of subject's own real property brought from outside the lab.
P26|How war affects political attitudes: evidence from eastern Ukraine|This study empirically evaluates the impact of the war in eastern Ukraine on the political attitudes and sentiments towards Ukraine and Russia among the population living close to the war zone on the territory controlled by the Ukrainian government. Exploiting unique survey data that were collected in early 2013 (13 months before the outbreak of the conflict) and early 2015 (11 months after the outbreak), we employ two strategies to infer how the war has affected two different groups defined by distance to the war zone. First, we apply a before-after analysis to examine intra-group changes in attitudes over time. Second, we use a difference-in-differences approach to investigate inter-group divergence over time. Under particular assumptions, the latter approach yields a lower absolute bound for the effect. We control for a range of observed characteristics and consider both parametric and semiparametric estimation based on inverse probability weighting. Our results suggest that one year of conflict negatively affected attitudes towards Russia, while mostly no statistically significant intra- or inter-group differences were found for sentiments towards Ukraine.
P26|Russian Economic Policy in 2015: Anti-Crisis Measures or Structural Reforms|Today, the world is looking for the new equilibrium that should occur after the global structural (systemic) crisis that began in 2008 and still more or less continues. We are witnessing the formation of a new macroeconomic (including the nature of monetary policy and economic growth potential) and institutional growth model, a change in the roles of certain economic sectors, the emergence of a new model for globalization and international trade, and a re-thinking of the role of inequality in the economic and social development of the leading states. The situation remains unstable, although the global crisis itself is nearing completion
P26|The dynamics of revolutions|We study the dynamics of revolutions and mass protests. In a uni ed framework we explain three classes of observed revolutions, two of which are unexplained by earlier models: 1) a revolution initiated by extreme regime opponents dissenting greatly, later joined by moderate dissidents dissenting less; 2) a revolution initiated by moderates dissenting moderately, later joined by extremists; 3) a revolution where extreme regime opponents gradually push the freedom of speech, backed by increased dissent of mod- erates. These match the dynamics of many major revolutions, e.g., the Iranian Islamic Revolution, the fall of the USSR, the Egyptian Arab Spring and the Tiananmen-Square protests
P26|The Divergent Postcommunist Paths to Democracy and Economic Freedom|This paper presents evidence from 29 postcommunist countries that the economic transition has been more successful than the political transformation in the quarter century since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The adoption of strong parliamentarian systems has countered the adverse effects of religious and imperial history on economic evolution. As a result, the divergence in democracy and political rights is 4 to 5 times larger than the divergence in the path toward economic freedom and ease of doing business. Democracy is not harder to predict than economic freedom—history and ethnicity predict it well. But recent authoritarian regressions in Hungary and Poland, countries with successful economic reforms and strong parliamentarian systems, present a new challenge to researchers.
P26|The Balance of Economics and Political Science in Islamic Political Economy|The purpose of this paper is to investigate the balance of economics and political science in Islamic political economy. The economic science here refers to economics value based on Islamic teaching, while political science refers to political value based on Islam. Whereas Islamic political science is a field that evaluates the interaction between the Islamic economy and politics as well as the implication of the influences of one field on the other.Beyond this assessment, between the economic and political value, which one is more influential in Islamic political economy? To date, most scholars are inclined towards the influence of their respective field. For those in economic field, the focus of Islamic political economy is mostly directed towards economic value rather than political value.Similarly, those who are in politics will be more inclined towards the political value rather than economic.Thus, which of the political or economic value should be made priority in Islamic political economy? Based on literature review and textual analysis, this paper will firstly, re-evaluate the issue where it is perceived that Islamic political economy does not necessarily need to focus on both political and economic value; secondly, analyse the extent to which the economic and political values are needed in Islamic political economy; and thirdly, summarise the option between the economic and political value in Islamic political economy in order to achieve a holistic field of study in overcoming problems and presenting solution for the political economy of the Ummah (Islamic nation).
P26|Economic Development as a Factor of Democratisation: Evidence from Post-Socialist Economies|The main aim of the paper is to verify whether economic development, as the main component of Modernization theory, has affected the development of political regimes/democracy in post-socialist countries. Within Modernization theory, the contribution distinguishes between endogenous and exogenous Modernization theory. As indicators of the political regime, a composite index combining three concepts of democracy (Freedom in the World, Polity2 of the Polity IV Project and Freedom of Press) is used. On the basis of the index, several political systems (liberal democracies, hybrid and authoritarian regimes, non-liberal states, electoral democracies and non-democratic countries) are compared. For attainment of the aim, the paper uses three methods, a test of the equivalence of means, and logistic and linear regression analyses (OLS, OLS fixed effects, the Difference GMM and the System GMM). The reference period is focused on the years 1990-2015. According to the results, the paper rejects the endogenous Modernisation hypothesis as an explanation of the establishment of political regimes (formal institutions) in post-socialist countries, but alongside, one can state that the theory could be used as an elucidation of the formation of liberal democratic and authoritarian political systems in the post-socialist area. Simultaneously, the exogenous Modernization theory is confirmed, which means that higher economic development promotes the consolidation of democratic systems, particularly in the case of liberal democracies.
P26|The Limits of Meritocracy: Screening Bureaucrats Under Imperfect Verifiability|Does bureaucratic ability predict promotion in governments? We show that self-reported performance in enforcing the One Child Policy predicts mayoral promotion in China. However, misreporting handicaps screening—a non-manipulated performance measure does not predict promotion. We show that this is consistent with a model where a government has a meritocratic objective but underestimates the imperfect verifiability of performance, rather than a model where a government is only interested in the illusion of meritocracy. Thus, despite meritocratic intentions, we challenge the notion that a successful promotion system effectively substituted for democratic institutions in explaining Chinese growth.
P26|Unresolved issue of private property legitimacy in Russia|Private property exists in Russia for almost 25 years. However, the legitimacy of established property rights and the legitimacy of private property as an institution remain ambiguous. Despite the change of generations and the improvement of living standards, numerous opinion polls show that the majority of Russians refers negatively not only to the privatization of the 1990s and its results, but also to private property in general. Positive forecasts on the adaptation of people to new reality do not come true. The authors analyze the reasons and consequences of private property illegitimacy and compare alternative ways of its legitimating. The main conclusion is the uselessness of any discretionary state intervention in this long-lasting process, while the focus should be put on the mitigation of inequality and the enforcement of formal institutions without any exceptions or privileges.
P26|The state advances, the private sector retreats? Firm effects of China’s great stimulus programme|It has been argued that the state sector is advancing at the cost of the private sector in China. To examine this issue, we conduct an empirical analysis in which we exploit the launch of a large stimulus programme in the autumn of 2008. We find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are better able to maintain their leverage levels and have better access to both short- and long-term debt compared with private firms after the introduction of the stimulus programme. We also find that preferential access to debt financing does not help SOEs improve their performance. Instead, SOEs perform significantly worse than private firms after the introduction of the stimulus programme. Moreover, political connections obtained through political participation help mitigate the discrimination that private firms face from Chinese banks and help improve firm performance. These results support the conjecture that China’s state sector is advancing, with negative consequences for aggregate performance in the economy.
P26|Determinantes socioeconómicos del crimen en México<BR>[The Socioeconomic Determinants of Crime: The case of Mexico]|"In this paper, we review the literature on social and economic determinants of crime. We analyze the behavior that crimes in Mexico over the last 15 years dividing those who threaten national security (federal crimes) and those against property and integrity of people (ordinary crimes) and highlight the behavior before and after the so-called ""war against drugs"" launched by the federal government in 2007. Finally tried two simple econometric models to determine if income levels; the level of unemployment and the probability of success of offenders are determinants of both types of crimes in Mexico. We found that unemployment and the probability of success may explain the increase in property crimes (common crimes), but not federal crimes."
P26|Lessons from Enterprise Reforms in China and Vietnam|This paper surveys a few key features of SOE reforms in China and Vietnam, focusing particularly on the evolution of ownership structures and on the relative weight of market regulatory mechanisms, and discusses their general implications for socialist development. It tentatively concludes that some broad principles informing and constraining any feasible socialist-oriented economic strategy can indeed be identified.
P26|Continuous time, continuous decision space prisoner’s dilemma: A bridge between game theory and economic GCD-models|General Constrained Dynamic models (GCD – models) in economics are inspired by classical mechanics with constraints. Most macroeconomic models can be understood as special cases of GCD – models. Moreover, in this paper it will be shown that not only macroeconomic models but also game theoretic models are strongly related to GCD – models. GCD models are characterized by a system of differential equations in continuous time while most game theoretical models are set up in discrete time. Therefore it is necessary to build a bridge from game theoretical models denominated in discrete time to game theoretical models using continuous time. This bridge is illustrated in the following using the example of a continuous time, continuous decision space prisoner’s dilemma. Furthermore, it is shown that the differential equations which determine other continuous game theoretic models can be understood to a certain extent as special cases of the GCD – differential equations. Well known types of continuous game theoretic models include for instance “Evolutionary Game Theory” with the replicator equation, “Adaptive Dynamics” with the canonical equation, which is nothing else than a replicator – mutator equation, and the so called “Differential Games”, which are strongly related to optimal control theory with two controls and two different objectives (goals). Most of the GCD – models are characterised by 3 key feature: - mutual influence, - Power-factors - Constraints Nowak (2006b) and Taylor & Nowak (2007) show that there are five mechanisms which, under certain conditions, can lead to the evolution of cooperation in an iterated prisoner’s dilemma. Inspired by this, we apply the 3 key features of GCD – models to the standard prisoner’s dilemma in discrete time which yields 3 additional mechanisms which enable the evolution of cooperation. The assumption or axiom of the free market economy is that an individual optimisation strategy will lead to an overall optimum by virtue of Adam Smith’s invisible hand. Without additional conditions this assumption alone is fundamentally wrong. As in prisoner’s dilemma also in economics cooperation is essential to get an overall optimum. The big question of political economy is to analyse which additional measures could guarantee that the individual optimisation strategy characterising a free market economy leads to cooperation as precondition to get an overall optimum. From this point of view the different economic theories could be characterised in terms of which measures they assume to be sufficient to guarantee an overall optimum without abandoning the principle of individual optimisation.

P26|State Control and the Effects of Foreign Relations on Bilateral Trade|Do states use trade to reward and punish partners? WTO rules and the pressures of globalization restrict states’ capacity to manipulate trade policies, but we argue that governments can link political goals with economic outcomes using less direct avenues of inﬂuence over ﬁrm behavior. Where governments intervene in markets, politicization of trade is likely to occur. In this paper, we examine one important form of government control: state ownership of ﬁrms. Taking China and India as examples, we use bilateral trade data by ﬁrm ownership type, as well as measures of bilateral political relations based on diplomatic events and UN voting to estimate the effect of political relations on import and export ﬂows. Our results support the hypothesis that imports controlled by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) exhibit stronger responsiveness to political relations than imports controlled by private enterprises. A more nuanced picture emerges for exports; while India’s exports through SOEs are more responsive to political tensions than its ﬂows through private entities, the opposite is true for China. This research holds broader implications for how we should think about the relationship between political and economic relations going forward, especially as a number of countries with partially state-controlled economies gain strength in the global economy.
P26|Political Economy Approach of Institutional Research|Abstract Institutional research should be ready to move to the next stage, a stage that is, as argued by this paper, characterized by a more comprehensive approach integrating economics, politics, and social culture. The theoretical foundation for such a move exists, as the interconnection between political institutions and economic institutions has been addressed by North, Fukuyama, and Acemoglu, and the influences of cultural heritage on institutional choices have further been mentioned by North and Huntington. Another shift in institutional research proposed by this paper is a change from general to specific solutions because the institutional characteristics become individualized after considering the impacts of culture heritage. This paper presents the correlations between political and economic institutions and the unique characteristics of political orders taking different developmental paths using a data analysis based on the World Governance Index (WGI) and other development indicators. The paper also discusses the influences of cultural heritage on institution’s choice of transformation path and proposes a institutional research framework.
P26|Housing Policies in Hong Kong, China and the People’s Republic of China|This paper analyzes the housing markets and housing policies in Hong Kong, China and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Both markets face housing affordability problems due to limited land supply, for which the solutions vary considerably. Hong Kong, China has adopted a railway and property development model, which involves close collaboration between the government and property developers in compact urban areas, while leaving most greenbelts and surrounding islands underdeveloped. Although the PRC has pledged to maintain a minimum level of basic farmland to feed its large population, this target has often been compromised due to local governments’ fiscal constraints and growth concerns.
P26|Land Policy and Urbanization in the People’s Republic of China|We explore the relationship between land policies and urbanization in the PRC. We analyze the land policies associated with urbanization and summarize findings related to central and local government involvement in the process of urbanization. In particular, we explore the relationship between urbanization and land leasing. We find that the urbanization rate and the land leasing revenue are positively related. Land leasing provides financial support for PRC urbanization, but damages the interest of landless peasants. Especially in the west, population urbanization lags behind land urbanization, resulting in much higher land and house prices in the east than those in inland PRC. Current land and household registration policies hinder the mobility of production factors, including construction land and the labor force, and distort the process of urbanization and industrialization. Land policy should be revised such that the market determines the allocation of land resources, which will create a unified, competitive urban–rural land market.
P26|The Economics of Nationalism|This paper provides an economic framework for examining how economic openness affects nationalism. Within a country, a region's level of nationalism varies according to its economic interests in its domestic market relative to its foreign market. All else being equal, increasing a region's foreign trade reduces its economic interests in its domestic market and thus weakens its nationalism. This prediction holds both cross-sectionally and over time, as evidenced by our empirical study using the Chinese Political Compass data and the World Value Surveys. Our framework also applies to analysis of nationalism across countries and receives support from cross-country data. (JEL F14, F52, O17, O19, P26, P33)
P26|Land Valuation and Perceptions of Land Sales Prohibition in Ethiopia|This study investigates attitudes towards legalizing land sales and Willingness to Accept (WTA) sales prices and compensation prices for land among smallholder households in four different areas in the Oromia and SNNP Regions in the southern highlands of Ethiopia. Household panel data from 2007 and 2012 are used. The large majority of the sample prefers land sales to remain illegal, and the resistance to legalizing land sales increased from 2007 to 2012. In the same period, perceived median real land values increased sharply but also exhibit substantial local variation. Land loss aversion is associated with higher land values and less willingness to sell land if land sales were to become legal. The substantial increase in perceived land values, high economic growth and outmigration of youth have yet to persuade the rural population in southern Ethiopia to open the land sales market.
P26|Competence vs. Loyalty: Political survival and electoral fraud in Russia’s regions 2000–2012|Election fraud is a pervasive feature of autocracies but often only serves lower-tier officials to cast signals of loyalty or competence to the central government in order to pursue their own interests. How much such personal interests matter for electoral fraud under autocracy has however not been studied so far. In this paper, I exploit a radical policy change in Russia which allowed the president to replace governors of the country’s 89 regions at his own will. As a result, federal elections after December 2004 were organised by two types of governors: one was handpicked by the president, the other one elected before the law change and re-appointed. Even though both types faced removal in case of bad results, the need to signal loyalty was much lower for the first type. In order to estimate the e.ect of handpicked governors on electoral fraud, I use a diff-in-diff framework over 7 federal elections between 2000 and 2012. For this time period, I use results from about 95,000 voting stations to construct a new indicator of suspicious votes for each region and election. I show that this indicator correlates strongly with incidents of reported fraud. My baseline estimates show that in territories with a handpicked governor the share of suspicious votes decreased on average by more than 10 percentage points and dropped even further if the region’s economy had done well over the past legislature. These findings suggest that governors have less need to use rigging as a signal once loyalty is assured unless faced with circumstances raising doubts about their competence.
P26|Loose Cannons – War Veterans and the Erosion of Democracy in Weimar Germany|I study the effect of war participation on the rise of right-wing parties in Inter-war Germany. After the democratisation and surrender of Germany in 1918, 8m German soldiers of WWI were demobilised. I argue that defeat made veterans particularly sceptical about the new democratic state. Their return undermined support for democratic parties from the very beginning and facilitated the reversion to autocratic rule 15 years later. In order to quantify this effect, I construct the first disaggregated estimates of German WWI veterans since official army records were destroyed. I combine this data with a new panel of voting results from 1881 to 1933. Diff-in-Diff estimates show that war participation had a strong positive effect on support for the right-wing at the expense of socialist parties. A one standard deviation increase in veteran inflow shifted vote shares to the right by more than 2 percentage points. An IV strategy based on draft exemption rules substantiates my findings. The effect of veterans on voting is highly persistent and strongest in working class areas. Gains for the right-wing, however, are only observed after a period of Communist insurgencies. I provide suggestive evidence that veterans must have picked up especially anti-Communist sentiments after defeat, injected these into the working class and in this way eroded the future of the young democracy.
P26|An Interdisciplinary Perspective on the Relationship between Ethics and Today’s Capitalism|The paper begins by emphasizing the fact that, on a historical scale, one can have several views of the relationship that has existed over time between ethics and capitalism, namely missionary, ‘Nietzschean’, critical, and ‘regulatory’. It is argued that, nowadays, the capitalization of the contributions supplied, over time, by the four views embraces the form of two modern diametrically opposed perspectives, i.e.: on the one hand, there is the interpretation given by the neo-classical school of thought (mainstream economics) and, on the other hand, it comes to the interpretation given by the Austrian praxeological economic school (libertarian economics). The emphasis of the analysis is put on the assertions developed by the last one, libertarian thinking, that insists on the necessity to operate with a well-defined distinction between the legal level of the matter, the ethical level and the moral one. At the core of the libertarian analysis there is the understanding of the capitalist system being naturally impregnated by ethical values. And this intrinsic ethical nature of capitalism is organically bound to the sphere of the ownership-type relationship. In line with the understanding of the economic system, based on the institutions of the free market as representing ethical capitalism per se, the paper argues that the realities of the world today show governmental interventionism as a main factor that supports non-ethical economic behaviour. As a consequence, the more limited government intervention is, the greater the chance of ethical capitalism, that is, voluntary, non-conflictual and non-aggressive economic market relationships. Under such conditions, a ‘minimal state’ institutional arrangement (that is, the legitimate use of power by the state is limited to preventing fraud or the use of force; it does not include the power to tax or to confiscate property) is the basic condition for the existence of an ethical capitalism that works, which is to say that the chance of an economic system based on ethical values stands in people’s willingness to be part of such an evolution in society that aims to minimise the role of the state. Further, the paper argues that any historical analysis on how societies asserted such a willingness outlines the expression of a secular and unshaken option for growing rather than diminishing state involvement in the economy. It is about people’s perennial preference for the state, namely for the organization of society based on state interventionism (respectively, their preference for the coercive order imposed by the state authorities, order based, through its own nature, on the subjugation of private property and the aggression against individual freedom), with a preference for the government intervention over the organization of a society based on free market functioning (which is equivalent, in fact, to their rejection of a voluntarily and spontaneously non-violent order, based on the observance of private property and individual freedom, brought about by the free functioning of markets). In the last part of the paper there are put forward for discussion the possible explanations for this perennial preference for non-ethical capitalism, the analysis focusing on two directions: firstly, on that of social ontology; and then, on that of human psychology.
P26|Russia's Legal Transitions: Marxist Theory, Neoclassical Economics and the Rule of Law|We review the role of economic theory in shaping the process of legal change in Russia during the two transitions it experienced during the course of the twentieth century: the transition to a socialist economy organised along the lines of state ownership of the means of production in the 1920s, and the transition to a market economy which occurred after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s. Despite differences in methodology and in policy implications, Marxist theory, dominant in the 1920s, and neoclassical economics, dominant in the 1990s, offered a similarly reductive account of law as subservient to wider economic forces. In both cases, the subordinate place accorded to law undermined the transition process. Although path dependence and history are frequently invoked to explain the limited development of the rule of law in Russia during the 1990s, policy choices driven by a deterministic conception of law and economics also played a role.
P26|Strong State, Weak Managers: How Firms Cope with Autocracy in Hungary|This paper investigates how companies manage risk associated with political ties in the context of the ‘return of state capitalism’. We show that findings from previous studies of firms’ copying strategies under autocratic regimes are of limited relevance in the context of Hungary, because they lack a sophisticated, theoretically underpinned conceptualisation of ‘the state’. We develop a more fine-grained analysis of the role of the state in emerging markets. We then show that the type of ‘state capitalism’ that is emerging in Hungary poses unique challenges to companies with implications for existing theories of companies’ political ‘buffering strategies’. Based on interviews with business leaders in Hungary, we identify two coping strategies: responsiveness –whereby firms accommodate state pressures by giving in to them – and a non-responsive strategy of ‘dormancy’, which consists in firms putting forward-looking activities on hold and focussing on survival. We discuss implications for theories of corporate political risk management.
P26|Political Risk, Information and Corruption Cycles: Evidence from Russian Regions|Political budget cycles are a well-established phenomenon in which opportunistic politicians systematically adjust public policies prior to elections in order to attract a higher number of votes. We show that corrupt behavior of politicians also follows certain patterns, which are driven by electoral cycles. Based on Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey data, exploiting variation in the dates of surveys and in length and starting date of Russian regional governors' terms, we find that corruption levels, as perceived by firms operating in different regions of Russia, increases closer to the expected expiration date of a regional governor's term. We argue that the Russian political system allows governors to accumulate private information about their likelihood of remaining in office for another term. Therefore, they will know well in advance of elections if they continue in the office for the next term. We suggest that the accumulation of such information may serve as an explanation for the observed pattern of perceived corruption: if a governor gradually learns that he is leaving office once the current term has expired he has increasing incentives to engage in corrupt activities in order to accumulate wealth before he is out of the game. We formalize this idea with a simple theoretical model and test it. We find that in regions where incumbent governors are less likely to remain in office for the next term, corruption increases over their terms, while in regions where governors are more likely to remain in office, perceived corruption follows a decreasing trend.
P26|Financial development, environmental quality, trade and economic growth: What causes what in MENA countries|This paper examines the relationship between financial development, CO2 emissions, trade and economic growth using simultaneous-equation panel data models for a panel of 12 MENA countries over the period 1990–2011. Our results indicate that there is evidence of bidirectional causality between CO2 emissions and economic growth. Economic growth and trade openness are interrelated i.e., bidirectional causality. Feedback hypothesis is validated between trade openness and financial development. Neutrality hypothesis is identified between CO2 emissions and financial development. Unidirectional causality running from financial development to economic growth and from trade openness to CO2 emissions is identified. Our empirical results also verified the existence of environmental Kuznets curve. These empirical insights are of particular interest to policymakers as they help build sound economic policies to sustain economic development and to improve the environmental quality.
P26|In the shadow of the Gulag: Worker discipline under Stalin|An ‘efficiency wage’ model developed for Western economies is reinterpreted in the context of Stalin’s Russia, with imprisonment – not unemployment – acting as a ‘worker discipline device’. The threat of imprisonment allows the state to pay a lower wage outside the Gulag than otherwise, thereby raising the “surplus” left over for investment: this externality provides a reason for coercion over and above the direct productivity of those in custody.
P26|The political determinants of executive compensation: Evidence from an emerging economy|In regulated economies, corporate governance mechanisms such as executive compensation are less driven by market-based forces but more subject to political influence. We study the political determinants of executive compensation for all listed Chinese firms in the context of an exogenous shock that removed market frictions in share-tradability. Under strong political constraints, state ownership reduced the managerial pay levels and increased pay-for-performance sensitivity (to asset-based benchmarks). Board independence and compensation committees do not curb managerial pay, and market-based factors do not have a significant influence. However, these effects reversed following the governance shock (removal of market frictions in share tradability).
P26|Privatization, financial development, property rights and growth|This study analyzes how prevailing institutional arrangements i.e., property rights, contracting rights, political institutions, and corporate governance practices affect privatized firms’ performance, capital markets development, and economic growth. Most of the studies surveyed show that privatization enhances privatized firms performance, efficiency, and profitability, which percolates to economic growth. Privatized firms performed better in countries with better regulatory and legal frameworks. Partial privatization may be beneficial in countries with weak institutions, namely, the French civil law countries. The stronger the economic and the governing institutions, the easier it is for privatized firms to thrive and contribute to economic growth. Overall, privatization allows firms to achieve improved efficiency while driving the development of the financial sector.
P26|Mixing business with politics: Political participation by entrepreneurs in China|We study how Chinese private entrepreneurs benefit from participating in politics. Using original hand-collected data on listed firms controlled by private entrepreneurs, we document a significant positive relationship between political participation and subsequent change in firm performance. We also provide evidence that the change in social status cannot explain the change in performance. We then identify several ways through which firms gain preferential treatment when the controlling entrepreneur participates in politics: better access to debt financing, preferential tax treatment, more government subsidies, and superior access to regulated industries.
P26|When does local political competition lead to more public goods?: Evidence from Russian regions|In imperfect democracies, does political competition always improve the provision of public goods? To address this, we study the pattern of public expenditures on health and education in 74 Russian regions between 2004 and 2009. Because governors are now appointed by the federal government, reappointment depends on their maintaining support in the legislative elections for the ruling party. Results show that outsider governors appointed by the federal government spend more on public goods (in this case, education) than governors who had originally been elected, and then were reappointed by the federal government, when there is competition in the legislature (as measured by party share). But in cases where the ruling party is strong (virtual monopoly) or when party share is low enough that governors can do little to raise party support, governors with local ties spend more on public goods. This non-monotonic (inverted U-relationship) between expenditures on public goods and party share suggests that formal mechanisms of accountability (administrative subordination to the central government) work worse under political monopoly, while informal mechanisms (such as local ties and strong networks) work worse under political competition to encourage public goods spending.
P26|Divining the level of corruption: A Bayesian state-space approach|This paper outlines a new methodological framework for combining indicators of corruption. The state-space framework extends the methodology of the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) to fully make use of the time-structure present in corruption data. It is estimated using a Bayesian Gibbs sampler algorithm.
P26|Patronage and ideology in electoral behavior: Evidence from Egypt's first presidential elections|This paper investigates the impact of patronage and ideology on voter behavior and election outcomes. Egypt's first free presidential elections represent a good case study to answer the question whether private gain outweighs ideology in voter behavior on a broader level. First, we combine election results with household surveys and national statistics to estimate the impact of patronage (measured by public employment) on voting for the pre-revolution regime candidate. Second, using results of the first round of elections as a proxy for ideology, we test for the effect of ideological preferences on voting behavior. Additionally, we test for candidates' ability to mobilize supporters. Our results suggest that patronage has a stronger effect than secularist ideology but a weaker effect than pro-change ideology. Results show that the number of public sector and government employees in each electoral district has a positive impact on participation rates.
P26|The transparency curse: Private information and political freedom|I offer a model of the sustainability of authoritarian rule in which the transparency of productive economic activity enables the ruler to distinguish productive economic activity from preparations for rebellion. The less transparent the productive technology the greater the economic side effects of maintaining authoritarian rule, and the stronger the incentives to liberalize the regime. Using a cross section of countries I provide evidence that, consistently with the theory, democratic government Granger causes internet penetration.
P26|Membership has its Privileges – The Effect of Membership in International Organizations on FDI|We argue that membership in specific international organizations (IOs) is an important determinant of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. To the extent that membership restricts a country from pursuing policies that are harmful to investors, it can signal reduced political risk. Using data over the 1971–2012 period, we find that membership in IOs does indeed increase inflows of FDI. We find this effect to be substantively important and robust to controlling for alternative determinants of FDI, to using different model specifications and to using an indicator of membership in regional rather than global IOs.
P26|Economic Transition and Private-Sector Labor Demand: Evidence from Urban China|This paper studies the policy determinants of economic transition and estimates the elasticity demand for labor in the infant private sector in urban China. We show that a reform that untied access to housing in urban areas from working for the state sector accounts for more than a quarter of the overall increase in labor supply to the private sector during 1986-2005. We do not find any increase in self-employment. Using the reform to instrument for private-sector labor supply, we find that private-sector labor demand is very elastic, with elasticity estimates ranging between -3.1 and -5.3.
P26|The Political Economy of State Capitalism and Shadow Banking in China|The Xi-Li administration faces the dual challenge of managing state capitalism and shadow banking as China enters a phase of more moderate economic growth. During China's first three decades of reform, private sector development occurred in parallel with prioritization of state-owned enterprises in strategic industries, and growth surged. This pattern of state capitalism rested on an unarticulated bifurcated financing arrangement whereby the formal banking system primarily served public enterprises, while private businesses relied primarily on informal finance. However, China's response to global financial crisis disrupted the preceding equilibrium of financial dualism under state capitalism. Unprecedented expansion of bank lending after 2008 created opportunities for a host of state economic actors- including SOEs, state banks, and local governments—to expand their participation in offbalance sheet activities.
P26|New firms entry, labor reallocation, and institutions in transition economies|In the transition from central planning to a market economy in the 1990s, governments focused on privatizing or closing state enterprises, reforming labor markets, compensating laid-off workers, and fostering job creation through new private firms. After privatization, the focus shifted to creating a level playing-field in the product market by protecting property rights, enforcing the rule of law, and implementing transparent start-up regulations. A fair, competitive environment with transparent rules supports long-term economic growth and employment creation through the reallocation of jobs in favor of new private firms.
P26|Determinants of Willingness to Bribe: Micro Evidence from the Educational Sector in China|We use a unique dataset based on reported direct personal bribes paid by arts students in China at examinations and in the college admissions process to study willingness to bribe. We find that individual willingness to bribe depends on personal characteristics rather than on the attributes of the admissions process at different colleges and universities. The perceived level of corruption, personal attitudes towards corruption, academic attainment, and the rank of a college are significant predictors of bribery. Based on self-reporting, students from middle-income families have a higher likelihood of engaging in bribery than students from poor or rich families. There are no significant gender differences in bribing behavior. We acknowledge and seek to account for the possibility of identity-confirming expressive behavior in the survey responses.
P26|Income Inequality, State Ownership, and the Pattern of Economic Growth – A Tale of the Kuznets Curve for China since 1978|The lack of supposed trickle-down benefits for industrialization to reduce income inequality during China’s 30 years of post-reform economic growth appears to constitute an anomaly for the inverted U-shaped Kuznets curve hypothesis. Using an alternative inequality measure that depends on factor share and ownership, we show that in a transition economy with the state weight of capital less than its market counterpart, enhanced state ownership exacerbates inequality. Econometric evidence suggests that although the government attempts to balance the three goals of growth, equality, and state ownership in the short run, stubborn state ownership as well as lopsided growth patterns jeopardize equality in the long run and have therefore delayed the turning point in the inverted U-shaped Kuznets curve for China.

P26|The mature limited access order at the doorstep: Imperial Germany and contemporary China in transition|A basic premise of the limited/open access orders framework of North, Wallis, Webb and Weingast is a variant of the Hayek–Friedman hypothesis that economic and political freedom sustain each other. Keys to this framework are the specific “doorstep” conditions that enable a transition from limited to open access, which the authors draw from the historical experience of Britain, France and the United States. This essay analyzes the transition process of Imperial Germany to reveal that maintaining economic competition did not depend on democracy and that the middle classes became stakeholders in authoritarianism. It then explores the specific challenges posed by this large, mature limited access order as it was integrated into an international system sustained by a declining liberal hegemon, Great Britain. The refinements of the framework suggested by the case of Imperial Germany allow for a better understanding of some of the parallel transition processes in present-day China and its evolving relationship to both the United States and the current international order.

P26|Commitment to local autonomy in non-democracies: Russia and China compared|The aim of this paper is to investigate under which conditions non-democratic political regimes are capable of making credible commitments to maintain a certain level of local autonomy and to incentivize local bureaucrats. For this purpose, we compare two big non-democratic countries—Russia and China. While China has managed to establish a relatively stable system, with substantial decision-making rights resting with sub-national governments, in Russia relations between the center and the regions have been highly unstable and driven primarily by the extent to which central elites consolidated their power. We argue that China has been able to make credible commitments because its non-democratic rule is based on competition between vertical elite networks that span regional and central political arenas, and because the country has limited access to natural resources: these two characteristics explain the difference between the two cases we investigate.

P26|Subnational leaders and economic growth: evidence from Chinese cities|This paper studies the role of subnational leaders in economic growth using a unique city-leader linked dataset of Chinese cities for the period 1994–2010. A unique feature of China’s institutional setups is that local leaders are often moved from one locality to another. This feature allows us to compare leaders across cities. Adopting the decomposition method previously applied to linked employer–employee data, we find that leaders have significantly different levels of abilities to promote local economic growth. We also study how leaders’ personal abilities affect their chances of promotion. We find that personal abilities become more important as a leader gets older, and this effect is most pronounced around the median age in the sample. Those results remain robust when we conduct full-information maximum-likelihood estimation of a system of equations consisting of both the growth and the promotion equations.

P26|Après le déluge: Institutions, the Global Financial Crisis, and Bank Profitability in Transition|While the determinants of bank profitability have been well-explored, the influence of institutions on bank performance is less understood, especially in the transition context. Given the presence of a financial crisis such as the one that struck the global economy from 2007 onward, did the underlying institutional structure of a country help to mitigate the effects of the crisis on banks? Utilizing a new database of 1600 banks across 30 transition economies, this paper applies Bayesian model averaging, fixed-effects, and IV-GMM methodology to test the effect of institutions on bank profitability in a crisis period. Results are conclusive across models that investor-specific property rights aided bank profitability during the crisis. The effect of democracy on banks is much more ambiguous but appears to negatively influence profitability indirectly through interest group channels and bank concentration. These results hold across a variety of specifications and robustness tests. Copyright The Author(s) 2015
P26|Is there a local knowledge advantage in federations? Evidence from a natural experiment|In economics, the local knowledge advantage is arguably one of the key arguments in favor of decentralizing the public sector. However, empirical investigations of this particular effect have been scarce. This paper tests the existence of the local knowledge advantage in a real-world setting. Specifically, it looks at the variation in local knowledge across regions based on the origins and careers of regional politicians, assuming that politicians who have spent more time in a particular region possess more and better knowledge of that region than outsiders. To avoid the reverse causality problem, the paper investigates how local origins affected the performances of politicians in a ‘natural experimental’ environment, studying the responses of regional governors in Russia to disastrous forest fires in 2010. We confirm that local knowledge improves gubernatorial performance. In a highly centralized federation such as Russia, though, the effect is dependent on access to federal resources obtainable through close ties to the federal center. We also discuss alternative interpretations of the local origins of politicians and test whether the effects found are indeed more plausibly explained by local knowledge.

P26|Államosítás, privatizáció és gazdaságpolitika - a főirány széttöredezése<BR>[Nationalization and privatization - in the shadow of changing paradigms of economic policy]|Az állami tulajdon kiterjedésének módosítása a gazdasági válságok kezelésének mindig fontos - de nem kizárólagos - eszköze volt az elmúlt évszázad európai és egyesült államokbeli történetében. Az utóbbi évek ebből a szempontból nem kivételesek. Csakhogy míg korábban vagy a közkézbe vétel, vagy az eladás irányzata volt meghatározó, a közelmúlt folyamatai furcsa együttmozgást mutatnak. A tanulmány a nagy léptékű államosítási és privatizációs hullámok alapvonásainak fényében elemzi az elmúlt évek új fejleményét, a változási irányok széttöredezését. Bemutatja azokat az indokokat, amelyek alapján az állami tulajdon kiterjesztése és szűkítése egyaránt alkalmasnak látszott a válság enyhítésére, szoros kapcsolatban más válságkezelő intézkedésekkel. Amellett érvel, hogy a köztulajdonra vonatkozó felfogás elbizonytalanodása részben a korábbi hullámok tapasztalataival és ennek nyomán a közvélekedés változásával függ össze, részben az elméleti és gazdaságpolitikai paradigma elbizonytalanodására vezethető vissza: most sem az államosítás, sem a privatizáció mögött nem áll egységes, határozott nézetrendszer.* Journal of Economics Literature (JEL) kód: H82, L32, P26.
P26|Revisiting Neoclassical Economic Growth: A Survey in the Literature|During the second half of the twentieth century economists have build newer models of economic growth that consider policy influences of growth and divergent outcomes among countries. These models address issues concerning economic growth, operation of financial markets, trade policy, government expenditures, and taxation. In this essay we have revisited the interdependence of political and economic institutions, taking the neoclassical growth model of Solow (1956) as a point of departure, which maintains that long run economic growth can be explained by capital accumulation, population growth and technological progress. We first discuss the evolution of the neoclassical school of economics in a historical context, and the role of various institutions in engendering economic growth. Subsequently the role of government spending, political stability, property rights and special interest groups (SIG’s) affect economic growth have been discussed, and how these institutions can explain different countries to grow at divergent rates and achieve different levels of wealth.
P26|Xi Jinping Regime Trying to Avert the gTwo Traps h - Will the policy of gtilting leftward politically and rightward economically h be sustainable?|Since launching the reform and opening-up initiative, China has been aiming to achieve economic development and a transition to a market economy at the same time. During this process, there is the risk that China could be caught in two traps: a middle-income trap and a transition trap. Indeed, there are already signs that this risk is becoming a reality, including the widening income gap, environmental degradation, corruption among bureaucrats, a decline in the potential growth rate associated with a shortage of labor, and the stalling of the reform of state-owned enterprises. To avoid being caught in these two traps, the government of Xi Jinping has set forth the policy of gtilting leftward politically and rightward economically, h which seeks to strengthen General Secretary Xi fs power base on the political front and to unleash the vitality of the market and companies by minimizing government intervention on the economic front. The details of economic reforms were decided at the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party held in November 2013. With these reforms expected to meet resistance from vested interests, the government must obtain the people fs support for the economic reforms and undertake political reforms to promote democracy and the rule of law.
P26|Culture and Global Sourcing|This paper develops a model of global sourcing with culturally dissimilar countries. Production of final goods requires the coordination of decisions between the headquarter of a multinational firm and managers of their component suppliers. Managers of both units are assumed to have strong beliefs about the right course of action and are reluctant to adjust their decisions. We characterize the optimal allocation of decision rights across firms when contracts are incomplete. Our theoretical model delivers two key predictions: the incentive of a firm to integrate (rather than outsource) its input supply is decreasing in the cultural distance between the home and the host country and decreasing in trade costs between the two countries. Combining data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Related Party Trade with various measures for cultural distance and trade cost, we find empirical evidence strongly supportive of these two predictions.
P26|The Mortality Cost of Political Connections|We study the relationship between the political connections of Chinese firms and workplace fatalities. In our preferred specification we find that the worker death rate for connected companies is two to three times that of unconnected firms (depending on the sample employed), a pattern that holds for within-firm estimations. The connections-mortality relationship is attenuated in provinces where safety regulators' promotion is contingent on meeting safety targets. In the absence of fatalities, connected firms receive fewer reports of major violations for safety compliance, whereas in years of fatal accidents the rate of reported violations is identical. Moreover, fatal accidents produce negative returns at connected companies and are associated with the subsequent departure of well-connected executives. These results provide suggestive evidence that connections enable firms to avoid (potentially costly) compliance measures, rather than using connections to avoid regulatory response after accidents occur. Our findings emphasize the social costs of political connections, and suggest that appropriate regulatory incentives may be useful in mitigating these costs.
P26|Neoliberalism, ‘Digitization’, and Creativity: the Issue of Applied Ontology|The paper extends Foucault’s analysis of neoliberalism in The Birth of Biopolitics. More specifically, I construct and defend an anti-Husserlian approach to the labour process with the objective of investigating how collectively generated forms of intellectual labour have been appropriated under capitalist relations of production. I also interrogate the way that different notions of (computational) applied ontology influence both the nature of and our very conception of social creativity. What, quite wrongly, has been thought of in Spinoza as pantheism is simply the reduction of the field of God to the universality of the signifier, which produces a serene, exceptional detachment from human desire. In so far as Spinoza says—desire is the essence of man, and in the radical dependence of the universality of the divine attributes, which is possible only through the function of the signifier, in so far as he does this, he obtains that unique position by which the philosopher—and it is no accident that it is a Jew detached from his tradition who embodies it—may be confused with a transcendent love. This position is not tenable for us. Experience shows us that Kant is more true, and I have proved that his theory of consciousness, when he writes of practical reason, is sustained only by giving a specification of the moral law which, looked at more closely, is simply desire in its pure state, that very desire that culminates in sacrifice, strictly speaking, of everything that is the object of love in one’s human tenderness—I would say, not only in the rejection of the pathological object, but also in its sacrifice and murder. That is why I wrote Kant avec Sade. (Lacan, 1979: 275-6) But it is like the story of the Resistance fighters who, wanting to destroy a pylon, balanced the plastic charges so well that the pylon blew up and fell back into its hole. From the Symbolic to the Imaginary, from castration to Oedipus, and from the despotic age to capitalism, inversely, there is the progress leading to the withdrawal of the overseeing and overcoding object from on high, which gives way to a social field of immanence where the decoded flows produce images and level them down. Whence the two aspects of the signifier: a barred transcendent signifier taken in a maximum that distributes lack, and an immanent system of relations between minimal elements that come to fill the uncovered field (somewhat similar in traditional terms to the way one goes from Parmenidean Being to the atoms of Democritus). (Deleuze and Guattari,1987: 290-1). Marx was vexed by the bourgeois character of the American working class. But it turned out that the prosperous Americans were merely showing the way for the British and the French and the Japanese. The universal class into which we are merging is not the revolutionary proletariat but the innovative bourgeoisie. (McClosky, D. 2009)
P26|Institutional Diversity in the Post-socialist Area during Crisis|The main aim of the paper is to identify the types of capitalism in the Eurasian transition economies in comparison with the other European countries and evaluate the influence of the recent global crisis on the institutional organization of these states. The paper uses cluster analysis for identifying the types of capitalism. The paper identifies 3 basic groups (core and periphery of the EEA and the other transition economies) and 10 sub-clusters in the European area. According to the results, only Estonia is at the same level as the core of the EEA, whilst the rest of the EU-8 economies and Montenegro with the Mediterranean economies comprise the periphery. In general, CEECs and EU Balkan States have higher quality institutional environment, but on the basis of the analysis of the selected indicators (economic growth, inflows of FDI and unemployment), these economies were impacted more by the recent global crisis than part of the Balkan and post-soviet countries in the clusters “2a” and “2c”. For the losing economies, one can consider sub-cluster “2d” (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine).
P26|Capital In the 21st Century: A Review|This paper reviews Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Piketty's Capital seeks to bring the issue of inequality back to the centre of social analysis and to encourage discussion about the evolution of wealth and inequality with a view to inform policy. The book uses data stretching as far back as the 1700's. The main thesis of the book is that capitalism automatically generates inequality and wealth concentration since the rate of return on capital always exceeds the growth rate of income. To resolve this problem, the book proposes a progressive tax on wealth and income. I show that Piketty's book is based on a misunderstanding of classical political economy, particularly Marx. Piketty's view of the development and phases of capitalism is inadequate. His tax proposals, though progressive, will not resolve the inequality problem. Lastly, his conclusion that modern economic growth made it possible to avoid the Marxist apocalypse is not borne out by his data.
P26|The Impact of Institutional Environment on Inflows of Foreign Direct Investment in European Transition Economies and Latin American Countries|The main objective of the paper is to identify and quantify the infl uence of institutional environment on infl ows of foreign direct investment in European post-socialist countries and countries of Latin America. The reference period is the period 1996-2012 due to data availability. The World Bank Governance Matters concept is used as the basic indicator of institutional environment. Panel data regression analysis is used for the identifi cation and quantifi cation purposes. According to the results, the infl uence of institutional environment on FDI is not entirely unequivocal in the European transition economies, but it is statistically signifi cant in the Latin American countries. Furthermore, there are statistically signifi cant areas - quality of democracy and government eff ectiveness - in the post-socialist countries, and all the institutional areas except the level of democracy in Latin America, mainly regulatory quality and rule of law.
P26|Kompetence, vzdělání a lidský kapitál v České reublice ve světle dat OECD-PIAAC<BR>[Skills, Education and Human Capital in the Czech Republic in tThe View of OECD-PIAAC Survey]|The 2011/12 survey PIAAC is analyzed regarding the formation of skills (literacy, numeracy and information technologies) by family background, gender and age, and regarding the relationships between skill levels and education of adult population in the Czech Republic. The impact of the family background was increasing and the chances of men and women to attain higher education have been reversed in the past: currently, women have twice as high a chance to attain secondary education than men and three times higher chance to pass to tertiary education. Skills are formed both by education and social origin which affects them rather indirectly. In the age perspective, skills are rising up to around 32 years of age and slowly “evaporate” after, with minor differences based on gender and the type of competences. The importance of skills and its empirical analysis is put into the context of political economy research stressing its importance for individual careers and competiveness of national economy.
P26|Národohospodářské efekty privatizačního procesu v České republice<BR>[National Economics Effects of the Privatization Process in the Czech Republic]|The transformation of centrally planned economy to a market economy has confi rmed that the basic premise for the economic policy, characterized by liberal market economy, is democratically established property rights. This text analyzes the National Economic effects of one of the most complex transformation processes, which is the process of privatization. This publication examines all three legal regimes through which were the entire privatization process implemented. These are “The Small Privatization“ according to the Act no. 427/1990 Coll., “The Large-scale Privatization“ according to the Act no. 92/1991 Coll. and “The privatization of agricultural and forestry property“ according to the Act no. 229/1991 Coll. and the Act no. 95/1999 Coll., with respect to the: affected economic theories, theory of property rights in particular, transaction costs theory, theory of interested groups, rent-seeking theory, theory of government failure, etc.; macroeconomic analysis of the process itself; macroeconomic analysis of the use of the proceeds from the privatization process; evaluation of the National Economic effects, whether positive or negative, of the privatization process in the Czech Republic. The aim of this text is to provide professional and comprehensive overview of the National Economic effects of the privatization process as a whole, which has not been published until now by any author in view of the fact that the perception of the privatization process of the professionals and the general public has been narrowed to a process implemented by the National Property Fund and the Ministry of Finance (by selling shares through vouchers). Finally, the aim of this publication is to analyze the application of economic theories within the privatization process in the Czech Republic which describes the pros and cons of this unique economic and national economy “experiment“.
P26|The Impact of External Pressure on Voting Outcomes in Transition Economies|The public choice model developed in this paper explains how increased external intervention and monitoring may lead to lessening of the intrinsic motivation within transitional economies to pursue reforms as prescribed by the Washington Consensus. This may lead to the slowdown of economic and institutional reforms sometimes followed by a lack of support for reform in popular votes at election time. Conditions under which this situation may occur are identified. The model is empirically tested for the period 1990-2001, encompassing more than fifteen East European countries. Results of the analysis suggest that the impact of external pressure expressed as the amount of U.S. loans on voting outcomes in transitional countries is significant. Consistent with prior expectations, a new class of private landowners and farmers support further privatization and market orientation and consequently vote for Western-oriented parties. Likewise, a new system of market based economies brings along more volatility and uncertainty creating an income based population segmentation and inequality. Higher fertility rates which are typically associated with lower income levels lead to fewer votes going to reformist, pro-market parties. Hence, foreign investors will clearly have to target the more affluent segment of populations in transitional economies for more support.
P26|On the Alleged Stagnation of Capitalism|The assumption that capitalist globalization has been a period of overall stagnation is the dominant consensus opinion within Marxist political economy. This paper criticizes this opinion and shows that it rests on a mis-measure of the transition of the centrally planned economics of the ex-USSR, Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and China developed by the official statistical agencies during the Cold War. This mis-measure has the effect of underestimating both the collapse of physical output in the ex-USSR and CEE during the transition and underestimating the growth of genuine national income after the creation of market economies where previously there had been none. This paper develops some alternative, much higher, estimates of the real growth of national income during the transition period.
P26|A quarter century of economic reforms in Ukraine: too late, too slow, too little / Æwieræ wieku ukraiñskich reform: za ma³o, za póŸno i zbyt wolno|"The first aim of this paper is to describe the main developments in the Ukrainian economy since its independence in 1991, focusing on the evolution of output, and the path of economic reforms — that is, to simply show what happened. The bottom line on that is well known: Ukraine’s economy performed very poorly, and its reforms moved quite slowly, lagging behind most of Central Europe and the Baltic, and even behind some FSU (Former Soviet Union) countries. This first task is a relatively easy one, though some measurement issues do need discussion. In comparison, the second aim — explaining why it happened, identifying the explanatory, causal factors — is much more difficult and contentious. Indeed, causation here means two dynamics: the relationship between performance and reform pace, and the underlying determinants of the slow reforms. The paper’s main effort will be to argue and present evidence that the poor economic performance is primarily due to the late and slow start on economic reforms. However, it only begins to point to the explanations for slow reforms and suggest a modeling approach to analyze this econometrically in future work. Contents of this publication were first presented by Oleh Havrylyshyn during the 135th mBank-CASE Seminar ""A quarter century of economic reforms in Ukraine: too late, too slow, too little"". / Niniejsze opracowanie ma na celu opisaæ g³ówne zmiany, jakie zasz³y w ukraiñskiej gospodarce od momentu odzyskania niepodleg³oœci w 1991 roku, równoczeœnie zwracaj¹c uwagê na rozwój produkcji i œcie¿ki reform gospodarczych.

P26|Words or deeds: what matters? On the role of symbolic action in political decentralization|Although decentralization is often modeled as an outcome of bargaining over rents and policies, public statements, symbols and status have a great impact on this process as well. The paper studies the relative importance of “real” political actions versus changes of a symbolic nature in the bargaining over devolution, using the unique laboratory of personnel recentralization in the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in 2000 through 2007. While in the 1990s, most regional branches of federal ministries were under control of regional governors, and Vladimir Putin replaced the heads of agencies with new bureaucrats in the 2000s, thereby cutting their connections to the regions. This paper finds a robust influence of symbolic gestures made by regional governments in the earlier bargaining process on appointments, even controlling for the actual policies. It finds that regions sending stronger signal in favor of devolution in the 1990s were less likely to be punished by the federal government. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
P26|Gender and occupational wage gaps in Romania: from planned equality to market inequality?|In Romania, the communist regime promoted an official policy of gender equality for more than 40 years, providing equal access to education and employment and restricting pay differentiation based on gender. After its fall in December 1989, the promotion of equal opportunities and treatment for men and women did not constitute a priority for any governments of the 1990s. This paper analyzes both gender and occupational wage gaps before and during the first years of the transition to a market economy and finds that the communist institutions did succeed in eliminating the gender wage differences in female- and male-dominated occupations but not in gender-integrated occupations. During both regimes, wage differences were, in general, much higher among workers of the same gender working in different occupations than between men and women working in the same occupational group, and women experienced a larger variation in occupational wage differentials than men.

P26|Economic Effects of Post-Socialist Constitutions Revisited (nearly) 25 Years from the Outset of Transition|Post-socialist transition taking place since 1989 in countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as later in Central and Southwestern Asia, brought about simultaneous changes of their political and economic systems, requiring the establishment of new constitutional frameworks. In this paper we study the effects of post-socialist constitutional change on economic policy decisions of countries involved in this process. As nearly 25 years have passed from the outset of transition, the data allows to conduct an empirical study based on an econometric model confirming the relevance of several constitutional rules in this respect, e.g. regarding the model of government and constitutional judiciary. Based on the results, recommendations are made for countries, where the transition process has been slow and unsuccessful.
P26|Loose Cannons – War Veterans and the Erosion of Democracy in Weimar Germany| I study the effect of war participation on the rise of right-wing parties in Inter-war Germany. After the democratisation and surrender of Germany in 1918, 8m German soldiers of WWI were demobilised. I argue that defeat made veterans particularly sceptical about the new democratic state. Their return undermined support for democratic parties from the very beginning and facilitated the reversion to autocratic rule 15 years later. In order to quantify this effect, I construct the first disaggregated estimates of German WWI veterans since official army records were destroyed. I combine this data with a new panel of voting results from 1881 to 1933. Diff-in-Diff estimates show that war participation had a strong positive effect on support for the right-wing at the expense of socialist parties. A one standard deviation increase in veteran inflow shifted vote shares to the right by more than 2 percentage points. An IV strategy based on draft exemption rules substantiates my findings. The effect of veterans on voting is highly persistent and strongest in working class areas. Gains for the right-wing, however, are only observed after a period of Communist insurgencies. I provide suggestive evidence that veterans must have picked up especially antiCommunist sentiments after defeat, injected these into the working class and in this way eroded the future of the young democracy.
P26|Competence vs. Loyalty: Political survival and electoral fraud in Russia’s regions 2000–2012| Election fraud is a pervasive feature of autocracies but often only serves lower-tier officials to cast signals of loyalty or competence to the central government in order to pursue their own interests. How much such personal interests matter for electoral fraud under autocracy has however not been studied so far. In this paper, I exploit a radical policy change in Russia which allowed the president to replace governors of the country’s 89 regions at his own will. As a result, federal elections after December 2004 were organised by two types of governors: one was handpicked by the president, the other one elected before the law change and re-appointed. Even though both types faced removal in case of bad results, the need to signal loyalty was much lower for the first type. In order to estimate the effect of handpicked governors on electoral fraud, I use a diff-in-diff framework over 7 federal elections between 2000 and 2012. For this time period, I use results from about 95,000 voting stations to construct a new indicator of suspicious votes for each region and election. I show that this indicator correlates strongly with incidents of reported fraud. My baseline estimates show that in territories with a handpicked governor the share of suspicious votes decreased on average by more than 10 percentage points and dropped even further if the region’s economy had done well over the past legislature. These findings suggest that governors have less need to use rigging as a signal once loyalty is assured unless faced with circumstances raising doubts about their competence.
P26|A political economy of China's export restrictions on rare earth elements|We investigate why governments restrict exports of exotic raw materials taking rare earth elements as a case study. Trade restrictions on exotic materials do not have immediate macroeconomic effects. Relocating rare earth intensive industries is found to be the main reason behind China's export barriers. They are part of a more extensive strategy aiming at creating comparative advantages in these sectors and at overcoming path dependencies. Moreover, export barriers serve as a second-best instrument to reduce pollution and to slow down the depletion of exhaustible resources. Growing domestic rare earth consumption renders those increasingly ineffective. Rising reliance on mine-site regulation indicates that this fact is taken into account. Rare earth extraction is dominated by a few large companies; the demand side is dispersed. That speaks against successful lobbying for export restrictions. It appears as if the export barriers are set up to compensate mining firms.
P26|Initial endowments and economic reform in 27 post-socialist countries|This study explores how initial endowments at the start of transition have shaped reform outcomes and reform trajectories in 27 former communist countries in Europe and Central Asia. Countries of the former Russian Empire that had a large resources sector at the start of transition underperformed other countries in terms of the speed and the depth of economic reforms. The effect is particularly strong for privatization, enterprise restructuring and competition policy. Within country, Ottoman or Russian provinces that had a large natural resources sector in 1989 have a lower share of entrepreneurs and of small and medium sized enterprises today and also experience endemic corruption. Our results indicate that the propensity, or ability, of special interest groups to capture the reform process that would erode their rents were facilitated by the quality of institutions whose foundations go back centuries; and that the effects on the local economy are real.
P26|Education and the Transition to Sustained Democracy|We study empirically the role of education, age structure and other socioeconomic factors as a determinant of the transition to stable democratic regimes. Our findings suggest that educational improvements (in particular in primary education) and policies towards reducing inequalities in educational attainment play a particularly important role as a catalyst of sustainable democratization processes.

P26|How important is industry-specific managerial experience for innovative firm performance?|This study examines how industry-specific managerial experience affects firms' innovation performance in the context of different institutional environments. Based on firm-level data from 27 Central and Eastern European countries we identify a robust positive relationship between industry-specific experience of the top-manager and the decision to innovate as well as the share of new product-related sales. These effects are particularly pronounced for small firms operating outside the European Union or, more generally, in institutionally less developed countries. The results suggest that managerial experience affects firm innovations largely indirectly, for example, by reducing uncertainty about future returns on innovations or by providing knowledge about how to cope with institutional shortfalls potentially hampering the commercial success of new products.
P26|From Divergence to Convergence: Reevaluating the History behind China's Economic Boom|China's long-term economic dynamics pose a formidable challenge to economic historians. The Qing Empire (1644-1911), the world's largest national economy before 1800, experienced a tripling of population during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries with no signs of diminishing per capita income. While the timing remains in dispute, a vast gap emerged between newly rich industrial nations and China's lagging economy in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. Only with an unprecedented growth spurt beginning in the late 1970s did this great divergence separating China from the global leaders substantially diminish, allowing China to regain its former standing among the world's largest economies. This essay develops an integrated framework for understanding that entire history, including both the divergence and the recent convergent trend. We explain how deeply embedded political and economic institutions that contributed to a long process of extensive growth before 1800 subsequently prevented China from capturing the benefits associated with the Industrial Revolution. During the twentieth century, the gradual erosion of these historic constraints and of new obstacles erected by socialist planning eventually opened the door to China's current boom. Our analysis links China's recent development to important elements of its past, while using recent success to provide fresh perspectives on the critical obstacles undermining earlier modernization efforts, and their eventual removal.
P26|Developmental perspectives on Europe|The crisis of 2008–2009 has ended, stockmarkets skyrocketed in 2012–2013, while growth of the real sector remained sluggish in Europe. This article attempts to explain the latter puzzle. Analyzing long term factors, the costs of short-termism in crisis management become obvious. The limitations of EU as a growth engine are highlighted.
P26|China as a Developmental State|" type=""main"" xml:id=""twec12215-abs-0001""> The paper examines the notion of a ‘developmental state’ and shows that China possesses the relevant characteristics. It explains the political economy which generated such a state in China. It analyses the institutions and methods that were introduced to create a developmental state, in particular the incentive structures that the leadership used to solve the principal-agent problem implicit in having centralised political control but decentralised economic management. These include personnel policies, fiscal decentralisation and patronage relationships. That leads to a review of its successes, limitations and adverse consequences and to the question: can China's developmental state be sustained? Among these issues are the great socioeconomic changes that rapid economic growth has entailed – which have strengthened the case for broadening government policy objectives beyond the previous narrow focus on growth. Conclusions are drawn for both China and other developing countries."
P26|Towards Behavioral Political Economy of Institutional Change: With Field Facts from China|This study proposes an analytical framework towards behavioral political economy of institutional change. It considers institutional changes as central government’s choices under uncertainty, which are largely driven by the strategic outcomes in a behavioral coordination game between local officials and private businessmen. With field facts in China, this study suggests that institutional changes begin with pro-competition policies, then a better protection of property rights, followed by a possible standstill or even worse rule of law.
P26|Current tendencies in corporate governance system in Russia|The aim of this article is to analyze current selected tendencies in Russian corporate governance system that have been observed in the past few years. The corporate governance in Russia started formulating in the nineties of the 20th century as a result of the privatization process. It’s principal mechanism is a concentrated ownership structure. On the basis of a research conducted by the leading Russian research centers, the authors analyze changes concerning the ownership structure of Russia’s companies, including the model of companies’ owners, the role of the state both in the ownership structure and in corporate control and capital markets. The authors also try to define the probable further changes in corporate governance system in Russia.
