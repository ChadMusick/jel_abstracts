B59|The Precariat Class Structure and Income Inequality Among US Workers: 1980-2018|I apply the precariat class schema developed by Standing to the US workforce from 1980-2018. I use a decomposition of inequality to show that this schema explains a substantial and growing portion of income inequality. I find that that the precariat, typified by unstable and benefit-free jobs, make up a large and growing share of the US work force, that the “old” working class shrank precipitously, and that the demographics of these two classes differ substantially. Finally, I illustrate that insight into these difficult to measure phenomena can be gained with an easily replicable class schema using plausible class definitions.
B59|An attitude of complexity: thirteen essays on the nature and construction of reality under the challenge of Zeno's Paradox|This book is about the construction of reality. The central aim of this study is to understand how gravity works and how it may be focused and manipulated. While I do not have an answer to this question, the discoveries along the way have been worth collecting into a single volume for future reference.
B59|The nature of Public Interest in Muslim and Non-Muslim writers|Leading a comfortable life on this planet with few problems and worries is one of the aims and objective of human since the dawn of history. Defining and then achieving a prosperous and comfortable life has been the subject of intense discussion among philosophers and religious scholars since the dawn of history. In order to investigate whether the contemporary economic system better serves the wellbeing of the general population (public interest), then it is very important to know that what the public interest itself actually means? To accomplish this task, we started this essay with an examination of the idea of public interest from both Muslims and non-Muslims writers. After the emergence of enlightenment self-interest got prominence due to which public interest among non-Muslims writers is considered as a rule or concept serving to present something as suitable for long term approval or acceptance according to changing circumstances. In contrast Muslim writers think that public interest refers to the fulfilment of the objective of the Sharia which lies in safeguarding their faith (Din/Religion), their human self (Nafs), their intellect (Aql), their posterity (Nasl) and their wealth (Maal). There will be violence and corruption without these five basics purposes of Sharia.
B59|Die Illusion der Identität und die Krise der Wissenschaften|Das Eingangszitat von George Forster aus dem Jahre 1793 gibt einen ersten Hinweis auf das, was nachfolgend zu entfalten ist. Als These formuliert: Die Begriffe der modernen Wissenschaften sind auf innere Weise mit dem Rechnen in einer Geldökonomie verbunden. Die vielfältig zu beobachtenden Krisenphänomene in zahlreichen Wissenschaften lassen sich auf einen gemeinsamen Grund zurückführen. Ich werde zunächst von einer spezifischen Blickweise ausgehen, die charakteristisch ist für die modernen Wissenschaften, um in dieser Perspektive die stillschweigenden kategorialen Voraussetzungen näher zu beschreiben. Daraus lassen sich dann Krisenphänomene, die in Mathematik, Physik und Ökonomie zu beobachten sind, verständlich machen.
B59|The anti-democratic logic of right-wing populism and neoliberal market-fundamentalism|The paper compares neoliberal market-fundamentalism and right-wing populism on the basis of its core patterns of thinking and reasoning. Based on an analysis of the work of important founders of market fundamental economic thinking (particularly Mises, and Hayek) and the arguments brought forward by leading right-wing populist we find highlight conceptual resemblances of these two approaches: Both show a world that is split into only two countervailing parts. Right-wing populism shows a society split into two groups, fighting against each other. In a similar vein, neoliberal market-fundamentalism shows only two possible countervailing economic and societal orders. Thus, we develop a scheme of the similar dual social worlds of right-wing-populism and market-fundamentalism and offer some examples in the history of the Republican Party, where these concepts mutually reinforced each other or served as a gateway for each other. The main conclusion of the paper is that neoliberal market-fundamentalism and right-wing populism can be perceived as two mutually reinforcing and radicalizing threats to democracy in the 21st century.
B59|The European economic crisis from 2007 onwards in the context of a global crisis of over-production of capital - a Marxian monetary theory of value interpretation|This paper attempts to clarify how the European economic crisis from 2007 onwards can be understood from the perspective of a Marxian monetary theory of value that emphasizes in-trinsic, structural flaws regarding capitalist reproduction. Chapter two provides an empirical description of the European economic crisis, which to some extent already reflects the struc-tural theoretical framework presented in chapter three. Regarding the theoretical framework Michael Heinrich's interpretation of 'the' Marxian monetary theory of value will be presented. Heinrich identifies connections between production and realization, between profit and inter-est rate as well as between industrial and fictitious capital, which represent contradictory tendencies for which capitalism does not have simple balancing processes. In the context of a discussion of 'structural logical aspects' of Marx's Critique of the Political Economy, explana-tory deficits of Heinrich's approach are analyzed. In the following, it is argued that Fred Mose-ley's view of these 'structural logical aspects' allows empirical 'applications' of Marxian mon-etary theories of value. It is concluded that a Marxian monetary theory of value, with the characteristics of expansive capital accumulation and its limitations, facilitates a structural analysis of the European economic crisis from 2007 onwards. In this line of argument, expan-sive production patterns are expressed, among other things, in global restructuring processes, while consumption limitations are mitigated by expansive financial markets and shifts in ex-port destinations.
B59|The Europe of the five parts of the world: François Perroux on European Integration|"Although seldom remembered in this respect, François Perroux exerted direct and indirect influence on the debate on European integration in the immediate post-war period in France. The theme of European integration serves in Perroux’s work as a concrete case study on which a series of his recurrent themes could be explored, such as his theory of domination, his reflection on economic spaces, development and the costs of man (""coûts de l’homme""), or even as an extension of topics from his work in the 1930s related to corporatism and communitarianism. Perroux deals with the theme of European integration fundamentally in an extensive book from 1954, L’Europe sans rivages, but also in several others of his books and articles from the period, forming a complex and multifaceted analysis of the problematic that, nevertheless, insists in a central message: the importance of the global aspect of the European integration, thinking in a Europe of the “five parts of the world”. This paper offers an analysis of this set of writings, connecting it to the institutional and political context of the debate on European integration in France. The goal is to situate the effective influence Perroux’s ideas and his concrete personal influence on important names of Jean Monnet entourage. Taking these general questions as a reference, and starting with Perroux’s perspectives on topics such as national accounts, planning and liberal interventionism, the article also explores the critical thinking undertaken by Perroux, throughout the 1950s, on the institutional and political paths taken in the first years of the European integration process, approximating his analysis to other voices that critically discussed those paths, such as, for example, Gunnar Myrdal. Doing this, the paper also explores important connections, not frequently visited in the literature of the history of economic ideas, between the European integration and the field of economic development or regarding the debates on regional inequalities that took shape in the midst of the postwar European reconstruction projects."
B59|Economics of Information Biasing: A Unified Economic Theory That Leads to New Sustainability Concepts|The author believes that his concept “Biased Equilibrium” based on information sharing strategies of individual economic agents brings two scientific paradigms of economics, neoclassical economics and institutional economics together from the origin of general equilibrium to provide holistic view of real world economic and social structures. In this article he goes deep into the concept of dynamics of rational behaviors with respect to diverse self-interests of individual economic agents. Our social or economic institutions can be subjectively modeled as an information biasing chain where individuals are positioned in different abstract coalitions according to interdependence of their payoff functions. The upper layer coalitions virtually control the institutions and they have greater influences on our economy that provokes growth by exhausting energy and other natural resources and causes climate change. His model also provides guidelines for transiting from a growth based economy to a sustainable economy, while solving macro and micro-economic challenges in real time.
B59|A Dangerous Alliance? The Relationship Between Ecuador and China|Abstract The aim of this article is to outline the relationship between Ecuador and China, highlighting its main threats to the development of the Ecuadorian Republic, and in particular how the implementation of the buen vivir economic paradigm which Ecuador is experimenting with may be affected if it does not change the terms of engagement with the Asian giant. The article is structured as follows: in the introduction, we present an overview of the historical framework of the Chinese relationship with Ecuador. There follows an analysis supported by data on the commercial situation between the two countries and its implications for the development of the Latin-American state. In our final remarks, we present the possible routes that Ecuador could follow to secure its path to development, while highlighting possible conditions under which Ecuador could cooperate with China while avoiding a state of dependency.
B59|Toward A New Framework of Islamic Economic Analysis|The effort to develop Islamic economics as a discipline has not brought about the expected results. Differing from previous diagnoses, in this paper, I argue that it is the absence of a clear notion of what economics can be considered to be Islamic that impedes the development of Islamic economics. Such a clear notion is essential. I therefore propose three main conditions under which an economics can be considered as (and henceforth to be given the prefix) Islamic. I further propose that the scope of Islamic economics consists of four distinguished fields of work, and that the methods used in the development of Islamic economics vary depending on the end sought within each field of work. I finally expand on three implications, which together give rise to a hope that the development of Islamic economics, and its body of knowledge, is likely to be much less complicated than Islamic economists have ever thought.
B59|Postkeynesianismus: Ein heterodoxer Ansatz auf der Suche nach einer Fundierung|In diesem Beitrag geht es darum, den Postkeynesianismus als paradigmatische Alternative zum herrschenden neoklassischen Mainstream etwas näher kennenzulernen. Es zeigt sich sehr schnell, dass der Postkeynesianismus keine einheitliche Denkschule darstellt, sondern vielmehr eine Vielzahl von theoretischen Ansätzen darunter zu verstehen ist, die eine Reihe von methodologischen und epistemologischen Gemeinsamkeiten aufweist und die einige identitätsstiftende Postulate verbindet. Zum konkreten Nachvollzug dieser Postulate aus dem axiomatischen Kern des Postkeynesianismus wird dann darauf verzichtet, dass Kaleidoskop postkeynesinaischer Theorie mit kaleckianischer, kaldorianischer oder gar sraffianischer Grundlage aufzuzeigen, sondern es wird vielmehr nur ein Postkeynesianismus - die monetäre Theorie der Produktion - in seiner paradigmatischen und formalen Struktur beleuchtet und die darauf aufbauende Theorie der Marktteilnahme als alternative Theorie der Wirtschaftspolitik dargelegt.
B59|The welfare state and liberal democracy: A political economy approach|This paper attempts to shed some light on the developments of welfare states in highly developed nations since WW2 within the context of a narrative which seeks to combine institutional distinctions, termed 'varieties of capitalism', with the historical regimes of regulation theory in a political economy perspective which puts interested political actors at centre stage. It will be argued that in a liberal democracy, the elite has the framing and agenda-setting power to 'manufacture a political will' according to its interests. The welfare state is not the result of a long social struggle on the part of the needy; rather, it results in its general features from the minimal state of meritocratic exigencies. Under the very peculiar circumstances of the post-WW2 era, this even translated into a rise in social welfare spending to more than a third of national income. The particular design of welfare state organisation was the subject-matter of political conflict, and a clear distinction between liberal and coordinated market economies can be attributed to cultural differences and institutional settings. Yet the core of the welfare state conception serves the interest of the meritocracy as much as those who benefit from social programmes and re-distribution. And the neoliberal attack on the welfare state since the 1980s is not a necessary re-calibration due to changing economic conditions or a growing lack of solidarity among the people but an expression of a modified cost-benefit analysis from the elite's perspective.
B59|The limits to profit-wage redistribution: Endogenous regime shifts in Kaleckian models of growth and distribution|"A feature of Kaleckian models of distribution and growth that is often overlooked is that they describe a nonlinear relation between functional income distribution and demand and growth, because the size of the multiplier is affected by redistribution from wages to profits and vice versa. This paper addresses the nonlinearity of the standard post-Kaleckian model by examining its so-called IS-curves. It is found that changes in functional income distribution affect the ""distribution-ledness"" of an economy: redistribution towards wages reinforces the wage-led or profit-led character of an economy, while redistribution towards profits does the opposite. In addition, redistribution towards wages can turn an intermediate regime wage-led. A standard post-Kaleckian model with nonlinear investment behaviour is then presented. This model yields substantially different IS curves, such that an optimal functional income distribution can be derived. However, it is found that unlike in the standard model, this optimum is not the same for the different classes, such that true opposing interests appear in the model."
B59|Policy Goals in the Eyes of the Public: Preservation of the Liberal Democratic Order Remains Most Important|More than just a few politicians and scientists see an imbalance in policy’s primary orientation toward economic goals, especially the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In view of scientific and public discourses on prosperity, this report analyzes how voting-eligible Germans, the electorate, rated the significance of different policy areas in 2013 and again at the beginning of 2017. It is based on two representative surveys conducted together with Kantar Public (formerly TNS Infratest), in which respondents were asked to rate the relevance of various policy areas. The areas included were based on the ten social indicators favored by the study commission, “Growth, Prosperity and Quality of Life,” and 20 out of the 46 indicators the German government uses in its “Living Well in Germany” Report to describe quality of life. This report shows that the majority of German citizens do indeed view the areas which are described by the indicators as important policy dimensions. In both 2013 and 2017, “preserving democracy” had the highest relevance. In 2017, “improved care for old people” was number two, and a “more effective battle against crime” took (by a very small margin) third place, followed by “full employment.” While there is a high consensus on the importance of these four goals, the assessment of the importance of further policy goals varies greatly across people, and there are also clear systematic differences in the relevance of policy areas among different social groups. The issue of refugees does not appear as a policy goal in the classifications of the commission and the government, which iswhy it was not included in the survey.
B59|Politikziele im Spiegel der Bevölkerung: Erhalt der freiheitlich-demokratischen Ordnung weiterhin am wichtigsten|Nicht wenige PolitikerInnen und WissenschaftlerInnen sehen in einer primären Ausrichtung der Politik an ökonomischen Wohlstandsindikatoren eine Schieflage. Angesichts wissenschaftlicher und öffentlicher Diskurse zum Thema Wohlstand analysiert dieser Bericht, wie die Wahlberechtigten in Deutschland die Bedeutung verschiedener Politikziele 2013 und zu Beginn des Jahres 2017 einschätzten. Grundlage sind zwei mit Kantar Public (vormals TNS Infratest) durchgeführte repräsentative Befragungen, in denen die Relevanz verschiedener Politikziele direkt ermittelt wurde. Die Auswahl der Ziele orientierte sich dabei an den von der Enquete- Kommission „Wachstum, Wohlstand, Lebensqualität“ ausgewählten zehn Wohlstandsindikatoren, die die Ergebnisse von Politik quantifizieren, sowie an 20 der 46 von der Bundesregierung ausgewählten Indikatoren, welche die Lebensqualität („Gut leben in Deutschland“) beschreiben sollen. Dieser Bericht zeigt, dass diese Indikatoren tatsächlich von den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern überwiegend als wichtige Politikziele angesehen werden. An der Spitze der Relevanz lag 2013 wie 2017 der Erhalt der Demokratie. Auf Platz zwei landet 2017 die Verbesserung der Pflege alter Menschen und den dritten Rang nimmt eine wirksamere Bekämpfung der Kriminalität ein, der ein etwas höheres Gewicht als Vollbeschäftigung zugemessen wird. Gleichzeitig zeigt sich, dass die Menschen verschiedene Politikbereiche erkennbar unterschiedlich gewichten. Zusätzlich wird deutlich, dass es auch systematische Unterschiede in der Relevanz von Politikbereichen bei verschiedenen sozialen Gruppen gibt. Nach dem Themenbereich „Geflüchtete“ wurde nicht gefragt, da die Zahl der Geflüchteten in beiden Indikatorensystemen nicht als Politikbereich enthalten ist.
B59|"A ""gung-ho"" Approach Towards Sophic Economy"|"The object of this study has been the Sophic Economy of Sergei Bulgakov ï¿½ an alternative and valuable philosophical-economic doctrine. At the beginning, facts-examples have been identified in a contemporary, social and purposely localized context (contemporary Italian society), demonstrating a certain potential sensibility towards the idea of Sophic Economy. Then, Bulgakovï¿½s thought has been expounded with a purposeful tone instead of the critical-purposeful frame originally used by Bulgakov himself in the volume Philosophy of Economy: the world as household. The quality of the examined content has raised the simple question, What about the dynamics of the diffusion of ideas like these? Employing what I call the ""gung-ho"" approach ï¿½ the researcherï¿½s imagination as a historical technique method that does not integrate the facts of the past but places them in a sort of laboratory-simulative environment model ï¿½ the idea of Sophic Economy has been inserted in NetLogoï¿½s Spreading Utopian Ideas Model. The popularization of an alternative philosophical doctrine and the proposal-experiment of an original method of historical research in Economics have been the main results of the present study."
B59|Concordian Economics: Beyond Micro and Macroeconomics|In Concordian economics there is no distinction between micro and macro economics, because the economic process is the same for the individual person, the city, the nation, or the world, What changes is the scale, but not the structure of the process. When micro and macro economics are seen as one, it makes no sense to add monetary wealth to real wealth. It becomes then evident that monetary wealth is not wealth; monetary wealth is a legal representation of real wealth.
B59|Does Bible and Quran Represent the True Word of God, The Economist case against Addictive substances|Policy prescription regarding addictive substances is one of the critical issues facing humanity since time immemorial. It is a universal truth that drug adductors are always trouble makers in terms of creating violence, corruption, incest and numerous other immoral and corrupt activities across the globe. In order to formulate the best and universal policy approach, the present study analyzed the policy prescription of economists and different religions. Christian church like the Jews not only permits but encourage the use of addictive substances in their various religious festivals. Mainstream economists case about addictive substances is based on confusion and contradiction. In sharp contrast Islam consider addictive substances as the mother of all evils and ills. Muslim jurists on one side strictly restrict the production and consumption of addictive substances, while on the other side through moral education its use is discouraged.
B59|Optimizing Discount Rates: Expressing Preferences for Sustainable Outcomes in Present Value Calculations|This paper describes how the discount rate used in present value calculations expresses the preference for sustainability in decision making, and its implication for sustainable economic growth. In essence, the lower the discount rate, the greater the regard for the future, and the more likely we choose behaviors that lead to long-term sustainability. The theoretical framework combines behavioral economics and holonomics, which involve limitations of regard for the future due to constraints on processing uncertainty. An alternative formulation for present value calculations, which includes a survival function, is developed. A taxonomy of institutions based on discount rate is proposed.
B59|The Macroeconomic Implications of Consumption: State-of-Art and Prospects for the Heterodox Future Research|The recent US economic scenario has motivated a series of heterodox papers concerned with household indebtedness and consumption. Though discussing autonomous consumption, most of the theoretical papers rely on private investmentled growth models. An alternative approach is the so-called Sraffian supermultipler model, which treats long-run investment as induced, allowing for the possibility that other final demand components – including consumption – may lead long-run growth. We suggest that the dialogue between these approaches is not only possible but may prove to be quite fruitful.
B59|A supermultiplier Stock-Flow Consistent model: the “return” of the paradoxes of thrift and costs in the long run?|Supermultiplier models have been recently brought to the post-Keynesian debate. Yet these models still rely on quite simple economic assumptions, being mostly flow models which omit the financial determinants of autonomous expenditures. Since the output growth rate converges in the long run to the exogenously given growth rate of “non-capacity creating” autonomous expenditure and the utilization rate moves towards the normal utilization rate, the paradoxes of thrift and costs remain valid only as level effects (average growth rates). This paper investigates whether the core conclusions of supermultiplier models hold in a more complex economic framework, described by means of a supermultiplier SFC model, in which private business investment is assumed to be completely induced by income while the autonomous expenditure component—in this case consumption out of wealth—becomes endogenous. The results of the numerical simulation experiments suggest that the paradox of thrift can remain valid in terms of growth effects and that a lower profit share can also be associated with a higher accumulation rate, though with a lower profit rate.
B59|The relationship between Ecuador and China: a dangerous alliance?|The aim of this paper is to outline the relationship between Ecuador and China by highlighting the main threats for the development of the Ecuadorian Republic, in particular how it will affect the implementation of the buen vivir, the new economic paradigm experimented in the Latin American State, if it does not change the terms of affair with the Asian giant. The paper is structured as follows: in the introduction, we will present an overview on the historical framework of the relationships of China with Ecuador. Later there will be an analysis supported by data on the commercial situation between the two countries, and its implication over the development of the Latin American state. Finally, some final remarks will present the possible paths that Ecuador can follow to secure its way to development. With this, we will highlight under which conditions Ecuador and China can cooperate while avoiding a state of dependency.
B59|Green-oriented Knowledge Transfers in global markets: technologies, capabilities, institutions|The development of green technologies represents a key driver in the transition towards environmentally sustainable societies. Among environmental challenges, the implementation of national climate policies and international efforts to face the threat of climate change has been particularly effective at triggering the production of climate-friendly innovation in developed countries. This effectiveness has been acknowledged by several studies which observed that, for example, the production of patents related to renewable energy technologies has sharply increased over the last decades. However, the battle against climate change is far from being over. As the share of greenhouse gases emissions in developing countries is sharply growing, how to promote the transfer of available green technologies to these countries is one of the main challenges that policymakers are facing in recent years. Understanding the mechanisms behind technology transfer of “environmental” knowledge and how such transfer happens among countries with heterogeneous economic conditions and different capabilities is a complex exercise. In this report we provide an overview of the literature on green knowledge transfer and, more importantly, on how such literature can be strengthened to deepen the understanding of the interactions that are at stake. The conceptual analysis is aimed at offering a platform to set in-field projects with stakeholders (research/business oriented), to concretely implement the elaboration and general best practice identification for knowledge and technology transfers in the green economy transition.
B59|Reconsidering Communication Regarding Economic Phenomena. Some Hints from a Complexity Approach|This paper, inspired by the notion of complexity and the use of network analysis, is presented as a short survey on communication in economics when it is addressed to people who approach the subject neither for study nor for professional purposes. Their perception of the economic system has also been shaped by events interpreted by opinion and political leaders. Its main contribution is an attempt to avoid current misunderstandings arising from a mechanical notion of the economic system and a consequent excess of confidence in what political economy can do in pursuing welfare. To do this, after a brief review of useful perceptions of phenomena both at system level and at firm level, we will propose some hints arising from complexity and network theory for an alternative viewpoint on political prescriptions and for a better appreciation of the entrepreneurial function. At the end, we will conclude with some teaching suggestions along with final remarks about understanding economics.
B59|NEW ECONOMIC WINDOWS ON INCOME AND WEALTH: THE k-GENERALIZED FAMILY OF DISTRIBUTIONS|Over the last decades, the distribution of income and wealth has been deteriorating in many countries, leading to increased inequalities within and between societies. This tendency has revived the interest in the subject greatly, yet it still receives very little attention within the realm of mainstream economic thinking. One reason for this is that the basic paradigm of “standard economics”, the representative-agent General Equilibrium framework, is badly equipped to cope with distributional issues. Here we argue that when the economy is treated as a complex system composed of many heterogeneous interacting agents who give rise to emergent phenomena, to address the main stylized facts of income/wealth distribution requires leaving the toolbox of mainstream economics in favour of alternative approaches. The “?-generalized” family of income/wealth distributions, building on the categories of complexity, is an example of how advances in the field can be achieved within new interdisciplinary research contexts.
B59|Directed Technical Change and Capital Deepening: A Reconsideration of Kaldor's Technical Progress Function|This note proposes a growth model that is derived from the standard Solow growth model by replacing the neoclassical production function with Kaldor’s technical progress function while maintaining a marginalist theory of factor prices in the spirit suggested by von Weizsäcker (1966, 1966b). The hybrid model so obtained accounts for balanced growth in a way that appears less arbitrary than the Solow model, especially because it directly accounts for Harrod neutral technical change, without any need for further assumptions.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B59|Understanding Financial Instability: Minsky Versus the Austrians|Although Minsky’s interpretation of Keynes’s macroeconomics and essential message clashes with authoritative alternative interpretations, it has become increasingly influential during the years following the Global Financial Crisis, even in mainstream circles. This paper offers a critical evaluation of Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis from the perspective of the alternative Austro-Wicksellian paradigm. Although some of the similarities and/or analogies between Minsky’s approach and that of the Austrian School suggest a more than merely superficial affinity between the two theoretical frameworks and although some scope for cross-fertilization between both approaches can be found, both theoretically and empirically, at a fundamental conceptual level both theories remain incompatible and difficult if not impossible to reconcile, in particular in terms of fundamental causality and in terms of policy conclusions and prescriptions. Despite the fact that Minsky’s policy conclusions are multifaceted and somewhat eclectic, they manifest a lack of familiarity with the conclusions of the Austrian analysis of the problems of central planning by Big Players such as Big Bank and Big Government. Both approaches also offer contrasting interpretations of the historical experience of the Global Financial Crisis.
B59|Más allá del posdesarrollo: avances hacia un sistema de cooperación sostenible|Con este artículo se ha pretendido refutar la autoridad del discurso posestructuralista como alternativa al desarrollo. Haciendo uso del aparato analítico del enfoque de las capacidades se corroboró como desde la concepción de desarrollo como libertad se consigue superar, sin necesidad de abandonarse al relativismo epistémico de la corriente posdesarrollista, el reduccionismo analítico de las teorías contemporáneas de desarrollo. De tal examen se concluyó que frente a las tesis posmodernas, la teoría de las capacidades es no solo más coherente normativamente, sino que también lo puede ser en términos operativos. Para esto último, se incorporan conceptos inéditos como la soft action (acción suave) y la “trampa de no desarrollo” con el que superar así, analíticamente, algunas de las barreras empíricas (fundamentalmente el fetichismo de la mercancía) que pudieran obstaculizar el éxito de un marco de cooperación (sostenible) adaptado a los retos del desarrollo como libertad.
B59|The common good and economics|This paper analyzes the meaning of the ‘common good’ and its impact on economics. It adopts the ‘classical notion of the common good’ which, conceived by Aristotle and further developed by Thomas Aquinas, has been widely used for centuries. Sections 2 and 3 introduce Aristotle's view on this notion, followed by Aquinas’ developments. Section 4 addresses the different meanings of common good in the 20th century. Given that the classical version of the common good implies an anthropological position and a theory of the good, Section 5 extracts them from Aristotle's works, while Section 6 deduces policy implications from the previous definitions. Finally, Section 7 analyzes two current economic theories from the point of view of their relation with the common good: economics of happiness and the capability approach. The final section presents a brief conclusion.
B59|Robots and humans – complements or substitutes?|The effect of the spread of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on wages depends on both the form of aggregate production relationships and the elasticity of substitution between human and robotic labor. With a conventional production function involving labor, robots, and ordinary capital, an increase in robotic labor can have either a positive or a negative effect on wages. Alternatively, it is possible to estimate the aggregate production relationship without measuring capital or other fixed factors explicitly, using the procedure developed by Houthakker in the 1950s. Houthakker's method is based on the probability distribution of the productivity of the variable factor. Fitting different distributions to cross-sectional data on U.S. productivity, it is shown that if the elasticity of substitution between human and robotic labor is greater than about 1.9, the burgeoning of AI technologies will cause a decline in aggregate wages, other things equal. For the manufacturing sector, an even smaller human-robot elasticity of substitution is likely to result in declining wages of industrial workers as robots proliferate.
B59|Understanding urban mobility and the impact of public policies: The role of the agent-based models|This paper provides a critical review of research on Agent-Based Models (ABMs) focusing on urban mobility, dealing either with passengers or with freight transport. The work concentrates on urban areas where public policies aiming at improving the sustainability of city systems necessarily affect both passengers and freight dimensions. Traffic in towns is responsible for a high share of congestion and pollution and consequently, it contributes to the climate change problems. The following conclusions can be derived. ABMs present important advantages for analysing urban transport and its sustainability but more efforts are needed in order to test and improve their use. In the literature, there is still a gap in urban transport AB modelling. The number of developed models is limited and they are often applied in broader geographical areas than urban ones. Only some of the works includes the estimation of environmental impacts as a result of certain types of agents' behaviour. Despite their potential effectiveness to represent the impacts of different public policies on agent behaviour and on the environment, none of the ABMs have been implemented in the real word by the researchers and there is no evidence of application of any model by policy-makers.
B59|Modèles multi-agents et stock-flux cohérents : une convergence logique et nécessaire|Les modèles à base d’agents multiples sont des modèles informatiques macroscopiques peuplés d’un grand nombre de modèles individuels. Dans ces modèles, les relations entre grandeurs agrégées ne sont pas postulées : elles « émergent » du système complexe formé par les interactions des agents individuels qui les peuplent. C’est dans le champ de la macroéconomie, il y a plus de 50 ans, qu’ont été posées les bases de cette approche. Pourtant, ses méthodes restent encore un objet d’étonnement parmi les économistes, qu’ils soient orthodoxes ou non. Cette approche connaît cependant depuis quelques années des succès croissants, surtout depuis le développement de modèles respectant la cohérence des stocks et des flux. Si le rapprochement entre une approche centrée sur les individus et une méthodologie issue d’une macroéconomie post-keynésienne volontiers organiciste peut paraître inattendu, pour nous, il répond à des nécessités logiques et scientifiques. Nous défendons l’idée selon laquelle la combinaison de la cohérence des stocks et des flux et de la multiplicité des agents est une opération essentielle au renouveau de la modélisation macroéconomique.
B59|A study on abdominal wagging in the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, with speculation on its meaning|Abstract Social vertebrates have a rich repertoire of communication signals and modalities. Recent work on the social insects has uncovered a diverse set of communication modalities including chemical, tactile, visual, and auditory signals to communicate a wide variety of information on the location of distant food sites, distress, and aggression. Here, we investigated abdominal wagging in the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. We found that the abdominal “wagging” that occurred inside the fire ant nests differed significantly from the abdominal “flagging” that is known to occur outside the fire ant nests. Neither sounds nor venom was emitted during abdominal wagging inside the fire ant nests. Moreover, the incidence and duration of abdominal wagging was greater when workers were tending brood or ingesting food than when engaged in non-brood related tasks or in donating food. Lastly, inside the nests, abdominal wagging neither attracted nor repelled nearby workers. Thus, we speculate that wagging is an expression of pleasure while tending brood or ingesting food that falls along the continuum between the aggressive nature of abdominal flagging and the distress call of abdominal stridulation.
B59|Race, Capitalism, and Power: The Economic Thought of the Young Jesse Jackson|Fifty years ago, Jesse Jackson joined the S.C.L.C. and rose rapidly to become one of this country’s major advocates of black capitalism. Far less well known is his interest in finance and credit for African Americans that suggests his prescience about the decline of industrial capitalism. Focusing on Jackson’s early civil rights activity in Chicago, this paper charts the initial stages through which Martin Luther King’s young pupil rapidly became a staunch supporter of black economic power, strongly committed to a wealth-transfer agenda, while most of the other civil rights and labor leaders showed more interest in a just distribution of income. Abandoning the stereotypical image of Jackson in his early years, an image limiting him to an ambitious activist interested in bargains and with little inclination for analysis of the economic reality of his times, this paper addresses Jackson’s forward way of thinking. His growing expertise in money and finance made him one of the few civil rights leaders who genuinely grasped the functioning of the post-industrial economy and constituted the true wellspring of his later pan-Africanism and economic policies.
B59|Modern Transformations of Economics: Neuroeconomics|Traditionally, economists have not been interested in the neural underpinnings of human behavior. According to the classical decision-making theory, a decision-maker is a perfectly rational cognitive agent ignoring the influence of emotions. However, in recent years this model has been challenged by prospect theory, which identifies heuristics and biases that influence human choice. A recent approach known as neuroeconomics is a transdisciplinary field that tries to shed light on the computational and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the decision-making process, integrating ideas and methods from the fields of psychology, neuroscience, economics and computer science. Neuroeconomics gives researchers an opportunity to look into the “black box” of the human brain, which will give an opportunity to investigate how people make choices, how the brain calculates gains and losses, the roles of emotions and cognition, etc. The aim of this paper is to survey findings from the neuroeconomic literature and investigate the implications of this knowledge for understanding human behavior in various contexts.
B59|Who are the forerunners, economists or central bankers?|Is it possible to tell whether central banks’ choices are grounded on monetary theories or whether the theories derive from what central bankers have already experimented? This study delves into this issue by adopting an approach that is novel for at least two reasons. First, it involves a lexical comparison between the textual content used by central banks and in economic articles. Second, this comparison is drawn using quantitative tools. In short, the variables measured here are words and segments of text that were submitted to a statistical analysis to identify trends and behaviors in central bankers and economists that would otherwise not be immediately apparent.
B59|How the Intelligent Non-Economist can Refute Every Economist Hands Down|Most non-economists tend to think that economists know what they are talking about when they use specific terms like income, profit, capital, market equilibrium, and so on. This is not the case. What, then, follows from the well-documented fact that the representative economist has no idea of what profit is? Quite simple: if the core concept profit is false then the whole economic theory/model is false. This holds for the Walrasian, the Keynesian, the Marxian, and the Austrian approach.
B59|Monopoly Capital and Capitalist Inequality: Marx after Piketty|This paper proposes that one major explanation of growing inequality in the United States (US) is through the use of the concept of economic surplus. The economic surplus is a neo-Marxian term which combines the traditional Marxian tenet of surplus value with other ways that surplus value can be invested in a mature, advanced capitalist economy. A rising economic surplus that is not absorbed through growing consumer spending, luxury spending or government spending results in stagnant wages and growing inequality via higher levels of underemployment and greater monopoly and monopsony power among a decreasing number of huge, powerful corporations. Therefore, the politics surrounding the growth of inequality in the US has to be understood first by understanding over accumulation of the economic surplus by those at the top of the US capitalist class. This research note gives estimates of the rising economic surplus over the last several decades in the US as well as how these correlate with the level of inequality. The growth of the economic surplus gives rise and form to the politics of inequality and austerity. As time goes by, the politics of inequality and austerity in the US will be manifested by greater corporate influence in the political system, greater political polarization, less government effectiveness, and more debates about welfare spending, corporate taxation, taxes on upper income households, and taxes on wealth.
B59|The 'Common Goood' in Pope Francis's Social Welfare Hypothesis|In conventional welfare economics Pareto optimality requires competitive markets in which rational sellers use pure private resources to produce pure private goods and services for rational consumers. Although such theory acknowledges that market failures prevent Pareto optimality, it continues to advocate efficiency alone as the first best policy for society. Pope Francis has argued recently that the current economics of indifference to the common good is responsible for the enormous environmental damage to Earth (‘our common home’). He calls for an integral approach to consumption and production, one that takes the common good as the source and object of well-being. In that way consumption and production depend on the common good, and so too do associated time-discounted social satisfaction and surplus. This means that a socially desirable program is one that optimizes integral satisfaction and surplus, so that consumption and production functions are a system of endogenous (dynamical) simultaneous equations in which the utility of the integral person is a function of the social utility. I use insights from the economic models of resources (both exhaustible and renewable) to describe what the Pope means. The description is rather loose, but the implications of the exercise are wide and far-reaching. For example, I find that the socially efficient price is not Pareto efficient; it is one that allows for the marginal social utility, marginal social surplus, and marginal social royalty to the common good. In other words, under conventional welfare economics the marginal cost of generating the present value of the social surplus that eats up the present value of the rent to the common good guarantees the disutility of the integral person even as it meets the utility of the rational person. One policy implication of such a result recommends consideration of the common good as a key variable in both production and consumption. Precisely how that can be done is the direction in which future research must go. The question this result raises is about how to quantify the common good. For Pope Francis the level of analysis is integral subsidiarity, where the environment would be a good proxy for the common input to production and the common outputs are reduce poverty, inclusion (reduced inequality), and the protection of the common input.
B59|Capital after Capitalism The evolution of the concept of capital in the light of long-run sustainable reproduction of the species|The capitalist mode of production has fulfilled a most astonishing ‘historical mission’ for the human species. It enabled an explosion of labor productivity gains and the discovery of new utility dimensions. But this progress came at the price of accompanying explosion of contradictions, of unequal benefits and burdens across global and local classes of humans. This paper sets out to explore what will happen if capitalism is finally ending, if its mission collapses. To do so a workable definition of the essence of capitalism is needed, I propose this to be the ‘capitalist algorithm’ – for a detailed treatment see [Hanappi, 2013]. The most interesting question then concerns the social mechanisms that might overcome – revolutionize – what currently dominates the behavior of large production conglomerates as well as their military arms on a global level. Following the tradition of Hegel and Marx it can be assumed that a large part of the capitalist algorithm simply will have to vanish. But as history shows there also always is a remainder of a mode of production that in an inverted form (Hegel: negation, German Marxism: ‘Umstülpung’) becomes part of the next progressive mode of production. To identify what ‘Capital after Capitalism’ could be, what has to be abolished and what might survive in which form – remember the double meaning of Hegel’s concept ‘Aufhebung’ – is a central prerequisite for a proper understanding of the coming revolution of the current mode of production. Since each step on the ladder of global social evolution is also a step in social human consciousness, this step in understanding implies a direct impact in guiding the actions to accomplish this turnover.
B59|Concordian economics and the economic bubble|In Concordian economics, a bubble is defined as a separation of monetary values from values of real wealth. This separation is effected by the fundamental proposition of Concordian economics: Investment is income minus hoarding. This definition, in turn, allows us to identify a set of crucial relationships that exist in the economic process, namely more hoarding, less investment and less growth; more hoarding, more inflation; more hoarding, more poverty.
B59|Revize monetárního modelu Marca Lavoieho endogenizací parametru gama|Revision of Marc Lavoie’s Monetary Model by the Endogenization of the Parameter γ This paper tries to point out a fallacy in Lavoie’s (2006) conclusion that incorporation of deep endogeneity of parameters into the PKA model suffices to bring about irreversibility of such a system. The arguments of the authors are supported by Setterfield’s (1998a, 2008) concept of hysteresis as path-dependence in the long-run outcome of systems with direct shocks. The paper shows that extension of Lavoie’s PKA model by deep endogeneity of the parameter γ causes the fulfillment of the necessary condition of hysteresis - Setterfi eld’s condition (a) ensuring deep endogeneity of the alleged exogenous parameter and, by means of this, path dependence in the long-run output - but not the fulfi llment of the sufficient condition of hysteresis - condition (c) ensuring the presence of adjustment asymmetry and, by means of this, irreversibility. Thus, deependogenisation of the parameter γ does not bring about Setterfi eld’s hysteresis and, in effect, does not cause irreversibility.
B59|Optimality of Social Choice Systems: Complexity, Wisdom, and Wellbeing Centrality|Since circa 1900, civilization has experienced radical changes including changes in the size and distribution of populations, the power of technologies, the magnitude of energy and materials use, and the depth of scientific knowledge. With these have come increasingly complex challenges and elevated risks, and thus a heightened need for wise decision making. Accordingly, the need has grown for efficient and functional decision-making systems, also called social choice systems. I use these terms to refer to economic, governance, and legal systems. The seeming inability of societies, both individually and collectively, to effectively mitigate excessive climate change, poverty, income inequality, pollution, habitat loss, and other major problems suggests that underlying social choice systems are sub-optimal relative to need. I raise two overarching questions: (1) What characteristics would more optimal social choice systems exhibit? (2) How could research and development of more optimal systems best proceed? The answers I explore in this paper are based on the premise that the relative optimality of a social choice system is a measure of its relative capacity to help communities solve problems and organize activities such that collective wellbeing is elevated. The characteristics of complex adaptive systems, successful problem-solving systems found in nature, are explored in order to suggest useful design motifs and monitoring indicators. I emphasize the need for research and development of new social choice system designs, and argue that field testing of these can best occur at the local (e.g., community, city, or county) level. Efforts in this direction by the science and technology sectors and academic community are still nascent. The work described here suggests a new multidisciplinary program that I term wellbeing centrality: the design, testing, promotion, and operation of social choice systems that place wellbeing measurement, evaluation, forecasting, and deliberation at the center of decision-making activities.
B59|Coordination of Methodology and Subject in Economics: A Philosophical Approach for Islamic Economics|"In this paper, by examining the proportion of ""subject"" and ""method"" in the conventional economics, a path for theory building in the Islamic economics from a philosophical perspective has been shown. For this purpose, by showing the position of ""subject"" of every science, opinion of economists on the subject of economics is investigated. In this paper we show that the ""subject"" of economics is “action of rational economic man”. Thus, all issues, economic theories and schools should logically be based on. Then by showing the relationship between the conventional method of theory building – means of mathematical approach and the subject of conventional economics- Nature of the subject of economics, within the framework of Islamic philosophy has been re-reading. The basic result of this paper is that Islamic approach to economics in addition to the ""explanation"", has a normative and prescriptive recommendations as well; this approach, comes from an Islamic perspective in the realm of ""subject"" of the economics."
B59|The Origin of Scientific Theorization in Islamic Economics: An Institutional Perspective|"This paper primarily seeks to prove the actual logical relationship between institutions, E'tebariat and Islamic Sharia rules and social sciences. Secondly, it attempts to demonstrate the impact of economic institutions consistent with Sharia law on the formation of economic realities commensurate with the same institutions. Accordingly, the economist can think through economic realities emanating from economic institutions which are in conformity with the Islamic Sharia law. On this basis, he/she can explain independent variables and function of these economic realities in terms of scientific theories. In this paper starting with concepts, the definition of institution by North and Searle has been investigated. North defines institutions as ""humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic and social interactions"". Searle introduces the concept of 'institutional fact', defined as a fact whose existence presupposes the existence of certain systems of constitutive rules called 'institutions'. Next, the nature of E'tebariat (agreed perceptions) broached by Allameh Tabatabai, its similarity with Searle's conception of the institution and the relationship between E'tebariat and the Islamic Sharia law have been examined analytically and then explored the impact of the adoption of Islamic Sharia law on the establishment of institution. These underlying discussions ground the basis of evolution in social sciences -which as an accepted approach- being influenced by fixed and variable rules of Islamic Sharia; this is due to the fact that an –actual- logical relationship emerges between institutions, E'tebariat and Islamic Sharia law and the subject matter of social sciences being recognized as social facts."
B59|The Tragedy of the Anticommons in Knowledge|The anticommons in knowledge is distinct from the anticommons in physical objects. The former is always tragic, the latter not necessarily so. For society at large, the tragedy of the anticommons is more serious when it involves knowledge than when it involves physical resources. Buchanan and Yoonâ€™s (2000) formal model of the anticommons is incorrect even within the neoclassical context, and their neoliberal suggestion that single ownership is the socially optimal solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons is misleading. This article argues that the only, epistemically and socially beneficial solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons is to create, expand, and protect the knowledge commons. The article also constructs a simple formal model based on Bessen and Maskinâ€™s (2006) sequential model, as a metaphor for how the comedy of the knowledge commons works. The analysis supports the worldwide movement for free knowledge, and dissents from the evolving political and academic consensus in China in favor of more restrictive intellectual property regimes.
B59|Rethinking the Factors of Production for a World of Common Ownership and Sustainability|The classical economists bequeathed us an understanding of the nature of economies in terms of three factors of production: land, labor, and capital. If we are to transcend the unsustainable and inequitable economy we live with today, an intellectual reinterpretation of these three factors is a vital first step. In this paper we provide such a liberating reinterpretation with examples from European and Latin American praxis.
B59|Koreaâ€™s Post-1997 Restructuring|This paper aims to transcend current debates on Koreaâ€™s post-1997 restructuring, which rely on a dichotomy between domestic industrial capital and foreign financial capital, by adopting Nitzan and Bichlerâ€™s capital-as-power perspective. Based on this approach, the paper analyzes Koreaâ€™s recent political economic restructuring as the latest phase in the evolution of capitalist power and its transformative regimes of capital accumulation.
B59|Global Financial Crisis, its impact on stock markets' linkages and portfolio diversification opportunities|"This research investigates causal relationships and short-term interaction mechanisms among seven equity markets, including smaller post-communist Eastern-European countries and developed G7 markets, while paying special consideration to the effects of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. The analysis period runs from 01/10/2004 to 01/02/2015, while the credit-crunch crisis sub-period is considered to have started on 09/08/2007 when BNP Paribas terminated withdrawals from three hedge funds citing ""a complete evaporation of liquidity"" and to have ended on 01/06/2009, according to the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research. The study analyses whether the relationships among stock markets are time varying and whether the potential for diversifying risk by investing in different markets is limited/diminished during financial turmoil. Other points of interest consist in the leading role of the Russian market in the Eastern-European region before/during/after the crisis and in the impact of innovations from the US market in the Eastern-European area."
B59|The Elusive Quest for Happiness|This article summarizes key findings in the contemporary research field of happiness economics. Elaborated is the influence of macroeconomic factors like inflation, unemployment, and GDP, as well as the quality of governance on the overall reported life satisfaction. The concepts of conspicuous consumption and the relative income hypothesis are brought in connection with the notion of the ‘hedonic treadmill’ for the purpose of explaining the invariant happiness levels in the last decades despite of the remarkable increase in standard of living. The methodological framework is used to find an answer to the puzzling question of declining women’s reported happiness levels in developed economies
B59|Edmund Phelps on Productivity Slowdown: Limits to Utilitarian Economics|Abstract Nobel Laureate economist Edmund Phelps blames the increasing marginalisation of a large number of workers in unstimulating jobs on low wages as a contributory factor to productivity slowdown in the West. He blames utilitarian economics because it cannot accommodate the idea of social inclusion. In our view, the problem is best understood as a manifestation of the poverty of the theory of prices governing the allocation of resources.
B59|Modèles multi-agents et stock-flux cohérents : une convergence logique et nécessaire|Les modèles à base d'agents multiples sont des modèles informatiques macroscopiques peuplés d'un grand nombre de modèles individuels. Dans ces modèles, les relations entre grandeurs agrégées ne sont pas postulées : elles « émergent » du système complexe formé par les interactions des agents individuels qui les peuplent. C'est dans le champ de la macroéconomie, il y a plus de 50 ans, qu'ont été posées les bases de cette approche. Pourtant, ses méthodes restent encore un objet d'étonnement parmi les économistes, qu'ils soient orthodoxes ou non. Cette approche connait cependant depuis quelques années des succès croissants, surtout depuis le développement de modèles respectant la cohérence des stocks et des flux. Si le rapprochement entre une approche centrée sur les individus et une méthodologie issue d'une macro-économie post-keynésienne volontiers organiciste peut paraître inattendu, pour nous, il répond à des nécessités logiques et scientifiques. Nous défendons l'idée selon laquelle la combinaison de la cohérence des stocks et des flux et de la multiplicité des agents est une opération essentielle au renouveau de la modélisation macroéconomique.
B59|‘Why has economics turned out this way?’ A socio-economic note on the explanation of monism in economics|Economic science has – lamented by some, applauded by others – turned into a monistic discipline. In this short research note, a socio-economic answer to the question of why this has happened is provided by combining an economic approach to the market for economic ideas with a sociological approach to a scientific (power) field.
B59|Wie krank ist unser Wirtschaftssystem? Krisen als Krankheiten im ökonomischen Diskurs|"Dieser Beitrag zeigt auf Basis einer Diskurs- und Metaphernanalyse des öffentlichen Diskurses von ÖkonomInnen zur Finanzkrise, dass hier Krankheitsmetaphern eine zentrale Bedeutung zukommen. Die Metapher der Krankheit impliziert die Vorstellung eines gesunden Normalzustandes der Wirtschaft, der als erstrebenswert bzw. wiederherstellenswürdig erscheint. Die Suggestion, dass die Krise von außen verursacht (eine ""Infektion"") sei, ist eine spezifische Interpretation der Krise, die grundsätzlichen Zweifel am bestehenden (Finanz-)Kapitalismus kategorisch ausschließt. Krankheitsmetaphern können vielmehr als implizite politische Forderung interpretiert werden, wirksame Korrekturmaßnahmen zu suchen, um diese Störungen oder Infektionen rasch los zu werden bzw. heilen zu können, um dann schnell wieder zum ""Normalzustand"" funktionierender Marktmechanismen zurückkehren zu können."
B59|Idealizations of Uncertainty, and Lessons from Artificial Intelligence|At a time when economics is giving intense scrutiny to the likely impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the global economy, this paper suggests the two disciplines face a common problem when it comes to uncertainty. It is argued that, despite the enormous achievements of AI systems, it would be a serious mistake to suppose that such systems, unaided by human intervention, are as yet any nearer to providing robust solutions to the problems posed by Keynesian uncertainty. Under the radically uncertain conditions, human decision-making (for all its problems) has proved relatively robust, while decision making relying solely on deterministic rules or probabilistic models is bound to be brittle. AI remains dependent on techniques that are seldom seen in human decision-making, including assumptions of fully enumerable spaces of future possibilities, which are rigorously computed over, and extensively searched. Discussion of alternative models of human decision making under uncertainty follows, suggesting a future research agenda in this area of common interest to AI and economics.
B59|The Changing Face of Economics? Ethical Issues in Contemporary Economic Schools as a Consequence of Changes in the Concept of Human Nature|The last financial crisis combined with some recent social trends (like growing inequality or environmental problems) inspired many contemporary economists to the re-evaluation of actual economic knowledge in the search for solutions to these problems. Modern economic schools (especially heterodox ones) stress the meaning of ethical issues in economics more often. The thesis of the paper is that this revival of the ethical face of present economics depends very strongly on the changing assumptions of human nature within economics and other disciplines which work alongside economics, such as social psychology or business ethics, for instance. In order to prove the thesis, the paper provides an evaluation of current economic schools, especially within the heterodoxy, in search of their ethical aspects, and presents them as a result of the changing assumptions about human beings within those schools. This ethical dimension of human beings manifests itself in different ways, which can be perceived as a result of it being based on different ethical schools and different psychological and philosophical assumptions about human nature. Therefore, the paper also considers the current developments of the view on human beings in contemporary schools of economic ethics.
B59|Economics as a Discipline of Instrumental Reason. Looking at Economics as a Science from the Perspective of the Frankfurt School of Philosophy|The article is built around the analysis of The critique of instrumental reason by Horkheimer, applied to issues connected with the philosophy of economics. Positive economics is under-stood as an example of a discipline where the pragmatic paradigm has been implemented. Therefore, economics functions within the boundaries of what Horkheimer called instrumental rationality. The starting point is the intellectual source shared by economics and the Frankfurt School, namely Kant’s philosophy of rationality. In the first part of the article, three of Kant’s ideas that are fundamental to economics are presented, and then the development of their application in philosophy of science, as seen by Horkheimer in 1947, is laid out. The second part of the article consists of enumerating various distinctive features of economics that set it apart from other social sciences and which constitute factors for which it can be considered a realm of the reign of ‘instrumental rationality’, with all the threats such an approach provokes. The above-mentioned features concentrate on treating humans in economics as a means, not as a goal. This aspect of the philosophy of science of the Frankfurt School (unlike its critique of capitalism as an economic system) has not been widely received.
B59|Work, recognition and subjectivization: some remarks about the modernity of Kojève’s interpretation of Hegel|From the analytical point of view of Hegel's philosophical anthropology, in Kojève's interpretation, work is an existential structure through which the dual process of subjectification and socialization unfolds. For Hegel, however, this process is not taken for granted: its possibility is understood in terms of the culmination of man's conquest of humanity, taking as a point of departure the relation of mastery to servitude and the undertaking to transform this relation precisely from within the perspective of servitude. The goal of this article is to reconstruct the conceptual framework of this philosophical moment, to our mind an indispensible precondition for the apperception of our modern societies' functioning at the most fundamental level, to the extent that they consider themselves to be ‘work based societies.’
B59|Economics of paternalism: the hidden costs of self-commanding strategies|The paper proposes an economic assessment of paternalism by comparing different alternative responses to dynamically inconsistent behaviors consecutive to hyperbolic discounting. Two main types of action are possible, self-commanding strategies and paternalism The first category includes personal rules and pre-commitment The second can be subcategorized between coercive and non-coercive forms of paternalism, which are respectively associated (although it is debatable) with legal paternalism and with ‘nudges’. Despite being self-inflicted, self-commanding strategies are actually not cost free and can result in a dramatic cutback of people’s freedom of choice. Likewise, legal paternalism can, on occasion, be less harmful than personal rules or pre-commitment; similarly, nudges can be more invasive and less effective than their proponents want us to believe. The aim of this paper is not to propose any standardized form of response to irrational behavior (whatever that may mean) but to argue, on the contrary, that every case should be individually appraised. Individual situations can be remedied by self-commanding strategies or by paternalistic policies, either in isolation or in combination.
B59|Una aproximación al pensamiento económico-normativo de John Rawls|Rawls, desde muy joven, estuvo interesado por los principios normativos del pensamien­to económico moderno, y más específicamente su teoría del bienestar. Esta inquietud no sorprende. En primer lugar, a Rawls siempre le preocuparon la pobreza y la injusticia social, temas ampliamente discutidos en economía. Segundo, el pensamiento económico ha tenido un desarrollo muy cercano a la historia del utilitarismo, el gran oponente de Rawls. Este trabajo expone la apuesta económica de la teoría rawlsiana, la cual, a su vez, se muestra como una alternativa al pensamiento utilitario. Para ello, se hace hincapié en la insistente preocupación de Rawls por los menos aventajados, en la importancia que nuestro autor le da al mercado, y finalmente en su propuesta tributaria y salarial.
B59|Unraveling the veil of fuzziness: A thick description of sustainability economics|This article provides a thick description (Geertz, 1973) of sustainability economics. Baumgärtner and Quaas (2010a, b) have proposed as an alternative to ecological economics the new field of sustainability economics, which has triggered various replies. The purpose here is to order and to review these contributions. Building upon a literature review of sustainability economics, the paper argues that the concept currently has more of a fuzzy and declamatory character. The rhetoric (McCloskey, 1998) of sustainability economics contains general issues of sustainability economics, externalities and the capability approach. The article argues that it is currently not clear how the solutions for science and policy proposed by sustainability economics differ from those of ecological economics. Efforts should be directed towards further development of the theory and the operationalization of sustainability principles. The systemic view of co-evolutionary development, social learning and sustainability economics' normative underpinning merits more consideration in the debate about sustainability economics.
B59|Sustainable consumption in capability perspective: Operationalization and empirical illustration|The present research combines the capability approach (CA) with the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to investigate the effects of social norms and personal autonomy on sustainable consumption behavior. The approaches bear some similarities, but differ in that the CA attaches more importance to autonomy and highlights the indirect effects of social influence. In contrast to TPB, the CA suggests indirect norm effects (on behavior) by shaping attitudes and the perception of freedom of choice. Furthermore, the CA hints at the motivational power of personal autonomy for behavioral choices. We develop a combined model to test our assumptions for two sustainable consumption behaviors (i.e., purchase of organic food and mobility behavior). Testing the combined model based on cross-sectional data of the German socio-economic panel (GSOEP-IS) confirms the significance of the CA for sustainable consumption. The policy implications of the findings are enhancing people's opportunities for sustainable consumption in order to strengthen sustainable behavior.
B59|Another “French paradox”: explaining why interest rates to microenterprises did not increase with the change in French usury legislation|Conventional wisdom indicates that the growth of credit may not materialize if credit rates remain capped by usury laws, as had long been the case in France. France therefore abolished usury ceilings on loans to microenterprise in an effort to increase financing for microentrepreneurs. This should have led to an increase in interest rates and increase in microcredit. However, we do not find any increase in interest rates and this is therefore a paradox. The paper provides a brief literature review and the salient features of the legislative changes in France. It follows this up with a presentation of interest rate movements. The discussion of possible explanations of the paradox includes classical market analysis (global interest rates, money supply, and competition), behavioral and institutional analysis (guarantees, Basel II and risk taking, legal concept of abusive support, protection for over-indebtedness, information asymmetry and limited liability) and softer institutional reasons (religion, risk-taking culture).

B59|Right to the City or Urban Commoning? Thoughts on the Generative Transformation of Property Law|The economic and political transformations determined by the rise of neoliberalism are usually studied at a state dimension, while the urban one is quite ignored. Nevertheless, the government of the city has been influenced by global and national recent changes and all the municipal sectors have been touched by the austerity's recipe. The decrease of urban public spaces, their privatizations as well as gentrification transform city planning that is often unable to elaborate alternative solutions against the overexploitation of the urban territory and the increase of inequalities caused by economic crisis. In a city, after all, it is impossible to hide inequalities and injustices. In the last years, cities have often been the theater of political struggles against the privatization of public spaces, evictions and the dissolution of the urban welfare. In many cases, the demonstrators have occupied parks or abandoned buildings (theatre, condominiums...), and used them to find a temporary solution to their different needs (housing, social space, new forms of work, urban gardens...). They denounce the great number of public or private empty spaces (for instance, the abandoned infrastructures left by the process of de-industrialization) and their neglect. According to the right to the city they claim, the inhabitants have to produce urban spaces starting from their own needs: empty spaces become an opportunity, the urban care is a collective task. This approach shares the logic of the commons, which reclaims a new paradigm based on inclusion, participation and social and ecological use of resources: according to many scholars, also urban spaces are commons. After a description of this wide context, the article explores the connection between commons and the right to the city.
B59|Strategic and expressive voting|Critics of the expressive account of voting have argued that it is inconsistent with strategic voting. Since there is strong evidence that people vote strategically, this has been taken to show that many voters are at least partially instrumentally motivated. This paper argues that strategic voting in the relevant sense is consistent with entirely expressive political motivation. Building on an earlier suggestion by Geoffrey Brennan, I model voters as expressively valuing ideological position as well as the strategic pursuit of expressively-defined preferences. This model predicts strategic voting without instrumental preferences entering the voter’s calculus at all. I also suggest that expressive preferences for strategic behaviour can be usefully analysed in terms of dispositional choice. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
B59|What can ants tell us about collective behavior during a natural catastrophe?|The fire ant, Solenipsis invicta, has successfully invaded and colonized ecosystems worldwide. Like humans, fire ants build permanent domiciles to house family members, establish well-defined territories for foraging and fight to the death when invading neighbors breach the borders. One of the more striking behaviors of fire ants is their ability to form a living raft when springtime rains flood their domiciles. What are the survival benefits, if any, to collective behavior during a flood? To address this question, we quantified the survival of individuals as solitary swimmers compared to cooperative rafters. We found that large workers and matriarchs survived equally well as solitary swimmers or rafters. In contrast, small workers drowned whether they were solitary swimmers or rafters. However, when rafting with large workers or matriarchs, the mortality of small workers declined three-fold. We propose a behavior phenotype classification scheme to catalog the diverse behaviors observed in this series of experiments. Although the ultimate goal of rafting behavior by fire ant workers is to protect their matriarch, the proximate goal for the vast majority of fire ants is to save themselves first and to save others if the opportunity arises.

B59|Piaci alkalmazkodás ragadós árak mellett - Calvo-típusú ármerevség egy ágensalapú modellben<BR>[Market adjustment under sticky prices: the price rigidity of a Calvo type in an agent-based model]|A tanulmányban ármerevséget vezetünk be egy ágensalapú piaci modellbe a Calvo-féle megoldáshoz hasonló módon. Amellett érvelünk, hogy az árak merevségének DSGE modellekben leírt következményei (átváltás az ár és a termelés ingadozása között, illetve az átlagos értékek változatlansága az ármerevség függvényében) csak a modellek sajátos feltevéseiből következnek. Megmutatjuk, hogy egy ágensalapú modellben más hatások mutathatók ki: pozitív kapcsolat van az ár és a termelés ingadozása között az ármerevség függvényében, ami egy fordított U alakú összefüggés szerint hat a változók ingadozására. A rugalmasabb árak nagyobb átlagos kibocsátáshoz is vezetnek. A vállalatok ármerevségbeli heterogenitásának nincs hatása a változókra. Ha a vállalatok nagyobb súllyal veszik figyelembe a versenytársak árait az árdöntés során, akkor rugalmas árak mellett csökken, ragadós árak mellett nő az ár és a termelés ingadozása. A vállalatok közötti ismertségi hálózat sűrűségének növekedése rugalmas árak esetén csökkenti a változók ingadozását, ragadós árak mellett nem hat rájuk.

B59|Take it or leave it! Experimental evidence on rationality, social preferences and bargaining|The ultimatum game has improved our understanding about the bargaining power associated with a threat, an issue where information and communication are central. This paper presents a selective review of the literature on economic experiments in the ultimatum game, organizing the major developments of the theory by incorporating the empirical evidence in this context. The results of these experiments have shown that people deviate systematically from the theoretical prediction; in fact, it has been found that proposers make bids close to equitable distribution and responders often reject offers they deem unfair. Unquestionably, this game has gained a central place in behavioral economics, so the review herein will be useful for researchers working both in bargaining and experimental economics.
B59|Modelling economic hysteresis losses caused by sunk adjustment costs| Transition from one economic equilibrium to another as a consequence of shocks is often associated with sunk adjustment costs. Firm-specific sunk market entry investments (or sunk market exit costs) in case of a reaction to price shocks are an example. These adjustment costs lead to a dynamic supply pattern similar to hysteresis. In analogy to “hysteresis losses” in ferromagnetism, the authors explicitly model dynamic adjustment losses in the course of market entry and exit cycles. They start from the micro level of a single firm and use explicit aggregation tools from hysteresis theory in mathematics and physics to calculate dynamic losses. The authors show that strong market fluctuations generate disproportionately large hysteresis losses for producers. This could give a reason for the implementation of stabilizing measures and policies to prevent strong (price) variations or, alternatively, to reduce the sunk entry and exit costs.
B59|Sectoral FDI, Absorptive Capacity and Economic Growth — Empirical Evidence from Egyptian Governorates|Using a novel panel dataset of Egyptian governorates for the period 1992–2007, we investigate the effects of aggregate and sectoral foreign direct investment (FDI) on Egypt’s economic growth. We distinguish between FDI in the manufacturing, agriculture and service sector. The similarity of governorates in terms of institutional characteristics like culture, language, and legal framework and the consistency of the data collection process enables an effective estimation of the effect of FDI on Egypt’s economic growth. Employing General Methods of Moments (GMM) panel estimations, we find that neither aggregate nor sectoral FDI has an unconditional effect on economic growth. We also reject human capital as a channel of absorptive capacity, but reveal an interesting effect of FDI in the service sector on economic growth in interaction with domestic private investment (DPI). Service FDI promotes economic growth only if the host governorate has a minimum threshold of DPI to absorb foreign knowledge and technology.
B59|Epistemological Status of Models and Thought Experiments in Economics|The paper considers the analogy of theoretical modeling and thought ­experiment in economics. The authors provide historical and epistemological analysis of thought experiments and their relations to the material experiments in natural science. They conclude that thought experiments as instruments are used both in physics and in economics, but in radically different ways. In the natural science, a thought experiment is tightly connected to the material experimentation, while in economics it is used in isolation. Material experiments serve as a means to demonstrate the reality, while thought experiments cannot be a full-fledged instrument of studying the reality. Rather, they constitute the instrument of structuring the field of inquiry.
B59|Hyman Minsky's financial instability hypothesis and the Greek debt crisis|This article attempts to analyze the current debt crisis in Greece based on the financial instability hypothesis developed by Hyman Minsky. This article shows that the hypothesis provides an understanding of how an economy endogenously becomes “financially fragile” and thus prone to crises. The authors analyze how public and private sector behavior in the Greek economy led to the country's debt crisis. In particular, based on a sample of 36 Greek companies, the authors show that between 2001 and 2014, the majority of those companies had switched to fragile financial structures. Special attention is devoted to the negative consequences of applying the neoclassical doctrine of “austerity measures” in Greece as the principal “anti-crisis” concept of mainstream economic science.
B59|Hyman Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis and Greece Debt Crisis|The paper analyzes Greece debt crisis by means of the Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis, which makes it possible to investigate the country’s endogenous transformation into the financially fragile position. Therefore, we can understand how the economy becomes vulnerable to crises. Using this hypothesis, it has been demonstrated how behavior of both public and private sectors of the Greek economy had generated the debt crisis. In particular, the authors use the sample including 36 Greek companies for the 2001—2014 period and show that the rising share of these firms moved to fragile financial structures. The paper also pays special attention to negative effects of austerity policies in Greece. The austerity doctrine is treated as the leading anti-recessionary mainstream conception.
B59|Essentials of Constructive Heterodoxy: The Market|The consensus is that orthodox economics is a failure in three dimensions: conceptual, methodological, and empirical. Heterodoxy has meticulously sorted out the multitude of errors, mistakes, and distortions. Yet, this alone does not help out of stagnation. Economists have now to go into constructive mode. The most urgent task is to replace the misleading supply-demandequilibrium representation of the market. The reconstruction of the centerpiece of the market system from scratch paves the way to the new paradigm. Nobody can talk about the market system without a correct idea of how the market works. Heterodox economists must take the innovative lead.
B59|Essentials of Constructive Heterodoxy: Say’s Law|The core problem of economics is that the representative economist never managed to keep political and theoretical economics properly apart. The mixture is toxic indeed. As Joan Robinson said about what parades as economics: Scrap the lot and start again. Yet, the question then arises where to start. To solve the Starting Problem - first formulated by J. S. Mill - is the all-dominant initial step of a paradigm shift. The most urgent task of a constructive Heterodoxy is to rethink pivotal concepts like market, Say's Law, profit, etcetera. The reconstruction of the theoretical superstructure from scratch is an absolute methodological necessity.
B59|Essentials of Constructive Heterodoxy: Aggregate Demand|Heterodoxy has left not one stone unturned and has unraveled a plethora of errors/mistakes/contradictions of Orthodoxy. The outcome of this prolonged critical and self-critical process is that there is actually no acceptable and accepted theoretical economics. The need of a paradigm shift is irrefutable. There is less need of further debunking exercises. For Constructive Heterodoxy follows that the subjective axiomatic foundation of Orthodoxy has to be replaced. All economic conceptions have to be consistently reconstructed. What comes to mind first are phenomena like market, profit, money, employment or aggregate demand. The latter is dealt with in the following.
B59|Essentials of Constructive Heterodoxy: Money, Credit, Interest|The goal of theoretical economics is to explain how the monetary economy works. The fatal methodological defect of Orthodoxy is that it is based on behavioral axioms. Yet, no specific behavioral assumption whatever can serve as a starting point for economic analysis. From this follows for Constructive Heterodoxy that the subjective axiomatic foundations have to be replaced. This amounts to a paradigm shift. Nobody can rest content with a pluralism of false theories. Based on a set of objective axioms all economic conceptions have to be reconstructed from scratch. In the following this is done for the theory of money.
B59|Essentials of Constructive Heterodoxy: Profit|The goal of theoretical economics is to explain how the actual economy works. Since Adam Smith economists have consistently failed to clarify the nature and magnitude of overall profit. No economist, though, would deny that profit is an important phenomenon. Yet, obviously economists are still mired in utter confusion about the most fundamental concept of their discipline. Hence, in the strict sense, there is no valid economics. From all this follows for a methodologically ambitious Constructive Heterodoxy that the accustomed foundations of Orthodoxy have to be replaced. In technical terms this is what a paradigm shift is all about.
B59|Essentials of Constructive Heterodoxy: Employment|Orthodox economics is founded on behavioral assumptions. This has been the wrong starting point because no way leads from there to an understanding of how the economic system works. Critical Heterodoxy is one step ahead insofar as it does not accept the green cheese assumptionism of optimization and supply-demand-equilibrium, yet this is not sufficient to establish a superior paradigm. What we have at the moment is a plurality of debunked theories. This is not a tenable situation. Consequently, Constructive Heterodoxy is focused on the formally consistent reconstruction of central economic phenomena like market, money, profit, and - in this paper - employment.
B59|Essentials of Constructive Heterodoxy: Institutions|What do economists understand about the economy if they do not understand the profit phenomenon? Next to nothing. Therefore, the very first task in theoretical economics is to clarify the difference between profit and wage income and their respective determinants. It was Ricardo who tackled the problem first, but neither Orthodoxy nor Heterodoxy solved it until this day. The need for a paradigm shift is indisputable. The new structural axiomatic approach is more comprehensive as it embraces the consistent interaction of real and nominal variables of the monetary economy and the economic consequences of alternative variants of institutions.
B59|Essentials of Constructive Heterodoxy: Behavior|For a host of compelling methodological reasons, homo oeconomicus has to be replaced. This is consensus, the open question is how this could be accomplished. What is required first is the separation of the formal foundations into a structural and a behavioral part. This paper introduces the propensity function as general formalization of Economic Man/Woman. The propensity function is a compact formal expression of random, semi-random, and deterministic behavioral assumptions. It is shown how, in a random environment, target-oriented behavior produces stochastic stability and optimality in the product market. With homo oeconomicus the conception of simultaneous equilibrium, too, vanishes.
B59|Essentials of Constructive Heterodoxy: Financial Markets|What stands before all eyes as failed Orthodoxy is ultimately caused by the wrong answer to Mill's Starting Problem. It is now pretty obvious that one cannot put utility maximization, equilibrium, well-behaved production functions, ergodicity or any other physical or psychological or sociological or behavioral assumption into the premises. No way leads from such premises to the explanation of how the actual market economy works. The logical consequence is to discard them. Having first secured a superior formal starting point, the present paper addresses the question of how the various types of financial markets emerge from the elementary monetary circuit.
B59|Major Defects of the Market Economy|When we characterize an argument that has no sound theoretical foundation as political, then what has been produced by economists so far is political economics. However, since the Classics and Marx all major economic schools have defended the claim that they were doing science. This claim has been convincingly rebutted. So, the task is still before us. The way forward is to move from behavioral to structural economics. In what we should be mostly interested are not so much the behavioral defects of economic agents but the structural defects of the market system and how to repair them.
B59|Disputed (Disciplinary) Boundaries: Philosophy, Economics and Value Judgments|This paper aims to address the following two questions: a) what is the logic of the kind of discourse that seeks to found, demarcate or defend the autonomy or the boundaries of a discipline; b) why does this discourse, whether methodological, ontological or epistemological, sometimes turn into normative, dogmatic-excommunicating wrangles among disciplines, schools or scholars? I will argue that an adequate answer may be found if we understand: 1) disciplines as institutions and, therefore, as dogmatic systems, where scholars’ discourse often takes the form of a legitimizing discourse regarding the founding Reference of their own discipline; 2) that scholars speak in the name of that very foundation, with which they closely identify; 3) that the issue of the legitimacy of a discipline cannot easily be separated from the issue of identity and, therefore, of a scholar’s legitimacy; 4) that the excommunication may arise not only when the founding Reference is absolutized, but also as a form of selfdefense of a scholar’s identity-legitimacy. To understand these claims I will re-examine three paradigmatic positions: the methodological, ontological and epistemological considerations put forward by (and the debates between) Pareto, Croce and Einaudi – with specific reference to the demarcation between philosophy, economics and value-judgments.
B59|Half-Forgotten Personalities of Economic Thought - Silvio Gesell|Silvio Gesell was a German tradesman, self-educated economist, globetrotter and social reformer with a nonconformist worldview. He is known for his proposals for monetary reform. He is famous for his experiments with interest-free currency. Gesell’s thought inspired a plenty of political and civil movements, and has a few followers even to this day.
B59|German Human Resource Management professionals under tensions: A Bourdieusian approach|In line with the current discussion on Human Resource Management (HRM) professionals, we claim that HRM professionals are confronted with a critical challenge: they have to master the tensions between HRM as a profession on the one hand and the needs of maintaining power within their organization on the other. In this paper we explore whether HRM professionals perceive tensions stemming from changes in their professional role, their organizational roles and their position, where these tensions come from, and which strategies are used to cope with them in their daily practice. We build our theoretical frame on Bourdieu’s Theory of Practice and conceptualize HRM professionals as actively contesting both their own as well as their groups’ interests without losing sight of structural influences. Moreover, this theoretical framing allows us to assume that professional positions in organizations are inherently based on contradictions and tensions and so highlights these facets of HRM professional practice as well as focusing attention on coping strategies. Our empirical study is based on 21 interviews with German HRM professionals from large enterprises. The results show three main sources of tensions HRM professionals perceive within their organizations. These tensions stem from what we refer to as their various “sandwich” positions, from scarce resources, and from conflicts with line management. Our results show that these tensions are handled by HRM professionals as they dispose of suitable habitus aspects and professional capital. We identify four strategies that HRM professionals deploy when dealing with the tensions: the strategic consultant strategy, the active HRM service provider strategy, the HRM controller strategy and the qualification strategy. All of these strategies enable HRM professionals to maintain or even broaden the power position of HRM within their organization.
B59|The Genesis of Islamic Economics Revisited By Abdul Azim Islahi|"The present paper is an attempt to correct Timur Kuran on various issues related to the genesis of Islamic economics. It demonstrates that ""Islamic economics"" is not a product of twentieth century. The term may be new but its origins go back to early period of Islam. Its evolution up to the present state of a distinguished discipline can be divided into six distinct phases. The paper argues that the modern Islamic economics was never a sectarian subject. Nor was it developed for Muslims' identity and protection purpose. Scholars of different regions and of diverse affiliations promoted it and its propounders aimed at the well-being of all."
B59|Instability of Interest Bearing Debt Finance and the Islamic Finance Alternative By Mughees Shaukat & Datuk Othman Alhabshi|Evidence has been mounting that the interest-based debt financing regime is under increasing distress. Evidence also suggests that the financial crises, whatever title they carried - exchange rate crisis or banking crisis – have been debt related crises in essence. At present, data suggest that the debt-toGDP ratio of the richest members of the G-20 is expected to reach 120% mark by 2014. There is also evidence that out of securities worth US$ 200 trillion in the global economy, no less than three-fourth represent interestbased debt. It is difficult to see how this massive debt volume can be validated by the underlying productive capacity of the global economy. This picture becomes more alarming considering the anemic state of global economic growth. There is great uncertainty with regard to interest rates. Although policy-driven interest rates are near-zero level, there is no assurance that they will not rise as the risk and inflation premia become significant. Hence, a more serious financial crisis may be in the offing and a general collapse of asset prices may occur. This paper argues that the survival of the interest-based debt regime is becoming less tenable, as is the process of financialization that has accompanied the growth of global finance over the last four decades. The above has resulted in an unprecedented increase in economic risks; generating (adverse) non-linearities in system’s behavior. Such a behavior is nothing but a demonstration of the verse, “Allah obliterates ribā ….” of the Qur’ān. As a result, the search is on for a paradigm shift towards a less volatile and more resilient financing regime. The paper proposes and advocates risk sharing based Islamic financing as a suitable alternative and further supports the claims by demonstrating empirically the better growth and stability characteristics of risk sharing based financing, using advanced dynamic heterogeneous panel techniques.
B59|Mapeando o pós-keynesianismo: Uma abordagem cienciométrica|O presente artigo tem por objetivo estudar a corrente pós-keynesiana na economia para delinear suas características. A metodologia usada para atingir este objetivo combina concepções filosóficas e linguísticas, com técnicas computacionais e cienciométricas. Primeiro, tal metodologia parte do conceito de finitismo de significados (meaning finitism) para compreender o que significa uma expressão do ponto de vista da sua construção social. A ideia de finitismo consiste em expandir o significado de um termo para permitir que ele seja formado por uma infinidade de conceitos, e não por uma a definição unívoca. Tal ideia é baseada na filosofia da linguagem de Ludwig Wittgenstein. Segundo, o contexto social em que o significado da expressão “Post Keynesian” surge tem que ser escolhido. Neste artigo, o contexto relevante é a comunidade acadêmica dos economistas, representada pelas revistas em que esses pesquisadores publicam seus artigos. Assim, o significado da expressão “Post Keynesian” é estudado a partir de uma base de dados formada por milhares de artigos acadêmicos. Terceiro, o modo especifico de estudar a expressão “Post Keynesian” neste contexto é através um programa computacional para construir um mapa de Co-word. Este mapa representa a co-ocorrência de palavras relevantes que co-ocorrem com a expressão em foco como distâncias em um espaço bidimensional. Quarto, a literatura pós-keynesiana é utilizada para estabelecer conexões entre as palavras que aparecem no mapa, dando origem a um quadro de significados e características da corrente pós-keynesiana. Em paralelo com esta metodologia, o presente artigo apresenta, ainda, um gráfico que mostra as ocorrências da expressão “Post Keynesian” nas revistas de economia, cotejando tal gráfico com a literatura histórica da corrente.
B59|Augusto Graziani: Theoretician, Applied Economist, Historian of Economic Thought—An Appraisal|Augusto Graziani, one of the leading Italian economists in his generation, brought to economics the gifts of an analytically-oriented mind, crystal-clear logical reasoning, flawless erudition, and a passionate interest in the political and policy implications of both theoretical models and empirical analysis. After a presentation of Graziani’s life and career, this article investigates the links connecting his theoretical evolution from general equilibrium analysis to circuit theory, his interpretation of the development of the Italian economy, and his approach to the history of economics. While recognising change in his analytical framework, I argue in favour of a basic continuity in his thought around the central themes of capital accumulation and the origins of its ownership and control.

B59|Happiness Economics, Eudaimonia and Positive Psychology: From Happiness Economics to Flourishing Economics|A remarkable current development, happiness economics focuses on the relevance of people’s happiness in economic analyses. As this theory has been criticised for relying on an incomplete notion of happiness, this paper intends to support it with richer philosophical and psychological foundations. Specifically, it suggests that happiness economics should be based on Aristotle’s philosophical eudaimonia concept and on a modified version of ‘positive psychology’ that stresses human beings’ relational nature. First, this analysis describes happiness economics and its shortcomings. Next, it introduces Aristotle’s eudaimonia and takes a look at positive psychology with this lens, elaborating on the need to develop a new approach that goes beyond the economics of happiness: the economics of flourishing. Finally, the paper specifies some possible socio-economic objectives of a eudaimonic economics of happiness. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015
B59|İktisat-Fizik İlişkisine Tarihsel Bakış|Değişen ve giderek karmaşık hale gelen dünyada yüzyıllar içerisinde bilimin köklü değişimlere uğradığını söylemek mümkündür. Özellikle fizikteki gelişim ve yeniliklerin tüm bilimleri etkilediği ve yeni dönemler açtığı iddia edilebilir. Đktisat bilimi fiziğin yüksek derecede etki yarattığı bilim dallarının başında gelmektedir. Klasik iktisadın deterministtik dünya görüşünün hakim olduğu Newton fiziği üzerine inşa edildiği söylenebilir. Yirminci yüzyılda fizikteki determinist dünya görüşünün terk edilip, fiziğin köklü değişimlere uğraması, iktisat bilimi üzerinde de önemli değişimlere neden olmuştur. Yaşanılan karmaşık dünyada geleneksel iktisat kuramlarının belirli olguları anlamada yetersiz kalması ve istatistiksel fizik tekniklerinin doğrusal olmayan dinamiklerle bir araya gelerek bu karmaşık yapıyı açıklamadaki gücü, özellikle 1990’ların başında fizikçilerin, son yıllarda ise iktisatçıların ilgisini çekmiştir. Bu doğrultuda yapılan çalışmalar daha önceleri sadece fizik dergilerinde, son zamanlarda ise iktisat dergilerinde de yer buluyor olması bunun en önemli göstergesidir. Bu çalışmanın amacı iktisadın doğuşu ile başlayan iktisat – fizik ilişkisini incelemek ve fizik biliminin geçirdiği evrimin iktisat bilimini ne derecede etkileyerek değiştirdiğini göstermektir.
B59|The Impact of the Human Nature Concepts on the Goal of Humanistic Economics and Religious Motivated Streams of Economics (Buddhist, Islam and Christian)|The shape of economics depends on the concept of human nature. Those concepts can be understood as a set of assumptions made about the individual (especially his/her behavior, motives, meaning), his/her social world, and the worldview. Such a concept of human nature builds the basis of thinking about the economics and about its fundamental elements. The goal of the paper is to present the impact of the assumptions about the concept of a man on one of such fundaments - the goal of economics, on the example of humanistic economics. Humanistic economics is here understood widely, including approaches to economics developed within particular world religions as especially: Buddhist, Islam and Christian. The method applied to this research is, among others, a content analysis of the most important texts created within widely understood humanistic economics and directions of economics motivated by world religions.
B59|Geld und Sprache: Der innere Widerstreit in der Modernisierung|"Geld und Sprache sind das ""Band der menschlichen Gesellschaft"" (Cicero). Im vorliegenden Text wird die menschliche Sprache als soziale Form, als Prozess der Vergesellschaftung rekonstruiert und das damit verbundene Denken daraus entwickelt als Logos. Das Geld stellt logisch und historisch ein Novum innerhalb dieser Vergesellschaftung dar, das zu einer sich immer weiter einlagernden berechnenden Vernunftform (Ratio) führt. Diese wachsende Dominanz der Ratio über den Logos charakterisiert den Prozess der Modernisierung und erlaubt zugleich ihren inneren Gegensatz aufzudecken. Es zeichnet sich schließlich in der völligen Verdinglichung der Ratio in der Künstlichen Intelligenz eine neue Weise der Vergesellschaftung ab, worin die Herrschaft des Geldes in neuer Form reproduziert wird."
B59|Idealizations of uncertainty, and lessons from artificial intelligence|Making decisions under uncertainty is at the core of human decision-making, particularly economic decision-making. In economics, a distinction is often made between quantifiable uncertainty (risk) and un-quantifiable uncertainty (Knight, Uncertainty and Profit, 1921). However, this distinction is often ignored by, in effect, the quantification of unquantifiable uncertainty, through the assumption of subjective probabilities in the mind of the human decision makers (Savage, The Foundations of Statistics, 1954). This idea is also reflected in developments in artificial intelligence (AI). However, there are serious reasons to doubt this assumption, which are relevant to both AI and economics. Some of the reasons for doubt relate directly to problems that AI has faced historically, that remain unsolved, but little regarded. AI can proceed on a prescriptive agenda, making engineered systems that aid humans in decision-making, despite the fact that these problems may mean that the models involved have serious departures from real human decision-making, particularly under uncertainty. However, in descriptive uses of AI and similar ideas (like the modelling of decision- making agents in economics), it is important to have a clear understanding of what has been learned from AI about these issues. This paper will look at AI history in this light, to illustrate what can be expected from models of human decision-making under uncertainty that proceed from these assumptions. Alternative models of uncertainty are discussed, along with their implications for examining in vivo human decision-making uncertainty in economics.
B59|The macroeconomics of radical uncertainty|Macroeconomics must take radical uncertainty into account, if it aims at contributing to the solution of serious real-world problems such as climate change. Allowing for radical uncertainty must happen at two levels: the level of modeling and the level of the scientifi c discipline. I argue that the complexity approach which sees the economy as a complex adaptive system is better suited to deal with radical uncertainty than the mainstream DSGE approach. I review a number of agent-based models that are promising starting points to incorporate radical uncertainty into macroeconomics. Discussing the examples of the fi nancial crisis and climate change, I establish why methodological monism is dangerous and why macroeconomics needs more pluralism and openness towards other scientifi c approaches. Radical uncertainty and the complexity approach have important implications for macroeconomic policy and the advice that economists can give to policy makers. Under radical uncertainty it does not make sense to look for optimal policies.
B59|A Way To Determine Chaotic Behaviour In Romanian Stock Market|"It is difficult to distinguish between multiple random shocks and endogenous informational inflow in nonlinear systems which show complex dynamics. For this reason, we run the chaos tests to investigate the presence of chaotic phenomena using: nonlinearity tests, Recurrence Plot (RP) and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). In this paper, we compute the Hurst Exponent using R/S analysis on Romanian capital market for a time span between 2005 - 2014 daily data. Substantial changes of Hurst Exponent behaviour in the current period compared to the previous one may be seen as structural break points in the series. The goal of this paper is to determine time series chaotic behaviour in order to highlight the efficiency levels of CEE markets. Also, we aim to investigate the changes in drifting dynamical systems, to examine the recurring patterns – the most important features of complex systems and to admire the ""simple beauty of the complexity""."
B59|Behavioural controversy concerning homo economicus: a Humean perspective|In his monumental masterpiece, A Treatise on Human Nature, which explains the methodology of human reasoning concerning matters of fact and describes the roles that passions and morals play in it, Hume arrives at an enormously interesting maxim: An academic controversy cannot continue for long unless the disputants assign different meanings to the major terms employed in the debate. This theory has been applied in this paper to examine the behavioural criticisms about Homo Economicus (HE), the pivotal perception in the neoclassical microeconomic model.To achieve this objective, the paper discusses the origin and evolution of the concept, reviews behavioural criticisms, summarises the main tenets of Hume’s philosophy of human knowledge and finally examines the behavioural opinions from Hume’s perspective. The paper concludes that Hume’s theory convincingly explains the reason why the HE controversy is continuing for over half century- a fact that both the mainstream and behavioural economists are ignoring.
B59|Shifting economics: fundamental questions and Amartya K. Sen’s pragmatic humanism|Amartya K. Sen’s body of work is an unrelenting project that consistently and coherently re-focuses the attention of economists and economics towards foundational questions. His capabilities framework has offered an expanded space of evaluation to directly judge the well-being of people and society. Through a detailed survey of Sen’s intellectual development, his readdressing fundamental rigidities in economic methodology, and his new framework for evaluation, this paper argues that Sen has inculcated new habits of mind, and engendered a social momentum in economic thought that takes human complexity and the richness of societal diversity into account. Creating a social momentum in economic thought through refocused habits of mind can have a sustainable impact in economics only if its scope is not sub-discipline specific, if it provides an inclusive framework, and if it builds bridges within and outside the discipline chiefly between economics and moral philosophy. Sen’s approach is pragmatic, courteous, and persuasive, but not divisive. It is expansive, yet contextual; it is humanistic. In Sen, economics is an inquiry into the nature and causes of human development.
B59|El dilema de la contribución voluntaria a bienes públicos: una revisión de trabajos experimentales|"El artículo presenta una revisión de los experimentos realizados sobre bienes públicos apoyados en el mecanismo de contribución voluntaria. La evidencia empírica existente muestra que los individuos no son solo los seres egoístas y competitivos que supone la teoría económica ortodoxa, sino que también son seres bondadosos y altruistas. Aunque los diversos trabajos experimentales concuerdan en la existencia de estos sentimientos catalogados como “bondad”, no es claro si los sujetos actúan así para mejorar el bienestar de los demás (altruismo) o porque se sienten bien realizando este tipo acciones (satisfacción moral). ***** The article presents a review of experiments on public goods based on voluntary contribution mechanism. The empirical evidence shows that individuals are not only selfish and competitive beings as stated in orthodox economic theory, but are also kind and altruistic beings. Although several experimental studies agree on the existence of these feelings listed as ""kindness"", it is not yet clear whether subjects act this way to improve the welfare of others (altruism) or because they feel good doing these actions (warm-glow)."
B59|¡Tómelo o déjelo! Evidencia experimental sobre racionalidad, preferencias sociales y negociación|RESUMEN: El juego del ultimátum ha permitido entender mejor el poder de negociación asociado a una amenaza, tema en el cual la información y la comunicación son centrales. Este artículo presenta una revisión selectiva de la literatura sobre experimentos económicos en el juego del ultimátum, organizando los principales avances de la teoría al incorporar la evidencia empírica en este contexto. Los resultados de estos experimentos han mostrado que las personas se desvían sistemáticamente de la predicción teórica; de hecho, se encontró que los proponentes hacen ofertas cercanas a la repartición equitativa y los receptores suelen rechazar las ofertas que consideran injustas. Indiscutiblemente, este juego se ha ganado un espacio central en la economía del comportamiento, por lo que la revisión aquí realizada será de gran utilidad para los investigadores que estén trabajando tanto en negociación como en economía experimental.
B59|Prolegómenos al vivir bien-buen vivir: una evaluación normativa y práctica|Resumen Este trabajo examina el concepto de vivir bien-buen vivir ponderando sus contribuciones y limitaciones. Esta cosmovisión tiene un horizonte normativo más ambicioso que el paradigma del desarrollo, pues apuesta por una concepción de la pobreza y la riqueza que no se reduce a la acumulación de bienes materiales, una economía que comprende sus efectos sobre la naturaleza y se centra en la satisfacción de necesidades, y una descolonización de los saberes. No obstante, se caracteriza por un déficit de operacionalización que se manifiesta en la dificultad para definir políticas concretas e indicadores de medición precisos.******This article examines the concept of live well-good living, by analyzing its contributions and limitations. This worldview has a normative horizon more ambitious than the development paradigm, as it wagers for a poverty and wealth conception that is not limited to the accumulation of material goods, but it is an economy aware of its effects on nature and the satisfaction of needs and the decolonizing of knowledge. Nevertheless, it is characterized by an operationalization deficit that is shown through the difficulty to establish specific policies and accurate indicators of measurement.
B59|Housing Provision, Finance, and Well-Being in Europe|This paper explores the role of housing in households’ increasing financial activities. First, I build on quantitative work on the growth of housing related debt across Europe carried out under WP5 by presenting data on rates of homeownership, levels and types of mortgage debt, and house prices (and, by implication, housing wealth). I find that, although there is a general tendency for all to increase, differences in the structures of housing provision across countries lead to significant variation in both the data, and what can be drawn from it, across countries. Second, I consider accounts of households’ growing financial activities that attribute a central role to housing, including Lapavitsas and Dos Santos’s ‘financial expropriation’ thesis, and a growing body of literature that sees Europe as moving towards a housing asset-based welfare model. I argue that both, in different ways, are insufficiently attentive to the way in which housing provision, the role of finance within it, and the relationship of both to the reproduction of labour power more generally, are all uniquely and distinctly structured in different countries. I also show that even in the UK, where the role of finance in housing and welfare provision is thought to be most advanced, the restructuring of housing and welfare in favour of finance remains limited and contradictory. Finally, I outline some preliminary findings on the impact that a growing tendency to treat one’s home as an asset has had on well-being.
B59|Reply to the Caplan and Gochenour critique of Georgism|This paper refutes the proposition by Caplan and Gochenour that there is no such thing as natural resources because all goods are produced. Caplan and Gochenour use that proposition to argue against the reform proposal of Henry George and his followers, to replace all taxes with a single tax on land value. The rebuttal to Caplan and Gochenour made by this paper is that the discovery of a resource does not constitute its production. The refutation here argues that entrepreneurship and investment create human capital and capital goods, not natural resources. Discovery is not the same as invention or production.

B59|Sociostructural Aspects of Socio-Economic Development: The Role of Economic Approach|The author discusses the importance of studying socio-structural factors of socio-economic development through a broader application of the economic approach. The resources of status positions of economic agents are in the spotlight. A possible platform for interdisciplinary interactions is proposed which allows to increase the contribution of both economics and sociology in improving governance at all levels.
B59|Logistics Management In The Contemporary Economy|The evolution of logistics management as a system in the recent decades can be characterized by the influence of the globalization processes and the economic integration in the European Union.

B59|Central BanksÕ Transparency: Words as Signals|Evidence of the evolution of ideas on central bank transparency can be found in the central bankersÕ speeches during the period 1997-2012. Exploratory analysis of the central bankersÕ speeches provides an overview of their use of language: speeches define the historical evolution of central banksÕ discourses, and thus suggest how the concept of transparency has evolved. The paper invites reconsideration of the role of central banksÕ transparency through analysis of central bankersÕ speeches and their use of language as a part of their communication framework. While literature on transparency indexes shows increasing central bank transparency, the semantic area of transparency in central bankersÕ speeches changed over the period 1997-2012. The paper investigates this evolution until recent shift towards new semantic areas pertaining more to the financial and real economy than to traditional inflation concerns.
B59|Wealth as an Indicator of Socio-Economic Welfare: Islamic Views|According to western views, wealth is unambiguously good, and so human welfare is positive when wealth is in excess of needs, and negative if it is less. Islam has a substantially more sophisticated view of the relation between wealth and welfare. Excess wealth is a trial, which can bring great rewards if utilized correctly, and also bring great harm if utilized incorrectly. Similarly, poverty is a trail which can bring great rewards if borne with patience and prayer, and also cause great harm if it leads to begging from others. Thus there is no clear and simple relationship between wealth and welfare. This means that Islamic approaches to constructing an index for welfare must be substantially more complicated than those currently in use in the west. It is worth considering the reasons for undertaking the project of measurement and assessing what needs to be measured, and whether measurement itself is necessary, for achieving these goals?
B59|Mathematical Proof of the Breakdown of Capitalism|The existence proof of general equilibrium, which is based on subjective-behavioral axioms, is replaced by the existence proof of a final turning point, which is based on objective-structural axioms. The final turning point is characterized by an irreversible switch from profits to losses for the business sector as a whole and marks the beginning of the breakdown of the monetary economy. This has nothing to do with any market failures or irrationalities. The final turning point can be preceded by an arbitrary number of temporary profit/loss reversals and is in full accordance with the households’ optimal intertemporal consumption plans.
B59|Pareto-Efficiency, Hayek’s Marvel, and the Invisible Executor|This non-technical contribution to the RWER-Blog deals with the interrelations of market clearing, efficient information processing through the price system, and distribution. The point of entry is a transparent example of Pareto-efficiency taken from the popular book How Markets Fail.
B59|Loanable Funds vs. Endogenous Money: Krugman is Wrong, Keen is Right|In a recent article, Keen resumes the debate with Krugman about the effects of debt upon the economy. It is hard to see how the question can be settled as long as all participants apply their idiosyncratic models. Hence the issue boils down, as Krugman rightly put it, to the deeper question: “how should one do economics.” Sketched with a broad brush, the consensus is that Orthodoxy has failed and that Heterodoxy has no convincing alternative to offer. The conceptual consequence of the present paper is to restart from a firm common formal ground. This relocation makes the debate solvable.
B59|Exchange in the Monetary Economy|It is clear by now that pure exchange models are useless. For two reasons. First, because exchange is the other side of specialization in production, and, second, because a direct exchange of goods does not take place in the monetary economy. The decisive drawback of conventional exchange models, though, is that they cannot explain profit. Standard economics rests on behavioral assumptions that are expressed as axioms. The ultimate reason for the failure of conventional exchange theory is that human behavior and axiomatization are disjunct. Notable progress can be made by replacing the subjective-behavioral axioms by objective-structural axioms.
B59|Mr. Keynes, Prof. Krugman, IS-LM, and the End of Economics as We Know It|Krugman has recently revitalized IS-LM with a number of succinct analytical pieces on his blog. The reverberations were remarkable. Economists, however, are known often not grasp the full content of their own and, a fortiori, of others’ models. This happened to Keynes in the days of high theory and to Krugman in these days. Keynes applied a defect formalism, which is here replaced by objective-structural axioms. This yields the correct relationship between retained profit, saving, and investment which in turn makes it clear after the event that the IS-part of the IS-LM construct never could bear any substantive theoretical load.
B59|The Logic of Value and the Value of Logic|Jevons composed his value theory of nonenties. These creatures are elusive. Subsequent formal refinements did not eliminate the fundamental flaw but made it only harder to detect. A vacuous formal structure is one that cannot be interpreted in some domain. For want of any correspondence in the monetary economy, Jevons’s approach could not produce viable results. Roughly speaking, Jevons made value dependent on subjective factors. This paper gives a rigorous formal proof that value is determined by objective conditions. Within the structural-axiomatic framework there is no formal spare room for the major behavioral nonentities utility, optimization, rational expectations, and equilibrium.
B59|The Truly General Theory of Employment: How Keynes Could Have Succeeded|There is not much use to attack standard economics because deep in his heart the representative economist long knows that he is tied to a degenerating research program. The problem is, rather, that it seems to be exceedingly difficult to build up a convincing alternative. Keynes, for one, tried and was successful – albeit not fully. Unfortunately, he got some basics wrong. The conceptual consequence of the present paper is to discard the accustomed subjective-behavioral axioms and to take objective-structural axioms as the formal point of departure for the analysis of employment as the main practical issue of economics.
B59|Profit for Marxists|Marxian economics and standard economics are widely different yet they share a central weakness: the respective profit theories are demonstrably false – each one in its own characteristic way. Roughly speaking, Marx tried to explain profit by objective factors while standard economics cites subjective factors. For different reasons, neither route led to satisfactory results. The conclusion is straightforward: one has to do better. The conceptual consequence is to first reconstruct the profit theory from a solid basis with no regard to either Marxian or standard premises. In order to succeed, objective-structural axioms have to be taken as formal point of departure.
B59|Objective Principles of Economics|Economists have the habit of solving the wrong problems. They speculate circumstantially about the behavior of agents and do not come to grips with the behavior of the monetary economy. This is the consequence of the methodological imperative that all explanations must run in terms of the actions and reactions of individuals. The critical point is that no way leads from the understanding of the interaction of the individuals to the understanding of the working of the economy as a whole. The solution consists in moving from subjective-behavioral axioms to objective-structural axioms, i.e. from past to future.
B59|Towards Full Employment Through Applied Algebra and Counter-Intuitive Behavior|It is common knowledge that neither Walrasians nor Keynesians nor Marxians nor Institutionialists nor Austrians nor Sraffaians came to grips with profit. The reason is a defective formal basis. In the present paper the formal foundations are first renewed. When the profit theory is false the rest of an approach is questionable. What is reexamined next because of its vital practical implications is the theory of employment. One remarkable result is that the popular recipe to eliminate unemployment, viz. downward wage rate flexibility, is self-defeating because it does not take the objective systemic properties of the monetary economy into account.
B59|The Law of Supply and Demand: Here It Is Finally|There is no such thing as a law of human or social behavior. The conceptual consequence of the present paper is therefore to discard the subjectivebehavioral axioms and to take objective-structural axioms as new formal foundations. The central piece of economic theory is the interaction of demand and supply which determines prices and quantities. Demand and supply in turn are determined by subjective factors. In the structural axiomatic paradigm the Law of Supply and Demand follows from objective factors alone. The Law consists of measurable variables and is testable in principle. The results prove the superiority of the new paradigm.
B59|The Three Fatal Mistakes of Yesterday Economics: Profit, I=S, Employment|Axiomatization is the prime task of theoretical economics. Without correct axioms,no correct theory. Without correct theory, no understanding of how the economy works. Without empirically corroborated understanding, no useful economic policy advice. Yet, much more important than any political reputation of economics is indeed: without correct axioms, no acceptance as science. There is no way around it, neither for Orthodoxy nor for Heterodoxy. The conceptual consequence of this paper is to discard the subjective-behavioral axioms and to take objective-structural axioms as the formal point of departure. This enables the rectification of the most fatal analytical mistakes of conventional economics.
B59|The Synthesis of Economic Law, Evolution, and History|It has long been criticized that history is almost entirely absent from orthodox economics. This deficiency is due to the fact that equilibrium and time make an odd couple. Because equilibrium is one of the crucial hard-core propositions of the research program it cannot be abandoned. This impedes the treatment of time in a methodologically acceptable manner. The orthodox approach is based on indefensible axioms which are in this paper replaced by objective structural axioms. This enables the synthesis of timeless economic laws, randomness, and goal-oriented human action, which are the essential elements of a formally consistent historical account.
B59|The Profit Theory is False Since Adam Smith. What About the True Distribution Theory?|All popular schools lack a consistent profit theory. Economists have no true conception of the most important phenomenon in their universe. This methodological defect persists since Adam Smith. Therefore, the theories of income and wealth distribution are wrong by logical implication. If the conclusions of a theory do not find any counterpart in reality the fault lies in the premises. In order to rectify distribution theory it is necessary to substitute the conventional subjective-behavioral axioms by objective-structural axioms. A major result of the present paper is that distribution is not governed by marginal productivity but by the distributed profit ratio.
B59|Economics for Economists|The characteristic capability of science – to turn whatever it might touch into knowledge – seems to have eluded economics. Currently, economists do not understand how the economy works. To get out of the cul-de-sac requires a paradigm shift. It consists in replacing behavioral axioms by structural axioms. The subject matter of theoretical economics is not human behavior but systemic behavior. From the structural analysis follows a new Law of Supply and Demand and a new Profit Law for the economy as a whole. The conventional supply-demand-equilibrium approach is refuted. This implies that the reliance on the spontaneous order metaphor is unfounded.
B59|Onblog Economics Muddle Busting|The representative economist does not understand the two most important phenomena in the economic universe: profit and income. Because of this economists have nothing to offer in the way of a scientifically founded advice. Therefore, the contributions to economic blogs cannot claim to offer more than personal opinion. Of opinions, though, economics always had plenty. What is needed is knowledge – scientific knowledge, that is. With the outline of the correct economic paradigm at hand it is straightforward to refute obsolete approaches. For this purpose the economics blogs are ideal. A selection of recent comments is reproduced in the present paper.
B59|Смещение Неоклассической Экономической Парадигмы ‒ Предпосылка Повышения Качества Макроэкономического Образования<BR>[Removal of the neoclassical economic paradigm – condition for the improving of macroeconomic education]|Russian. В работе расматривается необходимость смещения современной господствующей неоклассической экономической теории. Показывается, что она с предпосылками равного качества и значения всех деятельности, и всемогущества саморегулирующего рынка, не имеет возможности и сил объяснить факторы экономического развития, появления и расширения бедности. Причём, это относится как к одной отдельно взятой стране, так и к международным обстоятельствам. В качестве новой парадигмы, которая должна заменить неоклассическую, выдвигается Другой канон, обосновывающийся на многовековой традиции и биологических метафорах. Он происходит из эпохи Возрождения, был подтверждён многовековым опытом современных развитых экономик, через применение политик которые в современном мире запрещают применять неразвитым странам, пока они сами их применяют. В отличие от неоклассических политик, воплощённых в (нео)либеральной политике Вашингтонского консенсуса, приводящих к дезиндустриализации, политики Другого канона, обоснованные на политиках образца плана Маршалла, приводят наоборот к индустриализации как предпосылке выхода неразвитых стран из кризиса и бедности. Смещение неоклассической экономической парадигмы появляется в этом смысле как предпосылка повышения качества макроэкономического образования и должна обеспечить лучшее понимание экономических проблем и процессов. English. The article considers a need for displacement of the contemporary neoclassical economic theory. This theory and its presumptions of equal quality and importance of all the economic branches, as well as the power of the self-regulating market, have proven unable to explain the economic development factors, nor the appearance of poverty and its growth. This has been demonstrated in cases of individual countries, as well in the international context. The Other Canon, based on many centuries’ tradition and biological metaphors, represents a new paradigm, which is suggested as a substitute for the neoclassical one. It dates back to the Renaissance period, and it has proved successful in many centuries’ experiences of the contemporary developed countries. In the contemporary world, the developed countries forbid the underdeveloped one from using these policies, at the same time applying them themselves. The neoclassical policies embodied within the Washington Consensus neoliberal policies lead to deindustrialization. On the contrary, the Other Canons policies, based on the policies such as Marshall Plan, lead to industrialization, which is the main requisite for the underdeveloped countries to find a way out of crisis and poverty. The dismissal of the neoclassical economic paradigm appears to be the condition for an improvement of macroeconomic education and is ought to secure a better understanding of economic problems and processes.
B59|Economic Direct Democracy: A Framework to End Poverty and Maximize Well-Being|In Economic Direct Democracy: A Framework to End Poverty and Maximize Well-Being, John Boik proposes an innovative social framework that enables communities to strengthen local economies, and take meaningful action on infrastructure, debt, income inequality, health care, climate change, and environmental degradation. He challenges us to examine the basic purpose of an economic system, and to consider that human nature drives individuals toward deeper cooperation. Boik's proposal integrates multiple local movement, participatory democracy, and open society initiatives into a single framework that helps organize and enhance existing city, county, and regional economies. By infusing a local economy with 21st century direct democracy, the system empowers local areas to take the lead in making real change. The hopeful message is that we can increase incomes, end poverty, reach full employment, and address major social and environmental problems, in our lifetime.

See README.rst file in package for details."
B59|First Microsimulation Model of a LEDDA Community Currency-Dollar Economy|Results are presented for a first-in-class microsimulation model of a community currency (local currency) system. The agent-based, stock-flow consistent model uses US Census income data as a starting point to project the evolution of community currency and dollar flows within a simplified county-level economy over a period of 28 years. Changes in the distribution of family income are tracked. The community currency system under investigation is the Token Exchange System (TES), a component of the larger Local Economic Direct Democracy Association (LEDDA) framework under development by the Principled Societies Project. The model captures key design features of a TES, and results suggest parameter ranges under which the simulated TES is capable of achieving stated aims. Median and mean take-home family incomes more than double during the simulation period, income inequality is nearly eliminated, and the unemployment rate drops to a 1 percent structural level. The need for more sophisticated modeling of a TES, and avenues for future research, are discussed.

B59|Historia ambiental de las comunidades indígenas de Bosawás, Nicaragua: un análisis metabólico|The areas of the planet that are most biologically diverse tend to overlap extensively with indigenous peoples’ lands. This has led to considerable in­terest in indigenous subsistence practices and their potential as buffer zones against the advance of the agricultural frontier, as is the case in the Biosphere Reserve of Bosawás (Nicaragua). In recent decades it has attracted a large group of researchers and conservation agencies, interested in the environmental impact of the subsistence practices of Mayangna and Miskitu Indians. However, few studies have addressed the historical perspective of natural resource management. Applying the theoretical framework proposed by social metabolism theory, this article suggests a dia­chronic characterization of the multiple land-use patterns of indigenous peoples in the Bosawás Reserve. A detailed literature review and a collection of oral histories of these communities reveal how a multiple use logic has been preserved from pre-colonial times as the substrate on which the communities have actively incorporated innovations from foreign cultures.
B59|Identitarian passions: the overwhelming power of the human recognition need|According to Plato, thymòs—a notion denoting the human need for recognition—triggers off the most powerful and overwhelming human passions. Indeed, any action originated and nurtured by thymòtic passions places its own raison d’être in itself. The acts motivated by thymòs can either improve or (even) worsen someone’s wellness: they do not entail any pay-off in the present or future, and their nature is not influenced nor mitigated by monetary incentives. Moreover, it follows that since identity is based on the others’ recognition (both individuals and social groups), then indulging with thymòtic passions and building up someone’s own identity are exactly the same process. Indeed, thymòtic passions are identitarian passions. This paper argues the relevance of the thymòtic approach. We do propose a conceptual framework that we reckon is useful and innovative in order to study and interpret these peculiar forms of human action. We also point out the social and “environmental” conditions that stimulate their appearance. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
B59|Does Constitutionalizing Economic and Social Rights Promote their Fulfillment?|This paper explores whether constitutional provisions promote fulfillment of economic and social rights. This is accomplished by combining unique data on both enforceable law and directive principles with the Social and Economic Rights Fulfillment Index (SERF Index), which measures government fulfillment of such rights. The results indicate that there is a positive and significant correlation between enforceable law provisions and the right to health and education components of the SERF Index. The strongest relationship appears to be for the right to health component where the inclusion of an enforceable law provision on economic and social rights in the constitution is correlated with an increase in the health component by 9.55, or 13.0%, on average. These results support the idea that constitutional provisions may be one way to improve economic and social rights outcomes.
B59|Phänomenologie des Geldes|"Phänomenologie ist eine philosophische Methode – eigentlich: Nicht-Methode –, in der man den Blick vom untersuchten Gegenstand (hier das Geld) umkehrt auf die Denkformen, in denen er gedacht wird. Der Kerngedanke einer Phänomenologie des Geldes lautet: Geld ist eine Denkform und nur darin eine soziale Wirklichkeit. Man versteht ""Geld"" nur durch Teilnahme an einer Geldökonomie. Das sind allerdings Erfahrungen, über die in der Moderne jeder verfügt. Man kann das Geld als kategoriales Novum nicht aus einer Form von Nicht-Geld ""ableiten"".

Unter anderem wird konstatiert, dass in den Lehrbüchern kein aufgeklärtes und (selbst)reflektierendes Bildungsverständnis sichtbar ist, welches die Voraussetzungen des eignen Denkens bewusst vermitteln könnte. Im Anschluss daran werden die Grundzüge einer derartigen Alternative diskutiert und die Frage aufgeworfen, was Multiperspektivität und eine kritische Reflexion der eigenen geschichtlichen Wurzeln in der Lehre bedeuten kann.
B59|The Fund-Flow Approach: A Critical Survey|"The fund-flow approach to production theory was first proposed by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen almost half a century ago. Since then, from time to time it has received attention, but, probably because of its analytical complexity and difficulty to deliver sound ""operational conclusions"", it is now almost abandoned. The approach has been also recently criticized for its instrumental assumption of constant efficiency of funds, by emphasizing its limitations in addressing issues related to fixed capital depreciation. The paper critically surveys Georgescu-Roegen's original model, together with the later developments and modifications. It also discusses the recent criticisms. The conclusion is that, despite its drawbacks, the fund-flow approach has a ""competitive advantage"" in the actual description of production as a process unfolding in time and entailing a temporal coordination between different elements. In this respect, it seems that most of its fruitful applications have yet to come.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
B59|La cuestión metodológica en Albert Hirschman|Resumen: Albert Hirschman fue un economista poco convencional. Su metodología de investigación y exposición se distancia abismalmente de la utilizada por la corriente principal en la ciencia económica. El artículo hace una aproximación a la cuestión metodológica en Hirschman. Aunque no se encuentra un tratado escrito por el autor para discutir el tema, sus trabajos son claros ejemplos de como abordar metodológicamente los objetos sociales de estudio: esta se sintetiza en partir de la realidad para diagnosticar problemas y proponer soluciones, utilizando la teoría económica y buscando en otras disciplinas la forma de complementar los análisis y recomendaciones. Además su método de exposición se caracteriza por dirigirse a todo público de manera clara y simple.
B59|Measuring Well-Being: W3 Indicators to Complement GDP|"Plenty of people in Germany, including politicians and researchers, believe that gross domestic product (GDP) is an outdated indicator of a society's prosperity. Therefore, at the end of 2010, the German Bundestag, the federal parliament, established a study commission (Enquete Kommission) tasked with developing an alternative to GDP for measuring growth, wealth, and quality of life. This commission has now submitted a proposal: to complement GDP with nine additional indicators, covering a wide range of areas such as the distribution of income, biodiversity, and life expectancy. Replacing gross domestic product with a single alternative index was rejected by the commission, however, since it is not possible to reduce citizens' very different wishes and expectations to ""a common denominator."" The ten indicators cover three dimensions of wellbeing - economy, ecology, and social wealth - and hence are called W3 indicators.2 This name, which emphasizes the equal importance of the three dimensions, is concise and memorable enough to position itself alongside GDP. A representative survey of registered voters conducted by DIW Berlin and TNS Infratest shows that citizens generally consider all the new indicators proposed by the commission to be important. Respondents ranked preserving ""democracy and freedom"" as the most relevant indicator and ""further increasing life expectancy"" as the least relevant. Average per capita income - as an indicator of gross domestic product - is rated as the second least relevant factor. Moreover, the study also shows that opinions on the importance of different indicators vary considerably across socio-economic groups."

Und zwar um neun weitere Indikatoren, die so unterschiedliche Aspekte wie die Einkommensverteilung, Artenvielfalt und Lebenserwartung umfassen. Eine einzige zum Bruttoinlandsprodukt alternative Maßzahl wird von der Kommission hingegen abgelehnt, da sie die unterschiedlichsten Wünsche und Vorstellungen der Bürgerinnen und Bürger nicht ""auf einen Nenner"" bringen könnte. Dass die Bürgerinnen und Bürger die von der Kommission vorgeschlagenen Indikatoren als wichtig ansehen, zeigt eine repräsentative Befragung der Wahlberechtigten durch das DIW Berlin und TNS Infratest. An der Spitze der Relevanz steht nach Ansicht der Befragten der Erhalt von ""Demokratie und Freiheit"", am Ende eine ""weitere Steigerung der Lebenserwartung"".

B59|The shallow or the deep ecological economics movement?|Ecological economics and its policy recommendations have become overwhelmed by economic valuation, shadow pricing, sustainability measures, and squeezing Nature into the commodity boxes of goods, services and capital in order to make it part of mainstream economic, financial and banking discourses. There are deeper concerns which touch upon the understanding of humanity in its various social, psychological, political and ethical facets. The relationship with Nature proposed by the ecological economics movement has the potential to be far reaching. However, this is not the picture portrayed by surveying the amassed body of articles from this journal or by many of those claiming affiliation. A shallow movement, allied to a business as usual politics and economy, has become dominant and imposes its preoccupation with mainstream economic concepts and values. If, instead, ecological economists choose a path deep into the world of interdisciplinary endeavour they will need to be prepared to transform themselves and society. The implications go far beyond the pragmatic use of magic numbers to convince politicians and the public that ecology still has something relevant to say in the 21st century.
B59|Operationalizing the capability approach to assessing well-being|We consider the conditions under which a singular concentration on objective measures of well-being embodied in the capability approach formulation provide unambiguous guidelines to policymakers who seek to reduce discrepancies between potential and realized outcomes. A consensus benefit of the capability approach is its open-endedness regarding what constitutes the evaluative space and thus its adaptability to particular settings. We present the customary formal statement of the approach and a kindred version involving parental care for a child. We show that to unambiguously explain and to predict what happens in the child's evaluative space, whether this space be potential opportunities, realized achievements, or both, the capability approach requires careful attention to the curvatures of those functions as well as variable interactions central to it.
B59|A heterodox structural Keynesian: honouring Augusto Graziani|Translated from the Italian by Antoine Godin. The article gives an appraisal of Augusto Graziani's thought as a heterodox structural Keynesian. Graziani has always challenged the basic assumptions of orthodox theory by rejecting the initial definition of the economic and social world as being populated by identical individuals, where consumers are sovereign, technology is exogenous and money is neutral. Since the 1970s, Graziani's efforts have aimed at rebuilding on solid foundations the line of inquiry that sees capitalism as a â€˜monetary economy of productionâ€™. Authors such as Schumpeter and Keynes, and before them Wicksell and Marx, were all key influences on Graziani's work. This theoretical attitude shaped Graziani's studies on the Italian economy within the European and the global landscapes. We are confronted here with an idea of state intervention where demand policies are not separated from supply-side policies, and are indeed embodied in a structural design to redefine the composition of production with great attention to the quality of labour. He reminds us that economic theory has to put at the heart of its discourse not the â€˜imperfectionsâ€™ of the market, but rather the â€˜normalityâ€™ of power and conflict, not only between labour and capital, but also between fractions of capital, and between capitalisms.
B59|Capabilities and Human Dilemmas: How to Cope with Incompleteness|The main objective of this paper is to discuss the role of evaluative incompleteness in the work of Amartya Sen. In section 2, we consider Sen’s distinction between optimising or perfect choices and maximising or acceptable choices, showing it is based on a restrictive interpretation of incompleteness. In section 3, we argue that this distinction does not take into account a third crucial category of human choices, the dilemmas, and we show they are based on the concept of incompleteness in a strict sense. Section 4 discusses the reason why in Sen’s theoretical approach dilemmas and incompleteness appear to be somehow neglected. Then, in section 5 we advance an attempt to analyse human choices – both in the form of dilemmas or not – in conditions of incompleteness, while in section 6 we suggest a definition of freedom able to embrace also these dilemmatic choices. Finally, section 7 concludes.

B59|Social Movements as Constituent Power: The Italian Struggle for the Commons|The Italian commons ('beni comuni') movement is a powerful example of the way in which social movements are emerging as the new 'pouvoir constituant' serving not only to enforce the protections and guarantees of national constitutions but also, in the context of the declining power of the nation-state, as a counter hegemonic force against the neoliberal economic constitutionalism of the international economic institutions. The common goods social movement in Italy was born out of the concerted action of a number of civil society groups combating neoliberal privatizations. This commons movement, as will be argued in this paper, is an instance of one of the many struggles taking place throughout the world; from the Bolivian Andes to the Indian Himalayas, where local people are pushing out the state and predatory multinationals, and resisting the collusion of state and market actors to enclose common spaces and resources. These individual struggles for the commons are emerging as a transnational social movement challenging the top-down economic constitutionalism of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and in the context of Europe what has been dubbed the 'troika' of the European Central Bank, the European Commission, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Part I argues that social movements are giving new life and meaning to the concept of popular sovereignty by challenging the assumptions underpinning the liberal constitutional form, namely of private property, and providing a much needed channel for political confrontation where parliamentary politics has failed to protect the public from predatory private actors. Part II offers a participant observation exploring the national constituent role played by the 'beni comuni' social movement in upholding the protections and guarantees of the Italian Constitution. Finally, Part III attempts to describe the global commons movement as engaged in a form of bottom-up constitutionalism an emerging form of 'pouvoir constituant' in a supranational constituent process of reclaiming commons from predatory multinational actors through bottom-up societal constitutionalism.
B59|Rotating the Necker cube: A bioeconomic approach to cooperation and the causal role of synergy in evolution|The paradox of widespread cooperation in an intensely competitive natural world has been a major focus of theory and research in evolutionary biology and related disciplines over the past several decades. While much of the earlier work in this vein was gene-centered and grounded in inclusive fitness (or kin selection) theory, more recent developments suggest that it might also be useful to view cooperation (and biological complexity) from a bioeconomic perspective. Here I will briefly explore the case for a paradigm shift, with special reference to the role of functional synergy as a distinct class of interdependent causal influences in evolution. I will argue that synergies of various kinds have been important drivers for cooperation in living systems at all levels. From this perspective, inclusive fitness and other factors may be enablers for cooperation, but the many exceptions show that genetic relatedness is neither necessary nor sufficient for the emergence of cooperative phenomena.

B59|Stock-flow Consistent Modeling through the Ages|The aim of the paper is to provide an overview of the current stock-flow consistent (SFC) literature. Indeed, we feel the SFC approach has recently led to a blossoming literature, requiring a new summary after the work of Dos Santos (2006) and, above all, after the publication of the main reference work on the methodology, Godley and Lavoie's Stock-flow Consistent Approach (2007). The paper is developed along the following lines. First, a brief historical analysis investigates the roots of this class of models that can be traced as far back as 1949 and the work of Copeland. Second, the competing points of view regarding some of its main controversial aspects are underlined and used to classify the different methodological approaches followed in using these models. Namely, we discuss (1) how the models are solved, (2) the treatment of time and its implication, and (3) the need-or not-of microfoundations. These results are then used in the third section of the paper to develop a bifocal perspective, which allows us to divide the literature reviewed according to both its subject and the methodology. We explore various topics such as financialization, exchange rate modeling, policy implication, the need for a common framework within the post-Keynesian literature, and the empirical use of SFC models. Finally, the conclusions present some hypotheses (and wishes) over the possible lines of development of the stock-flow consistent models.
B59|Historical Aspects and Current Reflections of Global Economic Crisis|This study analyzed the causes and mechanisms of functioning of the global economic crisis of the system that existed in the past centuries and was based on the financing of scientific and technical progress through lending at interest and to the constant expansion of capital. In the study applies fundamentally different approach that relations between developed and developing countries should be seen as an interaction between economic systems with varying degrees of technological division of labor. Is analyzed the role of the monetary system as an exogenous factor with regard to the real economy, who ensuring the normally flowing of the interaction between systems with different levels of technological division of labor. Are examined the historical aspects of the development of the global economic system that underlie the global economic crisis. It made fundamental conclusion that the limiting factor, who has reached his end, is the inability to further increase the productivity of labor, which until now was growing due to the increasing levels of technological division of labor. The last has reached such limiting levels, relating to an uncontrollable increased ambiguity, in the temporal and spatial aspects, after which follows technological regress. Are offered, for an initial discussion, potential methods for managing the national economy that would mitigate the impact of the crisis and would ensure more stable flowing of the social and political processes.
B59|Foundations of the economic and social history of the United States: Apologia|This set of three volumes argues that the mind – human consciousness – may be measured by considering mathematically the aggregate of that consciousness, i.e. social history.

How does this measurement affect our present understanding of the reality in which we live? Each of these three volumes attempts to provide answers to one of these questions.

We begin with a philosophic model of trade (pp. 34-46); aggregate this model over the course of year to state the real Gross National Product of the United States and its relationship to the rate of employment (pp. 47-62); aggregate this model over the course of many years to find the growth of the United States stated as a natural “14-year octave” within real GNP data (pp. 63-91); multiply this octave times two to find the 28-year natural rate of price fluctuation (pp. 92-112); and multiply this octave times four to find the 56-year natural rate of political change (p. 92-112). The final model (pp. 113-136) is the larger “fractal” of the model of trade which begins these essays, in essence demonstrating that the United States “trades” values over a period of time in much the same way the individual citizen trades goods and services for money on a personal basis.
B59|Foundations of the economic and social history of the United States: Metaphysical|"""Oppositional Analysis"" - the name I give to the metaphysics presented in this volume - proposes a number of dichotomies through which one may analyze and understand systematically the structure of every level of reality. Macroeconomic theory, as well as social research, are two excellent stages upon which we may search for clues and insights to the interaction of oppositions. This is so particularly in connection with an analysis of the precepts of the ""Austrian School"" of macroeconomics as presented by Ludwig von Mises in his well-known and highly influential book Human Action. Based upon the circuit given for a musical note (see the Apologia and the Introduction to Volume 2, as well as the more extensive treatment herein) and the ""Circuit of Being"" which will be introduced in this final volume, I propose a model of economics which may correlate with a view of the physical universe of five dimensions as suggested by Theodor Kaluza. I suggest that these dichotomies may underlie the unity created by Kaluza’s work between General Relativity and Maxwell’s equations for electro-magnetism. If this is so, Oppositional Analysis and the economic and social history of the United States may provide a starting point from which we may learn important insights as to the inner workings of these economic and social oppositions as well oppositions of a more physical nature."
B59|Does “Okun’s Law” state a Pi:1 ratio? Toward a harmonic interpretation of why Okun’s Law works|In Albers & Albers (Spring, 2013) we demonstrated that the historic development of U.S. real GNP, 1869-present, may be structured in recurring 14-year periods. A steady-state rate of growth of 3.4969% is thereby calculated, generating an increase in real GNP proportional to the famous “Golden Mean” (1:phi or 1:1.6180) every fourteen years on average. Building on this foundation we show herein that “Okun’s Law,” a 3:1 proportion between percent growth in real GNP and percent decrease in the rate of unemployment, is actually a pi:1 proportion, created through a form of mathematic / harmonic inverse. The resulting model of economics in the United States is thereby aligned with geometric, harmonic and trigonometric analysis, rather than purely statistical methods.
B59|The sources of profits and their sustainability: A survey of basic theoretical issues|The volume of profits in an economy is a magnitude, which is out of sight of orthodox macroeconomics textbooks and effectively ignored by neoclassical economics. In contrast, Kalecki's approach brings to the forefront the sources of profits and makes possible their further analysis. The sources of profits are examined one by one and their impacts, as well as the inter-relations among them are studied in some detail. The sustainability of the profits' sources tends to have inevitable limits, which are discussed and elucidated. On the basis of these limits, two phases in the operation of the sources may be distinguished. The beneficial phase is transformed into a pathological one, as the limits are approached. Consequently, profits may be distinguished according to the source from which they flow, as well as the phase in which they arise. Taking into account both source and phase, a terminology is proposed to highlight the distinctive character of the different kinds of profits.
B59|Okun’s Law as a Pi-to-1 ratio: A harmonic / trigonometric theory as to why Okun’s Law works|“Okun’s Law” states a 3:1 proportion between percent growth in U. S. real GNP and percent decrease in the rate of unemployment. This paper argues that this ratio is actually a Pi:1 proportion, heretofore unrecognized because it is displayed through a form of mathematic / harmonic inverse. In Part One the Cartesian coordinate system is merged with the legal doctrines of actus reus (x-axis, actions) and mens rea (y-axis, thoughts). A unit circle of personal choice – including economic choice (trading vs. keeping) – may thereby be devised. This unit circle is then aggregated into a torus, half the circumference of which represents U.S. real GNP (Pi), the antipodal half-circumference its monetary value (Pi) and the radius the rate of employment necessary to its production (R = 1). Mainstream econometric analysis appears to support this theory of inverses with proximities of within 1.3%, 1.0%, 0.35%, 0.00105% and less than half a degree. In Part Two this model of Okun’s Law is connected closely to an analysis of the well-known Kondratiev Wave, a 56-year “Long Wave” of evolving social and economic relationships. This approach to macroeconomics is thereby aligned with a geometric, harmonic and trigonometric analysis of empirical data, rather than purely statistical methods.
B59|Understanding Profit and the Markets: The Canonical Model|Neither Walrasians nor Keynesians have a clear idea of the fundamental economic concepts income and profit, nor of the interdependence of qualitatively different markets. Critique of these approaches is necessary but not overly productive. A real breakthrough requires a new set of premises because no way leads from the accustomed behavioral assumptions to the understanding of how the economy works. More precisely, the hitherto accepted behavioral axioms have to be replaced by structural axioms. Starting from new formal foundations, this paper gives a comprehensive and consistent account of the objective interrelations of the monetary economy’s elementary building blocks.
B59|Rational Agency and Moral Practice: An Exploration of Dual Constraints|A number of actions performed by a large number of persons are often characterized by apathy, impulsivity and goal-neglect in contemporary times. While being fully capable of exercising the theoretical reasoning consistent with their desires and beliefs, an increasing number of persons generally fail to take into account the necessity of practical reasoning focused on valuing the other-regarding responsibility, duty and obligation. They are endowed with the faculty of theoretical rationality and yet they have no regard for the necessity of deliberation about and valuation of future consequences of an action. In such a case, the apathetic and goal-neglecting impulsive persons fail to properly execute actions. What is at stake is that apathetic disposition and impulsive intentionality constrains the working of the relation of emotion, reason and thought towards purposeful action and moral doing. It needs to be acknowledged that agential autonomy of human nature and voluntary nature of human actions as these are mediated through practical reason have an intimate relation with the health of human brain and the richness of information it is endowed with. What is nowadays increasingly observed as human actions driven by socially pervasive undesirable whims and reprehensible impulses may often be simply the result of malfunction of cognitive control of brain over internal information and asymmetry in coupling of external information with brain. A human agent suffering from apathy, impulsivity and goal-neglect may not be successful in bringing the cognitive reason and perceptual information to leave a stamp on his/her moral practices in day to day life. Such a situation may allow for manifold standards of moral practices in the real world. Such a multiplicity in the practices of morality is tragically not always accounted in theories of ethics. It must however be accounted. Classical postulates on the concept of a rational agency and the rationalist claim regarding universality of the practical reason needs to account for the general observations of at least two pervasive real-life constraints on moral practices since these dual constraints produce exceptions in standard moral practices. One is grounded in observations of pervasive apathy, and another derives from the phenomena of impulsivity and goal-neglect on part of a large number of people. Whereas apathy may often be caused by malfunction of cognitive control function of the pre-frontal cortex and corti-costriatal circuitry of the human brain, goal neglect may largely be the result of asymmetry in coupling and transferring of perceptual data and external information to human brain. In case of lesions of and damages to the pre-frontal cortex of brain, malfunctioning of the cognitive control functions begins and, inter alia, the human agents begin suffering from apathy. In case of irregularity in the functioning of corti-costriatal brain circuitry, the processing of reward-related (internal and external) informational resources is hampered and, inter alia, the human agents witness losing control over the process of regulation of impulsive decisions and actions. Both situations are symptomatic of the ‘psychic akinesia’ (also called ‘athymormia’) - auto-activation deficit.
B59|Redemption and Depression|According to prevailing methodological criteria, standard economics is definitively refuted. Joan Robinson’s wake-up call “Scrap the lot and start again” has therefore lost nothing of its original freshness and urgency. Yet, how can the restart succeed? This inquiry builds on structural axioms. First, conceptual consistency is assured and the confusion about profit and income is dissolved. The question of interest is then how a recession or depression develops as the result of the normal functioning of the monetary economy. This involves the identification of positive feedback. A very effective mechanism consists of the circular interaction of profit and distributed profit.
B59|The Ideal Economy: A Prototype|Standard economics starts with behavioral assumptions that are formally expressed as axioms. This approach met with little scientific success but still enjoys some popularity for lack of a convincing alternative. To replace the subjective formal foundations by objective structural axioms is the first task of this paper. To give a correct account of how the monetary economy works is the second. This entails an explanation of the continuous clearing of both the product and the labor market in the random consumption economy, that is, of how the economy could establish ongoing full employment and price stability in principle.
B59|Debunking Squared|Steve Keen has debunked a good part of standard economics. However, he has left standing the theory of profit. This is unfortunate, because the theory of profit is the pivot of all of theoretical economics. This tightly focused paper clarifies the factual relation of profit and income, which should be helpful to put Keen’s alternative to the standard approach on sound foundations.
B59|The Influence of Ordoliberalism in European Integration Processes - A Framework for Ideational Influence with Competition Policy and the Economic and Monetary Policy as Examples|How can one study the ideational influence of ordoliberalism on European integration processes? This is the overarching question answered in this paper where I propose a refined methodology, taking into account that the influence of ordoliberalism can vary over time and, more importantly, that its influence has to be measured on the backdrop of a detailed specification of the characteristics of ordoliberalism itself compared to the strongest ideational alternatives. I have carefully identified these alternatives as interventionism (competition policy), laissez-faire liberalism (competition policy), and Keynesianism (economic and monetary policy). I show the usability of my framework; however, I also point to the fact that more analyses are needed, especially where traces of ordoliberal influence does not seem likely to find.
B59|Say’s Law: A Rigorous Restatement|Say’s Law has passed through various conceptual frameworks. As the next logical step, this paper provides a rigorous restatement in structural axiomatic terms. The main reason is that previous attempts have been methodologically unsatisfactory. Standard economics rests on behavioral assumptions that are expressed as axioms. Axioms are indispensable to build up a theory that epitomizes formal and material consistency. The crucial flaw of the standard approach is that human behavior does not lend itself to axiomatization. Small wonder that the accustomed attempt to explain how the economy works met with scant success. This battered also the discussion about Say’s Law.
B59|Methodological Misconceptions in the Social Sciences. Rethinking social thought and social processes|Contemporary social teaching suffers from a grave deficiency: it is lacking rules of methodology and procedure suited to social reality that are, in particular, able to reconcile increasing creativity (implying irreversibility) with rationality, which are indispensable for the scientific judgement of theoretical ideas. Unfortunately, this lack is largely ignored, and eminent social scholars have even explicitly and emphatically theorized a rejection of method. This allows rhetorical and literary skills to prevail over the reasons of science, thereby promoting a deceptive instead of constructive pluralism, confusion in the study of contemporary societies and growing ineptitude in their government, what represents a main source of afflictions in the present world. Method is a two-edged sword: it offers powerful assistance in and enhances our capability of understanding and solving the problems of everyday life; but if the chosen method is inappropriate,it can seriously obstruct the advancement of knowledge. Significantly, the best contributions to social knowledge have been ad hoc studies that disregard method and simply apply common sense. But ad hoc studies suffer a lack of coordination, and the neglect of method makes it difficult to evaluate and select findings and results. As a consequence, ad hoc analyses have little chance of stimulating the cumulative growth of knowledge. However, the present study is intended as a contribution that prevents method from becoming a prison for the mind as opposed to a stimulant of creativity and knowledge.
B59|Notas sobre un plan de estudios de economía del mundo real|Propongo una reforma radical y ramificada del plan de estudios. Aún se debería enseñar el modelo básico de comportamiento del agente de la economía tradicional, pues no es totalmente irrelevante para el mundo real. Pero solo debería ser una de las numerosas formas de comportamiento de los agentes y no la única. La teoría del comercio internacional, en su versión Sraffa-Ricardo, tiene muchos aspectos recomendables. La literatura sobre econometría de corte trasversal inspirada por Heckman es también muy importante. Es inevitable incluir muchas cosas del plan de estudios estándar. Pero las reformas que propondría son, en resumen: enseñar macro desde la perspectiva de algunos episodios importantes de la historia económica, enseñar a usar el software moderno de simulación para explorar el comportamiento fuera del equilibrio; enseñar modelos alternativos de toma de decisiones de los agentes; enseñar teoría de redes, y a usarla para relajar el supuesto de que los agentes actúan independientemente con gustos y preferencias fijos.
B59|El aporte del pensamiento de Karl Polanyi a la cuestión ambiental|Gran parte de la literatura referida a la historia del pensamiento económico y al vínculo específico entre economía y naturaleza, traza un recorrido histórico que va desde las primeras discusiones entre las escuelas precursoras de la economía moderna, los economistas clásicos y algunos críticos no economistas -provenientes de las ciencias naturales y actualmente postulados como precursores de la economía ecológica-, para luego arribar a la contemporánea discusión entre economistas ambientales de raíz neoclásica y los denominados economistas ecológicos. Sin embargo, hasta el momento son contados autores los que destacan el rol de la obra de Karl Polanyi en ese recorrido. El objetivo de este trabajo es resaltar que el pensamiento de Karl Polanyi es notablemente provechoso a la hora de pensar el vínculo entre sociedad, economía y naturaleza. Recuperar la obra de Polanyi, la idea de economía como proceso institucionalizado, su alegato inapelable contra la posibilidad de una economía autoregulada por el mercado, la potencialidad destructora de las mercancías ficticias y el peligro de la economía desincrustada, puede resultar de gran utilidad en el análisis de la actual crisis ecológica y sobre todo en la necesidad de constituir una democracia global que afronte estos problemas.
B59|The Emergence of Profit and Interest in the Monetary Circuit|Efficient progress of the monetary theory of production (MTP) is hampered by an unsatisfactory account of how profit and interest emerge in the monetary circuit. As matter of fact, this question puzzled already the classics. It seems evident that it cannot be answered by applying the usual tools. The present paper's purpose is to overcome the deadlock. This is done by setting the circulation approach on general structural axiomatic foundations. View the Open Peer Discussion of this paper »
B59|Emergency Aid 2.0|Does the proliferation of aid donors lead to visible changes in the world of foreign assistance? Aid provided by low- and middle-income countries, autocratic regimes and donors operating outside the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD is gaining in importance. This article uses data on emergency aid supplied by 105 donor countries to explore the determinants of aid and the differences in allocation patterns between donor groups. Our results show that both the so-called new and traditional donors provide emergency aid based on humanitarian need and their self-interests, but we find evidence that non-DAC donors attach relatively more importance to political motives. Additionally, autocratic donors seem to favor countries rich in natural resources and to disfavor democracies. Since the timeliness of the aid delivery is crucial for aid effectiveness, we furthermore analyze which factors influence the number of days that pass after a natural disaster before a donor commits herself to provide emergency relief. With regard to aid promptness, we find DAC, developed and democratic countries to be significantly faster than non-DAC, developing and autocratic countries.
B59|Issues And Epistemological Mutations In The Economic Field|"Knowledge in economics, as well as in other fields included in social sciences, can not be achieved upon the Galilean model, so customary in natural sciences. In time, its transfer conducted to the finding of some inconsistencies at the level of theory or between theory and practice. The subject-object discernibility, a possible simplification in natural science, becomes problematically in social sciences, where this delimitation operates only in theory, and, actually, the effects of the whole ""package"" are registered in. Also, the repeatability of initial conditions, possible in natural sciences through the control of the variables, becomes inoperative within social sciences that can not recreate the original context. All these lead to the idea that explanatory models and theories based on the causaltype determinism do not provide satisfactory answers. That is why the Aristotelian tradition is brought into attention, emphasizing the determinism of intelligibility type."
B59|Worth as Integration of Utility and Value|This study presents a variant for synthesis of the essential categories utility and value on the level of society. The labour theory of value and the theory of marginal utility are the starting base. Worth (as distinct from value) is the integrating category. That is why the synthesis can be called common theory of worth. It should be understood as a framework for the explanation of the essence of the functioning of the economy and as a result of the application of a new, organic approach.
B59|Observing productivity: what it might mean to be productive when viewed through the lens of Complexity Theory|The paper tries to explore options and preconditions for a theoretically thoroughly grounded conception of productivity that is able to account for its observer-dependency and thereby meets the needs of a dynamic and highly differentiated modern society. It does so in respect to insights from Cybernetics and Complexity theory, thereby taking up charges about the contradiction of economic productivity and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. In respect to epistemological consequences of contemporary levels of productivity, a seemingly paradoxical constraint is put forward: the constraint that productivity is conditioned on being observed as such, with the observer in its turn being conditioned on productivity. The assumption is that this paradoxical constitution helps to keep productivity adaptive to the changes it itself incites in economy.
B59|Origen y evolución de la teoría del crecimiento impulsado por la demanda real|El artículo estudia el origen y evolución de la teoría del crecimiento endógeno a las fuerzas del mercado, desde la óptica de Adam Smith, Alfred Marshall, Allyn Young y Lauchlin Currie, quienes introdujeron aportes significativos, al presentar nuevos conceptos y precisar o cambiar el significado de los ya existentes. Esta teoría entiende que la economía progresa continuamente mediante sucesivas reorganizaciones de los procesos productivos, lo cual produce un aumento acumulativo de la demanda real, reflejado en un continuo desequilibrio dentro de la economía. Lo anterior significa una crítica fuerte a las visiones tradicionales del crecimiento económico y un campo de investigación fértil.
B59|El economista y el sociólogo: el pensamiento relacional como paradigma|Este artículo contribuye a la reflexión acerca de las razones del distanciamiento entre las ciencias sociales, particularmente la sociología y la economía, en su proceso histórico de institucionalización y autonomía, que acabaría por oponerlas y por limitar su potencial explicativo. Se sostiene que la opción entre diferentes perspectivas epistemológicas ha estado estrechamente relacionada a unas determinadas posturas políticas y que ello puede explicar las divergencias teóricas entre esas ciencias; para ilustrar esto, se analiza un caso práctico del entorno francés. Asimismo, se argumentan las ventajas explicativas del paradigma relacional y cómo la inserción de la economía y la sociología en dicho paradigma permitiría reunificarlas y superar su pernicioso distanciamiento. También se exponen dos teorías, una sociológica y otra económica, que ejemplifican tal unificación.

B59|When the first interaction matters: Recruitment in the French retailing|In France, one of ten recently-hired workers works in retailing. The literature provides evidence about the screening criteria used to fill low-wage vacancies in stores. However, neither the stage when criteria matter nor the forefront role of information channels (direct applications, word-of-mouth, employment agency and job ads) has been well explored. Drawing on 35 interviews conducted in 2010-2011, with actors involved in recruitment activites and with recently-hired workers in large stores in Greater Paris. This article explores the initial interaction between job seekers and recruiters. It is argued that the screening criteria vary according to the way employers received information about applicants and first interact with them (by mail, phone or face-to-face). This contribution highlights the importance of walk-in applications, which prioritize selection based on residence, appearances and availability. Changes in the first interaction impact the whole selection process and may change the profile of the workers hired
B59|The Emergence Of La Decroissance|The paper aims to provide an overview of the emergence of degrowth – the notion designates a grass root, political and academic movement which is progressively spreading since the previous decade across Europe as a reaction to the drawbacks associated with the imperatives of economic growth. The intellectual founder of the new paradigm of degrowth is the Romanian born economist – Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen. The translation of his scientific works and the publication in French was to become the first milestone of degrowth discourse France becoming the cradle of the movement. While degrowth encompasses many dimensions such as equity, ecology, democracy or enjoyment of life, the overarching theme of the movement is the escaping of the economy as a central societal value. Degrowth gained an increasing audience in the beginning of the years 2000’, spreading progressively mostly in other Francophone, Francophile or Latin language speaking countries such as Italy and Spain, but in other European nations as well.
B59|The political economy of civil society|The dichotomy between intended and unintended outcomes of individual and collective action is central to political economy. It concerns the relationship of markets and states and their link to the constitution of society. As such, this dichotomy points to the patterns of connectivity that provide the social embedding of markets and states. The present paper argues that civil society is best understood as the principal locus of connectivity in which markets and states operate. Civil society so configured is neither separate from the body politic and commercial society nor subordinate to them but instead constitutes the primary objective structure of the social domain. It embeds the causal arrangements that determine the crisscrossing of both intended and unintended outcomes in specific contexts. Within the social domain, dispositions of the means-end type interact with non-instrumental dispositions. One important implication is that civil society is compatible with a range of different political economies and specific socio-economic arrangements. Based on a typology of three distinct paradigms of civil society, we argue that the proximity paradigm is conducive to the discovery of political economies that foster greater openness and specificity compared with the political and the economic paradigm. This paper suggests that the theory of civil society in general and the proximity paradigm in particular are indispensable heuristic tools to identity the unrealized capacities inherent in any given social configuration. A proximity heuristic is applied to the discussion of credit arrangements and policy. We conclude that a hierarchy of policy principles is necessary to preserve the primacy of social connectivity over means-end relationships and the conditions for context-specific arrangements and policy options.

B59|Correcting mistakes: cognitive dissonance and political attitudes in Sweden and the United States|Cognitive dissonance theory predicts that the act of voting makes people more positive toward the party or candidate they have voted for. Following Mullainathan and Washington (Am. Econ. J. Appl. Econ. 1:86–111, 2009 ), I test this prediction by using exogenous variation in turnout provided by the voting age restriction. I improve on previous studies by investigating political attitudes, measured just before elections, when they are highly predictive of voting. In contrast to earlier studies I find no effect of voting on political attitudes. This result holds for both Sweden and the United States. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012

B59|A comparison of the Lithuanian and Russian biotechnology sectors| The goal of this paper is to compare the development of the Lithuanian and Russian biotechnology sectors. In case of Lithuania we tried to uncover what are the circumstances surrounding the favorable development of the biotechnology sectors in Lithuania. In case of Russian Federation we looked at encouraging as well as discouraging circumstances surrounding this segment of economy. Drawing upon Schumpeter’s ideas of innovation and Porter’s business cluster theory, we argue that Lithuania is “at the right place and the right time” to make it a regional leader in Baltic biotechnology. Russia, on the other hand, is in the process of developing biotech sector in order to at least to catch up with other countries (including Lithuania). It will take time and continuous governmental support for Russia before this sector starts contributing significantly to Russian economy.

B59|The Impact of Capital Market Players’ Exit, Voice and Loyalty on Economic Growth|In analyses of the global money and capital markets, economic discourse is mostly focussed on the movement and flow of capital, giving less emphasis to its role in influencing the formation of institutional frameworks as well as national and international rules, particularly in terms of the impact on economic growth. Based on the concept of exit, voice and loyalty developed by Albert O. Hirschman, this paper examines the effect of capital movement and investors’ voice on economic growth, making use of both macroeconomic tools and linear regression based on the data of European countries and Post-Soviet states. Our results indicate that the de facto exit of capital has a negative effect on economic growth, while the de jure exit of capital to the shadow economy and investors’ voice result in a higher growth rate.
B59|On the mathematic prediction of economic and social crises: toward a harmonic interpretation of the Kondratiev wave|In Part One of this paper we use the harmonic analogy of a musical octave to analyze mathematic ratios of U.S. real GNP. These ratios are generated by bringing together figures for U.S. real GNP over intervals of time – “spreads of years” – as numerator and denominator in a single fraction. Using a range of 7-year to 18-year “spreads,” we find that this approach provides strong evidence that American economic history is composed of four 14-year quarter-cycles within a 56 year circuit in the real GNP of the United States, 1869-2007. These periods correlate closely with analysis by Nickolai Kondratiev and provide a framework for predicting an annual steady state rate of growth for the United States falling between 3.4969% and 3.4995% per year. In Part Two of this paper we provide three postscripts including: (1) correlations / speculations on the political and social consequences of this model, (2) simplification / expansion of the geometries implied and (3) analysis / prediction based upon this approach, as concluded by a brief afterword. These post-script refinements narrow the steady state rate of growth predicted to between 3.4969% and 3.4973% per year correlating closely with the 3.4971% rate for annualized quarterly data calculated for Okun’s Law, 1947-2007. The size and interconnectedness of world economies, and the virtually exact correlations provided herein, suggest that the dates predicted for future crises will see changes which are unexpectedly global, dramatic and fierce.
B59|Diseguaglianza, conflitto sociale e sindacati in America<BR>[Inequality, social conflict and unions in America]|A comparison of the 2007-08 crisis with that of 1929 showed its extreme gravity, but it also may have implied that the old harmful mistakes would not be repeated. After four years, the crisis has not been solved and it even threatens to worsen. Neo-conservative Republicans claim that this is proof of the failure of Keynesian policies. Yet, there is something structurally distorted in the institutions and policies of American industrial relations. The fall of the ‘social contract’ is the basic element of the crisis of the American social and economic model. In comparison with the crisis of the Thirties and its aftermath, what initially was supposed to possibly evolve toward a new New Deal of the Twenty-first century has evolved just in its opposite.
B59|Predicting crises: Five essays on the mathematic prediction of economic and social crises|This volume – Predicting Crisis: Five Essays on the Mathematic Prediction of Economic and Social Crises – is the first of three sets of essays. In this first set the economic and social history of the United States is shown to be a “system of movement,” i.e. a logical and mathematic progression of events which may be analyzed according to a set formula. The model proposed demonstrates that the citizen’s individual “consciousness” is writ large in the macro-economic statistics of this unique economy and thereby made available for inspection at other levels of reality.
B59|The Caldwellian Methodological Pluralism: Wishful Thoughts and Personal Tendencies|Economists failed badly both to predict and solve the Great Global Recession of 2008-2010 for two interconnected reasons. The first is that economics has moved too far away from its social foundations. The second reason is that the positivist economic methodology that economics follows has produced both benefits and costs, perhaps even costs than benefits, one may argue. This paper looks at the available evidence (not exhaustively) to argue for a Caldwellian methodological pluralism. It illustrates the advantages of such a methodological approach as well as the disadvantages of its alternatives, especially monolithic positivism.
B59|What Does Flexicurity Have to Gain from the Capability-Approach?|The policy discourse termed flexicurity is on its way of becoming a concept. Yet, this political process bears the risk of departing from the very idea of flexicurity. This paper argues that this could be prevented if flexicurity were guided by a clear conception of human well-being. The paper suggests complementing flexicurity by the capability-approach. Random or adverse effects of flexicurity-policy on human freedom can be avoided if “flexibility and security” in the employment system are recognised not as ends in themselves, but as instruments at the service of people’s capabilities. In principle, it is argued, flexicurity has the potential of extending human freedoms.
B59|Applying the Capability Approach Empirically: An Overview with Special Attention to Labor|Operationalizing the capability approach (CA) is difficult due to the conceptual challenges it poses: its multidimensionality and the role it assigns to freedom of choice for human wellbeing. Therefore the operationalizability of the CA has been questioned. Despite this, a lot of empirical studies apply the CA in various contexts and on a multitude of issues. This paper discusses the challenges in operationalizing the approach and reports on the methods used to meet them. Special attention is paid to studies of labor-related issues. It turns out that studies of labor-related issues have developed new methods for operationalizing the CA using available data. Generating primary data is another way to meet the challenge of modeling freedom of choice, the core concept of the CA, but has been used less with respect of labor-related issues. After discussing the challenges of operationalizing the CA, the paper briefly addresses the relation between labor and wellbeing in economic theory. Then one section reviews empirical studies based on available data and the methods they use and the next one primary studies of the CA. The last section concludes.
B59|Broadening the View: Diverse Types of Entrepreneurs|In this paper the hegemonic image of the entrepreneur is confronted with a more diverse picture derived from a research project in which a variety of qualitative methods were applied. The paper opted for an exploratory study which emphasizes the generation of theory from data in the process of conducting research. Thus the open-ended approach of grounded theory is used and 29 narratives, problem-centred interviews with female and male entrepreneurs were conducted. From these interviews four different entrepreneurial types emerged: the strategic planner, the step-by-step entrepreneur, the crisis entrepreneur and the bricoleur.
B59|Beyond constructivism: expanding the boundaries of international relations theory|One of the key research areas of Political Science is the field of International Relations (IR). Many scholars who speak of IR in terms of its Great Debates understand constructivism as the critical turn in theory. The main appeal of constructivism is the application of identity to IR problems. Interrogating the social construction of world order and considering identity as a factor enables scholars to offer better, deeper explanations. However, other scholars insist the constructivist turn is not critical enough and befalls some of the same traps seen in traditional approaches, namely essentialism. In this paper, I take the position that to engage in more meaningful dialogue about identity that challenges common knowledge and assumptions, we must move beyond constructivist approaches to advance the field of IR. This task is timely given increased academic attention to current social and economic issues in Europe.
B59|Governance without government or: The Euro Crisis and what went wrong with European Economic Governance?|The Great Recession after 2008 did not turn out to be as deep and severe as the Great Depression of the 1930s. According to the European Commission, this positive result is due to the fact that economic policy-makers around the world learnt their lessons from the Great Depression in stabilizing their financial systems and, moreover, that particularly the European Union and its economic governance system has become a shelter against negative external shocks in coordinating stabilization policies to maintain aggregate demand. This paper argues that the claim of the European Commission needs some qualifications: on the one hand, the lessons have not been applied appropriately in all EU and, particularly, Eurozone Member States. This is, on the other hand, not merely the result of mismanagement of individual governments but the systematic outcome of an ineffective and even counterproductive European economic governance system. Although, in the wake of the Euro Crisis some crisis control and emergency measures have been established, crisis resolution has failed as the core of the inefficient governance system - the European Stability and Growth Pact (ESGP) - has not been reformed adequately.
B59|The Economic Metronome|The “Economic Metronome” (EM) is a term, used for the mathematical formula of a set of fundamental interrelations of key importance for the monetary-value expression among: the main factors of economical activity of any range; their productivity; the primary proportions in production, distribution, exchange and consumption of the output commodity product; the speeds of development of the activity. The formula is an attempt to design an instrument for more accurate measurement of the potentially possible and the actually achieved efficiency of economical activity, as well as for more reliable forecasting and projecting its further development on the investment-innovative stage.
B59|Centralidade e hierarquia do sistema financeiro brasileiro|The aim of the article is to analyze the relationship between a financial system and the city in which it is located. In order to do so, initially an inedited theoretical discussion regarding the analysis of the relationship between the degree of centrality of a city and the behavior of financial systems is made. This analysis is carried out bearing in mind the concept of both liquidity preference and the endogeneity of money supply derived from Keynes (1937). An empirical investigation of the Brazilian case follows. In the investigation, it is proposed a hierarchy of the financial system for every municipality in Brazil. Based on this hierarchy the behavior of the bank system is analyzed. The paper concludes arguing that space is an important element on the definition of the ways bank branches work in different regions, with clear consequences for the economic development of the regions.
B59|Hacia el concepto de la felicidad en economía|Entre las diferentes corrientes del pensamiento económico, existe un concepto que ha brillado por su ausencia. La idea de la felicidad, además de no estar presente en la corriente dominante de la economía, ha sufrido un proceso de transformación a través de la evolución de la disciplina de manera que se crea un manto cada vez más grueso que opaca lo que se entiende por felicidad y de esa manera ha asociado el concepto con otros muy discutibles como la utilidad y la satisfacción de las necesidades. Sin embargo, algunos pensadores, tanto de la antigua Grecia como algunos economistas contemporáneos, han puesto en discusión esta verdadera problemática, que abarca una gama amplia de disciplinas, para llamar la atención a una ciencia que ha olvidado que mas que solo reproducir la riqueza, está en función de hacer personas felices llenas de goce y de bienestar.
B59|UN ACERCAMIENTO AL PROCESO DE COLONIZACIÓN DEL BRASIL (Finales del S. XV a mediados del S. XIX)|Salvo contadas excepciones, los países del centro y sur de América tienen un ámbito político, social y económico similar. El hecho de que los países latinos sean tan semejantes radica en la etapa colonial americana, pues la raíz común de estos pueblos es el imperialismo español. En el cono sur, un país es diferente a los otros en los aspectos socio-político y económico. Brasil es la única nación colonizada por el reino de Portugal sufriendo un proceso diferente al del resto de los países latinos.

B59|Teoría de los sistemas de ecuaciones de demanda|El presente documento tiene por objetivo realizar un repaso histórico, un análisis teórico y una aplicación empírica de dos sistemas de ecuaciones de demanda (Sistema Lineal de Gastos -LES- y su versión extendida -ELES-), para ello se explican los aportes de los autores más importantes e influyentes en este tema de la teoría del consumidor, seguido de una análisis microeconómico y econométrico de las condiciones necesarias para desarrollar el LES y ELES.Se revisan algunas estimaciones hechas para Colombia basadas en estos modelos, y finalmente por medio del programa estadístico SAS, utilizando la Encuesta de Calidad de Vida del 2008, se estiman los gastos de subsistencia (línea de pobreza) y diferentes elasticidades para 9 regiones colombianas. Entre los resultados más importantes de la aplicación, se concluye que Bogotá y San Andrés presentan los costos de vida monetarios per-cápita más alto del país, que el grupo de gasto en alimentos y vivienda es un bien necesario para todas las regiones, y que los grupos de otros pagos e impuestos-deducciones obligatorias se comportan como bienes de lujo.
