H72|Fiscal rules and budget forecast errors of Italian Municipalities|We study the impact of the domestic stability pact on the budget forecast errors of Italian municipalities. The identification of the causal effect exploits a quasi-natural experiment generated by the removal in 2001 of the fiscal restraints on budget decisions for municipalities with less than 5,000 inhabitants and by stricter budgetary restrictions and severe penalties for noncompliers in 2002. We find that relaxing fiscal rules had a sizeable impact on budget forecast errors, especially in 2002. Revenue (expenditure) forecast errors for municipalities below 5,000 inhabitants became indeed 26% (22%) larger than in the past.
H72|La mejora de la situación de las finanzas públicas de las corporaciones locales en la última década|Las Corporaciones Locales han registrado desde 2012 un superávit fiscal, que contrasta con el déficit registrado en el resto de las Administraciones Públicas. A pesar de la heterogeneidad en la composición del sector, esta mejora en las finanzas públicas se extiende a una amplia mayoría de municipios. Su origen se remonta a la reducción y a la posterior contención de los gastos no financieros surgidas en 2012, especialmente relevantes en el caso del gasto en inversión pública. Las Corporaciones Locales han utilizado esta evolución favorable de sus presupuestos para mejorar significativamente su situación financiera. En particular, desde 2012 el sector ha iniciado un proceso de desendeudamiento, que, si bien presenta cierto grado de heterogeneidad, ha supuesto una reducción notable de su stock de deuda. Esta reducción del pasivo ha venido acompañada de una sustancial mejora de los activos financieros, materializada, en particular, en la acumulación de efectivo y depósitos. Si bien a escala agregada el sector presenta una situación financiera saneada, holgadamente compatible con los límites de deuda establecidos en la Ley Orgánica de Estabilidad Presupuestaria y Sostenibilidad Financiera, aún muestra cierto margen de mejora, en particular en el caso de los ayuntamientos de tamaño medio.
H72|Jobs multipliers: evidence from a large fiscal stimulus in Spain|We estimate the employment effect of a large fiscal stimulus in Spain (PlanE), in which the national government transferred funds to municipalities to carry out local investment projects. Using a difference-in-difference approach by exploiting variation in the timing of the execution of projects across municipalities, we find that 100,000 euros of stimulus reduced unemployment by 0.62 jobs per year. We allow for possible spatial effects, i.e. the propagation of the stimulus to neighboring municipalities, and find that these are sizable, representing 8.4% of the “local” effect. We also present evidence on the transmission mechanism, finding that the effect was: (i) initially concentrated in the construction and industrial sectors, but later spilled over to the broader economy, (ii) larger for males than females, (iii) larger when the shock represented a higher share of the budget, and (iv) not larger for municipalities headed by more educated mayors. Our estimate of the multiplier falls in the lower range of previous work.
H72|The political economy of immigrant legalisation: evidence from the 1986 IRCA|What happens to the distribution of public resources when undocumented migrants obtain legal status through nation-wide amnesty? In this paper, we exploit variation in legal status from the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) to answer this question and find that state governors, of whatever party affiliation, allocate more per capita aid to those counties affected by the IRCA. We posit that this is borne out of rational, forward-looking governors who allocate resources strategically in pursuit of the votes of the newly legalised who were eligible to vote five years after legalisation. To support this view, we find that the distribution of state aid differs significantly according to political context. Counties affected by the IRCA receive more resources from the state when their governor is eligible for re-election, faces political competition or enjoys line-item veto power. Our results also indicate that the transfers were targeted to the newly legalised, who by and large were of Hispanic origin, and not other constituents. We find no evidence of anti-migrant sentiment confounding our results. Counties that received more transfers from the governor also experienced improvements in Hispanic high school completion rates.
H72|How Do Subnational Governments React to Shocks to Revenue Sources? Evidence from Argentina|Using the exogenous variability in intergovernmental transfers and hydrocarbon royalties, based on the fiscal regime that prevailed in Argentina from 1988 to 2003, we jointly estimate the effects that changes in these public revenues had on provincial public consumption and debt. When receiving a one-peso increase in intergovernmental transfers, provinces spent 32 centavos of each peso on public consumption and 43 on debt repayment. But when hydrocarbon-producing provinces received a one-peso increase in royalties, they used 75 centavos for debt repayment. These dissimilar reactions to revenue increases are robust to different specifications of the basic regressions. Finally, we provide two alternative explanations for them: the higher volatility of hydrocarbon royalties (relative to intergovernmental transfers) and the exhaustible nature of these revenues.
H72|Fiscal Windfall Curse|We study the impact of a one-off exogenous fiscal windfall on local public finances in the canton of Zurich in Switzerland. The windfall was due to the IPO of Glencore on the London Stock Exchange in 2011. As a result, its CEO paid an extraordinary tax bill of approximately CHF 360 million. About CHF 238 million of that extra tax revenue entered the municipal resource equalization scheme and rained down on the municipalities of the canton of Zurich. This quasi-experimental setup and our unusually rich dataset allow us to estimate the causal effect of this one-off windfall on all municipal accounting positions. We show that it triggered large expenditure increases targeting particular groups (e.g., salaries of public employees) at the same time as general tax cuts and user charge hikes (e.g., nursing home fees). The resulting imbalances caused a 7.5-fold increase in gross debt relative to the windfall. This massive overreaction hints at a substantial fiscal windfall curse.
H72|Communal fees and election cycles: Evidence from German municipalities|The political business cycle theories describe that election-motivated politicians manipulate economic policy-making. Election cycles occur in many fiscal variables, for example tax rates. I examine whether electoral motives influence communal fees in Germany. Fees have to be paid for the use of many public services, for example waste management or sewerage provisions. Fees should be equivalent to the costs of a public service and thus correspond to the benefit principle in public finance. The German municipalities, however, have a leeway to determine fees. I use revenue data for around 7,000 West German municipalities from seven states over the period 1992–2006. The results show that municipalities increase communal fees in election years to a smaller extent than in the middle of the legislative period, while they increase fees more directly after elections. Fees increase in election years by 0.94 euro per capita less and directly after elections by 1.74 euro per capita more than in the middle of the legislative period. The results thus corroborate the predictions of the political business cycle theories.
H72|Individual labor market effects of local public expenditures on sports|By merging administrative data on public finances of all municipalities in Germany with individual data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we explore whether local public expenditures on sports facilities influences individual labor market outcomes. Our identification strategy follows a selection-on-observables approach and exploits the panel structure of the data covering 12 years between 2001 and 2012. The results of our matching estimations suggest that both women and men living in municipalities with high expenditure levels benefit, exhibiting approximately 7 percent of additional household net income on average. However, this income effect is fully captured by earning gains for men rather than women living in the household. Additional analysis suggests, that these gender differences, which can also be observed in terms of working time, hourly wage and employment status, appear plausible since women in the age cohort under consideration are less likely than men to engage in sports in general and in any of the publicly funded sports facilities in particular. Moreover, improved well-being and health are possible mechanisms that determine how the positive labor market effects for men may unfold.
H72|Local Government and Innovation: the case of Italian provinces|"This paper evaluates the effect of decentralization on innovation at the provincial level in Italy. We exploit quasi-natural experiments associated with three waves of reforms occurred in 1992, 2001 and 2004, to establish 8, 4, and 3 new provinces, respectively. Using a difference-in-difference estimation approach, we find evidence of a significant detrimental effect of (further) decentralization on innovation for Northern and Central Italian provinces. We suggest a potential mechanism that may explain the reduction in innovation associated with the aforementioned reforms. We argue that this finding can be rationalized with the costs imposed by the \mafia transplantation"" phenomenon, as we find that the new provinces that were more exposed to \mafiosi in confino"" reduced their innovation output more extensively. We perform a number of robustness checks that corroborate our main findings."
H72|Taxes, traffic jam and spillover in the metropolis|This paper studies local governments' public policies in a metropolitan area plagued by traffic congestion, where both residents and workers consume local public goods. We develop a new spatial sub-metropolitan tax competition model which features a central city surrounded by suburban towns linked by mobile capital and mobile residents who commute to work. We show that Pareto-efficiency is achieved if towns can retain their workers using labor subsidies. Otherwise, traffic congestion in the city is inefficiently high and local governments respond by setting inefficient public policies: (1) the city over-taxes capital and under-taxes residents, which leads to too little capital and too many residents in the city; (2) local public goods are under-provided in the city and over-provided in the towns.
H72|Le Phénix renaîtra-t-il de ses cendres ? Réflexions sur le recours des collectivités territoriales aux marchés de partenariats public-privé|This article describes the use of public-private partnerships by local governments since their creation in France in 2004. We argue that the municipalities' objectives and constraints explain the development of such contracts. We also study the reason of their current neglect. We conclude that the recent lack of interest for public-private partnerships is also due to the diversification of the contractual tools made available to municipalities.

H72|Local territorial reform and regional spending efficiency|We investigate the effect of a local territorial reform, which reduced the number of parishes, on municipality spending efficiency in the period 2011-2016. We build a composite output indicator and use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to compute efficiency scores, which we then analyze through a second stage regression with socio-demographic, economic factors and the reform. We find efficiency gains for around 10% of municipalities overall. In Alentejo and in Centro, more than 50% of the municipalities improved efficiency. The second stage results show that the reform did not improve local spending efficiency in Mainland Portugal, particularly in the Norte region.
H72|Earthquakes, grants and public expenditure: how municipalities respond to natural disasters|We analyze the response of municipalities to the occurrence of natural disasters (earthquakes) in Italy, in terms of spending behavior, use of upper tier transfers and recovery. We find evidence of increasing expenditure for about 12 years after the shock, with asymmetric responses between matching (earthquake-related) and unconditional grants, and heterogeneous flypaper effects across the country. While in Northern municipalities expenditure tends to regress to pre-treatment levels, i.e., before the earthquake occurrence, Southern municipalities react to the drop of grants showing inertia in expenditure levels. This evidence is coupled with a faster recovery of private income and housing prices in Northern municipalities. Our analysis exploits balance sheet data of about 8000 municipalities for the period 2000-2015 and encompasses the universe of earthquake events defined using alternative intensity measures. We apply a matching approach to disentangle earthquake-related grants (mostly matching grants) from other grants, and to define a control group of non-treated municipalities. The spatial and temporal variation in expenditure and transfers between treated and not-treated governments are then examined using panel data models on the universe of municipalities as well as on a matching sample of municipalities.

H72|Retirement Choices by State and Local Public Sector Employees: The Role of Eligibility and Financial Incentives|I analyze the effects of state public pension parameters on the retirement of public employees. Using a panel data set of public sector workers from 12 waves of the Health and Retirement Study, I model the probability of retirement as a function of pension wealth at early and normal retirement eligibility and Social Security coverage in the public sector job. I find that becoming eligible for early retirement, or receiving an early-out offer, significantly increases the probability of retiring. I do not find any effect of retirement wealth levels; instead the findings are consistent with the literature on default options in defined contribution plans. These findings suggest that state legislative action to affect retirement decisions and reduce future pension costs may be most effective operating through plan eligibility rules and early-out incentives.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H72|The Impact of Early Investments in Urban School Systems in the United States|Cities in the United States dramatically expanded spending on public education in the years following World War I, with the average urban school district increasing per pupil expenditures by over 70 percent between 1916 and 1924. We provide the first evaluation of these historically unprecedented investments in public education by compiling a new dataset that links individuals to both the quality of the city school district they attended as a child and their adult outcomes. Using plausibly exogenous growth in school spending generated by anti-German sentiment, we find that school resources significantly increased educational attainment and wages later in life, particularly for the children of unskilled workers. Increases in expenditures can explain about 50 percent of the sizable increase in educational attainment of cohorts born between 1895 and 1915. However, increased spending did not close the gap in educational attainment between the children of skilled and unskilled workers, which remained constant over the period
H72|Do Local Governments Represent Voter Preferences? Evidence from Hospital Financing under the Affordable Care Act|A mainstream motivation for decentralized government is to enable public service investments to better align with political preferences that may differ by geographical region. This paper examines how political preferences determine local government provision of hospital services. We find that local governments in areas more supportive of public insurance expansion responded to such state action by increasing expenditures on hospitals, whereas those in areas that voted against such expansions used the savings to reduce property taxes. This finding suggests that local government financial responses indeed align with political preferences.
H72|Can Pigou at the Polls Stop Us Melting the Poles?|Surveys show majority U.S. support for a carbon tax. Yet none has been adopted. Why? We study two failed carbon tax initiatives in Washington State in 2016 and 2018. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we show that Washington's real-world campaigns reduced support by 20 percentage points. Resistance to higher energy prices explains opposition to these policies in the average precinct, while ideology explains 90% of the variation in votes across precincts. Conservatives preferred the 2016 revenue-neutral policy, while liberals preferred the 2018 green-spending policy. Yet we forecast both initiatives would fail in other states, demonstrating that surveys are overly optimistic.
H72|Living under Fiscal Rules: Fiscal Management Response and Resource Allocation Choices for State of Odisha|The paper assesses the remarkable success story of State of Odisha in making fiscal correction after adopting the fiscal rules and the policy responses. The degree of correction was one of the highest among the Indian States. The tradeoff between fiscal restraint and the development priorities assumes significance as a relatively economically weak State like Odisha maintained a very low-deficit regime by limiting the public spending for a long time. The paper highlights that while fiscal discipline improves the ability of the Government to prioritize among policy choices and improve operational management, strict imposition of self-restraint and large adjustments may lead to distortions. After a decade of controlled fiscal management, as the State has started opening up by expanding the public spending, the shrinking fiscal space, slow growth of internal revenue, and high dependence on Central funds present new challenges. The paper examines the institutional reforms in this context to address emerging fiscal architecture.
H72|Municipal Merger and Debt Issuance in South African Municipality|Employing South African data and Difference-In-Difference (DID) method, this paper investigates whether the free-ride behaviour was taken by municipalities which faced their mergers before the municipal demarcation changes are executed. With several developed countries' data, many research show that there are opportunistic free-ride behaviours of municipalities such as over-issuance of debt before their mergers since the burden of them will be shared by newly constructed municipalities. In spite of these fruits of research, few solution is suggested in the literature. Considering this, we focus on the South African municipal mergers, where the upper government of municipalities implemented the policy for pre-merged municipalities to suspend new contracts involving the borrowing contract before the mergers. As a result of DID analysis, we show that South African municipalities did decrease the amount of borrowings before their mergers. This result is an opposite result considering the previous empirical researches and means that the proper policy for municipal mergers can prevent the fiscal common pool problem caused by free-ride behavior. In addition, this paper shed the light to utilize the data of developing countries and is the first paper to show there were reductions of borrowings before municipal mergers.
H72|Delegation of Taxation Authority and Multipolicy Commitment in a Decentralized Leadership Model|This paper examines to what extent taxation authority should be delegated to local or lower-level government. Delegation of taxation authority can be regarded as a commitment to the local tax rate ex ante in a decentralized leadership model, in which local governments set policies ex ante and the central government decides transfer policies ex post. Previous papers point out that the ex post interregional transfers of the central government distort the ex ante regional policies of local governments. However, Silva (2014, 2015) clarify the case where efficient expenditure by local governments is achieved. This paper examines the delegation of taxation authority by extending Silva's model to include commitment to taxation and generally derives the conditions when efficient public expenditure by local governments can be achieved in relation to the delegation of taxation authority. The model adopted in this paper allows various levels of spillovers of local public goods and various types of multipolicy commitments of taxation and/or expenditure.
H72|Partial decentralisation and inter-governmental electoral competition in local public good provision|Over the last few years, the literature on partial decentralisation has largely grown, pointing out that one of its effects is a reduction in accountability because voters are imperfectly informed about each government contribution. However, the possibility for politicians to directly manipulate this asymmetry in information has not been addressed yet. This paper provides a simple model in which two levels of government are involved in the provision of a local public good with the local government that can decide to spend its budget either on the provision of the public good or in spending that influences the information of the voters in its favour. A central result is that the conflict of interest that arises among the levels of government reduces the spending in the public good at both levels, while it generates a wasteful spending to pander to voters.
H72|Municipal infrastructure spending capacity in South Africa: a panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) approach|This paper assesses the factors that contribute to underspending of the capital budget at the local government level by making use of a nonlinear model based on the panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) model. South Africa is used as a case study. Capital transfer is identified as an important threshold variable in that the degree to which municipalities spend their capital budget depends on a threshold determined by capital transfer. The results of the empirical analysis show that large amounts of capital transfers to local government contribute to underspending by municipalities in South Africa. Moreover, the results indicate that capital budget spending could be improved by ensuring that the trade-off between the current budget and capital budget is reduced, increasing the fiscal capacity of municipalities, which gives them financial autonomy to raise their own revenues.
H72|Should French municipalities foster urban densification to reduce their expenditures?|The relationship between population density and the costs of public services remains the subject of controversies due to the wide range of estimated elasticities. This disparity derives essentially from measurement and identification issues. Based on a sample of French municipalities for the period 2003-2015, this paper addresses both considerations and provides further evidence in support of a non-linear relationship between density and public expenditures per capita. First, we measure density differently from the traditional literature and consider two metrics. Second, to tackle endogeneity, we exploit historical records of population, settlements and soil characteristics as an exogenous source of variation. Our preferred specifications imply elasticity estimates equal to -0.13 and 0.12 for per capita current and capital expenditures respectively. Under a cubic B-spline specification, current spending initially decreases with density (up to 20 inhabitants plus jobs per ha) before increasing. In contrast, capital spending features several return points at 20, 30 and 50 inhabitants plus jobs per ha respectively
H72|Public investment and the fiscal common pool problem on municipal mergers in Japan|The purpose of this paper is to reveal which kinds of public investment cause municipal mergers to create a fiscal common pool problem in Japan. In particular, we focus on whether municipal mergers increase road and public park construction just before the mergers or not because previous papers reveal only that municipal mergers increase local bonds. The empirical results reveal that the subordinate merger partners rapidly increase their road and public park expenses just before mergers.
H72|Improving Subnational Government Development Finance in Emerging and Developing Economies: Toward a Strategic Approach|Considerable attention has been given to enhancing subnational development finance in response to the 2008 global financial crisis and recent global development agendas, including the Sustainable Development Goals, Financing for Development, and Habitat III/New Urban Agenda. Much work on this topic is fragmented, focusing on specific elements of development finance: fiscal transfers, capital market access, public-sector lending agencies, or public–private partnerships. Most countries, however, have a range of subnational governments with varying needs and capacities that require different and evolving mixes of development finance mechanisms. Enabling greater subnational borrowing is often desirable but requires adoption of other reform policies to improve the fiscal capacity and creditworthiness of subnational governments over time. We review the rationale and potential for improving subnational development finance, outline the overall landscape of institutional arrangements available for this purpose, and consider broad challenges involved. Based on a review of global practice and experience in selected Asian developing countries with a range of special entities and innovations to enhance subnational investment, we propose a more integrated, strategic approach to building subnational development finance.
H72|Innovation in Public Sector Accounting: a New Role for Local Governments?|The research aims to analyze how local governments can adopt accounting innovations to reinvent their role. This report attempts to define the importance of reducing information asymmetry among citizens, policy-makers, and public managers, as well as how accounting system reform can support the process. This paper makes use of a case study based on the realization of a medium-sized Italian municipalityâ€™s consolidated financial statements, exploiting the action research method. The analysis outlines that, on one hand, the development of new accounting tools can enhance organizational awareness, while on the other hand, there are some possible limits regarding internal and external accountability.
H72|Do local public expenditures on sports facilities affect sports participation in Germany?|This paper analyzes the effect of local public expenditures on sports facilities on sports participation in Germany. To this end, we construct a new database containing public expenditures at the municipality level and link this information with individual level data. We form locally weighted averages of expenditures based on geographic distances since people also benefit from expenditures of neighboring municipalities. We analyze how effects of sports facility expenditures change with different expenditures levels (“dose-response relationship”) and find no effect of local public expenditures on sports facilities on the probability to practice sports. These findings are robust across different age groups and municipality sizes.

H72|Ein Zukunftsfonds zur Tilgung der kommunalen Kassenkredite in Nordrhein-Westfalen: Handlungsempfehlungen für die Politik|"Die Verschuldung der Kommunen in Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW) hat in den vergangenen 20 Jahren deutlich zugenommen. Dabei haben sich Bürgermeister und Kämmerer großzügig an Kassenkrediten bedient, die lediglich zur Liquiditätssicherung vorgesehen sind. Der kontinuierliche Anstieg der Kassenkredite zeigt jedoch, dass diese zur allgemeinen Haushaltsfinanzierung eingesetzt werden. Um Städten und Gemeinden wieder mehr Handlungsspielraum zu geben, ist ein Schuldenschnitt in Verbindung mit einer Konsolidierung der Aufwendungen in vielen Fällen erforderlich. Dabei sollten die Kassenkredite im Fokus stehen. Die Überschüsse der öffentlichen Hand bieten die Chance, Altschulden mittels eines ""kommunalen Zukunftsfonds NRW"" zurückzuführen. Für die Konzeptionierung des ""Zukunftsfonds"" kann sich die Politik an vergleichbaren Programmen in Hessen und Niedersachsen orientieren, die ebenfalls bei den Kassenkrediten ansetzen und einen Schuldenschnitt mit einer Haushaltskonsolidierung verknüpfen. Um solide wirtschaftenden Kommunen nicht vor den Kopf zu stoßen, sollte der Schuldenschnitt um eine Investitionsoffensive für Kommunen ohne oder mit nur geringen Kassenkrediten (bis maximal 750 Euro je Einwohner) ergänzt werden, die dafür nicht am Entschuldungsprogramm teilnehmen können. Nach diesen Kriterien nähmen 143 Kommunen in NRW an einem Schuldenschnitt teil, 253 Kommunen würden Investitionszuschüsse erhalten. Je nach Ausgestaltung würde der ""Zukunftsfonds NRW"" Finanzmittel in Höhe von bis zu 25 Milliarden Euro erfordern. Wichtig ist dabei, dass die Kommunen beim Entschuldungsprogramm einen Eigenanteil leisten. Das Land müsste danach rund 18 Milliarden Euro beisteuern. Als Einmalbetrag wirkt dieser Wert aus Landessicht zweifelsfrei hoch, bei einer Streckung auf mehrere Jahre relativiert sich jedoch der Umfang."
H72|Does accrual accounting alter fiscal policy decisions? Evidence from Germany|Many governments have replaced traditional cash-based accounting with some form of accrual-based accounting system. However, empirical evidence on the effects of the public accounting system on fiscal policy is scarce. Following rules by the federal states, municipalities in Germany have adopted accrual-based accounting systems gradually. By exploiting variations over time and across states I find no evidence for an impact on the overall financial balance. However, my findings suggest that accrual accounting has altered the structure of the budget. Revenues from the sales of non-financial assets have decreased significantly. This supports the hypothesis that municipalities had used these one-off measures before to meet fiscal constraints. Using data on entities controlled by the municipalities, the analysis provides no evidence for repercussions on these public funds, institutions or enterprises.
H72|The impact of mayor-council coalitions on local government spending, service delivery, and corruption in Indonesia|This study examines the impact of majority coalitions on local government spending, service delivery, and corruption in Indonesia. The investigation finds that majority coalitions, i.e. those coalitions for which participating political parties control greater than half of council seats, cause a shift in local government spending towards health sector activities and induce improvements in citizen health service access—but only for a year or two, after which the positive effects disappear. The study shows that budget fraud starts to become problematic in the last two years of the coalition’s life. Majority coalition support for the local health spending and service agenda dissipates quickly as attention turns to corrupting the budget, via increased infrastructure outlays and associated rent-seeking. We hypothesize that budget fraud serves, in part, to finance subsequent rounds of local parliamentary and executive elections.
H72|Are fiscal budgets sustainable in South Africa? Evidence from provincial level data| This study uses the nonlinear autoregressive distributive lag (N-ARDL) model to investigate the expenditure-revenue relationship for all nine South African provinces using annual data spanning from 2000 to 2016. Whereas other cointegration models can only depict whether budgets are sustainable or not, the N-ARDL model presents features which further enable us to predict a course of action which individual provincial governments can take towards attaining higher levels of budgetary sustainability in both the short and the long-run. Ultimately, our empirical study demonstrates that the ‘one rule fit all’ strategy as suggested by previous studies may not be an appropriate approach seeing that provincial governments have differing requirements for attaining improved levels of budget sustainability

H72|Geschichte und Politökonomie deutscher Theatersubventionen<BR>[History and Political Economy of Public Subsidies for German Theatres and Operas]|Public theatres and operas in Germany currently receive an annual funding of 2 – 2,5 billion Euros by the German Laender and municipalities. The presented monograph shows that this special kind of cultural subsidy can be traced back to the Late Middle Ages, and that theatres and operas have always been subsidized for political reasons. Employing a panel data set, the empirical analysis also demonstrates clearly that since German reunification, a higher propor-tion of center-right party members in the Laender parliaments entails higher subsidies for theatres and operas. In addition, a classical political budget cycle can be observed, with higher subsidies being granted in election years.
H72|The Size of Flypaper Effect in Decentralizing Indonesia|This study explores the flypaper effect in Indonesia using a spatial approach. Covering data from 2000-2014, the paper shows that grants stimulate overspending by local governments even though spatial interdependence is carefully treated. The elasticity of lump-sum grants to expenditure is stronger than the elasticity of matching grants. Further, the elasticity of lump-sum grant is greater on routine expenditure, which shows the over-dependency of local governments to lump-sum grant. The over-dependency phenomenon has not changed a lot even after a major change of lump-sum grant formulation being applied by the 2004 decentralization law package.
H72|Political Cycles, Government Spending, and Efficiency of Indonesia' Local Governments|The paper presents a test of the relationship between rational political cycles with the government spending behavior and its efficiency by using extensive data set of whole Indonesian municipalities/cities from 2008-2014. The results show that politicians/local leaders in Indonesia tend to maximize their preference during the election year but anticipate the election time through strategy to deceive voters.
H72|U.S. State and Local Fiscal Policy and Economic Activity: Do We Know More Now?|Early reviews of the academic literature on the economic effects of state and local taxes and expenditures suggested that not enough was known upon which to base policy. The reviews called for better data and improvements in empirical methodology. This paper reviews studies conducted since the early literature reviews to assess our current state of knowledge. The conclusion of the study is that we know more now. But our knowledge is unlikely to ever be sufficient to provide universal policy guidance. Rather, we suggest that more research is needed on specific state and local policies for specific circumstances, consistent with the general principles that guide place-based policy.
H72|Do the Elderly Support Public Educational Expenditure? An Empirical Analysis Focusing on the Characteristics of Spending|This paper investigates the preferences of the elderly with respect to local public educational expenditures at the kindergarten, primary school, junior high school and high school stages in Japan focusing on the characteristics of expenditures. We applied dynamic estimation method to the data of educational expenditures after the latter half of the 1990s, during which period the aging factor would have been likely to have had a negative relationship with educational expenditure. According to the estimation results, the elderly population would not support an increase in current expenditures composed mainly of personnel expenses at every educational stage but would support capital expenditures of junior high and high schools, which consists of construction costs mostly.
H72|Do government activities determine electricity consumption in Ghana? An empirical investigation|The paper investigates the long-run relationship between government activities and electricity consumption using annual data collected from world development indicator for a period of 1971 to 2011 in Ghana. The paper adopts the autoregressive distributed lag model of co integration for the estimation. The estimation reveals both short run and long-run relationships between government expenditure and electricity consumption. The findings suggest that government activities explain electricity consumption in Ghana for the period under discussion, and could be considered as a policy variable in the management of electricity consumption.
H72|On the political economy of state corporate tax reforms in the U.S|This paper discusses the political economy of U.S. state corporate tax reforms. Using a unique dataset of state effective corporate tax rates over the period 1969-2015, I observe that business tax changes are associated with tax competition, swings in economic cycles, and left-right political ideology. In contrast, long-term debt and budgetary pressures do not correlate with state corporate tax policies. Moreover, I document a regional heterogeneity and notice a slowdown in state tax changes after the Federal Reform Act of 1986. These findings matter for the empirics of corporate tax incidence, which is increasingly concerned with the endogeneity between tax reforms and other economic developments.
H72|The Financing of Local Government in the People’s Republic of China: Stimulus Loan Wanes and Shadow Banking Waxes|The People’s Republic of China (PRC)’s four-trillion-yuan stimulus package fueled by bank loans in 2009 has led to the rapid growth of shadow banking activities in the PRC after 2012. The local governments in the PRC financed the stimulus plan mainly through bank loans in 2009, and resorted to non-bank debt financing after 2012 given the mounting rollover pressure from bank debt coming due, a manifestation of the stimulus loan-hangover effect. Cross-sectionally, provinces with abnormally greater bank loan growth in 2009 experienced more Municipal Corporate Bonds issuance during 2012-2015, as well as more shadow banking activities including entrusted loans and wealth management products. We highlight the market forces behind the regulation changes on local government debt post 2012, together with the expedited reform on interest rate liberalization during that period.
H72|Natural Disasters, Public Spending, and Creative Destruction: A Case Study of the Philippines|Typhoons, floods, and other weather-related shocks can inflict suffering on local populations and create life-threatening conditions for the poor. Yet, natural disasters also present a development opportunity to upgrade capital stock, adopt new technologies, enhance the risk-resiliency of existing systems, and raise standards of living. This is akin to the “creative destruction” hypothesis coined by economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1943 to describe the process where innovation, learning, and growth promote advanced technologies as conventional technologies become outmoded. To test the hypothesis in the context of natural disasters, we look at the case of the Philippines—among the most vulnerable countries in the world to such disasters, especially typhoons. Using synthetic panel data regressions, we show that typhoon-affected households are more likely to fall into lower income levels, although disasters can also promote economic growth. Augmenting the household data with municipal fiscal data, we show some evidence of the creative destruction effect: Municipal governments in the Philippines helped mitigate the poverty impact by allocating more fiscal resources to build local resilience while also utilizing additional funds poured in by the national government for rehabilitation and reconstruction.
H72|Optymalizacja polityki finansowej samorządów|Dzięki modelowi optymalizacyjnemu polityki finansowej samorządów, zweryfikowane zostały hipotezy o wpływie wybranych czynników na optymalny poziom w relacji do dochodów bieżących: wydatków bieżących oraz inwestycyjnych. Potwierdzono hipotezę, że większa wartość infrastruktury powoduje zwiększenie wydatków bieżących samorządów. Pokazano także, iż wzrost: stopy deprecjacji infrastruktury, zadłużenia w relacji do dochodów bieżących i, w mniejszym stopniu, stopy współfinansowania inwestycji unijnych wpływa negatywnie na poziom wydatków bieżących w relacji do dochodów bieżących. Oddziaływanie stopy procentowej zaś okazało się być ujemne lub neutralne. Zwiększenie czynnika dyskontowego wywiera różny efekt na wydatki bieżące w zależności od okresu. Nieoczekiwany efekt zaobserwowano w odniesieniu do wskaźnika wydatków bieżących poniesionych przed rozpoczęciem modelowanego okresu. Wyższe przeszłe wydatki ograniczają przestrzeń na wydatki bieżące na początku badanego okresu, ale w kolejnym roku następuje efekt kompensacji, tj. uprzednie oszczędności umożliwiają większe wydatki w porównaniu ze scenariuszem bez oszczędności. Stwierdzono także, że dodatni wpływ na inwestycje zwykłe (tj. niewspółfinansowane ze środków unijnych) w relacji do dochodów bieżących ma wzrost stopy deprecjacji infrastruktury oraz czynnika dyskontowego. Potwierdzona została także hipoteza o ujemnym wpływie na inwestycje zwykłe w relacji do dochodów bieżących wzrostu: stopy procentowej, stopy zapadalności zadłużenia i wskaźnika infrastruktury. Pozytywnie zweryfikowano również hipotezę o ujemnym wpływie wzrostu limitu dochodów unijnych. W przypadku wskaźnika zadłużenia można także doszukać się efektu kompensacji - ujemny wpływ występuje tylko na początku okresu. Efekt ten występuje również w odniesieniu do wskaźnika inwestycji zwykłych w roli zmiennej objaśnianej i wskaźnika przeszłych wydatków bieżących jako zmiennej objaśniającej. Okazał się on nawet silniejszy niż w przypadku wydatków bieżących jako zmiennej objaśnianej. Optymalny poziom wydatków inwestycyjnych co do zasady maleje w czasie, co jest konsekwencją przyjętej funkcji użyteczności, która premiuje inwestycje poczynione we wcześniejszym okresie, gdyż poprawiona w ten sposób infrastruktura jest uwzględniana wielokrotnie w użyteczności.
H72|Political Turnover and the Performance of Local Public Enterprises|We study how political party turnover at the municipal level affects the economic performance of Italian Local Public Enterprises. To this end, we match data on municipal elections in Italy to the budget data of firms whose shares are owned by Italian municipalities. As political turnover and performance are likely to be jointly endogenous, we exploit the quasi-experimental nature of close electoral races to estimate the causal treatment effect. We find evidence that municipal party turnover disrupts investment and slows down productivity growth. At the same time, the probability of observing financial distress is larger. No significant effect can be established, on the other hand, in terms of profitability and employment growth. We link the effect of municipal party turnover to three mechanisms: first, the nature of close electoral races alters the incumbent party’s incentives to invest; second, turnover makes the appointment of new, less-experienced, board directors more likely; third, the new political leadership directly reduces the amount of resources transferred in order to signal its commitment to curb wasteful municipal expenditure. We finally set up a survival analysis, whose results show that municipal party turnover is associated to an increase in the likelihood to observe bankruptcy.
H72|Assessment of Government COFOG Expenditures in Selected EU Countries|The goal of the article is an assessment of government COFOG expenditure in selected EU countries in the period 1995-2016. Government expenditure and factors of their growth are crucial problem of many countries. In the context of the EU2020 strategy, supportive of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, pressure on public expenditure is in link with on-going fiscal consolidation and the legacy of the economic and financial crisis. The paper evaluates the government expenditure in compliance with the COFOG international standard. The results show that the expenditure composition differs across the EU countries, but it is also possible to identify some similarities for specific government COFOG functions, such as the large weight of social protection. The proportion of potentially growth-enhancing public expenditure, such as education, health care, R&D or public investment, affirms significant cross-country variation. Next, the article provides direct empirical evidence on cyclicality and the long-term and short-term relationship between government COFOG expenditure and output. The Johansen cointegration test and the Error Correction Model are applied for research. Findings confirm the long-term relationship between government expenditure and output but the short-term relationship is not confirmed due to a low statistical significance.
H72|Determinant of Income Inequality in Indonesia: Study Case 33 Provinces in 2011-2016|This study intends to determine whether factors of income inequality in Indonesia based on regional data. Economic growth, unemployment, and inflation represent macroeconomic factors, whereas regional expenditure is deemed as a factor of the fiscal side. In the term of the financial, the study used the share of tradable sector credit to the total credit of commercial bank. By applying, the fixed effect panel framework, the study concluded that the factors of the macroeconomic and credit impact on income inequality, while the regional expenditure is not significant. However, the study also found that the impact of economic growth on inequality is positive which is different from previous studies. This suggests that the impact of economic growth tend to serve more middle and upper-income groups than lower income. Furthermore, the regional expenditure is mainly dominated by the personnel expenditure that has limited impact on income inequality. In addition, the disbursement of capital budgets is relatively low for roads, irrigation, and networking.
H72|Does fiscal oversight matter?|A gradually introduced reform of local government accounting made it temporarily possible for municipalities in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia to avoid the effective control of their budget by the authorities in charge of overseeing local government budgets and enforcing the existing fiscal rules. Using this withdrawal of effective fiscal oversight, we identify the effects of fiscal restraints and their enforcement on fiscal outcomes. We find that the withdrawal of oversight has a significant and sizable effect on per capita debt of local governments that were previously constrained by fiscal oversight. Fiscal restraints are important, and oversight and enforcement are key requirements for their success.
H72|Zur strukturellen Finanzlage der Laender: eine aktuelle Auswertung und Methodenkritik|Seit Einfuehrung der neuen Schuldenregel hat sich die Finanzlage der deutschen Bundeslaender deutlich verbessert. Nach unseren Berechnungen mit dem Aggregierten Quotierungsverfahren konnten die meisten Laender ihre strukturellen Budgetdefizite abbauen und im Jahr 2017 schon 14 Laender strukturelle Budgetueberschuesse erzielen; lediglich das Saarland und Nordrhein-Westfalen wiesen strukturelle Defizite auf. Die „strukturelle“ Besserung überzeichnet indes die Konsolidierungsfortschritte, denn sie ist zum grossen Teil dem historisch niedrigen Zinsniveau zu verdanken, das zu erheblichen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst fuehrte. Da die Finanzierungskonditionen aber nicht dauerhaft so guenstig bleiben wie in den vergangenen Jahren, verdecken die Zinsersparnisse den bei vielen Laendern noch bestehenden Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir plaedieren daher dafuer, nur nachhaltige Einsparungen bei den Zinslasten als strukturelle Besserung zu klassifizieren und entwickeln ein Bereinigungsverfahren, das neben den Konjunktureinfluessen auch die Verzerrung durch das aeusserst niedrige Zinsniveau beachtet. Unsere Simulationen zeigen, dass nach einer Bereinigung um die nicht nachhaltigen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst nicht mehr 14, sondern nur neun Laender im Jahr 2017 einen strukturell mindestens ausgeglichenen Haushalt erzielt haben. Bei den verbleibenden sieben Laendern besteht teilweise noch erheblicher Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir zeigen darueber hinaus, dass die zur quantitativen Vergleichbarkeit der Laenderfinanzen in der Regel verwandten Einwohner-Indikatoren wesentliche Strukturunterschiede zwischen den Laendern unberuecksichtigt lassen und damit zu irrefuehrenden Schlussfolgerungen fuehren koennen. Wir empfehlen daher, bei Laendervergleichen Kennzahlen zu verwenden, die strukturelle Unterschiede zwischen den Laendern bei Erwerbstaetigkeit und Produktivitaet beachten.
H72|Regional Transfer Multipliers|A series of discontinuities in the allocation mechanism of federal transfers to municipal governments in Brazil allow us to identify the causal effect of public spending on local labor markets, using a 'fuzzy' Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD). Our estimates imply a cost per job of about 8,000 US dollars per year and a local income multiplier around two. The effect comes mostly from employment in services and is more pronounced among less financially developed municipalities.
H72|The Price of a Vote: Evidence from France, 1993-2014|What is the price of a vote? This paper investigates this consequential controversy by analyzing a new comprehensive dataset of all French municipal and legislative elections over the 1993-2014 period. We begin by documenting the evolution of campaign finance in France, and show that both the amount and sources of campaign contributions vary widely from one candidate to another, in particular depending on their political party. We then turn to the empirical analysis and tackle a number of empirical challenges. First, we rely on recent methodological innovations to handle the special characteristics of multiparty data. Second, to overcome the endogenous nature of campaign spending, we propose a new instrument based on a change in legislation. We find that an increase in spending per voter consistently increases a candidate's vote share both for municipal and legislative elections, and that the effect is heterogeneous depending on the parties and on the sources of campaign funding. According to our estimations, the price of a vote is about 6 euros for the legislative elections, and 32 euros for the municipal ones. Simulations show that small changes in spending patterns and caps can have a large impact on electoral outcomes and seats. Our results suggest that political finance needs to be tightly regulated.
H72|Churning in thick labor markets. Evidence of heterogeneous responses along the skill and experience gradients|Using a very large comprehensive matched employer-employee panel of the Norwegian workforce (19 million observations), I find a higher likelihood of job change across sectors and occupations, namely labor churning, in populous areas. Further investigation shows that this result is driven by high skilled groups, assumed to have more transferable skills. Moreover, educated urban workers are more likely to switch to sectors and occupations that they have prior experience with and that are similar in the use of human capital. Together, these novel results complement previous research by illuminating how the tradeoff between better labor matching and accumulating specific skills affect churning decisions for heterogeneous workers.
H72|Local governments, in-kind transfers, and economic inequality|We examine how in-kind transfers provided by local governments affect economic inequality. The allocation of in-kind transfers to households and the adjustment for differences in needs are derived from a model of local government spending behavior. The model distinguishes between fixed and variable costs in production as well as mandatory programmatic spending components versus discretionary spending on different service sectors and target groups. To estimate the model, we combine Norwegian data from municipal accounts and administrative registers for the period 1982- 2013. We find that economic inequality is considerably lower when taking in-kind transfers into account. While the poor benefit from receiving a relatively large share of public services, the equalizing effect of in-kind transfers tends to be smaller than the equalizing contribution from public cash transfers. When examining the time trends in inequality, we find that local governments attenuated the growth in cash income inequality by re-allocating in-kind transfers to low-income families. This reduction in inequality is mostly due to changes in spending priorities across service sectors and target groups, whilst the contribution from re-allocation of resources across municipalities is much smaller.
H72|Organised Crime, Captured Politicians and the Allocation of Public Resources|What is the impact of organised crime on the allocation of public resources and on tax collection? This paper studies the consequences of collusion between members of criminal organisations and politicians in Italian local governments. In order to capture the presence of organised crime, we exploit the staggered enforcement of a national law allowing for dissolution of a municipal government upon evidence of collusion between elected officials and the mafia. We measure the consequences of this collusion by using newly collected data on public spending, local taxes and elected politicians at the local level. Differences-in-differences estimates reveal that infiltrated local governments not only spend more on average on construction and waste management and less on police enforcement, but also collect fewer fiscal revenues. In addition, we uncover key elements of local elections associated with mafia-government collusion. In particular, Regression Discontinuity estimates show that infiltration is more likely to occur when right-wing parties win local elections.
H72|Lo stock di capitale comunale: indicazioni per le politiche di intervento infrastrutturale di Regione Lombardia|Partendo dalle spese per investimento dei comuni lombardi nel periodo 2000-2015 e utilizzando il metodo dellâ€™inventario permanente si Ã¨ ricostruito lo stock di capitale pubblico a livello comunale per la regione Lombardia. Si mostra come alcune variabili come la popolazione e lâ€™altitudine influiscano sullo stock di infrastrutture esistente. Per meglio comprendere le determinanti dello stock di infrastrutture pro-capite comunale, si Ã¨ quindi provveduto ad effettuare una stima di questâ€™ultimo utilizzando la tecnica di regressione ai minimi quadrati. Utilizzando i coefficienti di questa regressione si Ã¨ giunti alla definizione di una formula che permette di distribuire trasferimenti in conto capitale, tenendo conto dello stock di infrastrutture in essere. Infine si Ã¨ confrontata lâ€™effettiva distribuzione degli spazi finanziari, concessi da Regione Lombardia ai sensi della legge n. 243/2012, con una distribuzione teorica derivante dallâ€™applicazione del modello delle infrastrutture standard.
H72|Public sector efficiency in Europe: Long-run trends, recent developments and determinants|This paper investigates the efficiency of the public sector in a sense of public performance and expenditures. For 23 European countries and for the period between 1995 and 2015 we construct a measure of public sector performance that consist of nine distinct indices for each area of public policy, such as administration, health education, economic performance, security and infrastructure. We use several efficiency techniques (FDH, order-m) and investigate input- and output-oriented efficiency of the public sector. We find that countries with small public sectors tend to be more efficient no matter which efficiency techniques we use. Because of the relatively long time span of our data, our study contributes to the literature by analyzing the effect of the financial crisis on the efficiency of the public sector in European countries. We show that after the crisis, the public sector efficiency increased especially in countries with small public sectors, while it stayed constant or worsened in countries with big public sectors. Finally, we analyze in more depth the impact of fiscal decentralization and fiscal rules on the public sector efficiency. We conclude that while decentralization is fostering efficiency, fiscal rules do not have any effect. Moreover, fiscal rules combined with decentralization may harm efficiency, consistently with the ratchet effect.
H72|Modeling Fiscal Sustainability in Dynamic Macro-Panels with Heterogeneous Effects: Evidence from German Federal States|In this paper, we extend Henning Bohn’s (2008) fiscal sustainability test by allowing for slope heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence (CD). In particular, our econometric approach is the first that allows fiscal reaction functions (FRF) to capture unobserved heterogeneous effects from business and fiscal policy cycles. We apply this econometric approach to sub-national public finance data of the German Laender between 1950 and 2015 and find that their fiscal policy only partly meets fiscal sustainability criteria. According to our results, politicians have significantly reacted to increasing debt levels by increasing budget surpluses since 1991. However, time-series evidence for longer periods does not indicate a significant and positive reaction to increasing debt levels in the West German Laender panel.
H72|Fiscal disparity, institutions and asymmetric yardstick competition|Fiscal disparity leads to a yardstick bias, in that incumbents in fiscally-rich jurisdictions can provide more public goods, extract more rents and yet have a higher probability to be reelected. This study further emphasizes disparity among jurisdictions, not only in terms of fiscal resources but also of costs of rent appropriation. In a setting in which jurisdictions with a higher fiscal capacity have lower costs of rent appropriation whilst those with a lower fiscal capacity have higher costs of rent appropriation, the difference in costs of rent appropriation might moderate the bias caused by the fiscal disparity.
H72|Voting with your wallet? Municipal budget policy and election results|In this paper, the authors examine the impact of municipal budget policy on the percentage of votes for the incumbent majority parties in subsequent elections. They contribute to the academic literature by examining the combined influence of taxes, expenditures and debt. Based on data for Flanders (Belgium) between 1994 and 2012, they find no significant association between these budget variables and the actual election results.
H72|Equalization transfers and the pattern of municipal spending: An investigation of the flypaper effect in Germany|"We investigate how lump-sum equalization transfers affect expenditures and taxes in the municipalities of the largest German state North Rhine-Westphalia. In general, those general-purpose transfers cannot be treated as exogenous variables. Thus, for the identification of causal effects, two exogenous adjustments in the transfer allocation formula are used as instrumental variables. Findings suggest the existence of the ""flypaper effect"" - municipalities use transfers to increase expenditures but do not reduce tax rates. Extra money from transfers is mainly used to finance social expenditures and public facilities. A set of robustness checks, including a spatial dependence model, confirm the results."
H72|Optimal Public Investment in Economic Centers and the Periphery|We analyze productivity enhancing public expenditure in a spatial economic model with labor mobility, firm-specific increasing returns to scale, and transport costs. Building on Krugman (1991), Fujita, Krugman and Venables (1999) and Redding (2016), we compare optimal investment and tax policies of fiscally autonomous regions to those of a benevolent central planer. We find transport costs and the size of scale effects to influence optimal tax and spending rates under both regimes. For sufficiently low transport costs and low substitutability between manufactured goods, regional fiscal autonomy leads to underinvestment: The lower the transport costs, the lower the local investment, and the higher the potential welfare gain through centralized policies. Our results challenge the view that local public goods should be financed entirely by local governments. They also help explain the recent decline of public investment at the municipal level in fiscally decentralized countries like Germany.
H72|Tax Cuts Starve the Beast! Evidence from Germany|This paper empirically evaluates how fiscal policy reacts to changes in the government's fiscal situation. Utilizing panel data from the German states covering the period from 1992 to 2011, we assess to what extent exogenous changes in tax revenues affect total public revenues, aggregate public expenditure as well as specific sub-categories of government spending. Applying the narrative approach pioneered by Romer and Romer (2010), we construct a measure of exogenous tax shocks, allowing us to identify the causal effect of tax changes on fiscal policy. Our findings indicate that tax changes trigger expenditure adjustments into the same direction after 2 to 3 years, specifically with respect to spending on governmental administration, health expenditures and spending on infrastructure.

Cada capítulo contiene dos secciones. La primera ha sido llamada “síntesis de política”, donde se describe brevemente la investigación para una audiencia no especializada en el tópico tratado y se enfatiza en pautas y recomendaciones para políticas públicas. La segunda se constituye en el “estudio completo” propiamente dicho.
H72|The Causal Effect of Infrastructure Investments on Income Inequality: Evidence from US States|Through utilizing US state-level data at annual frequency from 1976 to 2008, this paper documents a causal effect of infrastructure investments, specifically public spending on highways, on income inequality. The number of seats in the US House of Representatives Committee On Appropriations serves as a valid instrument to identify quasi-random variations in state-level spending on highways. When a given state gains an additional committee member, which is rather exogenous, new federal grants are allocated to that state, resulting in the state government slashing its investment expenditures on highways. In other words, a crowding-out effect of federal funding for state investment in highways is at play. The main contribution of this paper is to show that such committee-driven cuts in spending on highways cause an increase in income inequality within a two-year horizon. In addition, we show that wages paid for construction jobs correlate positively and strongly with spending on highways at the state level. This further provides suggestive evidence that the construction sector plays an important role in the transmission channel from a rise in state spending on highways to a reduction in income inequality.
H72|Spatial effects on local government efficiency|Little attention has been paid to the spatial pattern in local governments' efficiency. This paper intends to fill this gap by conducting an empirical analysis on a sample of 246 Italian municipalities over the decade 1998-2008. The efficiency of the municipal government is measured in terms of the speed of payments for different categories of public spending. Estimation results reveal the presence of spatial interdependence in the speed of payments among the geographically close municipalities, with a greater magnitude for the speed of current outlays. Thus, municipalities mimic the speed with which public spending is carried out by their neighbors.
H72|The global crisis and intergovernmental relations: Revisiting the centralisation-decentralisation debate ten years on|There is a growing empirical literature on the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on intergovernmental relations. This paper contributes to this literature by focusing on conventional budgetary aggregates and institutional indicators of subnational authority in policymaking and fiscal-financial management. The empirical analysis is carried out for a large set of advanced and emerging-market/developing economies between 1990 and 2015 and shows that the crisis has been associated with an increase in the subnational shares of general government spending and revenue. The findings for subnational authority over policy and fiscal-financial management are more nuanced and suggest that increases in government indebtedness (spending) since the crisis have been associated with greater (weaker) subnational authority. It is possible that the need to deliver debt reductions through medium-term fiscal consolidation calls for greater intergovernmental coordination, which enhances the bargaining power of the subnational jurisdictions to broaden their prerogatives in fiscal matters and influence national policymaking.
H72|Fiscal stability during the great recesion: Putting decentralization design to the test|There is a longstanding debate in the economics literature on whether fiscally decentralized countries are inherently more fiscally unstable. The Great Recession provides a fertile testing ground for analyzing how the degree of decentralization does actually affect countries’ ability to implement fiscal stabilization policies in response to macroeconomic shocks. We provide an empirical analysis aiming at disentangling the roles played by decentralization design itself and several recently introduced budgetary institutions such as subnational borrowing rules and fiscal responsibility laws on country’s fiscal stability. We use OECD countries’ data since 1995, which includes both a boom period of worldwide economic growth and the Great Recession. Our main finding is that well-designed decentralized systems are not destabilizing. But, in addition, sub-national fiscal and borrowing rules should be at work to improve the overall fiscal stability performance of decentralized countries.
H72|Is there an optimal size for local governments? A spatial panel data model approach|The paper presents a framework for determining the optimal size of local jurisdictions. To that aim, we first develop a theoretical model of cost eficiency that takes into account spatial interactions and spillover effects among neighbouring jurisdictions. The model solution leads to a Spatial Durbin panel data specification of local spending as a non-linear function of population size. The model is tested using local data over the 2003-2011 period for two aggregate (total and current) and four disaggregate measures of spending. The empirical findings suggest a U-shaped relationship between population size and the costs of providing public services that varies depending on (i) the public service provided and (ii) the geographical heterogeneity of the territory.
H72|Decentralization and governance in Europe: Evidence from different expenditure components|In this article, we consider the impact of fiscal decentralization on government quality by way of disaggregated measures of the former. Specifically, we break down fiscal decentralization into sub-central expenditure on public procurement and compensation of public sector employees. We find that decentralizing public procurement is bad for government performance while the decentralization of public sector wages improves governance. We relate the negative effect to the rent-seeking activity of interest groups and the positive effect to the informational advantage of sub-central provision. Moreover, we explore the impact of the Great Recession on our results and find that it is associated with stronger negative and positive effects of decentralization on governance, something which is consistent with the observed increased in the degree of decentralization since 2007.
H72|Monitoring the Spanish economy from a regional perspective: main elements of analysis|In highly decentralized countries the subnational dimension of economic developments acquires particular relevance, given the existence of potential spillover effects across jurisdictions or the existence of asymmetric impacts of national-wide macroeconomic shocks. At the same time, though, the analysis of sub-national macroeconomic and public finance short-term developments tend to be restricted in many countries due to data limitations. Against this backdrop, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the available data for monitoring macroeconomic and public finance developments at the regional level in Spain, and to present some examples of its practical use in real time. After a thoroughly review of the publicly available information, we identify two key informational gaps in this area of conjunctural analysis, namely: (i) the lack of homogeneous and official quarterly measures of aggregate regional economic activity (in particular, real GDP), and (ii) the limited sample size of time series pertaining to government budgetary developments at the regional level.
H72|Is there strength in unity? Some preliminary evidence on inter-municipal cooperation in Italy|This paper focuses on municipal unions, the most structured form of inter-municipal cooperation in Italy. Using information from multiple sources, we have built up an administrative database covering more than 500 municipal unions over the period 1998-2015. By cross-checking the information on the municipalities participating in each union with the figures from their financial statements, we have been able to follow the trend in their expenditure both before and after joining the union, acknowledging that time is needed for the effects of the cooperation to manifest themselves. We have replicated this analysis for single municipal functions in order to detect potential heterogeneity in the resulting economies of scale. The results show that belonging to a union has led to a reduction in expenditure only for some municipal functions (such as general administration, local police, roads and traffic) and over a certain time period. The main contribution of our work is that we have studied the effects of inter-municipal cooperation from a temporal perspective largely unexplored in previous studies of the Italian case.
H72|Las finanzas públicas territoriales en Colombia: dos décadas de cambios|El panorama de las finanzas de las entidades territoriales en Colombia ha cambiado sustancialmente en los últimos años. Su dinámica ha estado estrechamente relacionada con la descentralización y las normas que la regulan. Este documento tiene el objetivo de presentar la evolución de las principales cuentas de los gobiernos subnacionales durante las dos décadas entre 1996 y 2015. El análisis se realizó por tipo de entidad territorial y por regiones. Los resultados muestran que el proceso descentralizador ha fortalecido las finanzas de municipios y departamentos, especialmente para los primeros a causa de la mayor fortaleza tributaria que han dejado las reformas administrativas y la coyuntura económica nacional. En el ámbito regional se evidencian tendencias similares pero con significativas disparidades, con mayor desventaja para la periferia. Por otro lado, aunque la dependencia de las transferencias continua alta, no hay evidencias de una relación negativa entre el crecimiento de las transferencias y las regalías y los ingresos propios de las los gobiernos subnacionales. *******ABSTRACT: The context of the Colombian subnational finances have changed during the last years. These changes have been closely related to fiscal decentralization and its regulatory standards. The main objective of this paper is to show the evolution of the subnational governments’ main financial accounts between 1996 and 2015. The analysis is carried out by type of territorial entity and also by regions. Results show that decentralization has actually strengthen municipalities and departments’ finances, especially the former because of the higher tax robustness given by administrative reforms and the national economic situation. At regional level, we found similar trends but significant disparities, with the highest in peripheral regions. On the other hand, even when transfers’ dependency is still high, it is also true that there is no evidence of a negative relationship between transfers and royalties’ growth and the growth of the subnational governments’ own revenues.
H72|Municipal Fiscal Health in Colombian Main Cities|Local governments are primary providers of basic services to their communities, and any decision they make will echo in the economy as a whole. That is why healthy and sustainable local public finances should be a national priority. With the purpose of contributing to the discussion on subnational fiscal health, a recently developed approach by Slack (2017) is applied to the 23 main Colombian cities. After preparing a brief and general profile of each city, five dimensions are analyzed in-depth: external, financial, tax and revenue, debt, and infrastructure. Results highlight the high complexity of what making a fiscal health diagnosis of local governments implies. Colombian cities do not seem to face profound fiscal health issues. Nevertheless, there is evidence of regional differences, where coastal lagged behind Caribbean and Pacific cities seem to suffer of structural and long-term weaknesses. On the other hand, inner Eastern and Central cities’ issues are more related to cash-flows and shortterm sustainability. **** RESUMEN: Los gobiernos locales son los principales proveedores de los servicios básicos en sus comunidades y, por tanto, cualquier decisión que adopten se verá reflejada en la economía como un todo. Esta es la razón por la que finanzas públicas locales sostenibles y saludables deberían ser una prioridad nacional. Con el propósito de contribuir a la discusión sobre salud fiscal subnacional, en este documento se aplica, para las principales ciudades de Colombia, la metodología reciente de Slack (2017) en la construcción de indicadores de salud fiscal. Luego de preparer un perfil general de cada una de las ciudades, se analizan más detalladamente el comportamiento de indicadores en cinco dimensiones: externa, financiera, impuestos e ingresos, deuda, e infraestructura. Los resultados dejan en evidencia la alta complejidad que implica el análisis y diagnóstico sobre salud fiscal de los gobiernos locales. Las ciudades colombianas no parecen enfrentar, en general, profundos problemas de salud fiscal. Sin embargo, existe evidencia de patrones regionales, en donde las ciudades pertenecientes a las regiones Pacífica y Caribe parecen mostrar fragilidad estructural de largo plazo. Por otro lado, los desafíos de las regiones del interior, Oriental y Central en particular, están más relacionadas con los flujos de caja y la sostenibilidad de corto plazo.
H72|Fiscal incentives, competition, and investment in China|This paper explores how fiscal incentives offered to local governments in China affect investment rates in their jurisdictions. Theoretically, we build a simple fiscal competition model to establish the linkage between local fiscal incentives and expenditure policy and consequently, capital movement. The key prediction of the model, borne out by data from Chinese provinces spanning 2004–2013, is that an increase in the local corporate income tax-sharing ratio, which proxies fiscal incentives offered to local governments, motivates local governments to compete for capital investment through increased public expenditures. Our results contribute to the fiscal federalism literature by showing that local fiscal incentives significantly shape policy choices and local economic performance. In addition, by exploring fiscal incentives offered to local governments, we offer a novel explanation for the unusually high investment rate in China that has been sustained over a prolonged period of time.

H72|Ideologia partidária e crise fiscal dos estados : o caso de Minas Gerais|This papers aims at investigating the nexus between party ideology and public expenditures in the state of Minas Gerais (Brazil). Particularly, we assess if the current fiscal deficit deterioration has to do with the take over of a left-wing party in the state since 2015. To this end, we compare revenue and expenses dynamics, focusing on the results of the last triennum, when a left-wing political party (PT) replaced a more centre one (PSDB). The results show that the PT government, although further to the left of the political spectrum, has been struggling to adjust public accounts, albeit unsuccessfully.
H72|Modeling fiscal sustainability in dynamic macro-panels with heterogeneous effects: Evidence from German federal states|In this paper, we extend Henning Bohn's (2008) fiscal sustainability test by allowing for slope heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence (CD). In particular, our econometric approach is the first that allows fiscal reaction functions (FRF) to capture unobserved heterogeneous effects from business and fiscal policy cycles. We apply this econometric approach to sub-national public finance data of the German Laender between 1950 and 2015 and find that their fiscal policy only partly meets fiscal sustainability criteria. According to our results, politicians have significantly reacted to increasing debt levels by increasing budget surpluses since 1991. However, time-series evidence for longer periods does not indicate a significant and positive reaction to increasing debt levels in the West German Laender panel.
H72|The Role of Volunteers in German Refugee Crisis and their Contribution to the Local Government Expenditure|This study deals with a specific volunteering aspect revealed in the German refugee crisis 2015/16. German federalism prescribing interjurisdictional assignments of tasks for designing, financing and implementing services for refugees and their geographic distribution have made municipalities and cities primarily responsible for solving problems of refugees’ accommodation, integration and health care. Based on a survey recently carried out in the district of Erding, it firstly demonstrates distinctive characteristics of the individual volunteers engaged in such related local activities (gender and age; income structure; donation types; working hours), followed by an attempt to measure economic values of volunteering. Despite some methodological weaknesses, this study highlights the monetary significance of volunteers’ hidden contribution to overcoming the crisis and the relatively huge scope of possible savings in local expenditure, compared to an assumed situation if such voluntary activities were fully substituted by those of full-time civil servants.
H72|Analyzing the Efficiency of County Road Provision – Evidence from Eastern German Counties|This study analyzes the efficiency of the road provision of the local governments of eastern German counties using data envelopment analysis. The provision of roads is a costly public service, which makes an efficiency analysis in this field an interesting subject. I enhance the previous literature by first, examining the differences in the efficiency of eastern German counties; I consider the age of the foundations of roads, which previous studies have not considered due to data limitations. Second, I use a unique dataset on road quality for my efficiency analysis and show that efficiency levels differ from studies that apply proxies, such as the number of accidents, to analyze the quality of roads. These findings indicate there is a great need to develop suitable proxy variables to describe government services. Additional, I show that the correlations between efficiency levels and county characteristics vary greatly depending on the quality indicator used.
H72|Las finanzas públicas territoriales en Colombia: dos décadas de cambios|El panorama de las finanzas de las entidades territoriales en Colombia ha cambiado sustancialmente en los últimos años. Su dinámica ha estado estrechamente relacionada con la descentralización y las normas que la regulan. Este documento tiene el objetivo de presentar la evolución de las principales cuentas de los gobiernos subnacionales durante las dos décadas entre 1996 y 2015. El análisis se realizó por tipo de entidad territorial y por regiones. Los resultados muestran que el proceso descentralizador ha fortalecido las finanzas de municipios y departamentos, especialmente para los primeros a causa de la mayor fortaleza tributaria que han dejado las reformas administrativas y la coyuntura económica nacional. En el ámbito regional se evidencian tendencias similares pero con significativas disparidades, con mayor desventaja para la periferia. Por otro lado, aunque la dependencia de las transferencias continua alta, no hay evidencias de una relación negativa entre el crecimiento de las transferencias y las regalías y los ingresos propios de las los gobiernos subnacionales. *******ABSTRACT: The context of the Colombian subnational finances have changed during the last years. These changes have been closely related to fiscal decentralization and its regulatory standards. The main objective of this paper is to show the evolution of the subnational governments’ main financial accounts between 1996 and 2015. The analysis is carried out by type of territorial entity and also by regions. Results show that decentralization has actually strengthen municipalities and departments’ finances, especially the former because of the higher tax robustness given by administrative reforms and the national economic situation. At regional level, we found similar trends but significant disparities, with the highest in peripheral regions. On the other hand, even when transfers’ dependency is still high, it is also true that there is no evidence of a negative relationship between transfers and royalties’ growth and the growth of the subnational governments’ own revenues.
H72|Municipal Fiscal Health in Colombian Main Cities|Local governments are primary providers of basic services to their communities, and any decision they make will echo in the economy as a whole. That is why healthy and sustainable local public finances should be a national priority. With the purpose of contributing to the discussion on subnational fiscal health, a recently developed approach by Slack (2017) is applied to the 23 main Colombian cities. After preparing a brief and general profile of each city, five dimensions are analyzed in-depth: external, financial, tax and revenue, debt, and infrastructure. Results highlight the high complexity of what making a fiscal health diagnosis of local governments implies. Colombian cities do not seem to face profound fiscal health issues. Nevertheless, there is evidence of regional differences, where coastal lagged behind Caribbean and Pacific cities seem to suffer of structural and long-term weaknesses. On the other hand, inner Eastern and Central cities’ issues are more related to cash-flows and shortterm sustainability. **** RESUMEN: Los gobiernos locales son los principales proveedores de los servicios básicos en sus comunidades y, por tanto, cualquier decisión que adopten se verá reflejada en la economía como un todo. Esta es la razón por la que finanzas públicas locales sostenibles y saludables deberían ser una prioridad nacional. Con el propósito de contribuir a la discusión sobre salud fiscal subnacional, en este documento se aplica, para las principales ciudades de Colombia, la metodología reciente de Slack (2017) en la construcción de indicadores de salud fiscal. Luego de preparer un perfil general de cada una de las ciudades, se analizan más detalladamente el comportamiento de indicadores en cinco dimensiones: externa, financiera, impuestos e ingresos, deuda, e infraestructura. Los resultados dejan en evidencia la alta complejidad que implica el análisis y diagnóstico sobre salud fiscal de los gobiernos locales. Las ciudades colombianas no parecen enfrentar, en general, profundos problemas de salud fiscal. Sin embargo, existe evidencia de patrones regionales, en donde las ciudades pertenecientes a las regiones Pacífica y Caribe parecen mostrar fragilidad estructural de largo plazo. Por otro lado, los desafíos de las regiones del interior, Oriental y Central en particular, están más relacionadas con los flujos de caja y la sostenibilidad de corto plazo.
H72|Political Openness and Armed Conflict: Evidence from Local Councils in Colombia|In this paper, I empirically investigate how openness of political institutions to diverse representation can impact conflict-related violence. By exploiting plausibly exogenous variations in the number of councillors in Colombian municipalities, I develop two sets of results. First, regression discontinuity estimates show that larger municipal councils have a considerably greater number of political parties with at least one elected representative. I interpret this result as evidence that larger municipal councils are more open to political participation by more groups in society. The estimates also reveal that smaller parties are the main bene ciaries of this greater political openness. Second, regression discontinuity estimates show that political openness substantially decreases conflict-related violence, namely the killing of civilian non-combatants. By exploiting plausibly exogenous variations in local election results, I show that the lower level of political violence stems from greater participation by parties with close links to armed groups. Using data about the types of violence employed by these groups, the provision of local public goods, scal outcomes and coca cultivation, I argue that armed violence has decreased not because of power-sharing arrangements between the armed groups linked to the parties with more political representation, but rather because armed groups with less political power and visibility are deterred from initiating certain types of violence.
H72|Justicia y gasto público|Este estudio realiza una revisión general del gasto asociado a la justicia en Colombia en las siguientes tres dimensiones: i) Tamaño y evolución, eficiencia, efectividad y equidad del gasto orientado a la administración de justicia y las cárceles en el país, ii) El impacto en las finanzas públicas de decisiones de los jueces y de las altas cortes, y iii) Tamaño y evolución del gasto publico orientado a cumplir con las obligaciones financieras derivadas de demandas falladas en contra del Estado. El alcance del estudio es limitado y consiste en ilustrar estas tres dimensiones de la relación entre gasto público y justicia. En consecuencia, a partir de los resultados, el estudio sólo pretende recopilar algunas recomendaciones recientes y esbozar otras que surgen de los resultados del trabajo.

H72|Conflict externalization and the quest for peace: theory and case evidence from Colombia|"I study the relationship between the likelihood of a violent domestic conflict and the risk that such a conflict externalizes"" (i.e. spreads to another country by becomingan international dispute). I consider a situation in which a domestic con ict between a government and a rebel group externalizes. I show that the risk of externalization increases the likelihood of a peaceful outcome, but only if the government is suficiently powerful relative to the rebels, and if the risk of externalization is suficiently high. I show how this model helps to understand the recent and successful peace process between the Colombian government and the country's most powerful rebel group, the FARC, that ended 52 years of armed conflict."

H72|The Price of a Vote: Evidence from France, 1993-2014|What is the price of a vote? This paper investigates this consequential controversy by analyzing a new comprehensive dataset of all French municipal and legislative elections over the 1993-2014 period. We begin by documenting the evolution of campaign finance in France, and show that both the amount and sources of campaign contributions vary widely from one candidate to another, in particular depending on their political party. We then turn to the empirical analysis and tackle a number of empirical challenges. First, we rely on recent methodological innovations to handle the special characteristics of multiparty data. Second, to overcome the endogenous nature of campaign spending, we propose a new instrument based on a change in legislation. We find that an increase in spending per voter consistently increases a candidate's vote share both for municipal and legislative elections, and that the effect is heterogeneous depending on the parties and on the sources of campaign funding. According to our estimations, the price of a vote is about 6 euros for the legislative elections, and 32 euros for the municipal ones. Simulations show that small changes in spending patterns and caps can have a large impact on electoral outcomes and seats. Our results suggest that political finance needs to be tightly regulated.
H72|Regional Transfer Multipliers|A series of discontinuities in the allocation mechanism of federal transfers to municipal governments in Brazil allow us to identify the causal effect of public spending on local labor markets, using a â€˜fuzzyâ€™ Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD). Our estimates imply a cost per job of about 8,000 US dollars per year and a local income multiplier around two. The effect comes mostly from employment in the retail, education and services sectors and is more pronounced among smaller municipalities in the North, with lower income and lower bank penetration.
H72|Can Wealth Explain Neighborhood Sorting by Race and Income?|Why do high-income blacks live in neighborhoods with characteristics similar to those of low-income whites? One plausible explanation is wealth, since homeownership requires some wealth, and black households hold less wealth than white households at all levels of income. We present evidence against this hypothesis by showing that wealth does not predict sorting into neighborhood quality once race and income are taken into account. An alternative explanation is that the scarcity of high-quality black neighborhoods increases the cost of living in a high-quality neighborhood for black households with even weak race preferences. We present evidence in favor of this hypothesis by showing that sorting into neighborhood racial composition is similar across wealth levels conditional on race and income.
H72|To the ones in need or the ones you need? The Political Economy of Central Discretionary Grants − Empirical Evidence from Indonesia|We analyze the allocation of discretionary grants from the central government to local governments in Indonesia. Using OLS and Fixed Effects models on an unbalanced panel data set for more than 400 Indonesian districts covering the period 2005-2013, we investigate whether the allocation of the grants is determined by the need of a district, by political alignment of the central government with the local district heads, or by reelection motives of the incumbent president. We find that grant allocations are not determined by need characteristics and that political considerations matter significantly. Districts with low support for the president received significantly more than the core supporting districts, especially in the year of national elections. This effect is limited to the first term of the president. In the second term, after which reelection is impossible, political considerations were largely absent. This pattern is consistent with the view that the incumbent president considers discretionary grants as an instrument to increase reelection probabilities. Unlike the evidence for most countries, we find no effect for political party alignment with local district heads. Our results are robust to the inclusion of a number of other variables capturing competing motives.
H72|Local taxation and tax base mobility: Evidence from a business tax reform in France|This paper investigates the impact of tax base mobility on local taxation. We first develop a theoretical model in order to examine the connection between local business property taxation and tax base mobility within a metropolitan area. We find that decreasing capital intensity in the tax base increases the business property tax rates unambiguously. We then test this result using a French reform, which changes the composition of the main local business tax base in 2010. Estimations using Difference-in-Differences show that the reduction in the mobility of the tax base indeed results in higher business property tax rates. Housing tax rates were not affected by the reform.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H72|Decentralization and Governance in Europe: Evidence from Different Expenditure Components|In this article, we consider the impact of fiscal decentralization on government quality by way of disaggregated measures of the former. Specifically, we break down fiscal decentralization into sub-central expenditure on public procurement and compensation of public sector employees. We find that decentralizing public procurement is bad for government performance while the decentralization of public sector wages improves governance. We relate the negative effect to the rent-seeking activity of interest groups and the positive effect to the informational advantage of sub-central provision. Moreover, we explore the impact of the Great Recession on our results and find that it is associated with stronger negative and positive effects of decentralization on governance, something which is consistent with the observed increased in the degree of decentralization since 2007.
H72|The Global Crisis and Intergovernmental Relations: Revisiting the Centralisation-Decentralisation Debate Ten Years On|There is a growing empirical literature on the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on intergovernmental relations. This paper contributes to this literature by focusing on conventional budgetary aggregates and institutional indicators of subnational authority in policymaking and fiscal-financial management. The empirical analysis is carried out for a large set of advanced and emerging-market/developing economies between 1990 and 2015 and shows that the crisis has been associated with an increase in the subnational shares of general government spending and revenue. The findings for subnational authority over policy and fiscal-financial management are more nuanced and suggest that increases in government indebtedness (spending) since the crisis have been associated with greater (weaker) subnational authority. It is possible that the need to deliver debt reductions through medium-term fiscal consolidation calls for greater intergovernmental coordination, which enhances the bargaining power of the subnational jurisdictions to broaden their prerogatives in fiscal matters and influence national policymaking.
H72|Fiscal Stability during the Great Recession: Putting Decentralization Design to the Test|There is a longstanding debate in the economics literature on whether fiscally decentralized countries are inherently more fiscally unstable. The Great Recession provides a fertile testing ground for analyzing how the degree of decentralization does actually affect countries’ ability to implement fiscal stabilization policies in response to macroeconomic shocks. We provide an empirical analysis aiming at disentangling the roles played by decentralization design itself and several recently introduced budgetary institutions such as subnational borrowing rules and fiscal responsibility laws on country’s fiscal stability. We use OECD countries’ data since 1995, which includes both a boom period of worldwide economic growth and the Great Recession. Our main finding is that well-designed decentralized systems are not destabilizing. But, in addition, sub-national fiscal and borrowing rules should be at work to improve the overall fiscal stability performance of decentralized countries.Length: 29 pages
H72|Is there an Optimal Size for Local Governments? A Spatial Panel Data Model Approach|The paper presents a framework for determining the optimal size of local jurisdictions. To that aim, we first develop a theoretical model of cost efficiency that takes into account spatial interactions and spillover effects among neighbouring jurisdictions. The model solution leads to a Spatial Durbin panel data specification of local spending as a non-linear function of population size. The model is tested using local data over the 2003-2011 period for two aggregate (total and current) and four disaggregate measures of spending. The empirical findings suggest a U-shaped relationship between population size and the costs of providing public services that varies depending on (i) the public service provided and (ii) the geographical heterogeneity of the territory.
H72|Fiscal decentralisation and the distributive incidence of the great recession|We argue that fiscal decentralisation is one important explanation for variation in distributive outcomes following the Great Recession. Using a difference in differences approach, we examine how fiscal decentralisation mediated the link between spatial distribution, redistributive effort, and interpersonal inequality in 21 OECD cases in the years following the Great Recession. We find that fiscally decentralised nations saw increased interpersonal inequality and lower redistribution, but lower inter-regional inequality. We attribute these results to the weaker redistributive mechanisms in fiscally decentralized nations, which increased interpersonal inequality while preserving market-driven productivity declines in high productivity areas that temporary increased regional convergence.
H72|Private Sector Policymaking|Candidates often tout their private sector experience when running for public office. But do businessperson politicians actually govern differently? This paper argues that given their preferences and managerial expertise, businesspeople in office will adopt policies favorable to the business community and improve government efficiency. To test these claims, I collect data on over 33,000 Russian mayors and legislators and investigate policy outcomes using detailed municipal budgets and over a million procurement contracts. Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that businessperson politicians increase expenditures on roads and transport, while leaving health and education spending untouched. Prioritizing economic over social infrastructure brings immediate benefits to firms, while holding back long-term accumulation of human capital. However, businesspeople do not reduce budget deficits, but rather adopt less competitive methods for selecting contractors, particularly in corruption-ripe construction. In all, businessperson politicians do more to make government run for business, rather than like a business.
H72|Fiscal consolidation by intergovernmental transfers cuts? The unpleasant effect on expenditure arrears|For the period 2003–2014, we investigate unexplored effects of fiscal consolidation in decentralized public finance on a large dataset of Italian municipalities. Based on a simple, realistic theoretical model, we show that municipalities increase arrears on committed investment expenditure as a response to intergovernmental transfer cuts. Then, we test our predictions controlling for potential sources of endogeneity, and find that a reduction in intergovernmental transfers causes a significant increase in arrears, in addition to other common adjustments to local fiscal policies (e.g., tax revenues). Our results highlight a perverse effect of fiscal consolidation packages implemented by centrally imposed fiscal restraints.
H72|How defense shapes the institutional organization of states|Abstract We analyze theoretically how the provision of military services explains the vertical and horizontal fragmentation of a state. The model innovates on the previous political economy literature which views such institutional arrangements arising only as a response to internal ”technological” forces, not to strategic interactions within the state and with neighboring states. The model explains how these interactions lead communities of individuals to choose among three alternative types of institutional arrangements: 1) a union, i.e., a setting wherein both the vertical and the horizontal fragmentation of a state is minimized; 2) an alliance, whereby a state becomes more vertically fragmented by creating an upper government tier devised to take advantage of economies of scale; 3) autonomy, where horizontal fragmentation is maximized, as no merging of communities occurs and no higher government tier is created. A series of simulations of the model define the conditions under which each alternative institutional arrangement emerges in equilibrium.
H72|The Causal Effect of Infrastructure Investments on Income Inequality: Evidence from US States|Through utilizing US state-level data at annual frequency from 1976 to 2008, this paper documents a causal effect of infrastructure investments, specifically public spending on highways, on income inequality. The number of seats in the US House of Representatives Committee On Appropriations serves as a valid instrument to identify quasi-random variations in state-level spending on highways. When a given state gains an additional committee member, which is rather exogenous, new federal grants are allocated to that state, resulting in the state government slashing its investment expenditures on highways. In other words, a crowding-out effect of federal funding for state investment in highways is at play. The main contribution of this paper is to show that such committee-driven cuts in spending on highways cause an increase in income inequality within a two-year horizon. In addition, we show that wages paid for construction jobs correlate positively and strongly with spending on highways at the state level. This further provides suggestive evidence that the construction sector plays an important role in the transmission channel from a rise in state spending on highways to a reduction in income inequality.
H72|Local Taxation and Tax Base Mobility: Evidence from the French business tax reform|This paper investigates the impact of tax base mobility on local taxation. We first develop a theoretical model in order to examine the connection between local business property taxation and tax base mobility within a metropolitan area. We find that decreasing capital intensity in the tax base increases the business property tax rates unambiguously. We then test this result using a French reform, which changes the composition of the main local business tax base in 2010. Estimations using Difference-inDifferences show that the reduction in the mobility of the tax base indeed results in higher business property tax rates. Housing tax rates were not affected by the reform.
H72|Crime and Government Expenditure in Brazil: Estimating the Impact of Government Security Spending on Homicide Rates|Despite the widespread debate about crime in Brazil and the alarming increase in homicides in recent years, few studies have analyzed or exposed evidence of the impact of public security spending on deterring violence in the country. This may be due to issues of endogeneity when estimating the relationship between security spending and the rate of homicides. The primary innovation presented in this paper is the use of a Bartik-inspired instrument to address the simultaneity issue. It measures government security spending in a two-stage least squares estimation, obtaining outcomes that are not only statistically but also practically significant. Results indicate that an increase of R$10 per capita in annual security expenditure leads to a decrease of 0.6 per 100,000 people in the number of homicides.
H72|The Unintended Composition Effect of the Subnational Government Fiscal Rules: The Case of Italian Municipalities|Although numerical fiscal rules may be introduced to achieve several objectives, to date the maintenance of fiscal sustainability is their predominant goal. This is particularly true at subnational level; maintaining fiscal discipline in a decentralized setting is challenging and subnational government fiscal rules are considered one of the most valid solutions to the problem. While theoretical and empirical literature has mainly focused on their effectiveness in containing subnational deficit and/or debt, little attention has been paid to the possible trade–offs and side effects of the rules on the composition of subnational expenditure. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by exploiting the case of Italian municipalities, which have been subject for fifteen years (1999–2015) to a set of rules called Domestic Stability Pact. The Italian DSP framework – imposing rules only on municipalities above a population threshold (5,000 inhabitants) – allows us to implement a quasi– experimental technique to investigate the unintended composition effects of the rules. A difference–in–discontinuities design permits to find rigorous empirical evidence that the switching in 2007 to rules which are more binding in terms of fiscal discipline leads to a recomposition of municipal expenditure against investment spending. The analysis is then integrated by evaluating the impact of the rules on six categories of investment expenditure. Investment in human capital and infrastructure seems to be the most affected.
H72|Nation building: The role of central spending in education|It is generally argued that, in the context of Imperial Germany, public primary education was used to form “loyal citizens” and to build a nation. In this paper we analyze to what extent state spending on primary education affected participation at general elections and votes for pro-nationalist parties. We combine census data on the composition of school funding with federal election data at the level of 199 constituencies in five-year intervals from 1886 to 1911. Panel estimates of models with constituency and time-fixed effects show that an increase in the share of central spending is positively related to the vote share for pro-nationalist parties. Results on voter turnout are weaker and less clear cut. Estimates of models with lagged state spending by category of expenditure are consistent with the role of indoctrination of public primary education.
H72|German Public Attitudes Towards Asylum Seekers, Immigrants in the Workplace, Inflation, and Local Budgets: Evidence from a Representative Survey of the German Population|This paper provides background information and basic descriptive statistics for a representative survey of the German population conducted on our behalf by GfK in the first quarter of 2018. The survey covers various topics, including: 1) attitudes towards asylum seekers; 2) migrating workers in the workplace; 3) inflation and monetary policy; and 4) the role played by local budgets in local voting decisions. We also collect a broad range of socio-demographic and psychological indicators.
H72|Zur strukturellen Finanzlage der Länder: eine aktuelle Auswertung und Methodenkritik|Seit Einfuehrung der neuen Schuldenregel hat sich die Finanzlage der deutschen Bundeslaender deutlich verbessert. Nach unseren Berechnungen mit dem Aggregierten Quotierungsverfahren konnten die meisten Laender ihre strukturellen Budgetdefizite abbauen und im Jahr 2017 schon 14 Laender strukturelle Budgetueberschuesse erzielen; lediglich das Saarland und Nordrhein-Westfalen wiesen strukturelle Defizite auf. Die „strukturelle“ Besserung überzeichnet indes die Konsolidierungsfortschritte, denn sie ist zum grossen Teil dem historisch niedrigen Zinsniveau zu verdanken, das zu erheblichen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst fuehrte. Da die Finanzierungskonditionen aber nicht dauerhaft so guenstig bleiben wie in den vergangenen Jahren, verdecken die Zinsersparnisse den bei vielen Laendern noch bestehenden Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir plaedieren daher dafuer, nur nachhaltige Einsparungen bei den Zinslasten als strukturelle Besserung zu klassifizieren und entwickeln ein Bereinigungsverfahren, das neben den Konjunktureinfluessen auch die Verzerrung durch das aeusserst niedrige Zinsniveau beachtet. Unsere Simulationen zeigen, dass nach einer Bereinigung um die nicht nachhaltigen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst nicht mehr 14, sondern nur neun Laender im Jahr 2017 einen strukturell mindestens ausgeglichenen Haushalt erzielt haben. Bei den verbleibenden sieben Laendern besteht teilweise noch erheblicher Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir zeigen darueber hinaus, dass die zur quantitativen Vergleichbarkeit der Laenderfinanzen in der Regel verwandten Einwohner-Indikatoren wesentliche Strukturunterschiede zwischen den Laendern unberuecksichtigt lassen und damit zu irrefuehrenden Schlussfolgerungen fuehren koennen. Wir empfehlen daher, bei Laendervergleichen Kennzahlen zu verwenden, die strukturelle Unterschiede zwischen den Laendern bei Erwerbstaetigkeit und Produktivitaet beachten.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H72|Who Seeks Re-Election: Local Fiscal Restraints and Political Selection|This paper analyses the consequences of local fiscal autonomy for political selection. We propose a model of political careers where both decisions to become candidates and seek re-election are endogenous. Market and political ability are private information, and the latter is revealed to the incumbent during her first period in office. Following an unanticipated reduction in the returns from holding office, we show that incumbents with high market ability are more likely to refrain from running again for office than their lower ability counterparts. We test this prediction exploiting an unexpected reduction in the upper bound of the municipal property tax rate, announced by the Portuguese Prime Minister in July 2008, just 15 months before the local elections. We rely on a comprehensive dataset on all Portuguese mainland municipalities for the 2005 and 2009 elections, including municipality and individual mayor characteristics. We follow a difference-in-differences strategy to show that affected mayors – those who were forced to decrease the property tax rate, and thus faced a sharp tax revenue decrease – are less likely to seek re-election. This effect is driven by high quality incumbents, as proxied by their previous occupation.
H72|The Public Finance Challenges of Fracking for Local Governments in the United States|Fracking has revolutionized international oil and gas markets practically overnight, but its impact on local public finance and governance have largely been overlooked. While operating under federal and state constraints, the key ongoing policy question is whether and to what extent local governments can â€“ and should â€“ have the power to manage the industryâ€™s effects on their communities. This IMFG Paper explores the fiscal health risks associated with the industry, its local revenue generation implications, and what local governments can do to address the spatial and temporal mismatches between the two. As the industry expands internationally, including to Canada, lessons from the United States can inform future regulatory response in other places.
H72|Asymmetric regional dynamics: from bust to recovery|Regional convergence stands out in the severe adjustment of the Portuguese economy that followed the international financial crisis. This result contrasts with increasing regional inequality in other European countries. We show that regions’ GDP growth rates of the Portuguese economy were driven by debt and exports. Our estimates suggest that differences in regional debt-to-GDP and exports-toGDP ratios resulted in asymmetric regional economic dynamics. Highly indebted regions had a more severe recession and a slower recovery. Regions more open to trade had a milder recession and a stronger recovery. Finally, our results suggest that fiscal decentralization may improve regions’ resilience.
H72|Would UDAY brighten up Rajasthan Finances?|Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) required number of State governments to take over debt of power distribution companies in their books of accounts. Though this one time inter-vention made both debt and deficit measures more comprehensive, this has raised many chal-lenges including comparability of deficit across States and long run fiscal implications of po-wer sector debt on State finances.
H72|Fiscal Rules for Sub-central Governments: Design and Impact|Against a background of mounting demands for spending on services provided by sub-central governments, this paper examines how fiscal rules can help to ensure that pressure on resources is minimised and available resources are used efficiently. Drawing on questionnaire responses and other sources, this paper gives a detailed picture of fiscal rules for sub-central governments in place among a number of OECD countries. The paper examines the rationales for using fiscal rules, the various impacts fiscal rules can have, the factors making for effective implementation and the interactions between the various types of rule. It then constructs a number of synthetic sub-indicators designed to assess the extent to which sub-central government fiscal frameworks exhibit favourable characteristics for the achievement of fiscal objectives. It concludes with the construction of a composite indicator based on the combined impacts in the different areas of fiscal policy. Règles budgétaires des collectivités territoriales : Leurs caractéristiques et leur impact Face à l’augmentation des dépenses au titre des services assurés par les collectivités territoriales, cette étude examine comment les règles budgétaires peuvent contribuer à atténuer les pressions sur les ressources et à garantir une utilisation efficiente des ressources disponibles. S’appuyant sur les réponses à des questionnaires et sur d’autres sources, elle présente une description détaillée des règles budgétaires applicables aux collectivités territoriales dans plusieurs pays de l’OCDE. Elle analyse les raisons qui motivent l’utilisation de règles budgétaires, les divers effets que ces règles peuvent avoir, les facteurs qui contribuent à l’efficacité de leur mise en œuvre et les interactions entre les divers types de règles. Un certain nombre d’indicateurs synthétiques sont ensuite élaborés dans le but de déterminer dans quelle mesure les règles budgétaires des collectivités territoriales présentent des caractéristiques favorisant la réalisation des objectifs de finances publiques. L’étude s’achève par la construction d’un indicateur composite des effets combinés dans les différents domaines de la politique budgétaire.
H72|Market mechanisms in public service provision|This paper compares and analyses the use of market mechanisms in core sub-central policy areas, namely education, health care, transport, social protection, and environment. Arrangements like tendering, outsourcing, user choice and competition, user fees and performance-related funding can help to improve quality of service provision or lower its cost. With around 32% of total public expenditure and often wide-ranging spending powers, sub-central governments (SCG) have considerable leeway for improving their services by relying on market mechanisms. The decentralised and often fragmented nature of sub-central government poses some special challenges to efficient arrangements, however, and may require central government support or stronger inter-jurisdictional co-operation. And while market mechanisms are being harnessed ever more broadly, limits to a more extensive use have become apparent, particularly in the potential trade-off between greater efficiency and equity objectives, or between efficiency and sub-central accountability..
H72|The spending power of sub-central governments: A pilot study|This pilot study presents indicators that assess sub-central government (SCG) spending power by policy area. Traditional indicators – such as the share of SCG in total government spending – are often misleading as they underestimate the impact of central government regulation on sub-central spending patterns. In order to gauge true spending power, a set of institutional indicators is established, based on a detailed assessment of institutional, regulatory and administrative control central government exerts over various SCG policy areas. Results tend to confirm the limited discretion of SCGs over their own budget. Education in particular – the main SCG budget item in most countries – is strongly shaped by central government regulation. Federal countries tend to grant more spending power to SCGs than unitary countries.
H72|The drivers of regional growth in Russia: A baseline model with applications|Russia is a federation of more than 80 regions spanning across a huge territory. Natural resource endowment, inherited industrial specialization, remoteness and climate conditions contribute to large regional disparities. This paper presents an empirical framework model for assessing determinants of regional growth in Russia between 2004 and 2015 with an extension to include sub-national fiscal policies. Baseline results show convergence rates of regional GDP per capita in line with the 2% “iron law of convergence” between countries. Capital investment, and public investment in particular, is a stronger driver of regional growth than in most OECD countries. Natural-resource rich regions are growing faster, and oil price shocks have little economic impact in these regions, pointing at Russia’s centralized tax and transfer system. Subnational current government expenditure is associated with lower growth and slower regional convergence, suggesting low sub-national spending efficiency. There is also weak evidence that sub-national investment yields higher returns than federal government investment. Transfers have mixed effects depending on their nature. Budget equalization grants tend to slow regional growth as they reduce incentives to improve spending efficiency. On the other hand earmarked matching grants tend to spur growth and convergence as they direct resources towards more productive spending.
H72|Strategic Intertemporal Budget Allocation of Local Governments in the Model with Spillovers and Mergers|Mergers of local governments, commonly referred to as municipal mergers, have been implemented widely to internalize spillover effects. Many empirical studies point out that municipalities strategically increase their debt issuance before mergers, creating the `fiscal common pool problem', because of pooled budgets after mergers. However,this phenomenon has not yet been analyzed theoretically. Therefore, this paper examines the mechanism of increased debt issuance before municipal mergers. Our results show that three different effects influence intertemporal budget allocations of municipalities at the time of a merger and the existence of externalities may reduce the severity of the fiscal common pool problem.
H72|A Situational Theory of Pork-Barrel Politics: The Shifting Logic of Discretionary Allocations in India|Despite the extensive literature on distributive politics, we still lack a theory of how political and fiscal institutions interact to shape the pork-barrelling ability of national leaders in a federal parliamentary democracy. Focusing on party system attributes and governmental incentives attached to different types of discretionary grants, this article examines the extent to which a shift in the priorities and interests of the prime minister's party - effected by the change from a dominant-party system to a multiparty-coalition system - is responsible for the change in the dynamics of distributive policies. I use a rich panel dataset on Indian states to propose a situational theory of distributive politics which states that incentives for exclusive targeting of affiliated states in dominant-party systems drive national ruling parties towards particularism, while the shrinking opportunity to indulge in such a policy in multiparty-coalition systems creates a universalisation effect. Additionally, the disaggregated analysis of discretionary grants brings to the fore the fact that the shift from particularism to universalism occurs for schematic grants, which provide an opportunity for credit-claiming. The ad hoc grants, which are like side payments, remain subject to particularism.
H72|Political Representation and Effects of Municipal Mergers| We study the effects of municipal mergers using novel geocoded data on public sector jobs, housing transactions and local politiciansâ€™ place of residence. We find that total municipal expenditures evolve in the same way on average in merged municipalities as in the control group of hypothetical mergers that did not take place. These findings hide substantial heterogeneity within the mergers. Those municipalities that gained only weak political representation in the new post-merger council experience a substantial reduction in local public jobs in administration, and health and social care sectors relative to the municipalities in the same merger that were more strongly represented. This result implies that the mergers had an effect on the within merger spatial distribution of municipal services. However, we do not find conclusive evidence concerning welfare effects. This might be explained by a distance-quality trade-off related to these services.
H72|New Findings on the Fiscal Impact of Immigration in the United States|The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2016) report on the economic and fiscal effects of immigration included the first set of comprehensive fiscal impacts published in twenty years. The estimates highlight the pivotal role of the public goods assumption. If immigrants are assigned the average cost of public goods, such as national defense and interest on the debt, then immigration’s fiscal impact is negative in both the short and long run. If, instead, immigrants are assigned the marginal cost of public goods, then the long-run fiscal impact is positive and the short-run effect is negative but very small (less negative than that of natives). Highly educated immigrants confer large positive fiscal impacts, contributing far more in taxes than they consume in public benefits. To the extent that immigrants impose net costs, these are concentrated at the state and local level and are largely due to the costs of public schooling.
H72|How Does Environmental Regulation Shape Economic Development? A Tax Competition Model of China|We propose a novel theoretical framework to study how environmental regulation shapes economic development in a developing country such as China. We develop a dynamic tax competition model in which local governments, located in development zones, use variation in taxes to attract workers to their jurisdictions. Their objective is to maximize tax revenue less local health costs that are proportional to local pollution. Our main result is that competition generates a reallocation of productive factors when national regulation is introduced. Local governments in more productive regions set greater production taxes than in other regions. This makes workers and output to shift from more to less developed regions of the country.
H72|Does Government Quality Spending can reduce Poverty? A Case in East Java Province|"""Objective – The poverty issue in East Java Province is an interesting research object. This phenomenon has retrieved in every fiscal year, although the intergovernmental transfer funds increase significantly annually. In the decentralization era, a region has been authorized to identify its problem and provide solutions based on their initiatives and preferences. The local government through their budget should focus on their problem solving, i.e. poverty alleviation. Utilizing panel regression, we found that government spending on education and health can reduce poverty rate. Methodology/Technique – OLS (Ordinary Least Squared) model was utilized to answer the objective of the study, that is, to see how the effect of government spending in various sectors on poverty alleviation. Findings – Using the panel regression model, this study found that government spending on education has a negative impact on poverty rate in the East Java Province. The impact on this variable appears to be statistically significant. Novelty – This study showed that central and local government should synchronize their proposed programs, reducing overlapped programs, to pursue a higher efficiency of budget management."""
H72|Local taxation and tax base mobility: Evidence from a business tax reform in France|This paper investigates the impact of tax base mobility on local taxation. We first develop a theoretical model in order to examine the connection between local business property taxation and tax base mobility within a metropolitan area. We find that decreasing capital intensity in the tax base increases the business property tax rates unambiguously. We then test this result using a French reform, which changes the composition of the main local business tax base in 2010. Estimations using Difference-in-Differences show that the reduction in the mobility of the tax base indeed results in higher business property tax rates. Housing tax rates were not affected by the reform.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

H72|Hospital centralization and performance in Denmark - ten years on|Denmark implemented a major reform of the administrative and political structure in 2007 when the previous 13 counties were merged into five new regions and the number of municipalities was reduced from 271 to 98. A main objective was to create administrative units that were large enough to support a hospital structure with few acute hospitals in each region and to centralize specialized care in fewer hospitals. This paper analyses the reorganization of the somatic hospital sector in Denmark since 2007, discusses the mechanisms behind the changes and analyses hospital performance after the reform. The reform emphasized an improved acute service and high quality. The number of acute hospitals was reduced from about 40 to 21 hospitals with joint acute facilities. The restructuring and geographical placement of acute hospitals took place in a democratic process subject to central guidelines and requirements. Since the reform, hospital productivity has increased by more than 2 per cent per year and costs have been stable. While the overall indicators point to a successful reform, it has also been criticized that some people in remote areas feel “left behind” in the economic development and that hospital staff are under increased workload pressure. Concurrent with the centralization of hospitals municipalities strengthened their health service with an emphasis on prevention and health promotion.
H72|Housing booms and busts and local fiscal policy|This paper examines how local governments adjust their spending, savings and taxes in response to a temporary revenue windfall generated by a housing boom and how they cope with the inevitable shortfall that appears during the bust. We focus on Spanish local governments given the intensity of the last housing boom-bust experienced there and the large share of construction-related revenues they obtain. We find, first, that just a small share of the boom windfall was saved, with revenues being used primarily to increase spending (above all, current spending) and (to a lesser extent) cut taxes. Second, we find that the failure to save during the boom is higher in places with less informed voters and more contested elections. Third, we also examine what happens during the bust, and find that these governments had to cut abruptly their spending (above all, capital), raise taxes, and allow deficits to grow. Finally, in places wit less informed voters and more contested elections local governments had more trouble in adjusting during the bust, and they tend to rely more on spending cuts than on tax increases.
H72|On the determinants of fiscal non-compliance: an empirical analysis of spain’s regions|This paper proposes an empirical framework that distinguishes between voluntary and involuntary compliance with fiscal deficit targets on the basis of economic, institutional and political factors. The framework is applied to Spain’s Autonomous Communities (regions) over the period 2002-2015. Fiscal non-compliance among Spain’s regions has proven persistent. It increases with the size of growth forecasting errors and the extent to which fiscal targets are tightened, factors not fully under the control of regional governments. Non-compliance also tends to increase during election years, when vertical fiscal imbalances become accentuated, and market financing costs subside. Strong fiscal rules have not shown any significant impact on containing fiscal noncompliance. Reducing fiscal non-compliance in multi-level governance systems such as Spain’s requires a comprehensive assessment of inter-governmental fiscal arrangements that looks beyond rules-based frameworks by ensuring enforcement procedures are politically credible.
H72|Public expenditures and debt at the subnational level: Evidence of fiscal smoothing from Argentina| This paper uses the particular features of the tax-sharing regime CoparticipaciÃ³n Federal de Impuestos and the fact that some provinces earn hydrocarbon royalties to investigate public expenditures and debt at the subnational level in Argentina.We obtain that facing a one peso increase in intergovernmental transfers, provinces spend on average 36 cents in public expenditures with no changes in public debt. On the other hand, when royalties increase one peso, 59 cents are used to pay back public debt while public expenditures are not affected. These results, which are robust to many different specifications of the basic regressions, suggest a non-negligeable expenditure/debt smoothing behavior of Argentine provinces.
H72|Does Inter-municipal Cooperation promote efficiency gains? Evidence from Italian Municipal|Inter-municipal cooperation is a widespread phenomenon among municipalities as a way to provide local public services, exploit economies of scale and internalise externalities. While the determinants driving the decision to cooperate have been deeply analyzed in the literature, little is known about possible efficiency gains. We test their existence in terms of local public expenditures reductions by investigating the Italian experience of Municipal Unions. We exploit unique administrative data on 335 municipalities located in the Emilia Romagna region, for the period 2001-2011. Using a difference-in-differences approach combined with matching models, we find that being in a Municipal Union reduces the total per capita current expenditures by around 5%. The effect is robust, persistent and increasing up to nine years after entrance. Furthermore, joining a Municipal Union does not reduce the level of local public services. Hence, the Municipal Union is an effective tool that allows municipalities to gain efficiency.
H72|Can Gender Quotas in Candidate Lists Empower Women? Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design|We provide a comprehensive analysis of the short- and medium-term effects of gender quotas in candidate lists using evidence from Spain, where quotas were introduced in 2007 in municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants, and were extended in 2011 to municipalities with more than 3,000 inhabitants. Using a Regression Discontinuity Design, we find that quotas raise the share of women among council members but they do not affect the quality of politicians, as measured by their education attainment and by the number of votes obtained. Moreover, within three rounds of elections, women fail to reach powerful positions such as party leader or mayor, and we do not observe any statistically or economically significant changes in the size and composition of public finances.
H72|The Decentralization of Social Assistance and the Rise of Disability Insurance Enrolment|Abstract Fiscal decentralization, the decentralization of government expenditures to local governments, may enhance public sector efficiency. Vertical externalities, i.e. spillovers between local and central government, could however undo part of this advantage. In this paper we estimate spillovers from Social Assistance (SA), administered by municipalities, towards central government’s Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) scheme in The Netherlands. The latter scheme saw rapidly rising enrolment rates after financial responsibility for Social Assistance was transferred from central to local government. We find that the correlation between local SSDI enrolment and the local stock of SA benefits recipients has increased significantly in the years after decentralization. We show that an increased caseload shifting from Social Assistance to Disability Insurance is the only plausible explanation for this change. Our analysis shows that, following the decentralization of Social Assistance, at least one third of the SSDI inflow was diverted from SA. This caseload shifting increased more rapidly in municipalities experiencing deficits on their SA budgets than in municipalities running a surplus.
H72|Information sharing, neighborhood demarcation, and yardstick competition: an empirical analysis of intergovernmental expenditure interaction in Japan|Abstract The Japanese government provides information on local fiscal performance through the Fiscal Index Tables for Similar Municipalities (FITS-M). The FITS-M categorize municipalities into groups of “similar localities” and provide them with the fiscal indices of their group members, enabling municipalities to use the tables to identify their “neighbors” (i.e., those in the same FITS-M group) and refer to their fiscal information as a “yardstick” for fiscal planning. We take advantage of this system to estimate municipal spending function. In particular, we examine whether the FITS-M help identify a defensible spatial weights matrix that properly describes municipal spending interactions. Our analysis shows that they do. In particular, geographical proximity is significant only between a pair of municipalities within a given FITS-M group, and it does not affect competition between pairs belonging to different groups even if they are located close to each other. This would suggest that the FITS-M work as intended, indicating that spending interaction among Japanese municipalities originates from yardstick competition and not from other types of fiscal competition.
H72|Term limits for mayors and intergovernmental grants: Evidence from Italian cities|We investigate how term limits for mayors influence central government transfers to municipalities. Estimates are based on a dataset of Italian cities over the 1998–2010 period. To credibly identify the influence of term limits, our estimations include mayor fixed effects. We also consider intra-term differences in intergovernmental grants. We provide evidence that electoral incentives distort rather than discipline incumbent mayors’ behavior because transfers are higher before an election with an eligible incumbent, in line with the political budget cycle literature. This evidence is also consistent with the idea that the allocation of intergovernmental grants is influenced by lobbying on the part of eligible local government officeholders, as in Borck and Owings (2003).
H72|The Employment Effects of Countercyclical Infrastructure Investments|We estimate the causal impact of a sizable German infrastructure investment program on employment at the county level. The program focused on improving the energy efficiency of school buildings, making it possible to use the number of schools as an instrument for investments. We find that the program was effective, creating one job for one year for each €25’000 of investments. The employment gains reached their peak after nine months and dropped to zero quickly after the program’s completion. The reductions in unemployment amounted to two-thirds of the job creation, and employment grew predominately in the construction and non-tradable industries.
H72|Financing Urban Infrastructure in Canada: Who Should Pay?|The poor state of municipal infrastructure is the subject of frequent complaint in Canada. Roads are congested, transit systems are in need of major investments, bridges are crumbling, and water treatment plants need to be replaced. Municipalities continue to seek financial assistance from the federal and provincial governments, but are transfers really the best way to pay for municipal capital investments? This paper provides an overview of how municipal infrastructure is funded in Canada with an emphasis on the extent to which the users of infrastructure pay the costs. The paper concludes that although user fees are increasing in Canadian municipalities, better pricing is needed to link those who benefit with those who pay for municipal infrastructure.
H72|Fiscal Sustainability of the German Länder: Time-Series Evidence|We analyze the sustainability of public finances in the 16 states (Länder ) of the Federal Republic of Germany, using an unprecedentedly comprehensive fiscal data set covering the period from 1950 to 2011 for West German Länder and from 1991 to 2011 for East German Länder . We extend the existing literature in that we apply unit-root and stationarity tests not only to debt but also to expenditure and revenue and explore their long-run relation in cointegration analyses for each Land . The results provide evidence against strict fiscal sustainability in a majority of German Länder . A notable exception to this finding is Bavaria.
H72|On the Dynamics of Community Development|This paper presents a dynamic political economy model of community development. In each period, a community invests in a local public good. The community can grow, with new housing supplied by competitive developers. To finance investment, the community can tax residents and issue debt. In each period, fiscal decisions are made by current residents. The community's initial wealth (the value of its stock of public good less its debt) determines how it develops. High initial wealth leads to rapid development. Low initial wealth leads to gradual development that is fueled by community wealth accumulation. Wealth accumulation arises from the desire to attract more households to share the costs of the public good. The long run size of the community can be too large or too small and development may proceed too slowly. Nonetheless, some development occurs and, at all times, public good provision is efficient.
H72|Implications of Medicaid Financing Reform for State Government Budgets|"We analyze potential reforms to Medicaid financing through the lens of fiscal federalism. Because substantial dollars are at stake, both the economic and political sides of intergovernmental transfers have high relevance in this setting. We show that changes in Medicaid financing formulas can shift amounts exceeding several hundred dollars per capita from ""winning"" states to ""losing"" states. In some cases, these amounts exceed 10% of states' own-source revenues. States' balanced budget requirements imply that such changes would, if not phased in gradually, require significant budgetary adjustment over short time horizons. We next show that alternative Medicaid financing structures have significant implications for states' exposure to budgetary stress during recessions. During the Great Recession, an acyclical block-grant structure would have increased states' shortfalls by 2-3.5% of own-source revenues relative to either an explicitly countercyclical block grant or the current matching system. Finally, we assess the implications of several financing structures for the extent to which they subsidize states' decisions on both the ""extensive"" and ""intensive"" margins of coverage generosity over the short and long term."

H72|Estimating Public Spending on Health by Levels of Care for National Health Accounts: An Illustration of Use of Data on Withdrawals by Drawing and Disbursing Officers (DDOs) in India|This paper illustrates the use of information on withdrawals by Drawing and Disbursing Officers (DDOs) for improving estimates of public spending for National Health Accounts (NHAs) in India. Using information from two selected States (Karnataka and Rajasthan), the study highlights the advantages of combining DDO-level information with budgetary data for two purposes (i) mapping public spending to different provider classes of the international System of Health Accounts 2011 (SHA 2011) and (ii) mapping public spending to different types of healthcare providers in India. The benefits of using DDO-level information are found to be higher while mapping expenditure to healthcare providers in India than mapping to international categories of the SHA 2011. In particular, while mapping public spending to different types of healthcare providers in India, the improvement in precision of estimates brought about by DDO-level information was found to be significant in the two States.
H72|The Effect of Intergovernmental Transfers on Public Services in India|India has witnessed impressive growth performance since the market based re-forms were introduced in 1991. However, its regional spread has been uneven. Consid-ering the fact that over 63 per cent of the population lives in economically lagging states and they have over 67 per cent of children in the age group 0-14 demographic dividends can be realised only when a system of intergovernmental transfers is designed to offset their fiscal disabilities. The present paper analyses the design and implementation of gen-eral and specific purpose transfers in India. While the general purpose transfers are given to enable the States to provide comparable levels of services at comparable tax rates. However, given the large differences in the revenue capacities of the states with the rich-est large state having five times the per capita income of the lowest, it is politically infea-sible to offset the differences in revenue capacities completely. Therefore, the specific purpose which are meant to ensure minimum standards of meritorious services with high degree of externalities are extremely important. However, the analysis shows that there are too many specific purpose transfers, they are poorly targeted and inclusion of multiple objectives in each of the specific purpose transfers makes the compliance by the States difficult. The objective of inclusive development requires that the transfer system should be reformed.
H72|Enhancing public sector efficiency and effectiveness in the Czech Republic|Spending on public administration itself is relatively low and so are indicators of its performance. Challenges include wastage in public procurement, insufficient management of the investment cycle and high levels of staff turnover. This paper considers ways of building on recent reforms, including better procedures for EU-financed projects and the new Civil Service Act, to raise the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector. Performance monitoring is underused but could help drive improvements in service delivery. The structure of local government, which includes over 6 200 municipalities, exacerbates the challenges of the public administration by complicating co-ordination and stretching capacity. Accordingly, the second part of the paper focuses on ways of improving the efficiency and quality of public service delivery and realising greater benefits from decentralisation. Rendre le secteur public plus efficient et fonctionnel dans la République tchèque Les dépenses consacrées à l'administration publique proprement dite sont relativement faibles, et il en va de même de ses performances. Parmi les défis à relever, on peut citer notamment des gaspillages dans les marchés publics, une gestion insatisfaisante du cycle d'investissement et une rotation rapide des personnels. Le présent article est consacré aux moyens qui permettraient de prolonger les réformes récentes, en s’appuyant par exemple sur une amélioration des procédures qui régissent les projets financés par l'UE et sur la nouvelle loi sur la fonction publique, qui vise à rendre le secteur public plus efficace et plus efficient. Le suivi des résultats est peu pratiqué alors qu'il pourrait entraîner des progrès dans la prestation des services. La structure des collectivités locales, avec plus de 6 200 communes, aggrave les problèmes d'administration publique en compliquant la coordination et en dispersant les capacités. La deuxième partie de l’article porte donc sur les moyens d'améliorer l'efficience et la qualité de la prestation de services publics ainsi que de mieux tirer parti de la décentralisation.
H72|The Impact of Developmental Exependiture on the Competitiveness of Local Governments|Research background: Development policy in Poland is based on various strategic documents, and it utilizes both the national resources and the European funds. Managing development at the local level is an important element of this policy. Many facets of this management are of incessant interest to the theory and practice of public finance. One of undisputed findings is the relationship between development and increase in competitiveness. However there are no studies showing the relationship between the shape of local government expenditure policy and increase of competitiveness at the local level. Purpose of the article: The paper is focused on demonstrating the importance of specific groups of public expenditure implemented by local government units for development processes at the local level. The authors try to answer the question whether the implementation of certain local budget expenditure positively impacts the level of local government tax revenue, which determine the ability to provide public services, while creating a boost to the growth of competitiveness. Methodology/methods: On the basis of international consensus on the impact of individual factors on the competitiveness measured at the regional level, the authors propose the concept of public developmental expenditure and they adjust it to current standards of budget reporting. In turn, the indicator of tax revenue per capita was chosen to measure the achievement of the objectives of development policy at the local level. The study covers all major cities in Poland (poviat-cities). The authors calculate the volume of the developmental expenditure over the reference period in each city covered by the study as well as the average dynamics of tax revenue per capita. Regression analysis constitutes the essential part of the study. Findings: The observations that had been made, allowed to draw some conclusions regarding both the usefulness of proposed classification of developmental expenditure for the processes of planning, monitoring and evaluation of development strategies and the importance of developmental expenditure for the growth of competitiveness. The proper allocation of budgetary resources in developmental projects should lead in the long run to the growth of local economy and thus also to increase in local budget revenue.
H72|What Drives Local Public Investments? Evidence from Poland|Local public investments satisfy basic local communities’ needs and are crucial from the perspective of regional convergence. Against this background, investments by Polish local government pose as an interesting research subject. It is because, due to its size and dynamics, local public investments exert a considerably significant influence on the Polish economy. Self-government entities with primary responsibility for conducting local public investments in Poland are municipalities. The paper aims to identify fiscal, demographic and infrastructural determinants of municipal investment spending in Poland. I use panel data for 2412 Polish municipalities over the period 2007–2014. For institutional reasons, the sample excludes cities with county rights. The baseline specification employs two-way fixed-effects (FE) estimation that controls both for municipality and year fixed effects. To test for robustness, the sample is restricted to municipalities with up to 20,000; 10,000 and 5,000 inhabitants. For each considered sample there are four regression specifications implemented. Investment spending increases both in own revenues and grants. On the contrary, I document the negative impact of indebtedness level and the coverage of water supply and sewage systems. The coefficients on population size and the share of old inhabitants cease to be negative and statistically significant for municipalities with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants. The results indicate that, apart from fiscal capacity, the investment policies of Polish municipalities are affected by economies of scale, local communities’ preferences and infrastructural endowment. The study also shows that incurring debt should be of particular concern for supervisory and control bodies.
H72|Assignment of powers and number of states in Federal Philippines Discussion paper on federalizing Philippines|This paper argues that the number of states or regional units the Philippine should have when it will federalize the country must be limited to 5. This claim meets the Samuelsonian principle of welfare theorem where marginal social cost is equal to marginal social benefit. The paper also argues that the states or regional governments should have the limited to earn revenue through taxing powers which will be used to spend for government operations. In this manner, efficiency is achieved and control of the federal government on the affairs of the states and regional governments is limited primarily to transfers through equalization parameters.
H72|The effects of the new fiscal rule and creative accounting: Empirical evidence from Japanese municipalities|The purpose of this paper is to analyze creative accounting by stock-flow adjustment in Japanese municipalities after the introduction of a new fiscal rule. We contribute to the literature by analyzing the interdependency of the new fiscal indexes, which comprise three flow indexes and one stock index. Our main contribution is the finding that municipalities tolerated an increase in their stock indexes while they decreased their flow indexes by reducing reserved funds to avoid exceeding the criteria of the new fiscal rule, as the stock index criterion is weaker than that of the three flow indexes.

H72|Participatory Budgeting in Poland – Finance and Marketing Selected Issues|This article is an attempt to present and analyse the changes in the scale and scope of the significance of participatory budgets introduced in the years 2014-2016 in most Polish cities with district rights (MNP), as well as to determine the importance of activities in the field of marketing communication for the effective implementation of the objectives related to its functioning. The analysis carried out in the article concerning PB development in MNP clearly indicates the rise of interest of this form of citizens’ participation in deciding about MNP expenses. Simultaneously, differences in scale and range of implemented PB among examined groups might be visible. As an example, the city of Wrocław shows that an adequate marketing communication of the city as well as local project leaders with inhabitants is a fundamental factor influencing forming an active participation among inhabitants.

H72|Determinants of Budget Projection Errors in Latin America and the Caribbean|This paper analyses the effects of two relatively new budget institutions, a Treasury Single Account and a Medium Term Fiscal Framework, on government budget projection errors. We use a new data set covering a panel of 30 Latin-American and Caribbean countries for the years 2010-2014. Our empirical findings show that improvements in these budgetary institutions are associated with a lower probability of having expenditure projection errors as well as with lower levels of both expenditure and revenues projection errors. Other macrofiscal and political variables such as the economic growth rate, the ratio between government expenditure and GDP, the inflation rate, and the President´s election year are also significant determinants of the projection errors.
H72|Katılımcı Demokrasi ve Bütçeleme|Participatory budgeting, which was emerged at the end of 1980’s and enables citizens to participate in a system that is in accordance with the free will to decide directly related to budget spending and priorities.

Central and local governments will have a more democratic society by ensuring the participation of citizens in the budgeting process. In addition, participatory democracy and budgeting development is a need to provide national and regional development. In this study, participatory democracy concept has discussed in order to describe it comprehensively.
H72|Electoral Cycles and Public Employment in Brazilian Prefectures: Evidence for the years 2002-2013|This paper analyzes the effect of the municipal elections on the personnel expenses of Brazilian municipal governments, in search of evidence on the existence of electoral cycles in municipal expenditures. Using data that covers the 2002-2009 period, I estimate a Fixed Effects model. The results of the article indicate that in electoral years there is a decrease in personnel expenses. By separating the type of employment relationship of the worker, this article shows evidence that there is a decrease in the number of appointed and by-contract workers and the maintenance of the number of statutory workers. In addition, the total wage bill is reduced for all types of employment relation.
H72|Spatial spillovers in public expenditure on a municipal level in Spain|Abstract A key function of local governments is to provide a wide array of public services. The supply of these services has been found to create spatial spillovers among neighbouring municipalities. Although it is generally agreed that spillovers are present in models that explain government expenditures, their type—whether endogenous, exogenous or residual—and sign—whether positive or negative—remain ambiguous. In most cases, a subjective process is used to select the type of spatial regression model used in analysis, with mixed results. Per capita expenditures of ten subprogrammes (Security, Housing, Welfare, Environment, Social services, Employment promotion, Health, Education, Culture and Sport) are analysed for all Spanish municipalities with more than 5000 inhabitants in the 2010–2012 period. A Spatial Seemingly Unrelated Regression methodology in a panel framework is used to incorporate correlation between different subprogrammes and spatial dependence. Our results show that the three types of spatial effects are present. Furthermore, substantive dependence is positive in most cases, while negative residual dependence is observed in some.
H72|Schools and public buildings in decay: the role of political fragmentation|Abstract It is a widespread concern that schools and other public buildings are in poor conditions. A popular explanation is that maintenance is given too little priority in the budgetary process because politicians are shortsighted. In this paper we investigate this hypothesis using two novel survey data sets on school and general building conditions in Norwegian local governments. We use political fragmentation as a proxy for myopic behavior and provide strong empirical evidence that a high degree of political fragmentation is associated with poor building conditions, both for schools and for buildings in general. The finding is robust to handling of controls, outliers, and estimation method. We also provide evidence that lack of maintenance is the channel for poor building conditions.
H72|El Impacto Redistributivo del Gasto Social en Argentina (2003-2015): Una Herramienta para Evaluar las Politicas Publicas de Asignacion Social|Este trabajo tiene por objeto demostrar que entre los anios 2003 y 2015 el componente de mercado relacionado con el crecimiento económico ha sido mas significativo en explicar la disminucion de la desigualdad que la expansion de las politicas redistributivas del Estado. Bajo el metodo de descomposicion del Gini busca tambien cuantificar el impacto marginal de las politicas sociales en la desigualdad. A partir de un analisis de la EPH fue posible demostrar que el cambio atribuible a las politicas del Estado fue del 21% mientras que el 79% restante se explica por los factores del mercado. Entre 2003 y 2007, casi la totalidad del cambio se explica por el mercado. En tanto, entre 2011 y 2015, el componente del Estado ascendio al 45%. El programa de pensiones no contributivas evidencia un mayor impacto redistributivo por motivo de su participacion en el ingreso de las familias. La Asignacion Universal por Hijo es el programa social con la canalizacion hacia las familias mas pobres.
H72|Fiscally Responsible Mafia-clans|To work as an accountability mechanism, fiscal decentralization requires the democratic mechanism to function well. This is generally not the case where the quality of the institutional environment is weak, and local governments might be captured by local oligarchs. We explore this issue by studying how Italian municipalities reacted to an unexpected tax reform reducing tax autonomy at the local level. Focusing on three Southern provinces, where some municipal governments are captured by Camorra clans, our estimates suggest that captured municipalities are less responsive to incentives stemming from re-centralization. We also observe a different recomposition of spending between the two groups, which we interpret - according to our theoretical model - considering the different degrees with which clans can extract rents from public expenditure.
H72|Ideology and Public Policies: A Quasi-Experimental Test of the Hypothesis that Left-Wing Governments Spend More|In the literature it is often argued that governments on the left tend to raise tax rates and public spending more than their right-wing counterparts. We demonstrate that this result must be interpreted with caution. Not only it may reveal partisan effects, due to the direct impact of parties’ ideology on public spending, but also a selection bias, since the distribution of voters’ preferences determines the ideology of the government in office. The present research overcomes this problem of observational equivalence by applying two identification strategies, namely re-gression discontinuity design and propensity score matching. Using data from the French local public sector, we show that governments facing the same economic situation do not spend more when they are left-wing, particularly in the case of social expenditures. This result rules out the partisan-politicians hypothesis and lends support to demand driven policy selection processes.
H72|Do political parties matter? Endogenous fragmentation, partisanship, and local public expenditures in Finland|Both the Weak Government Hypothesis and the Partisan Theory state that institutional settings are sufficiently permissive to allow elected politicians to maximize their own utility at the expense of citizens’ preferences. We test this statement using data on Finnish local public expenditures. One important point is that the composition of the government can be explained by the hetero-geneity of voters’ preferences, hence the need for appropriate techniques to control for a potential selection bias. Using propensity score matching (PSM) methods, we demonstrate that neither the Weak Government Hypothesis nor the Partisan Theory provide an explanation of public spending differences. What appears to be the influence of government composition is in fact shown to be a demand driven process.
H72|Ideology or Voters? A Quasi-Experimental Test of Why Left-Wing Governments Spend More|In the literature, there is a widespread consensus that left-wing governments raise taxes and public spending more than their right-wing counterparts. We demonstrate that this result must be interpreted with caution. What might seem a partisan effect, due to the direct impact of parties’ ideology on public spending, might actually be a selection bias, because changes in the distribution of voters’ preferences determine changes of the ideology of the government in office. We overcome this problem of observational equivalence by applying two identification strategies, regression discontinuity design and propensity score matching. Using data from the French local public sector, we show that left-wing governments facing the same economic situation as rightwing ones do not spend more, particularly in the case of social expenditures. This result rules out the partisan-politicians hypothesis and lends support to demand driven policy selection processes.
H72|The Effect of Civil War Violence on Aid Allocations in Uganda|In recent years there has been an increase in the number of studies using microlevel data to analyse the aid-conflict nexus at local level, however most of these studies focus on how conflict dynamics are influenced by aid allocations whereas there is relatively little analysis on how conflict affects subnational aid allocations. Estimating the effect of conflict on aid can be difficult given possible reverse causality, therefore this study exploits an exogenous driven shock in conflict intensity in Uganda to estimate the effect of aid allocations at subnational level. Using district level data for Uganda between 2002-2010, and information on both foreign aid commitments and disbursements, the results show that conflict is negatively related to aid allocations: Conflict-struck regions see both lower commitment and disbursement levels in the wake of conflict. Although the sudden outburst of violence in Uganda can help identifying the effect of conflict on aid allocations, one caveat of this approach is that it is hard to know to what extent the results generalise.
H72|New Evidence on State Fiscal Multipliers: Implications for State Policies|"When state and local governments engage in balanced budget changes in taxes and spending, what fiscal multiplier effects do such policies have on creating local jobs? Traditionally, the view has been that possible job-creation effects of such state and local ""demand-side” policies are smaller, second-order effects. Such effects might be worthwhile to take into consideration when a state or local government balances its budget during a recession, but the effects were believed to be of modest magnitude, and not of major importance for more general state and local public policies. However, recent estimates of fiscal multiplier effects of state and local spending and tax policies suggest much larger demand-side effects of such policies on local jobs. These fiscal multiplier effects are large enough to suggest relatively low costs per job created of some tax and spending policy combinations, sufficient to alter the net benefits of many public policies. In particular, this recent research suggests that policies that use tax increases on the top 10 percent of the income distribution to finance either public spending expansions or tax relief for the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution may offer some job creation benefits that are large enough to alter state and local policy decisions. Furthermore, the cost per job created of state business tax incentive policies or business tax cuts may be significantly altered after taking into account the opportunity costs of financing such policies by cutting public spending or raising taxes on the bottom 90 percent."
H72|"Are Teacher Pensions ""Hazardous"" for Schools?"|I use a detailed panel of data and a unique modeling specification to explore how public schoolteachers respond to the incentives embedded in North Carolina’s retirement system. Like most public-sector retirement plans, North Carolina’s teacher pension implicitly encourages teachers to continue working until they are eligible for their pension benefits, and then leave soon afterward. I find that teachers with higher levels of quality, as measured by a teacher’s value-added to her students’ achievement test scores, are more responsive to the “pull” of teacher pensions. Younger teachers, those with higher salaries, and nonwhite teachers are also more likely to stay during the pension “pull.” All teachers show a strong response to the pension “push,” with about a quarter of teachers leaving every year once they become eligible for their pension. I depart from other models of teacher retirement by using a Cox proportional hazard model. Given that salaries are generally fixed by the state, I find that the number of years a teacher must work before she is eligible for her full pension benefit is the major driver of variation in pension wealth. This specification has the benefit of a flexible baseline hazard that can easily capture the sharp incentives driving a teacher’s retirement decision that are dependent on her proximity to retirement eligibility, and can flexibly account for differences driven by local labor market conditions. These analyses highlight important unintended effects that inform education policies going forward to ensure the retention of high-quality teachers in all types of schools.
H72|Housing booms and busts and local fiscal policy|This paper examines how local governments adjust their spending, savings and taxes in response to a temporary revenue windfall generated by a housing boom and how they cope with the inevitable shortfall that appears during the bust. We focus on Spanish local governments given the intensity of the last housing boom-bust experienced there and the large share of construction-related revenues they obtain. We find, first, that just a small share of the boom windfall was saved, with revenues being used primarily to increase spending (above all, current spending) and (to a lesser extent) cut taxes. Second, we find that the failure to save during the boom is higher in places with less informed voters and more contested elections. Third, we also examine what happens during the bust, and find that these governments had to cut abruptly their spending (above all, capital), raise taxes, and allow deficits to grow. Finally, in places wit less informed voters and more contested elections local governments had more trouble in adjusting during the bust, and they tend to rely more on spending cuts than on tax increases.
H72|Disentangling the fiscal effects of local constitutions|We apply a regression discontinuity design to verify how constitutional rules, such as electoral systems, shape budget revenues at the subnational governmental level. We take advantage of a natural experiment involving an institutional reform at the local level in Poland. The reform introduced two electoral rules, which changed according to an exogenous population threshold: smaller municipalities used majoritarian elections and larger municipalities used proportional elections. While intergovernmental grants increased in both small and large municipalities, they increased less in municipalities with majoritarian elections compared to jurisdictions with proportional representation. This has further implications regarding the level of property taxes and vertical fiscal imbalance. The jurisdictions with proportional electoral systems had lower revenues from property taxes and higher vertical fiscal imbalance than jurisdictions with majoritarian systems. We show that this effect works through the alignment channel, which is driven by the political alignment of mayors with parties in the central government. This is more prevalent in proportional election scenarios. We also demonstrate that these effects are more pronounced in the period after 2002, when direct elections of mayors were introduced.
H72|A Situational Theory of Pork Barrel Politics: The Shifting Logic of Discretionary Allocations in India|A rich panel dataset on Indian states is used to propose a situational theory of distributive politics which states that incentives for exclusive targeting of affiliated states in dominant party systems drive national ruling parties towards particularism, while the shrinking opportunity to indulge in such a policy in multiparty coalition systems creates a universalisation effect. Additionally, the disaggregated analysis of discretionary grants brings to the fore the fact that the shift from particularism to universalism occurs for schematic grants, which provide an opportunity for credit claiming. The ad hoc grants, which are like side payments, remain subject to par ticularism. [GIGA Working paper No. 298].
H72|Federalism and Foreign Direct Investment: How Political Affiliation Determines the Spatial Distribution of FDI – Evidence from India|This paper links the foreign economic engagement of India's states with the literature on federalism, thereby contributing to an understanding of the political economy of FDI inflows in a parliamentary federal system. More specifically, it studies subnational governments' international engagements to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and investigates whether the political affiliations of states' chief ministers and parliamentarians determine the spatial distribution of FDI across the Indian states, correcting for the influence of per capita income, population density, urbanisation, infrastructure, policy regime, and human development. Although the central government plays no direct role in determining the state to which FDI goes, the centre-state relations in a federal structure play a role in creating perceptions about the relative political risk involved in different investment destinations. Employing multiple linear regressions to analyse time-series (2000-2013) cross-sectional (12 states) data using the panel procedure, the study finds that affiliated states attract relatively more FDI per capita in comparison to states ruled by opposition parties or coalition partners. However, some exceptions do result, primarily due to two phenomena: first, the presence of a strong state leadership and, second, the presence of a significant share of members of parliament belonging to the prime minister's party in the non-affiliated states. Further, states ruled by outside supporters have been most successful in attracting FDI inflows during the coalition period.
H72|Do mergers of large local governments reduce expenditures? – Evidence from Germany using the synthetic control method|States merge local governments to achieve economies of scale. Little is known to which extent mergers of county-sized local governments reduce expenditures, and influence political outcomes. I use the synthetic control method to identify the effect of mergers of large local governments in Germany (districts) on public expenditures. In 2008, the German state of Saxony reduced the number of districts from 22 to 10. Average district population increased substantially from 113,000 to 290,000 inhabitants. I construct a synthetic counterfactual from states that did not merge districts for years. The results do neither show reductions in total expenditures, nor in expenditures for administration, education, and social care. There seems to be no scale effects in jurisdictions of more than 100,000 inhabitants. By contrast, I find evidence that mergers decreased the number of candidates and voter turnout in district elections while vote shares for populist right-wing parties increased.
H72|Decentralization effects in ecological fiscal transfers: The case of Portugal|Portugal has a unitary system in which the central government transfers funds to lower government levels for their public functions. In 2007, Portugal introduced Ecological Fiscal Transfers (EFT), where municipalities receive transfers for hosting Protected Areas (PA). We study whether introducing EFT in Portugal incentivized municipalities to designate PA and has led to a decentralization of conservation decisions. We employ a Bayesian structural time series approach to estimate the effect of introducing EFT in comparison to a simulated counterfactual time series. Quantitative results show a significant increase in the ratio of municipal and national PA designations following Portugal's EFT introduction. The analysis furthermore places emphasis on the importance of relevant municipal conservation competencies and the role of local decision makers' motivations for PA designations. Results have important implications for conservation policy-making in terms of allocating budgets and competencies in multi-level governments.
H72|Political fragmentation and fiscal policy: Evidence from German municipalities|The government fragmentation hypothesis (GFH) states that coalition governments spend more than single-party governments due to an underlying common pool problem. Using a large panel data set on 604 local governments in the German state of Baden-Württemberg for the 1994-2014 period, I test the GFH for tax rates, the growth in government debt as well as expenditures and its sub-categories. Studies using standard regression methods fail to identify causal effect as the type of government is generally not random. I apply a RDD, that exploits quasi-random variation generated by close elections. I add external validity to the recent quasi-experimental literature by investigating the GFH for a mayor-council system. I find that contrary to the theoretical prediction, coalition governments do not increase taxes and government debt. There is a non-robust, negative effect on total expenditures, which is mainly driven by administrative expenditures and material expenditures.
H72|Do local governments tax homeowner communities differently?|"This paper investigates whether and how strongly the share of homeowners in a community affects residential property taxation by local governments. Different from renters, homeowners bear the full property tax burden irrespective of local market conditions, and the tax is more salient to them. ""Homeowner communities"" may hence oppose high property taxes in order to protect their housing wealth. Using granular spatial data from a complete housing inventory in the 2011 German Census and historical war damages as a source of exogenous variation in local homeownership, we provide empirical evidence that otherwise identical jurisdictions charge significantly lower property taxes when the share of homeowners in their population is higher. This result is invariant to local market conditions, which suggests tax salience as the key mechanism behind this effect. We find positive spatial dependence in tax multipliers, indicative of property tax mimicking by local governments."
H72|Power Politics: Electoral Cycles in German Electricity Prices|We provide evidence that German public energy providers, over which municipality-level politicians hold substantial sway, systematically adjust the pricing of electric energy in response to local electoral cycles. The documented pattern is in line with both, an artificial reduction in prices before an election that needs to be countermanded by future price increases, and an artificial postponement of market-driven price increases until after the election is over.
H72|The revised WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA): Key design features and significance for global trade and development|"The WTO's plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement (""the GPA"" or ""the Agreement"") is an important ongoing success story for the Organization. In March 2012, the GPA Parties completed a comprehensive revision of the Agreement, encompassing both its text and coverage (market access commitments). The revised GPA, the negotiating processes that led to its adoption and coming into force, and the continuing gradual broadening of its membership are of therefore interest for the evolution of the international trading system. The GPA's successful renegotiation, the continuing growth of its membership and its vitality as an instrument of public policy were not achieved through happenstance. The paper discusses a number of specific design features of the GPA that clearly facilitated the successful conclusion of the renegotiation and that, as such, may in the future be relevant to other areas of global trade liberalization. In addition to the Agreement's plurilateral nature, of particular interest are the approach taken with respect to application of the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle in the Agreement; the GPA's continuing strong emphasis on principles of reciprocity in market access concessions; and its approach to special and differential treatment for developing countries, in all of which it differs from approaches that are widely used in other WTO Agreements. Apart from the above, the GPA revision is important for the merging of trade and good governance concerns that it exemplifies. As discussed in the paper, the themes of governance and the sound management of public resources that are treated in the revised Agreement were not afterthoughts to the renegotiation; rather, they permeated the revised text and received focused attention from the Parties in their own right. As well, the GPA has direct implications for investment policy and for domestic economic reforms, and is an important tool of e-commerce. And, the revision has made possible very significant synergies between the GPA and other international instruments and activities in reducing barriers to participation and strengthening governance in public procurement markets. For all these reasons, the revised Agreement is likely to have a wider impact than meets the eye, and well merits the support and attention that it has received from the participating WTO Member governments."
H72|Was bringen kommunale Gebietsreformen?: Kausale Evidenz zu Hoffnungen, Risiken und alternativen Instrumenten|Seit Jahrzehnten werden kommunale Gebietskörperschaften fusioniert, in der Hoffnung auf Kosteneinsparungen und eine höhere Leistungsfähigkeit der Verwaltung. In diesem Beitrag geben Sebastian Blesse und Felix Rösel einen Überblick über die bestehende kausale Evidenz zu den Effekten von Gebietsreformen auf öffentliche Ausgaben, Effizienz und Qualität der Verwaltung sowie zu den möglichen politischen Folgen der Zusammenschlüsse. Sie zeigen, dass Evaluationsstudien selten Effizienzrenditen von Gebietsreformen nachweisen. Allerdings ergeben sich unbeabsichtigte Nebenwirkungen auf die politische Partizipation: Die Bürger sind weniger zufrieden mit der Demokratie und gehen seltener zur Wahl, und die Ungleichheit zwischen den Ortsteilen nimmt zu. Vor diesem Hintergrund erörtern die Autoren alternative Instrumente wie interkommunale Zusammenarbeit, Funktionalreformen und Maßnahmen der Verwaltungsmodernisierung.
H72|Housing Supply Elasticity and Rent Extraction by State and Local Governments|Governments may extract rent from private citizens by inflating taxes and spending on projects benefiting special interests. Using a spatial equilibrium model, I show that less elastic housing supplies increase governments' abilities to extract rents. Inelastic housing supply, driven by exogenous variation in local topography, raises local governments' tax revenues and causes citizens to combat rent seeking by enacting laws limiting the power of elected officials. I find that public sector workers, one of the largest government special interests, capture a share of these rents through increased compensation when collective bargaining is legal or through corruption when collective bargaining is outlawed.
H72|Firms and Regional Favoritism|We examine formal firm behavior in response to regional favoritism by top-ranked politicians using a balanced panel of 444 rural districts (yearly observations) in Vietnam during 2000 to 2011 and census microdata of firms, politicians' home towns, and climate and population microdata. The study finds that the number of firms and aggregated employment of firms increase in the home town districts of politicians after they resume office. The findings suggest that regional favoritism in a single-party system maintains the continuous development of firms in politicians' home town districts and widens the gaps among rural districts.
H72|Las finanzas públicas de Valledupar, 2005-2015|La situación de insolvencia registrada llevó a que Valledupar firmara un Acuerdo de Reestructuración de Pasivos en 2014. Este trabajo analiza la evolución de las finanzas públicas de este municipio antes y después de firmado el acuerdo, comparando dicha evolución con lo que se registró en ciudades de similar desarrollo y población. Con base en información de las ejecuciones presupuestales se evidencia que, si bien los ingresos totales del municipio han crecido a tasas similares a las de los municipios comparables, los gastos en Valledupar muestran una tendencia insostenible en el mediano plazo, lo que ha repercutido en un déficit de capital que comprometen la viabilidad fiscal del ente territorial y el cumplimiento de los compromisos adquiridos con el acuerdo de reestructuración. ******ABSTRACT: The situation of insolvency led Valledupar to sign a Restructuring Agreement of Liabilities in 2014. This work analyzes the evolution of public finances of this municipality before and after signing the agreement, comparing this evolution with what was recorded in cities of similar development and population. Based on information from the budget executions, it is evident that expenditures in Valledupar show an unsustainable trend in the medium term. Although the total income of the municipality has grown at rates similar to those of comparable municipalities, the capital deficit of Valledupar compromises the fiscal viability and the fulfillment of the commitments acquired in the restructuring agreement of this territorial entity.
H72|Political Alignment in the Time of Weak Parties: Electoral Advantages and Subnational Transfers in Colombia|Este documento explora el efecto de alineación entre políticos locales y nacionales en un contexto de partidos débiles. Utilizando métodos de regresión discontinua en elecciones reñidas, encontramos que en ausencia de partidos fuertes, las coaliciones presidenciales se convierten en los ejes de la alineación política en Colombia. De hecho, mientras que los partidos políticos proveen muy pocas ventajas electorales a sus miembros, los candidatos de la coalición a posiciones nacionales obtienen muchos más votos en municipios gobernados por alcaldes alineados. A su vez, los alcaldes alineados reciben más transferencias discrecionales para financiar carreteras por parte del gobierno nacional. Estas transferencias, sin embargo, no se traducen en mayor crecimiento económico en los municipios. ******ABSTRACT: This paper explores the effect of alignment between local and national politics in a context of weak parties. Based on a regression discontinuity design in close elections, we find that, in absence of strong parties, presidential coalitions become the focal point of political alignment in Colombia. In fact, while parties provide almost no electoral advantages to their members, candidates aspiring to national positions get significantly more votes in municipalities governed by mayors aligned with the incoming presidential coalitions. In turn, aligned mayors receive additional discretionary transfers from the National Government to finance road investments. These discretionary transfers, however, do not translate into local economic growth.
H72|To What Extent Can Long-Term Investment in Infrastructure Reduce Inequality?|By reviewing US state-level panel data on infrastructure spending and on per capita income inequality from 1950 to 2010, this paper sets out to test whether there is an empirical link between infrastructure and inequality. Our main result, obtained from panel regressions with both state and time fixed effects, shows that highways and higher education spending growth in a given decade correlates negatively with Gini indices at the end of the decade. Such a finding suggests a causal effect from growth in infrastructure spending to a reduction in inequality, through better access to job and education opportunities. More significantly, this relationship is stronger with inequality at the bottom 40 per cent of the income distribution. In addition, infrastructure expenditures on highways are shown to be more effective at reducing inequality. A counterfactual experiment reveals which US states ended up with a significantly higher bottom Gini coefficient in 2010 that is attributed to underinvestment in infrastructure over the first decade of the 21st century. From a policy making perspective, this paper aims to present innovations in finance for infrastructure investments, for the US, other industrially advanced countries and also for developing economies.
H72|The Employment Effects of Countercyclical Infrastructure Investments|We estimate the causal impact of a sizable German infrastructure investment program on employment at the county level. The program focused on improving the energy efficiency of school buildings, making it possible to use the number of schools as an instrument for investments. We find that the program was effective, creating one job for one year for each €25’000 of investments. The employment gains reached their peak after nine months and dropped to zero quickly after the program’s completion. The reductions in unemployment amounted to two-thirds of the job creation, and employment grew predominately in the construction and non-tradable industries
H72|Resource-Richness and Economic Growth in Contemporary U.S|Between 1997 and 2014, US corn, soybean and cotton production almost fully converted to genetically modified crops. Starting around 2007, improved tight oil and shale gas technologies turned the declining US fossil fuel production into a booming industry. We study the effects of these two resource technology revolutions on US state income. We find that the shale revolution increased income in states abundant in oil and gas resources. States dependent on agricultural production also saw an increase in income, which we, however, attribute not to the GM innovation, but to a demand increase brought by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. We also document the resource boom indirect effects on other growth-enhancing activities, particularly, on private and public education expenditures, and distortionary taxation.
H72|Essays on the Behavior of Firms and Politicians|Die vorliegende Dissertation besteht aus sechs eigenständigen Kapiteln, die vom Verhalten von Firmen und Politikern im weiteren Sinne handeln. Nach einer Einführung in die Thematik wird im ersten Teil der Dissertation ausgeführt, wie institutionelle und politische Rahmenbedingungen das Verhalten von Firmen beeinflussen. In Kapitel 2 werden die Einflussgrößen von Schenkungen von Betriebsvermögen in deutschen Familienunternehmen untersucht. Umfrageergebnisse zeigen, dass bei größeren Unternehmen und bei Unternehmen mit guter Geschäftslage die Schenkungswahrscheinlichkeit stieg. In Kapitel 3 wird untersucht, wie politische Unsicherheit Investitionsentscheidungen von Unternehmen beeinflusst, wofür Daten über realisierte Investitionsquoten, Investitionspläne und -revisionen verwendet werden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die realisierten Investitionsquoten in den Jahren, in denen Landtagswahlen stattfanden im Durchschnitt niedriger waren als in Jahren, in denen keine Landtagswahlen stattfanden. Unternehmen schienen jedoch schon bei der Investitionsplanung die Wahlunsicherheit zu antizipieren, denn sie revidierten ihre Pläne kaum. In Kapitel 4 wird untersucht, ob politische Unsicherheit beeinflusst, wie Unternehmer ihre aktuelle Geschäftslage und zukünftige Geschäftsentwicklung wahrnehmen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Unternehmer erwarteten, dass ihr Geschäft sich besser vor Landtagswahlen und schlechter nach Landtagswahlen entwickeln wird. Der zweite Teil dieser Dissertation untersucht, wie ideologische Orientierung und Eigeninteresse von Politikern ihr Ethos und Verhalten prägen. Kapitel 5 beschreibt, wie ideologische Orientierung Einstellungen und Handlungen von Politikern in Deutschland prägt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Worte und Taten deutscher Landespolitiker und -regierungen in Bezug auf Haushaltskonsolidierung und Schuldenbremsen voneinander abgewichen haben. In Kapitel 6 wird untersucht, ob Parteien Politiker, die in namentlichen Abstimmungen von der Parteilinie abweichen, bestrafen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen nicht, dass Parteien das Abstimmungsverhalten beachteten und Politiker bestraften, die gegen die Parteienlinie gestimmt haben. In Kapitel 7 wird untersucht, inwiefern unterschiedliche ideologische Orientierungen der deutschen Wirtschaftsforschungsinstitute die Politikberatung in der Gemeinschaftsdiagnose beeinflusst haben.
H72|Der Demographieansatz im kommunalen Finanzausgleich|Zwischen den einzelnen Gemeinden der Flächenländer entwickelt sich die Bevölkerung teils sehr heterogen. Während die Bevölkerungszahl in einigen Gemeinden zunimmt, geht sie in den meisten Gemeinden zurück. Mit rückläufiger Bevölkerung stehen die Gemeinden vor der Herausforderung, ihre Ausgaben ebenfalls zu reduzieren. Die Anpassung der Ausgaben an eine sinkende Bevölkerungszahl kann jedoch einige Zeit in Anspruch nehmen. Damit finanzielle Engpässe während des Anpassungsprozesses in schrumpfenden Gemeinden vermieden werden, ist im kommunalen Finanzausgleich mancher Länder ein Demographieansatz implementiert. Dadurch wird den Gemeinden ein gewisses Zeitfenster zur Anpassung ihrer Ausgaben eingeräumt. In diesem Artikel wird die ökonomische Rechtfertigung des Demographieansatzes diskutiert. Es wird aufgezeigt, dass der Wissensstand über unvermeidbare Anpassungskosten und gerechtfertigte Anpassungszeiträume nach wie vor gering ist.
H72|Handelseffekte von Grenzkontrollen|Eine neue empirische Untersuchung des ifo Instituts zeigt, dass selbst bei einem vollständigen Zusammenbruch des Schengen-Raums das BIP in Deutschland lediglich zwischen 4 und 11 Mrd. Euro pro Jahr sinken würde; die weitaus realistischere Wiedereinführung von Kontrollen an den Flüchtlingsrouten würde zu Effekten zwischen 1 und 3 Mrd. Euro führen. Für Österreich liegen die Verluste bei 80 bis 210 Mio. Euro. Diese Kosten machen jedoch nur einen Bruchteil jener Belastungen aus, die durch fortgeführte ungeregelte Massenzuwanderung entstehen würden.
H72|Handelseffekte von Grenzkontrollen|Das am 26. März 1995 in Kraft gesetzte Schengener Abkommen hat einen Europäischen Binnenraum der Personenfreizügigkeit geschaffen und damit ein beispielloses kontinentales Integrationsziel erreicht. Die Bedrohung durch globalen Terrorismus sowie ein starker Anstieg der Flüchtlingszahlen in Europa seit Sommer 2015 haben eine Grundsatzdebatte darüber hervorgerufen, inwieweit offene Binnengrenzen politisch und ökonomisch haltbar sind. Diese Studie adressiert drei Fragestellungen: Wie stark wird die Reisezeit durch Grenzkontrollen beeinträchtigt? Beeinflusst die Abschaffung der Grenzkontrollen durch das Schengener Abkommen den grenzüberschreitenden Handel in Waren und Dienstleistungen? Welche Wohlfahrtseffekte sind aufgrund einer Veränderung internationaler Handelsvolumina in Folge einer Wiedereinführung von Grenzkontrollen im Schengen-Raum zu erwarten? Die Studie findet, dass die Überwindung von Ländergrenzen innerhalb des Schengen-Raumes um etwa 20 Minuten schneller gelingt als zwischen zwei Ländern, von denen mindestens eines nicht dem Schengen-Raum angehört. Eine Wiedereinführung der Grenzkontrollen im Schengen-Raum würde die bilateralen Warenexporte je Grenzübertritt um 2,7% reduzieren; entspricht einem Zolläquivalent von 0,54%. Die bilateralen Dienstleistungsexporte je Grenzübertritt würden um 4,2% reduziert; entspricht einem Zolläquivalent von 0,82%. Die deutschen BIP Einbußen durch einen vollständigen Zusammenbruch des Schengen-Raumes lägen zwischen 4 und 11 Mrd. Euro pro Jahr. Die weitaus realistischere Wiedereinführung von Kontrollen an den Flüchtlingsrouten würde für Deutschland zu BIP Effekten zwischen -1 und -3 Mrd. Euro jährlich führen. Ähnliche Analysen wurden für Bayern, Österreich und die Europäische Union durchgeführt.
H72|Beschönigen Landesregierungen fiskalische Kennziffern?|Beschönigen Landesregierungen ihre Finanzplanung vor Landtagswahlen? Die Ergebnisse einer neuen Studie zeigen, dass Regierungen in den alten Bundesländern keinen systematischen Einfluss auf die Finanzplanung nahmen. Im Gegensatz dazu unterschätzten die Regierungen in den neuen Bundesländern im Jahr vor einer Landtagswahl, verglichen mit anderen Jahren, die Landesausgaben, die Steuereinnahmen und den Finanzierungssaldo.
H72|Gebietsreformen: Hoffnungen, Risiken und Alternativen|Seit Jahrzehnten fusionieren westliche Industrienationen kommunale Gebietskörperschaften in der Hoffnung auf Kosteneinsparungen, eine höhere Leistungsfähigkeit der Verwaltung sowie lokale Wachstumsimpulse. Verlässliche wissenschaftliche Evidenz zu Gebietsreformen ist jedoch erst seit wenigen Jahren verfügbar. In diesem Beitrag geben wir einen Überblick über empirische Studien zu den kausalen Effekten von Gebietsreformen auf öffentliche Ausgaben, die Effizienz und Qualität der Verwaltung, lokales Wachstum sowie mögliche politische Kosten der Zusammenschlüsse. Unser Überblick zeigt, dass bisherige Studien nur selten fiskalische Effizienzrenditen bei früheren Gebietsreformen nachweisen können. Allerdings zeigen sich substanzielle politische Kosten wie ein Rückgang der Demokratiezufriedenheit, der Wahlbeteiligung, der Zahl der Kandidaten bei Kommunalwahlen sowie eine Stärkung populistischer Strömungen. Vor diesem Hintergrund sind Instrumente mit geringerer Eingriffsintensität – z.B. interkommunale Zusammenarbeit, Funktionalreformen sowie verschiedene Maßnahmen der Verwaltungsmodernisierung – Alternativen zu Gebietsreformen, die bisher aber nicht systematisch evaluiert wurden.

Con base en información de las ejecuciones presupuestales se evidencia que, si bien los ingresos totales del municipio han crecido a tasas similares a las de los municipios comparables, los gastos en Valledupar muestran una tendencia insostenible en el mediano plazo, lo que ha repercutido en un déficit de capital que comprometen la viabilidad fiscal del ente territorial y el cumplimiento de los compromisos adquiridos con el acuerdo de reestructuración.
H72|Political Alignment in the Time of Weak Parties: Electoral Advantages and Subnational Transfers in Colombia|This paper explores the effect of alignment between local and national politics in a context of weak parties. Based on a regression discontinuity design in close elections, we find that, in absence of strong parties, presidential coalitions become the focal point of political alignment in Colombia. In fact, while parties provide almost no electoral advantages to their members, candidates aspiring to national positions get significantly more votes in municipalities governed by mayors aligned with the incoming presidential coalitions. In turn, aligned mayors receive additional discretionary transfers from the National Government to finance road investments. These discretionary transfers, however, do not translate into local economic growth.

H72|Revisión de gasto sector salud|El presente documento pertenece a una serie de esfuerzos realizados por el Gobierno Nacional desde el 2015 por incorporar las Revisiones de Gasto como parte integral del proceso presupuestal. Esta herramienta busca lograr, a través de una metodología ordenada y sistemática, una mejor distribución de los recursos escasos, de forma que el gasto nacional se oriente hacia proyectos y programas de mayor impacto y que atienden necesidades más urgentes. Con la Revisión de Gasto del sector salud, se busca llegar a recomendaciones prácticas para la preparación del presupuesto y establecer lineamientos para lograr un proceso institucionalizado y comprensivo de planeación de gasto en el futuro. La metodología que aquí se presenta parte de aquella establecida por Banco Mundial en el 2016, la cual fue discutida, ajustada y acordada con el Departamento Nacional de Planeación, sin embargo la metodología no se aplicó para los recursos del Sistema General de Participaciones – SGP. En su implementación se contó con la participación del DNP, y las diferentes entidades del sector como son el Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, INS, INVIMA y la Superintendencia Nacional de Salud. De esta manera, se buscó crear un proceso participativo que contribuya a identificar de manera consensuada y organizada posibilidades específicas de ahorro y de reasignación de recursos dentro del sector, que se ajusten a las necesidades fiscales del Gobierno Nacional y a la coyuntura económica que han ocasionado recortes en los últimos años. De otra parte, se ha incluido una sección adicional enfocada al Sistema General de Participaciones, en consideración a la relevancia estratégica del mismo a nivel territorial y por el volumen de recursos involucrados. También se analizaron los proyectos correspondientes a salud del Sistema General de Regalías, aplicando la metodología con alguna variación de acuerdo con las características de los mismos y la información disponible.
H72|Eliciting women's willingness to take a job. Evidence from displaced and extremely poor women in Cali, Colombia|Este documento presenta un experimento de laboratorio sobre las preferencias de mujeres desplazadas por la violencia y en condición de extrema pobreza, residentes en Cali, Colombia, en el mercado laboral formal e informal. En este experimento se obtienen las decisiones que estas mujeres toman respecto al ingreso constante diario, obtenido de trabajar en casa en un negocio pequeño y de baja productividad (como cocinar o coser), contra la opción de aumentar su ingreso diario trabajando fuera de casa, como empleados. El salario elegido está sujeto al número de horas lejos de casa, el precio del transporte y el costo del cuidado de los niños y/o adolecentes, y adicionalmente de si el empleo es formal o informal. Un total de 225 mujeres participaron en este experimento. Para obtener las negociaciones sobre las opciones de trabajo al interior de los hogares, el grupo de tratamiento estaba compuesto por mujeres casadas con sus esposos presentes en el experimento, y un grupo de control conformado por mujeres casadas sin que sus esposos estuvieran presentes. Se invitaron parejas para negociar en diferentes escenarios. Los resultados muestran que no hay diferencias significativas entre los grupos de tratamiento y de control, en el caso de los empleos informales. Mujeres teniendo a sus esposos presentes eran menos propensas a aceptar empleos con un menor salario en el sector formal, y más propensas a quedarse en casa, que sus contrapartes que no tenían a sus maridos presentes. Las preferencias de trabajo también varían de acuerdo a los costos del cuidado y del número de hijos menores a los 18 años.

H72|Localización y especialización productiva regional en Colombia|Este artículo busca responder si las economías regionales colombianas fueron objeto de reconstitución en sus estructuras productivas entre 2000 y 2014, y de haberse dado, representar en qué sentido dicho proceso ha sido eficiente para los diferentes departamentos, desde los resultados y la dinámica de sus actividades económicas. Para ello, se ha recurrido a la aplicación de una serie de indicadores estadísticos particulares en el estudio de la geografía espacial, entre los que se destacan el análisis factorial bajo el método de componentes principales para explicar la orientación productiva regional; asimismo, se utilizaron en forma complementaria los índices sintéticos de especialización productiva regional, para analizar la dinámica de la diversificación productiva departamental. Los resultados de la presente investigación muestran que buena parte de las regiones colombianas han venido diversificando su actividad económica en franca orientación a las actividades de servicios, entre las que, sin embargo, son representativos los servicios de gobierno y de no mercado producidos por estas instituciones, dejando progresivamente de depender de unas escasas y concentradas fuentes de crecimiento, contrario a otras en las que ha sido y sigue siendo el sector primario particularmente el minero— el eje dinamizador de las estructuras productivas. Con ello, se ha retrasado el proceso de diversificación acorde con las demandas locales y un orden económico internacional que las requiere, en la medida del paso del tiempo, con mayor intensidad.******This document is directed to responding if Colombian regional economies restructured their productive activities from 2000 to 2014, and if so,illustrate the way that process has been effective in the different departments from the results and dynamics of their economic activities. For developing this exercise, we used a set of statistical indicators of spatial geography, among which is the factorial analysis, specifically the method of principal components, whose purpose was to identify the set activities whose performance explains more clearly the productive orientation of the departments, and complementary synthetic regional specialization indexes were employed in order to identify the degree and the changes of economic diversification, presented in those indicators. The results of this research shows that most of the Colombian regions have diversified their economic activity, with focus on service activities, among which are representative government and non-market services produced by those institutions, nowadays less dependent on few sources of growth. However, in other regions the primary sector, mainly mining activity, for many years has been the most important activity of production structures, affecting the process of full diversification, which is close to current local demands and international economic order the requests with greater intensity.******Este artigo procura responder se as economias regionais colombianas foram objeto de reconstituição de suas estruturas produtivas entre 2000 e 2014, e, se sim, representar em que sentido esse processo foi eficiente para os diferentes estados, a partir dos resultados e da dinâmica de suas atividades econômicas. Para isso, recorreu-se à aplicação de uma série de indicadores estatísticos particulares no estudo da geografia espacial, entre os quais se destacam a análise fatorial sob o método de componentes principais e os índices sintéticos de especialização produtiva regional. Os resultados da presente pesquisa mostram que boa parte das regiões colombianas vem diversificando sua atividade econômica em franca orientação às atividades de serviços, entre as quais, contudo, são representativos os serviços de governo e de não mercado produzido por essas instituições, o que deixa progressivamente de depender de umas escassas e concentradas fontes de crescimento, contrário a outras em que continuam sendo o setor primário —particularmente a mineração— o eixo dinamizador das estruturas produtivas. Com isso, tem sido atrasado o processo de diversificação plena em consonância com as demandas locais e com uma ordem econômica internacional que as demanda, com o passar do tempo, com maior intensidade.

H72|Social service provision as determinant of institutional efficiency of local self-governments|Motivation: The results presented in this paper constitute an element of the research performed as part of the project entitled ‘Institutional Efficiency vs. Local Economic Development: Modifying Factors and Interactions’. In particular, they refer to the partial objective consisting in identification and evaluation of factors that influence the institutional efficiency at the local level. Aim: The objective is to verify the hypothesis that communes manifesting greater activity in the financing of social services more frequently exceed the standard set of obligatory social services, undertake more advanced measures to improve their quality and availability and are able to accomplish the designated effects to a greater degree. Results: The hypothesis was verified on the basis of secondary data (from the Local Data Bank) and primary data (collected in the course of questionnaires circulated in the sample of 1,220 communes). Using the k-means procedure, financial activity coefficient, participation coefficient, task implementation coefficient, effect coefficient and Pearson’s coefficient, the research hypothesis was partially confirmed.
H72|Tax Federalism And Cooperative Games: Stability Analysis|This paper is devoted to analyzing the problem of how to distribute the public spending among the different regions of a country once all taxes are collected. We model the problem as a cooperative game in coalitional form. For that purpose, we need to specify how much tax is collected in every region (and coalition of regions) in the country under secession. In this way, we obtain the tax game of the problem, and its core is given by the set of stable tax allocations. Following such an approach, we are able to analyze the stability of a tax financing system. The Spanish case is considered and we show that the present regional financial system is unstable from this perspective.
