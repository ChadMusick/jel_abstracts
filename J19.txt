J19|Demographic change and climate change|The paper uses a continuous-time overlapping-generations model with endogenous growth and pollution accumulation over time to study the link between longevity and global warming. It is seen that increasing longevity accelerates climate change in a business-as-usual scenario without climate policy. If a binding emission target is set exogenously and implemented via a cap-and-trade system, the price of emission permits is increasing in longevity. Longevity has no effect on the optimal solution of the climate problem if perfect intergenerational transfers are feasible. If these transfers are absent, the impact of longevity is ambiguous.
J19|Birds, Birds, Birds: Co-Worker Similarity, Workplace Diversity, and Voluntary Turnover|We investigate how the demographic composition of the workforce along the sex, nationality, education, age, and tenure dimension affects voluntary turnover. Fitting duration models for workers' job-to-job moves that control for workplace fixed effects in a representative sample of large manufacturing plants in Germany during 1975–2016, we find that larger co-worker similarity in all five dimensions substantially depresses voluntary turnover whereas workplace diversity is of limited importance. In line with conventional wisdom, which has that birds of one feather flock together, our results suggest that workers prefer having co-workers of their kind and place less value on diverse workplaces.
J19|Is changing the minimum legal drinking age an effective policy tool?|In year 1991 regional governments in Spain started a period of implementation of a law that rose the Minimum Legal Drinking Age from 16 to 18 years old. This process was fully completed in year 2015. To evaluate the effects of this change on consumption of legal drugs and its related morbidity outcomes, we construct a regional panel dataset on alcohol consumption and hospital entry registers and compare variation in several measures of prevalence between the treatment group (16-18 years old individuals) and the control group (20-22 years old individuals). Our findings show important differences by gender. Firstly, our main result regarding overall drinking prevalence show reductions ranging from -11.57% for the subsample including both genders to -14.31% for the subsample of males. Secondly, effects on males are driven mainly by reductions in beer with alcohol consumption (-8.98%). Thirdly, effects on wine and/or cava drinking prevalence range from -12.62% for the subsample including both genders to -9.65% for the subsample of females. No effects regarding overall smoking prevalence are found. Fourthly, we do not find evidence that these reductions in alcohol consumption are translated into hospitalizations related to alcohol overdose. To our knowledge, this is the first paper providing evidence on gender-based differences to policies aimed at reducing alcohol consumption. Our results have important policy implications for countries currently considering changes in the Minimum Legal Drinking Age.
J19|New EU member countries? emigration: Projections for future|New EU member states face both migrational and natural demographic decline, while the old member states compensate the negative net birth rate with the immigration. A poor level of development of the economy as well as the accession to EU encouraged net emigration from the new member states. A panel data for the 12 new member states for the period 2007 - 2016 was used to determine how the length of membership and the GDP per capita trailing behind the EU average affect the proportion of the net emigration. It has been shown that a country has to reach at least 85% of the GDP p.c. of the EU average (measured in PPS) to prevent these tendencies, but this level increases with each year of membership by 1,37%. Croatian current GDP p.c. level at 60% of the EU average, lagging more than 30 percentage points behind the non-emigration level, is one of the reasons for the up to that moment unseen level of the net emigration (0,90% of population in 2016).
J19|Metods And Techniques For Analyzing The Population Evolution|On our planet live 7 billion people, every five days another million are born. Currently, world population is 10 times higher than 400 years ago. The demographic explosion occurred due to improved living standards and health, which allowed people to live longer than in previous centuries. Any economic process or phenomenon allows a mathematical description of its behaviour from an economic theory. It is very important to know the future evolution of the population and its structure therefore we using the forecasting models of the population. The paper presents the main models used in forecasting population and the advantages and disadvantages of each model.
J19|Gender, age, and competition: A disappearing gap?|Research on competitiveness at the individual level has emphasized sex as a physiological determinant, focusing on the gap in preference for competitive environments between men and women. This study presents evidence that women's preferences over competition change with age such that the gender gap, while large for young adults, disappears in older populations due to the fact that older women are much more competitive. Our finding that tastes for competition appear just as strong among older women as they are among men suggests a simple gender-based view of competitiveness is misleading; age seems just as important as sex.
J19|Corruption in the public and private sector from Romania: a comparative study|Corruption is becoming an increasingly acute problem lately for Romania and the authorities are trying to find solutions in this regard. Until now the anti-corruption strategy has undergone four stages, by approving as many sets of anti-corruption strategic documents (National Anti-corruption Strategies in 2001, 2005, 2008 and 2012). In this research, we started from the assumption that there is a correlation between corruption in the public sector and the corruption in the private sector, involving the corrupting power represented by the private sector and corruptible power represented by the public sector. The hypothesis was confirmed by detailed analyzes conducted in this regard using a number of variables such as the percentage of convictions in the public or private sector, the position that the culprit holds, the county he/she comes from, the institution in which they operate, type of sentence (suspended or performed) and the penalty in months. Then using the statistical functions Data Analysis, PivotTable of Excel software, the 3110 observations were processed. The centralizing tables were made by filtration and then the ventilation data by numerical and geographical coordinates. The quantitative information provided by these summary tables combined with qualitative information derived from extensive analyzes conducted during this investigation, led to the confirmation of the basic assumption that there is a correlation between corruption manifested in the public and private sector. This correlation becomes more powerful as the bureaucratic system, namely the workload in the public sector is growing. In this regard, we have concrete examples in the counties of Cluj, Timiș, Constanța, Prahova, Bucharest, respectively.
J19|The emergence of entrepreneurial ideas at universities in times of demographic change: evidence from Germany<BR>[Die Entstehung von Gründungsideen und neuen Unternehmen in Zeiten demografischen Wandels in ausgewählten deutschen Regionen]|Abstract The recent demographic trends in Western Europe imply tremendous structural change and are likely to heavily impact regional development. Against this background, we focus on entrepreneurial activities at universities and analyze regional and university specific determinants of the emergence of university entrepreneurship across regions that are differently challenged by demographic change. We underpin this quantitative assessment with interviews conducted in six case study regions with university staff responsible for technology transfer and the promotion of entrepreneurship to get some tentative insights about the perception of how demographic change might impact the entrepreneurial potential of universities. The results demonstrate that regional population decline is negatively related to entrepreneurial activities at universities. Furthermore, even university start-ups whose business idea is driven by detecting market opportunities related to demographic change are not more likely to emerge in regions that are especially challenged by demographic change. Finally, our interviews suggested that demographic change seems to play no role in the day-to-day work of technology transfer offices.
J19|Attitudes towards Intimate Partner Violence against Women in Latin America|In this paper we analyze the factors that explain attitudes towards intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) in 23 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Analyses of IPVAW in LAC are relatively scarce although there is growing concern about this problem in the region. We aim to assess the effect of individual and country characteristics using data from common sources for all countries. This work contributes to the sparse literature dealing with methods that attempt to assess the effect of macro variables. We perform a two-step procedure. We first estimate a logit model at the individual level, we calculate a measure of relative approval of IPVAW at country level and we use this measure as a dependent variable to estimate the effect of macro variables. Our study finds that most LAC patterns at individual level are similar to the international ones: approval of IPVAW is higher among women, people in rural areas, people in a disadvantaged socio-economic situation and individuals with some particular cultural characteristics. Unlikely international evidence, attitudes do not differ between ages. Our findings at country level show that approval of IPVAW increases with poverty, fertility rate and equal gender outcomes. It decreases with internet access and, with a lesser degree of robustness, with the time elapsed since the enactment of women’s suffrage. The most novel contribution of our work is the study of the variables at country level.
J19|Población y desarrollo en la periferia colombiana en el siglo XX|En este documento se analizan los cambios demográficos del Caribe y el Pacífico colombianos usando ocho censos, seis encuestas demográficas y registros vitales. Hasta cierto punto, los procesos de población han sido similares en estas regiones. Sin embargo, se encontraron diferencias notables en comparación con Bogotá y el resto del país. A pesar de una reducción sistemática en la razón de dependencia, la dependencia económica efectiva es superior a otras regiones de Colombia, siendo este uno de los límites al desarrollo económico de la periferia. Una estimación retrospectiva de la mortalidad en la primera infancia de estas regiones muestra una disminución sustancial en las últimas décadas, pero la diferencia con el resto del país representa la penalidad de nacer y vivir en las regiones menos desarrolladas de Colombia. Estimaciones indirectas de la mortalidad adulta y la esperanza de vida en edades productivas conducen a la misma conclusión.

En segundo lugar, se propone una tipología rural/urbana a escala municipal para España tomando en consideración tres criterios: la demografía – combinando densidades con umbrales mínimos de población -, la información sobre coberturas y usos del suelo y el grado de accesibilidad desde el mundo rural a las ciudades. Tras establecer la existencia de seis tipos distintos de municipios se procede a una caracterización de las provincias españolas en cuatro categorías diferentes haciendo uso de un análisis clúster.
J19|Smokers’ Preference for Divorce and Extramarital Sex|It is known that smokers are more impatient than nonsmokers and tend to prefer current benefits. However, smokers’ behavior in the marriage market has not as yet been well investigated. In this paper, individual-level data, which consist of over 10,000 observations from Japan, are used to examine how preferences for divorce and extramarital sex are different between smokers and nonsmokers. After controlling for various individual characteristics, the major findings are as follows: (1) smokers are more likely to have a positive view about divorce than nonsmokers; (2) smokers are more likely to have a positive view about extramarital sex than nonsmokers. These results were observed regardless of the individual’s marital status. The findings here about smoker’s preferences are consistent with the characteristics of smokers suggested in the literature. The findings suggest that whether one is a smoker presents important information in the marriage market, where information asymmetry can cause problems.
J19|"""Domografia"": storia dell’evoluzione urbana attraverso gli edifici"|"Il lavoro, di natura esplorativa, propone la ""domografia"", intesa come narrazione (graphia) dell’edificato (domos), in contrapposizione a quella della popolazione (demos) riferita esclusivamente alla popolazione umana. Scopo dell’analisi ""domografica"", parafrasando la definizione di Colombo (1959), è quello di studiare ""l’insieme degli edifici, [in particolare] del loro ammontare, della loro composizione, del loro sviluppo, dei loro caratteri generali, considerati principalmente da un punto di vista quantitativo [""]. Il riferimento è perciò a indicatori di stato e di movimento dell’insieme degli edifici di un territorio. Il recente Censimento degli edifici, che ha interessato i Comuni con popolazione superiore ai 20.000 abitanti e i capoluoghi di provincia, con l’utilizzo della Rilevazione dei Numeri Civici (RNC) ha introdotto la rilevazione puntuale degli edifici e delle loro caratteristiche. Tale profonda innovazione nell’ambito della statistica ufficiale consente l’applicazione di varie metodologie di analisi territoriale. L’applicazione di tecniche demografiche all’edificato offre una descrizione del paesaggio interessante per capirne l’evoluzione storica e funzionale e nuovi possibilità di analisi nell’ambito della pianificazione territoriale, con un approccio che si può appunto definire ""domografico"". Gli strumenti GIS valorizzano poi i contenuti individuati, oltre a delineare le evoluzioni territoriali intercorse."
J19|The schooling repayment hypothesis for private transfers: evidence from the PROGRESA/Oportunidades experiment|Abstract The schooling repayment hypothesis for private transfers predicts a positive relationship between the amount of parental investment in children’s education and the amount that adult children transfer to their parents. We provide evidence on the repayment motive using data from the Mexican conditional cash transfer program PROGRESA/Oportunidades (PO). PO pays a transfer to parents for sending their children to school. Thus, if private transfers from adult children to parents are in part repayment for parental schooling investments made in the past, then PO should decrease these transfers—parents were already exogenously compensated by the government for sending their kids to school and not to work. Exploiting the exogenous variation in the amount of cash transfers a household receives from PO for sending its children to school, we compare the private transfers received in 2007 by parental households who had children 0–16 in 1997 and started receiving the programs’ benefits in 1998 with the transfers received by similar parental households who started receiving benefits in 1999. Results suggest a repayment motive exists. That is, PO is causing adult children to transfer less resources to their parents.

J19|On Income Inequality and Population Size|The pursuit of having an appropriate level of income inequality should be viewed as one of the biggest challenges facing academic scholars as well as policy makers. Unfortunately, research on this issue is currently lacking. This study is the first to introduce the theoretical concept of targeted level of income inequality for a given size of population. By employing the World Bank’s data on population size and Gini coefficient from sixty-nine countries in 2012, this study finds that the relationship between Gini coefficient and natural logarithm of population size is nonlinear in the form of a second degree polynomial function. The estimated results using regression analysis show that the majority of countries in the sample have Gini coefficients either too high or too low compared to their appropriate values. These findings could be used as a guideline for policy makers before designing and implementing public policies in order to achieve the targeted level of income inequality.
J19|A SAS® Macro for the Generalized RAS Algorithm|Demographers and economists frequently encounter the problem of constraining matrices of mixed sign to controls of possibly mixed sign. The recently developed Generalized RAS (GRAS) algorithm is presented to solve these problems. The GRAS algorithm produces a unique solution that minimizes an entropy-like function. The algorithm is applied to a well-known example and compared to the solution originally obtained using a generalization of the Akers-Siegel procedure.
J19|Construcción de una tipología rural/urbana para los municipios españoles|Este artículo pretende establecer criterios para delimitar de modo riguroso qué es lo que constituye un territorio rural o urbano, dadas las limitaciones de las metodologías tradicionales.

El resultado es el establecimiento de seis tipos distintos de municipios. This article aims to establish criteria for rigorously define what constitutes a rural or urban area, given the limitations of traditional methodologies. Secondly, a rural / urban typology is proposed at the municipal level for Spain taking into account three criteria: demographics - combining densities with minimum population thresholds — information on land use and the degree of accessibility from the rural world to cities. This results in establishing the existence of six different types of municipalities.
J19|Electronic monitoring and recidivism. Quasi-experimental evidence from Norway|The replacement of custodial with non-custodial sanctions holds the potential to reduce recidivism as well as other costs associated with imprisonment. However, the causal impacts on recidivism of noncustodial sanctions in general, and electronic monitoring (EM) programs in particular, remain unclear. We estimate the effect of EM on recidivism by exploiting an EM program that was gradually introduced in Norwegian counties from 2008, using difference-in-differences and instrumental variable designs. Results show that introducing EM reduced 2-year recidivism rates by about 10 percent, which corresponds to about 19 percent for those actually serving on EM. We find no effects on recidivism intensity or severity. Subsample analyses show that the effect estimates are strongest among offenders without previous imprisonment or recent unemployment spells, and although between-groups differences are statistically non-significant, this suggest that avoiding prison stigma and maintaining workplace relations can be important to reduce recidivism and promote desistance. The reliability of our results is somewhat challenged by unstable pre-implementation trends and signs that more people are convicted to EM-qualifying sentences when EM is introduced.
J19|How do entrepreneurial bosses influence their employees' future entrepreneurship choices?|We adopt a process-based approach to investigate the influence of entrepreneurial bosses on the two main decisions of employees towards becoming entrepreneurs: exit from the current firm and entry into entrepreneurship. In other words, we study the push and pull mechanisms possibly underlying the influence of entrepreneurial bosses. We do so by employing an identification strategy based on comparisons of same-gender matches of bosses and employees, using rich register data for Denmark. We show that same-gender entrepreneurial bosses have a great impact on employees' future entrepreneurship choices, especially among women. We do not find any evidence that female bosses push female employees out of the workplace, by creating a discriminatory environment that forces them to search for alternative career paths. Instead, our analysis finds consistent support for pull mechanisms, with role modeling being the main explanation for the positive influence of female entrepreneurial bosses on female employees' transition into entrepreneurship. We show that the female boss effect is greater than other social interactions identified in prior research. We conclude that entrepreneurial bosses can be role models and female entrepreneurial bosses may thus act as a lever to reducing gender gaps in entrepreneurship rates.
J19|Gender Roles and Medical Progress|Maternal mortality was the second-largest cause of death for women in childbearing years until the mid-1930s in the United States. For each death, 20 times as many mothers suffered pregnancy-related conditions, which made it hard for them to engage in market work. Between 1930 and 1960 there was a remarkable improvement in maternal health. We argue that this development, by enabling women to reconcile work and motherhood, was essential for the joint rise in women’s labor force participation and fertility over this period. We also show that the diffusion of infant formula played an important auxiliary role.
J19|The Nautical Quality Index (NaQi): Methodology and Application to the Case of Italy|The present work aims at setting up an index to rank different coastal territories. The objective is to provide insights for future developing paths: a tool in the service of public decision-makers who govern the territories and optimize the local resources for the purpose of economic development, with the industry of boating involved. This paper offers indexes based on relevant indicators, all of which are available in advanced countries. The construction of the Nautical Quality Index (NaQi) follows a process that strictly adheres to the most reliable method of calculation: starting from 18 variables selected ad hoc, which are grouped into six synthetic indicators. The overall indicator is obtained as the sum of each partial indicator, appropriately re-standardized and weighted for the vector of dimensional weighting. The resulting NaQi is therefore a general classification, obtained from the sum of six synthetic indices.

To some extent, population processes have been similar in the Caribbean and the Pacific regions; however, salient differences were found in comparison to Bogotá and the rest of the country. Despite a systematic reduction on age dependency ratios, the effective dependency ratio remains higher than other Colombian regions, being one of the limits to the economic development of peripheral regions. A retrospective estimation of the under-5 mortality in the Pacific shows a substantial decline within the past few decades, but the gap to the rest of the country represents the negative penalty of being born and living in the less developed regions of Colombia. Indirect estimations of the adult mortality and the life expectancy at working ages lead to the same conclusion.

J19|Refugee immigration and public finances in Sweden|This study estimates the fiscal cost of refugee immigration. This is done by calculating the total value of economic resources that are redistributed through the public sector in Sweden in 2007 to the population of immigrants who once arrived in the country as refugees or their family members. The total redistribution corresponds to 1.0% of Swedish GDP in the same year. Four-fifths of it is due to lower public per-capita revenues from refugees compared with the total population, and one-fifth is due to higher per-capita public costs associated with refugees.

Several works compare the two approaches claiming that the Co-phonology approach is more formally parsimonious than Indexed Constraint approach. This paper presents an analysis of the stress system in Mehweb (Dargwa, Nakh Daghestanian) using a modification of the Indexed Constraint approach, which I call “Lexically Filled OT”. I argue that this approach is more parsimonious than both Co-phonology and Indexed Constraints

The analysis is based on data from an author's empirical research, conducted within the “Role conflicts of the modern Bulgarian woman: between family and career” thesis. The survey was conducted in July-August 2013. The analysis focuses on the following problem-thematic fields: The modern woman between family and work and the influences between the two areas; The model of a modern female personal and professional development, represented by value orientation, beliefs and attitudes of women regarding family and work; The balance between family and professional life, or to what extent modern Bulgarian women manage to achieve a balance between their roles in both areas. The main reasons (not) to achieve a harmonious reconciliation of family and professional roles; The generational affiliation as a factor for family and career realization – specificity for the young and mature generations of women. Positioning of family and work in the course of women’s life.

Avoir un robot comme compagnon ou aide-soignant à domicile n’est plus du domaine de la science-fiction, mais est devenue une réalité. Ceci grâce à l’inventivité et à la créativité de nombreux entrepreneurs passionnés en France et dans d’autres pays. Mais, quelles sont les motivations de ces entrepreneurs ?

J19|Competences of adult Poles - evaluation of the age as a differentiating factor|Skills and competences are important factors influencing the human capital resources especially in the era of the knowledge-based economy. All professional activities demand various competences. Moreover, it becomes necessary to continuously enrich knowledge and skills because of the rapidly changing environment. Possessing and developing skills turn out to be indispensable elements in the functioning of the labour market. On the other hand, Poland, as many other European countries, faces the problem of the aging society and potential lack of the qualified labour force in the future. Qualifications development is therefore extremely important from the economic point of view. This paper concerns the topic of the resources of the competences possessed by the adult Poles. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the assessment of the competences made by the respondents of the nationwide survey on the human capital in Poland. Skills from various fields are taken into account. Special attention is paid to the relationships between the age and the declared skills. One of the key questions under consideration is if there are substantial demographical determinants of the competences. The dataset used for the analyses comprises variables from various measurement scales. Chosen statistical techniques adequate for such data are applied to explore and describe the nature of the relationships. Additionally, the analyses are supported by some visualization methods appropriate for a multidimensional approach.
J19|Benchmarking Metis Economic and Social Development|This is a report on the socio-economic development of the Metis in Canada. The report identifies appropriate indicators to benchmark Metis socio-economic development against non-Aboriginal socio-economic development, while establishing a benchmark against which future progress can be gauged. Quite briefly, there have been strong gains in Metis socio-economic development, especially concerning income and education. In particular, Metis median income reached 86.7 per cent of non-Aboriginal median income in 2010, up from 72.9 per cent in 2000. In terms of education, the share of the Metis with a college, CEGEP or other non-university certificate or diploma as their highest degree actually surpassed the share of the non-Aboriginal population in similar areas by 2011. However, there are still a number of gaps that remain. For example, the Metis continue to have poorer indicators of health, especially concerning smoking. Furthermore, the Metis still have lower levels of suitable housing than the non-Aboriginal population. One of the most interesting findings of the report is the large gaps that exist within the Metis Nation between provinces. The report concludes that concerted efforts, determined cooperation, and substantial participation from Metis leaders and Metis organizations at both the provincial and national level will be required to close the remaining gaps between provinces within the Metis Nation and between the aggregate Metis and non-Aboriginal populations.
J19|Career, Private Life, and the Well-Being among College-educated West German Women|This paper describes to what extent college-educatedWest German women manage to reconcile a career and a private life. In addition, it explicitly investigates how the concurrence of career and cohabitation/family/motherhood is linked to women’s life satisfaction. I attempt to overcome the difficulties associated with estimating this relation using fixedeffects models. The results suggest that only a small fraction of woman-year observations is categorised as having a career and cohabitation/family/children simultaneously. Considering different birth cohorts and generations of West German women, there are no significant improvements in the reconciliation between career and family. Further, while there are life-satisfaction gains related to both “career” and “cohabitation/family” separately, their interaction terms throughout are negative.
J19|The Impact Of Risk Of Poverty On Segments Of The Market In Romania|In the present work I presented the risk of poverty in Romania considering the economic and social determination. I highlighted that poverty in Romania, is a mix of economic, educational, cultural etc. factors and reinforced by the lack of family or social support. Among the most significant correlative causes of poverty are: lack of money-unemployment, low salaries, lack of money, lack of food-hunger, deprivation, misery, lack of culture, lack of housing, disease, decay, addictions, political causes, individual causes, etc. I analyzed the dynamics of the decision-making behavior of the population of Romania both as a whole and as segments of the market, in terms of age, sex, residence environment, etc. in the market acts, regarding the purchase and consumption decision. The approach and treatment of the poverty must be understand regarding to the systemic economic-social-psychologically interaction. The impact of risk of poverty on the segments of the market is reflected in the production of goods and services; increasing of this type of risk lead to diminishing and modifying the request and further lead to diminishing supply, business failure, etc.
J19|Town Twinning and German City Growth| Brakman S., Garretsen H. and Oumer A. Town twinning and German city growth, Regional Studies. After the Second World War, town twinning became popular, notably in Germany. This was mainly a reaction to the war experience, and it was initially aimed at creating renewed international understanding and cooperation between former enemies. It also reduced transaction costs. The results show that counties that engage in town twinning grow faster than cities that do not have twinning partners. In particular, both the number and the intensity of twinning relations as well as town twinning with French cities positively affect city growth. Positive population growth effects of town twinning are also mostly confined to the larger German cities.
J19|Testosterone is associated with self-employment among Australian men|Testosterone has pronounced effects on men's physiological development and smaller, more nuanced, impacts on their economic behavior. In this study of 1199 Australian adult males, we investigate the relationship between the self-employed and their serum testosterone levels. Because prior studies have identified that testosterone is a hormone that is responsive to external factors (e.g. competition, risk-taking), we explicitly control for omitted variable bias and reverse causality by using an instrumental variable approach. We use insulin as our primary instrument to account for endogeneity between testosterone and self-employment. This is because prior research has identified a relationship between insulin and testosterone but not between insulin and self-employment. Our results show that there is a positive association between total testosterone and self-employment. Robustness checks using bioavailable testosterone and another similar instrument (daily alcohol consumption) confirm this positive finding.
J19|Demographics, human capital, and the demand for housing|This paper investigates how the demand for residential real estate depends on age and other demographic characteristics at the household level. Based on a detailed cross-sectional survey of English households, it finds that housing demand is significantly determined by a household’s human capital, and that housing demand generally increases with age. After retirement it declines, but only to a small extent. High education levels, good health, and high income will increase a household’s demand for housing even when households age. These results are relevant for countries that experience population shrinkage, but where total housing demand could still grow in the future despite stagnating household numbers and aging populations. The paper further shows that changes in demographics lead to very heterogeneous demand responses for different housing attributes, providing information regarding the future qualitative demand for housing.
J19|Diversity and Social Capital in the U.S: A Tale of Conflict, Contact or Total Mistrust?|This paper explores the relationship between ethnic fractionalization and social capital. First, using data from 1990, 1997 and 2005 we test for time differences in the impact of ethnic fractionalization on social capital. Subsequently, we examine U.S. data for evidence consistent with the pro- posed outcomes in the conflict, contact, or hunker-down theses discussed in Putnam (2007). Putnam (2007) examines what happens to â€œtrustâ€ or â€œsocial capitalâ€ when individuals of different ethnicity are introduced into social, political and/or economic groups over time. Using an instru- mental variable (IV) estimator, we find little evidence of heterogeneity in the impact of ethnic fractionalization on social capital over our period of analysis. In addition, using both fixed effect and IV estimators, we reject the contact hypothesis, but find evidence consistent with the outcomes predicted in both conflict hypothesis and Putnamâ€™s hunker-down hypoth- esis in inter-ethnic relations. Due to data limitations, we are unable to test directly which of these two thesis are more relevant for the U.S ex- perience. However, we provide suggestive evidence in support of conflict hypothesis over the hunker-down hypothesis. Our results suggest that as communities become more diverse, there is a tendency for social capital to decline.
J19|Optimization Of Deterministic Population Dynamics Models|The aim of this contribution is to apply methods from optimal control theory to the mathematical modeling of biological pest control. We formulate a pest control strategy for nonlinear Kolmogorov system of n interacting populations by introducing natural enemies as a control function. The sufficient conditions for existence of an optimal feedback control function are based on the fact, that the steady-state solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation is a Lyapunov function guaranteeing stability and optimality. We apply those general results to the Lotka-Volterra system with a logistic rate of increase of the prey population and Holling’s second type functional response of the predator population, to illustrate biological control of pest mite in stored grain Acarus siro by predatory mite Cheyletus eruditus.
J19|Networks And Organizational Analysis: Roles, Positions And Power Of Fragmentation Of Social And Commercial Relationships Redes Y Analisis Organizacional: Roles, Posiciones Y Poder De Fragmentacion De Las Relaciones Sociales Y Comerciales|"With the Cooperative Society of Agricultural Producers and Lombricultores of San Pedro TlapacoyÃ¡n, Veracruz, Mexico"", we observe a problem is the attitude and inter organizational relationships of the producers. Through indicators of social nets, we observe the position of actor inside the net of relationships and the relationships plays with more power of fragmentation in the net. The results indicate the importance of an actor is more in function of its position in the net that of the number of relationships that each member of the group of producers presents. We found that each actor plays different roles in the function of his individual interests and that social relationships present bigger power of fragmentation on commercial relationships."
J19|Did Men Benefit More from Medical Progress in Recent Decades? Cause-of-Death Contributions to the Decreasing Sex-Gap in Life Expectancy in the United States| BACKGROUND The narrowing of the sex gap in life-expectancy since the mid-1970s in the United States has been explained by women’s growing involvement in previously male-dominated risky behaviours, and in particular tobacco consumption. We argue that the narrowing sex-gap could additionally have resulted from greater benefits to men than women from new medical technologies due to differential access and the fact that many medical solutions result from studies based entirely on men. METHODS We decompose the sex gap in the mean duration of life between ages 0 and 75 into four large cause of death groups according to the index of amenable mortality. FINDINGS In the studied years, with the exception of 1985-1995, the sex gap decreased due to causes amenable to public policy interventions. An important contributor to this change was increased smoking among women. The observed narrowing of the sex gap due to medically amenable causes is limited to age 0. When a new group of causes amenable to medical interventions was formed by including half of the contribution of IHD, it had a positive contribution to the narrowing sex gap, and in particular at ages 1-75 years. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that when the group of medically amenable causes of death includes half of the contribution of IHD, the narrowing-sex gap in life-expectancy results from the two sexes benefiting to a different degree from medical developments due to differential access or from the fact that treatments are better fitted to male physiological needs than those of women.
J19|Learning and earning: Evidence from a randomized evaluation in India|Our paper presents the economic returns from participating in a subsidized vocational education program for women residing in low-income households in India. We combine pre-intervention data with two rounds of post-intervention data in an experimental framework to quantify the 6- and 18-month treatment effects of the program. The 6-month treatment effects indicate that women who were offered the vocational education program are 6% points more likely to be employed, 4% points more likely to be self-employed, work 2.5 additional hours per week, and earn 150% more per month than women in the control group. Using a second round of follow-up data collected 18 months after the intervention, we find that the 6-month treatment effects are all sustained over the medium run. Finally, cost-benefit analysis indicates that the program costs can be recovered with less than four years of employment. Overall our findings suggest that vocational education may serve to be a promising avenue through which young women can contribute to their household welfare.
J19|Modelling the Age Dynamics of Chronic Health Conditions: Life-Table-Consistent Transition Probabilities and their Application|We derive transition probability matrices for chronic health conditions using survey prevalence data. Matrices are constructed for successive age groups and the sequence represents the “age dynamics” of the health conditions for a stationary population – the probabilities of acquiring the conditions, of moving from one chronic conditions state to another, and of dying. One can simulate the life path of a cohort under the initial probabilities, and again under altered probabilities to explore the effects of eliminating a particular condition or reducing its mortality probabilities. We report the results of such simulations and note the general applicability of the methods.
J19|The Political Speech in the Play O scrisoare pierdutã [A Lost Letter]|The article proposes to analyze the political speech in the comedy O scrisoare pierdutã by I.L. Caragiale. I will analyze the speeches of the characters Farfuridi and Caþavencu from scene I, act III, respectively the scenes V, VI, VII of the same act, from a semantic and pragmatic perspective. Both characters want to candidate for the position of deputy and the means to achieve their goal are different. The speeches of the two characters breaches the principle of the logical non-contradiction, the conversation maxims and the politeness rules, thus leading to create the effect of lack of logical-semantic organisation and lack of diplomacy in interpersonal relations. The author’s purpose is to get the comical effect by irony of the demagogue politician, embodied into the two characters.
J19|Family attention care and transfers|In this paper, we examine the pure exchange motive for intergenerational transfers within the family. We consider a model where a parent offers a financial transfer in exchange for the care services of the child. Using a Stackelberg game, we study the optimal attention care-money contract between the generations. We prove that the amount of gift received may be either positively or negatively related with the child's income. In addition, the relationship between the two variables is non linear and affected by the parent's degree of risk aversion. This non linearity, which has been largely neglected to date in empirical analyses, may explain why the exchange transfer motive has received little support in developed countries
J19|Are Fertility Responses to Local Unemployment Shocks Homogenous Across Social Strata? Evidence from England, 1994 to 2010|Are fertility responses to local unemployment homogenous across sub-demographic groups? This paper investigates how changes in local unemployment rates affect household fertility decisions in England while taking sub-demographic differences into account. Recognizing that labor market status is a major determinant of child rearing decision, and assuming that children are normal goods, this paper hypothesizes that an increase in male and female unemployment will have different effects on the current period fertility. Using the Labor Force Survey and Birth Statistics data from the Office for National Statistics, this study shows that female unemployment tends to increase births whereas male unemployment has the opposite effect. More importantly, reported results indicate that unemployment and fertility relation exhibits strong age group and educational attainment gradients. In addition, a persistent counter-cyclical fertility pattern has also been documented at the ceremonial county level.
J19|Wpływ systemów emerytalnych na efekt Laffera w krajach OECD|Celem artykułu było wyznaczenie maksimum krzywej Laffera w gospodarkach poszczególnych krajów OECD posiadających instytucjonalne systemy emerytalne. Do realizacji tego zadania został wykorzystany model matematyczny opracowany wcześniej przez autora. Model przewiduje teoretycznie możliwość wystąpienia efektu związanego z krzywą Laffera w gospodarce z instytucjonalnym systemem emerytalnym. Podstawowa formuła modelu łączy produkt gospodarki tworzący wynagrodzenie czynników wytwórczych (kapitału i pracy) ze zmienną, którą jest stosunek liczby emerytów do liczby pracujących. Metodyka badania uwzględniała trzy etapy analizy z wykorzystaniem dostępnych danych statystycznych krajów OECD oraz bazy danych Banku Światowego. Pierwszy i drugi etap badania nie wypadł pomyślnie dla wszystkich krajów OECD. Kryteria modelu dla okresu 2001–2010 spełniło tylko 16 gospodarek na 34 zbadanych. Jednakże obliczenia przeprowadzone w oparciu o dane statystyczne potwierdzają przewidywania modelu. Gospodarka każdego kraju OECD może znajdować się w maksimum krzywej Laffera. To maksimum może być związane ze stosunkiem liczby emerytów do liczby pracujących z zakresu od 0 do 1. Może być ono umiejscowione bliżej 0 lub bliżej 1. Zależy to od elastyczności produktu względem kapitału w gospodarce. Przeprowadzone obliczenia nie rozstrzygają jednak, jaka jest rzeczywista w danej gospodarce elastyczność produktu względem kapitału.

J19|Demographic Characteristics Of Rural Populations In Vojvodina As A Factor Of Rural Economy Diversification| It has long been clear that rural economy involves not only agriculture, but all human, social, natural and material resources in rural areas. Human resources are of particular importance since limitations in human capital may limit the use of other resources and could be (and often they are) a ‘bottleneck’ of rural development. Serbia is characterised by the long-lasting lack of a viable and high-quality labour force in rural areas. That makes the inclusion of the rural population in the wider labour market difficult and limits their access to other markets (knowledge, information, and financial capital). This, consequently, leads to further impoverishment of the rural population, making poverty both a cause and a consequence. Starting from the above mentioned importance of human resources in this paper, the main demographic characteristics of the rural population in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina have been analysed and discussed as an important factor of rural economy diversification. The analysis conducted has shown that: i) the rural population in Vojvodina decreases (faster than the urban) ii) the ageing index in rural areas has increased more slowly in rural than in urban areas, but it is still higher iii) the level of education of the rural population is lower than that of the urban population. These findings point out that the demographic characteristics of the rural population might be a serious constraint on rural economy diversification and rural development in Vojvodina. Decision makers must be aware of this and adjust development policies to the existing conditions.
J19|Variable Populations and the Measurement of Poverty and Inequality: A Selective Overview|The present paper is a selective overview, very considerably based on work in which the author himself has been involved, of the difficulties which can arise in the measurement of poverty and inequality when one compares populations of differing size. The paper begins with certain problems attending the measurement of poverty when the overall population size is fixed but the numbers of the poor are permitted to vary: one discovers a certain commonality of outcomes between Derek Parfit’s quest for a satisfactory theory of wellbeing and the economist’s quest for a satisfactory measure of poverty. Complications arising from both the poverty and inequality rankings of distributions when the aggregate size of the population is allowed to vary are also investigated. It is suggested in the paper that, from the perspectives of both logical consistency and ethical appeal, there are problems involved in variable population comparisons of poverty and inequality which deserve to be taken note of and enquired into.

J19|Residential satisfaction in place market segments|The paper shows relationships between level of residential satisfaction and form of differentiation of marketing policy in place market segments. A combination of three criteria of place attractiveness (retention and attraction, conditions for natural growth, and settling) was chosen to classify place market segments, and distribution of residents by the level of satisfaction as a result of specific place marketing policy for all the segments were hypothesized. The results of the empirical study partially confirm developed theoretical typologies. The paper also demonstrates, that driver forces of the place marketing differentiation are related to both current activities of place marketers and external factors. Using the results of the study, it becomes possible to choose a relevant form of differentiation of place marketing policy and interpret its results adequately.
J19|Which Children Stabilize Marriage?|Children can be considered as a marriage-specific investment that increases the value of the marriage, making a divorce more costly. We exploit the richness of pre- and post-marital information from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 79, for the United States, to investigate the relation between fertility and marriage instability. In our model of marriage breakdown, we use the number of siblings of the respondent and, alternatively, multiple births, to instrument the number of children conceived during first marriage. Our results indicate that the presence of children significantly reduces the probability of marital disruption. In addition, the younger the children, the greater the deterrent effect. In contrast, we conclude that children conceived before first marriage increase the risk of marital disruption. Finally, the higher the parents' level of education, the larger the positive effect of fertility on marital stability.
J19|Differences in body mass indices for males imprisoned in the 19th century American South|A limited but increasing amount of research is being done on historical body mass index values. This paper uses 19th century Tennessee State Penitentiary records to demonstrate that Southern BMI values were in the normal range. There is little evidence of a Southern mulatto BMI advantage. Farmer BMIs were consistently heavier than non-farmers. Southern black BMIs remained constant throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries; however, white BMIs declined during the early 20th century.

J19|Personnel Satisfaction Study regarding the Emergency Medical Services’ Quality of Bucharest Hospitals|The current Romanian medical system is going throw a complex process of reform based mainly in winning the citizens, professionalization the management and increasing the funding levels. The present study is an analysis of the satisfaction level felt by medical staff in emergency reception units in Bucharest hospitals and brings a novelty in the field of medical research, based on the problems approached and the emphasis placed in observation the quality and the performance of medical services. This study shows how satisfied is a medical personnel in the working environment and identify what are the main drawbacks that generate disaffection and inefficiency in public medical emergency services in Bucharest. The research methodology used is based on a target group consisting of medical personnel’s in emergency reception units analyzed. The tools used for data collection were questionnaires and non-participatory observations were processed by computer program called SPSS. The results obtained from the medical staff examined shows dissatisfaction towards salary level, the level of endowment with modern equipment and informative materials available which capture the need to create a remuneration system based on performance criteria and competitiveness associated with a penalty system in parallel. The beneficiaries of this study are researchers in the medical field, hospitals surveyed, managers and representatives of research and development departments of analyzed hospitals taking into account their low activity in recent years.
J19|Cambios en la estructura demográfica de Boyacá y su impacto socioeconómico (1985-2005)|Resumen El presente trabajo pretende verificar que existió un proceso migratorio interno hu- mano, de los municipios periféricos de Boyacá hacia los del centro –Tunja, Duitama, Sogamoso, Chiquinquirá–, y del departamento hacia afuera (Bogotá). En consecuencia, el crecimiento de la población de Boyacá no está determinado por factores norma- les de crecimiento vegetativo o de reducción de la población. En particular, se plantea que dichas migraciones tienen como punto de llegada los municipios del eje central del departamento, pero estos no presentan gran crecimiento demográfico que evidencie la totalidad de la población que emigra del resto de pueblos, dirigiéndose al núcleo del país, específicamente a la ciudad de Bogotá, por ser el principal punto de desarrollo económico de Colombia.
J19|Segmentation of inhabitants in place marketing: the case of karelian towns|Inhabitants become the important target group of place marketing along with other place consumers. The problem of defining criteria for the attractiveness of places for different inhabitants and classification of factors is one of the most important for the marketing policies aimed at development of local communities. The paper shows that a combination of three criteria of place attractiveness (retention and attraction, conditions for natural growth, and settling) may be considered as the main characteristic of a place market segment that determines its distinctive attributes. Based on these criteria, the heuristic monothetic 3-dimensional typology of market segments and the hypothetic classification of distinctive characteristics of the Russian place market segments were developed.The combination of three demographic indicators (emigration, birth rate, difference of general birth rates, and emigration of natives - in accordance with the criteria of place attractiveness) were selected to estimate the place consumers’ behavior in the segments. The results of the empirical study partially confirm developed theoretical typologies. In addition, they allow concluding that both tangible and “intangible” attributes of places can have an impact on the behavior of inhabitants as place consumers. This paper also shows that all of the studied attributes depend on market segments, which towns occupy. Study results are important for marketing analysis and marketing policy of Russian towns.
J19|Mortality Trends in Russia Revisited-A Survey-|The aim of this paper is to use previous research to identify determinants of mortality rates, an economic variable that affects the size of Russia's population. It is impossible to explain mortality solely in terms of socioeconomic factors, so the survey of medical literature conducted here was essential. It was concluded that factors such as a deterioration in levels of medical care or an increase in environmental pollution could not easily explain the rise in mortality rates throughout the Soviet era and the fluctuating mortality rates seen after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Previous research has explored the relationship between Russians and alcohol, which had been described anecdotally in literary works, the media, and so on, and demonstrated the significance of alcohol consumption as a factor exerting a decisive influence on long-term changes in mortality rates and the probability of death in Russia since the transition to capitalism.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J19|When do people become adults? The Uruguayan case|We explore what are the key facts that Uruguayans consider relevant for being an adult. In particular, we assess the linkages between adulthood and skills, income, labor market participation and marital status, among others personal attributes. With the aim of identifying behavioral patterns, we estimate ordered probit models. Our dataset is the 2008 survey carried out by the International Social Survey Program in Uruguay.This article points out that gender, age and the educational level are critical factors for understanding opinions about adulthood. Moreover, we extend previous findings by showing that living some circumstances does not make people to consider that they are relevant experiences. For example, regarding parenthood, there are non-significant differences between those who have had a child and those who have not.
J19|The Effects of Estate Sales of Residential Real Estate on Price and Marketing Time|This study investigates price and time-on-market effects of estate sales of houses versus typical housing transactions using a sample of 180,921 sold properties. The hypothesis that estate sales sell at a discount and sell more quickly than typical houses is supported by the empirical results. The results indicate that estate sale properties sell at a 3.6% price discount and sell about 3.4% (i.e. approximately 4 days) more quickly. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012
J19|Are daughters always the losers in the chore war? Evidence using household and twin data from Vietnam|This paper examines the gender gap in the division of housework in Vietnam among the household heads f children who are not married and still reside in the family home. We find that in a typical day, a daughter has a higher probability of undertaking some housework and for some 9.66 to 17.94 minutes longer than would an equivalent son. Among siblings in two-child families, a daughter who has a brother has the largest gender gap. However, once we control for differences in genetic endowment, with both twins involved in at least some housework, male-female twins spend approximately the same amount of time on housework. In a mutual decision-making scenario, among siblings in two-child families, an elder daughter would shoulder housework for the other sibling while the reverse holds for younger sisters, but only where the children are 20 years of age or younger. In addition, we find that besides sharing the family total housework load, one minute spent on housework by the mother inspires a 0.0481-0.298 minute increase in the time spent on housework by her daughter.
J19|Influence of age of child on differencesinlife satisfaction ofmalesand females: A comparative study among East Asian countries|Using individual-level data for China,South Korea, and Japan for2006, this research examines how life satisfaction for married males and femalesin East Asian countries isinfluenced bythe age of theirchildren. Our results show that the life satisfaction of males is barely affected by a child of the relationship, whereas the life satisfaction of females with a young child is lower than that of females who do not have a child. This result holds for countries at different development stages. There is also a gender differential regarding the effect of young children on life satisfaction. Furthermore, the more developed the country, the greater this difference becomes.
J19|Naming and War in Modern Germany|This paper analyzes naming behavior in Germany in the context of rapid social change. It begins with an overview of general developments in naming in Germany over the last one hundred years, based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), which supplies us with almost 45,000 datasets. The paper focuses on the periods of World War II and the Cold War since we conclude that general developments in naming were disrupted by these two phenomena. Wartime brings accelerated social change in its wake and people react to this social change - often on an apparently individual level. Here, our findings are in accordance with established sociological theories.

J19|Warm glow in charitable auctions: Are the WEIRDos driving the results?|Running conventional laboratory experiments (i.e., with a standard student subject pool) is common practice in economic experiments especially when methodological issues are explored. However, generalization of the results from such experiments to the entire population is subject to severe critique. In this study we investigate warm glow in charitable auctions in a conventional lab experiment and an artefactual field experiment (i.e., lab experiment using subjects from the general population). The auction is constructed in a way to isolate warm glow by donating the sum of revenues by highest bidders to an environmental charity of subjectsÃƒ??Ãƒ?Ã‚Â¢?? choice. Contributions motivated by pure altruism were eliminated by keeping constant the total amount the charity would receive. Results for the two subject pools are at complete odds. There is ample evidence of warm glow in the student subject pool but none in the consumer subject pool. Our findings suggest that conclusions from conventional lab experiments may not be immediately transferable to the general population.
J19|Is population growth conducive to the sustainability of cooperation?|This paper asks whether population growth is conducive to the sustainability of cooperation. A simple model is developed in which farmers who live around a circular lake engage in trade with their adjacent neighbors. The payoffs from this activity are governed by a prisoner's dilemma “rule of engagement.” Every farmer has one son when the population is not growing, or two sons when it is growing. In the former case, the son takes over the farm when his father dies. In the latter case, one son stays on his father's farm, whereas the other son settles around another lake, along with the “other” sons of the other farmers. During his childhood, each son observes the strategies and the payoffs of his father and of the trading partners of his father, and imitates the most successful strategy when starting farming on his own. Then mutant defectors are introduced into an all-cooperator community. The defector strategy may spread. A comparison is drawn between the impact in terms of the sustainability of cooperation of the appearance of the mutants in a population that is not growing, and in one that is growing. It is shown that the ex-ante probability of sustaining the cooperation strategy is higher for a community that is growing than for a stagnant community.
J19|Economic Decision-Making in Poverty Depletes Behavioral Control|Economic theory and conventional wisdom suggest that time preference can cause or perpetuate poverty. Might poverty also or instead cause impatient or impulsive behavior? This paper reports a randomized lab experiment and a partially randomized field experiment, both in India, and analysis of the American Time Use Survey. In all three studies, poverty is associated with diminished behavioral control. The primary contribution of this empirical paper is to isolate the direction of causality from poverty to behavior. Three similar possible theoretical mechanisms, found in the psychology and behavioral economics literatures, cannot be definitively separated. One supported theoretical explanation is that poverty, by making economic decision-making more difficult, depletes cognitive control.
J19|Dinámicas espaciales de la globalización y mutaciones regionales del desarrollo|Este documento presenta una síntesis argumental del enfoque regional del desarrollo como lectura de las dinámicas espaciales de la globalización que marca la diferencia con la vieja categoría de análisis del desarrollo regional que predominó hasta los años noventa del siglo XX. Se busca recuperar el sentido de las categorías y referentes espaciales del despliegue de la globalización complementando los avances de la economía espacial y los nuevos enfoques regionales del desarrollo, con los cuales se elaboran los estudios y ejercicios de formulación de metodologías de planificación urbano-regional. Desde las teorías de la economía política y la geografía económica, se demuestra que lo regional es una categoría espacial de análisis dirigida al estudio de la práctica y el reconocimiento que los hombres tienen del espacio, como una manera de representar las trayectorias y configuraciones espaciales de los procesos y las relaciones sociales, así como las representaciones simbólicas que imprimen identidad a un espacio, lugar o territorio, leídos como momentos de la producción y presentación social de la acción individual y colectiva o de las relaciones sociales de producción.
J19|Is welfare dependency inherited? Estimating the causal welfare transmission effects using Swedish sibling data|This study tests whether individuals who grow up with parents on welfare benefits are themselves more (or less) likely to be welfare recipients as young adults, compared to individuals who grow up in non-welfare households. We use the sibling difference method to identify causal effects separately from the effects of correlated factors. While a descriptive analysis reveals a fairly high positive intergenerational correlation, especially in the late teens and conditional on a large set of household level factors, the sibling analysis provides no support for a causal effect of parents’ welfare benefit receipt on children’s future welfare use.
J19|Empowering Patients through ICT, Organisational Impact on Healthcare Systems in England and Scotland|This paper reports on the efforts carried out by England and Scotland to promote the widespread use of telehealthcare within Personal Health Systems (PHS) for patients with chronic conditions. In each setting, it explains the political drive, the trends in empowering patients, the needs for healthcare systems to treat chronic patients at home, the search for evidence supporting the case for telehealthcare, the reorganisation of services around these technologies and the need to coordinate and/or integrate different tiers of care in order to address the needs of patients suffering from chronic conditions. It details the achievements to-date and building on recent policy developments, it provides an overview on the likelihood of these services becoming a routine form of care. Following the two different approaches on telehealthcare in England and Scotland, it puts into perspective the need for adequate systemic governance and institutional reforms required to address the challenges associated to ICT implementations at organisational level and how the industry may be able to deliver solutions supporting them.

The importance of everyday activity of parents in shaping these child socialization values has long been established. Previous research however has largely been unable to establish a clear association between these parental values and the structure of children’s lives. This research demonstrates such a linkage, independent of measures of socioeconomic status, family and child characteristics.

J19|Políticas de salarios mínimos en Colombia. Una lectura entre la teoría y la realidad|Se analiza el comportamiento histórico del salario mínimo mensual legal vigente (SMMLV) en Colombia desde el punto de vista del marco de política utilizado para su fijación y de sus efectos sobre la capacidad de compra real de los trabajadores durante el periodo 1950-2009, teniendo como referente conceptual los principios básicos de la Teoría de Rentas. Los resultados muestran que el SMMLV en 2009 ($496 900) fue en términos reales ligeramente superior al 40% del establecido por primera vez en 1950 ($60), comportamiento a su vez equivalente a la tasa promedio anual de inflación vivida durante dicho periodo, lo que significa que, pese a los ajustes de enfoque a que ha sido sometida, la política salarial aplicada en el país durante los últimos 59 años ha servido, en el mejor de los casos, para mantener la capacidad de compra de los trabajadores que perciben el SMMLV como la de todos aquellos a quienes se les reajusta su remuneración con base en este último, en la práctica la mayoría de los trabajadores colombianos. La política de negociación del salario mínimo, basada en procesos de concertación entre trabajadores, productores y Gobierno, se centra de manera exclusiva en el tema salarial, sin referencia explícita sobre las condiciones de empleo (desempleo) existentes en el país. En consecuencia, se plantean algunos argumentos teóricos básicos acerca de las implicaciones prácticas de las políticas de salarios mínimos en economías con alto desempleo, como la colombiana.
