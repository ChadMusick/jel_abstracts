R38|Housing sector and optimal macroprudential policy in an estimated DSGE model for Luxembourg|This study investigates the optimal macroprudential policies for Luxembourg using an estimated closed-economy DSGE model. The model features a monopolistically competitive banking sector, a collateral constraint and an explicit differentiation between the flow and the stock of household mortgage debt. Based on a welfare-oriented approach and in a context of easy monetary policy environment, we first find that the non-joint optimal loan-to-value (LTV) and risk weighted capital requirement (RW) ratios for Luxembourg seem to be 90% and 30%, respectively, while the joint optimal ratios are found to be 100% and 10% respectively. Our results from the combination of instruments suggest that the policy scenario that provides better stabilization effects on mortgage credits isn’t necessarily the one that is welfare improving. In other words, we find a complementarity between LTV and RW in terms of welfare, while their optimal combination diminishes the stabilization effects on mortgage debt and house prices. However, the time-varying and endogenous rules for LTV and RW improve the social welfare and better stabilizes mortgage loans and house prices compared to their static exogenous ratios. We further find that the optimal interactions between LTV and RW ratios in our modelling framework exhibit a convex shape. It should be recalled that the results are conditional on the model’s specific assumptions.
R38|The Role of the Federal Housing Administration in the Reverse-Mortgage Market|The Federal Housing Administrationâ€™s Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program guarantees repayment on qualifying reverse mortgages made by private lenders. Reverse mortgages let older homeowners borrow money by using the equity in their home as collateral. The borrowed funds can be used to repay an existing mortgage or to fund other expenses. In this report, CBO examines how the HECM program works, how it affects the federal budget, and how various policy changes might reduce costs and risks to the government or to borrowers.
R38|Who cares? Future sea-level-rise and house prices| Globally, the single-most observable, predictable, and certain impact of climate change is sea level rise. Using a case study from the Kapiti Coast District in New Zealand, we pose a simple question: Do people factor in the warnings provided by scientists and governments about the risk of sea-level rise when making their investment decisions? We examine the single most important financial decision that most people make â€“ purchasing a home, to see whether prices of coastal property change when more/less information becomes available about property-specific consequences of future sea level rise. The Kapiti Coast District Council published detailed projected erosion risk maps for the districtâ€™s coastline in 2012 and was forced to remove them by the courts in 2014. About 1,800 properties were affected. We estimate the impact of this information on home prices using data from all real estate transactions in the district with a difference-in-differences framework embedded in a hedonic pricing model. We find that the posting of this information had a very small and statistically insignificant impact on house prices, suggesting people do not care much about the long-term risks of sea-level rise as they do not incorporate these risks in their investment decisions.
R38|Does Eviction Cause Poverty? Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Cook County, IL|Each year, more than two million U.S. households have an eviction case filed against them. Many cities have recently implemented policies aimed at reducing the number of evictions, motivated by research showing strong associations between being evicted and subsequent adverse economic outcomes. Yet it is difiicult to determine to what extent those associations represent causal relationships, because eviction itself is likely to be a consequence of adverse life events. This paper addresses that challenge and offers new causal evidence on how eviction affects financial distress, residential mobility, and neighborhood quality. We collect the near-universe of Cook County court records over a period of seventeen years, and link these records to credit bureau and payday loans data. Using this data, we characterize the trajectory of financial strain in the run-up and aftermath of eviction court for both evicted and non-evicted households, finding high levels and striking increases in financial strain in the years before an eviction case is filed. Guided by this descriptive evidence, we employ two approaches to draw causal inference on the effect of eviction. The first takes advantage of the panel data through a difference-in-differences design. The second is an instrumental variables strategy, relying on the fact that court cases are randomly assigned to judges of varying leniency. We find that eviction negatively impacts credit access and durable consumption for several years. However, the effects are small relative to the financial strain experienced by both evicted and non-evicted tenants in the run-up to an eviction flling.
R38|The Real Estate Transfer Tax and Government Ideology: Evidence from the German States|In 2006, the reform of the German fiscal constitution realigned legislative powers between the federal and the state governments. Since 2007, the German state governments have been allowed to design real estate transfer tax rates. We investigate whether government ideology predicts the levels and increases in the real estate transfer tax rates; and show that leftwing and center governments were more active in increasing the real estate transfer tax rates than rightwing governments. The result is important because many voters were disenchanted with the policies and platforms of the established German parties in the course of the euro and refugee crisis. Disenchantment notwithstanding, the established political parties are still prepared to offer polarized policies.
R38|Who Bears the Burden of Real Estate Transfer Taxes? Evidence from the German Housing Market|This paper examines the effects of real estate transfer taxes (RETT) on house prices using a rich micro dataset on German properties covering the period from 2005 to 2018. We exploit a 2006 constitutional reform that allowed states to set their own RETT rates, leading to frequent increases in states’ tax rates in subsequent years. Our monthly event study estimates indicate a price response that strongly exceeds the change in the tax burden for single transactions. I.e., twelve months after a reform, a one percentage point increase in the tax rate reduces property prices by on average 3.5%. Effects are stronger for apartments and apartment buildings than for single family houses. We interpret these results in the context of a theoretical model that accounts for the effects of RETT on a property’s resale value. If a property is expected to be traded more frequently in the future, the decline in its price can exceed the in crease in the tax burden. Moreover, larger price effects can be explained by higher bargaining power of sellers.
R38|The economic effects of density: A synthesis|This paper synthesises the state of knowledge on the economic effects of density. We consider 347 estimates of density elasticities of a broad range of outcomes ranging from wages, innovation, rents, various amenities, the cost of providing public services, transport- and environment-related outcomes to health and wellbeing. More than 100 of these estimates have not been previously published and have been provided by authors on request or inferred from published results in auxiliary analyses. We contribute original estimates of density elasticities of 16 distinct outcome variables that belong to categories where the evidence base is thin, inconsistent or non-existent. Along with a critical discussion of the quality and the quantity of the evidence base we present a set of recommended elasticities. Applying them to a scenario that roughly corresponds to an average high-income city, we find that density seems to be a net-amenity that is associated with positive external welfare effects. Densification policies may be welfare enhancing, but the distributional effects may be regressive, especially if residents are immobile and housing supply is inelastic.

R38|Social policy or crowding-out? Tenant protection in comparative long-run perspective|In the shadow of homeownership and public housing, social policy through the regulation of private rental markets is a neglected and underestimated eld of social policy. This paper, therefore, presents unique new data on the development of private tenancy legislation through the binary coding of rent control, the protection of tenants from eviction, and rental housing rationing laws across more than 25 countries and 100 years. This long-run perspective reveals the dynamic eects of rent control on the rise of homeownership as the dominant tenure during the 20th century. We nd that both rent regulation and rationing legislation eectively increased homeownership, but only up to a certain threshold. We suggest that the short-term lure of an inexpensive social policy for tenants has led to the long-term marginalization of rental markets in many countries
R38|Partial ownership of local firms and zoning of neighboring towns| This paper investigates zoning in two neighboring towns in which firms are owned by investors that reside in the two towns. We find that local regulators use zoning strategically depending on the weight of local profits in social welfare. When they are high enough both towns are zoned. For intermediate values an asymmetric result emerges: only one regulator resorts to zoning despite the symmetry in the percentage of ownership of the neighboring firms. For a low weight of local profits, towns may or may not be zoned. Zoning restrictions on the location of firms are tighter when local profits are more significant for social welfare.
R38|The Marginal Effect of Government Mortgage Guarantees on Homeownership|The U.S. government guarantees a majority of residential mortgages, which is often justified as a means to promote homeownership. In this paper we use property-level data to estimate the effect of government mortgage guarantees on homeownership, by exploiting variation of the conforming loan limits (CLLs) along county borders. We find substantial effects on government guarantees, but find no robust effect on homeownership. This finding suggests that government guarantees could be considerably reduced with modest effects on homeownership, which is relevant for housing finance reform plans that propose to reduce the government’s involvement in the mortgage market by reducing the CLLs.
R38|Do Minimum Wage Increases Benefit Intended Households? Evidence from the Performance of Residential Leases|Prior studies debating the eﬀects of changes to the minimum wage concentrate on impacts on household income and spending or employment. We extend this debate by examining the impact of changes to the minimum wage on expenses associated with shelter, a previously unexplored area. Increases in state minimum wages signiﬁcantly reduce the incidence of renters defaulting on their lease contracts by 1.29 percentage points over three months, relative to similar renters who did not experience an increase in the minimum wage. This represents 25.7% fewer defaults post treatment in treated states. To put this into perspective, a 1% increase in minimum wage translates into a 2.6% decrease in rental default. This evidence is consistent with wage increases having an immediate impact on relaxing renter budget constraints. However, this eﬀect slowly decreases over time as landlords react to wage increases by increasing rents. Our analysis is based on a unique data set that tracks household rental payments.
R38|Small and Mid-Sized Business as a Factor of Economic Growth in Russia|The present edition includes two papers by the leading experts of the Gaidar Institute for Economic Policy. The papers in question are based on the outputs of research carried out by the Gaidar Institute in 2018. Both the papers deal with operation of the sector of small and mid-sized business (SMB). In the first paper – “The Statistics of the Sector of Small and Mid-Sized Business in Russia and the World” – the authors note that there are serious differences in the methods of calculating statistical indices related to the SMB sector and definition criteria. Without understanding those differences, there is no point in inter-country statistical comparison. Utilization of international experience in facilitating and promoting the SMB sector suggests that there is clear awareness of the differences in this sector’s definition criteria and, consequently, statistical data published in international organizations’ reports. In the other paper – “Comparative Analysis of the Government’s Support to Exports by Small and Mid-Sized Businesses in the Regional Aspect” – the authors elaborate on the existing patterns of support to exports in Russia and point to serious disadvantages which largely prevent small and mid-sized businesses from engaging in export activities. The methods of analyzing the assessment of the impact of export support measures at the regional level on the volumes both of the overall regional exports and exports by small and mid-sized businesses are based on econometric models.
R38|Procedural Formalism and Social Networks in the Housing Market|Why do some OECD countries have high levels of procedural formalism (PF) in the housing market? We provide an explanation based upon complementarities between the strength of social networks and the stringency of procedural formalism. The interest of social networks is that conflict resolution is independent from the law. When local agents belong to social networks whereas non-local agents do not, PF may facilitate housing search for locals at the expense of non-locals. To illustrate this mechanism we build a search-theoretic model of the housing market. The model emphasizes that the demand for PF occurs when the size of social networks is large. By simulations, we show that the support for PF increases with the size of social networks, the default probability on the rent and the proportion of non-local agents. JEL Codes: R38.
R38|Wohnungsmarkt und Wohnungspolitik in Deutschland: Situation und Optionen|Die Situation am deutschen Wohnungsmarkt ist aktuell Gegenstand einer gesellschaftlichen Diskussion. Ein deutlicher Nachfrageüberhang, der sich vorwiegend â€“ aber nicht ausschließlich â€“ auf urbane Räume konzentriert, hat in den letzten Jahren zu einem deutlichen Preisanstieg sowohl bei den Immobilien als auch bei den Mieten geführt. Da die Mehrheit der Menschen in Deutschland zur Miete wohnt, betrifft diese Entwicklung eine große Gruppe. Mit den Zielen den Ausgleich am Wohnungsmarkt zu befördern und Wohnraum sozialverträglich, d.h. allen Bevölkerungsgruppen unter Berücksichtigung der Leistungsfähigkeit, zugänglich zu machen, gibt es in Deutschland eine Reihe wohnungspolitischer Maßnahmen und Eingriffe. Die Passgenauigkeit dieser Interventionen ist vor dem Hintergrund der Wohnungsmarktentwicklung der letzten Jahre kritisch zu überprüfen. Mit dem vorliegenden Aufsatz soll eine Bestandaufnahme über die Entwicklung und gegenwärtige Situation am Wohnungsmarkt gegeben werden. Hierbei liegt der Fokus zum einen auf der Herausarbeitung angebots- und nachfrageseitiger Ursachen, zum anderen werden die wesentlichen wohnungspolitischen Instrumente (Subventionen, Steuern, Preiseingriffe) im Hinblick auf Ziele und Wirkungen erläutert. Aufbauend auf dieser Bestandsaufnahme werden acht wohnungs(markt)politische Implikationen abgeleitet und zur Diskussion gestellt.
R38|How does subway and ground transit proximity affect rental prices?|This study focuses on the ground transportation system and its impact on the rents in 30 of Russia’s largest cities. It also compares the effect with subway transit networks. The data set includes rent information from an all-Russia online advertisement website Avito and various measures of proximity to the public transit network stops (including subways for cities with them). The analysis is conducted using linear hedonic models. The results show that the ground transportation proximity is important for housing rent formation in both cities with and without subways, although the effect for subway stations is greater in comparison. Nevertheless, the benefits of a denser ground transportation system are high and stable, whereas the distance to the closest bus stop and the number within the walking distance are important solely for cities with a subway system and without it, respectively.
R38|Do Tax Incentives Affect Business Location and Economic Development? Evidence from State Film Incentives|"I estimate the impacts of recently-popular U.S. state film incentives on filming location, film industry employment, wages, and establishments, and spillover impacts on related industries. I compile a detailed database of incentives, matching this with TV series and feature film data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and Studio System, and establishment and employment data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages and Country Business Patterns. I compare these outcomes in states before and after they adopt incentives, relative to similar states that did not adopt incentives over the same time period (a panel difference-in-differences). I find that TV series filming increases by 6.3 to 55.4% (at most 1.50 additional TV series) after incentive adoption. However, there is no meaningful effect on feature films, and employment, wages, and establishments in the film industry and in related industries. These results show that the ability for tax incentives to affect business location decisions and economic development is mixed, suggesting that even with aggressive incentives, and ""footloose"" filming, incentives can have little impact."

R38|Improving well-being through better housing policy in New Zealand|New Zealand’s housing supply has not kept pace with rising demand, including from net immigration. Affordability has worsened, particularly for low-income renters. Government action is underway to allow new housing through initiatives such as the Urban Growth Agenda, KiwiBuild and the Housing and Urban Development Authority, but further steps are needed to improve well-being. Clear overarching principles for sustainable urban development and rationalisation of strict regulatory containment policies would allow the planning system to better respond to demand for land. Incentives for local governments to accommodate growth could be increased by giving them access to additional revenue linked to local development. More user charging and targeted rates would also help to fund infrastructure required to service new housing. Government delivery of affordable housing through KiwiBuild should be re-focused towards enabling the supply of land to developers, supporting development of affordable rental housing and further expanding social housing in areas facing shortages.This Working Paper relates to the 2019 OECD Economic Survey of New Zealand (http://www.oecd.org/economy/new-zealand-economic-snapshot/).
R38|The Impact of Land Bank Demolitions on Property Values|A modern land bank is a public entity that purchases and demolishes blighted housing to remove negative externalities. We estimate the impact of land bank demolitions on surrounding property values for a medium-sized municipality. Using a spatial correction hedonic model of house prices, we find modest increases in sales prices associated with land bank activity in a neighborhood. In general, the impact estimates we find are smaller than those found in the literature for a much larger metropolitan area. We speculate on the cause of this difference in findings.
R38|Minimum Wages and Housing Rents: Theory and Evidence from Two Countries|Whether the minimum wage is an effective redistributive policy is still controversial. I investigate this issue from a new perspective by focusing on the effect of minimum wage hikes on housing rents. It is informative for two reasons. First, if minimum wage hikes increase housing rents, some of the benefits accidentally fall on homeowners rather than workers. Second, housing rents serve as an indicator as to whether and how much minimum wages are beneficial for workers, which I show by developing a spatial equilibrium model. I empirically analyze the causal impact of the minimum wage increase on housing rents in the United States and Japan. In both countries, minimum wages hikes increase housing rents in urban areas: 10% minimum wage increase induces 1%-2% increase in the United States and 2.5%-5% increase in Japan. While the unintended incidence on homeowners is arguably moderate, it is non-negligible. Moreover, it may be more salient if minimum wages induce unemployment. I also suggest the importance of heterogeneous welfare impacts on different groups of minimum wage workers.

R38|Government Policy and Land Price Dynamics: A Quantitative Assessment of China's Factor Market|This paper examines the role played by government policy regarding factors of pro- duction in shaping the dynamics of a growing economy. Using land as an example of an important productive factor, we develop a quantitative model with endogenous land price policy regimes to rationalize the following three economic reforms in China: introduction of non-SOEs (state-owned enterprises); reform of SOEs characterized by their retreat from the competitive manufacturing sector and the establishment of state monopolies in factor markets around 2000; and a regime switch from dual-track land pricing to land price discrimination by use. We calibrate our model to key economic indicators for China and quantify the e ects of these reforms. Our calibrated mo- del can match several stylized facts for China after 2000 such as widening disparity in land prices by use, rapid growth in housing price, land revenue, and government expenditures on public goods, and the steep decline in labor share for income.
R38|Housing, Debt and the Economy: A Tale of Two Countries|In housing affordability levels and volatility, there could hardly be a greater contrast than between the UK and Germany. Differences in history, institutions and policies are explored in this paper. Residential housing supply has been far more expansionary in Germany and mortgage credit more tightly regulated. A sensibly regulated rental market and stable German house prices have combined to leave the rental sector with over half of tenures. Policy failures in the UK have resulted in widening intergenerational inequality, increased social exclusion, adversely affected productivity and growth and raised the risk of financial instability. Policy lessons are drawn for the UK, which go far beyond the remit of the immediately responsible Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.
R38|Taxing Vacant Dwellings: Can fiscal policy reduce vacancy?|We provide the first evaluation of a tax on vacant housing. This instrument has been used increasingly by governments in order to reduce vacancy in large and dense cities with tight housing markets. We use the quasi-experimental setting of the implementation of a tax on vacancy in France in 1999 to identify the causal direct effect of the tax on the vacancy rate. Exploiting an exhaustive fiscal data-set, which contains information on every dwelling in France from 1995 to 2013, we implement a Difference-in-Difference approach combined with a Propensity Score Matching strategy. Our results suggest that the tax was responsible of a 13% decrease in vacancy rates between 1997 and 2001. This impact is twice as high for municipalities with an initially high level of vacancy. Our results also suggest that most of the vacant dwellings moved to primary residences.
R38|Macroeconomic and demographic determinants of residential property prices in Malaysia|This paper studies the relationship between residential property prices and macroeconomic and demographic determinants in Malaysia. In the years following the Asian financial crisis, property prices in Malaysia rose substantially, resulting in an affordability crisis and ultimately policy responses to the problem. Using unit root, Johansen-Juselius cointegration, VECM-based Granger causality tests and variance decomposition, and considering quarterly data that covers 2000-2015 period, we established that residential property price growth is principally driven by strong demographic performance and population growth and is backed by the low interest rate environment and rising consumer prices. Household income and level of GDP do not appear to contribute to property price growth. Certain distortions and asymmetries in the Malaysian real estate markets are documented: oversupply in the higher price segment of the market coupled with the lack of affordable housing in the lower price segment; household income growth lagging behind GDP and property price growth, thereby dampening housing demand; growing rental markets in major urban areas as a result of the affordability crisis; and a quality mismatch between buyers’ preferences and housing supply.
R38|U.S. State and Local Fiscal Policy and Economic Activity: Do We Know More Now?|Early reviews of the academic literature on the economic effects of state and local taxes and expenditures suggested that not enough was known upon which to base policy. The reviews called for better data and improvements in empirical methodology. This paper reviews studies conducted since the early literature reviews to assess our current state of knowledge. The conclusion of the study is that we know more now. But our knowledge is unlikely to ever be sufficient to provide universal policy guidance. Rather, we suggest that more research is needed on specific state and local policies for specific circumstances, consistent with the general principles that guide place-based policy.
R38|Open Innovation System and Entrepreneurship: A case study of the Offshore Renewable Energy|This article examines the innovation in the offshore renewable energy (ORE) industry using Open Innovation System (OIS), platforms and network perspective. Despite the benefits of ORE, Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs account for up to one-third of total wind energy project lifecycle expenditure requiring relationships with multiple external partners to improve the supply chain and O&M activities. Therefore, management of the O&M activities of the supply chain and logistics has become an excellent place to drive efficiency and reduce cost thereby creating innovative products and services, business clusters and job opportunities. Findings show how strategic resources help offshore companies to reduce cost and achieve environmental, economic and social benefit derived from ORE. The OIS is used to explain the importance of new resources in technology, knowledge sharing and relationships, and stresses the role of stakeholders in addressing the challenges. The limitation of this study is related to reliance on secondary data. However, it provided an opportunity to elaborate on OIS theory and reinforces the importance of knowledge sharing, collaboration and network advantage. Overall, this provided insights into the constituent resources needed for successful OIS, regional entrepreneurship and helps move renewable energy research from a technological advancement challenges to a problem of strategic resources and relational capabilities.
R38|Housing Taxation and Financial Intermediation|Through the lens of a multi-agent dynamic general equilibrium model, we examine the effects of four permanent changes in housing taxes and deductions on macroeconomic aggregates and welfare. Our main result is that the presence of borrowing-constrained bankers dampen the negative consequences of housing taxation on output. The long-run tax multipliers found range from -1.02 to -0.6. The reduction in the deduction of mortgage interest payments delivers the lowest multiplier. We also implement revenue-neutral tax reforms and find that the repeal of mortgage deductibility is the only policy that generates gains in output.
R38|Payment and Provision Consequentiality in Voluntary Contribution Mechanism: Single or Double “Knife-Edge” Evidence?|We conducted a field stated preferences survey to understand the joint and separate effects of payment and provision consequences on hypothetical bias associated with voluntary contribution. Based on four treatment groups and a contingent-ranking willingness to pay (WTP) question, this paper provides some support for “single” knife-edge evidence, which suggests that a respondent facing positive provision consequences will report a significantly higher preference only if the payment consequence is co-presented. For the payment consequence, its negative impact on WTP was independent on the presence of provision consequence; we therefore reject the “double” knife-edge evidence.
R38|Housing Tax Policy: Comment|Alpanda and Zubairy (2016) examine the effects of permanent changes to four types of housing-related tax policies in the context of a multi-agent DGE model. They find long-run tax multipliers that range from -2.21 to -1.53. However, we find an error in their codes that has a significant impact on the size of these multipliers. We correct their error and re-simulate their model. The long-run multipliers we find are reduced almost in half---they now range from -1.25 to -0.84. We also compute short-run multipliers at a 20-quarter horizon and find much lower multipliers, ranging between -0.14 to -0.02.
R38|Die Modernisierungsumlage zwischen Investitionshemmnis und Mieterüberforderung|Modernisierungen des Wohnungsbestands sind notwendig und wünschenswert, um u. a. die Klimaschutzziele zu erreichen und um den Komfort der Nutzer zu erhöhen. Bundesweit gesehen laufen die Investitionen in den Bestand dem Neubau hinterher, und gerade energetische Sanie-rungen erreichen noch nicht das nötige Niveau, um die Klimaschutzziele zu erreichen. Hinzu kommt, dass insbesondere in Mietwohnungen relativ gesehen wenig investiert wird. Dennoch sind Modernisierungen verstärkt in den politischen Fokus geraten, weil in einigen Bal-lungsräumen sehr umfassende Modernisierungen dazu geführt haben, dass Mieter ihre Woh-nungen kündigen mussten. Daher soll nun die Modernisierungsumlage von 11 Prozent auf 8 Prozent sowie auf maximal 3 Euro je Quadratmeter gesenkt werden. Auf Basis von Investitionsrechnungen lässt sich zeigen, dass unter aktuellen Rahmenbedingun-gen Modernisierungen zwar rentabel sind, insbesondere aber bei kürzeren Nutzungsdauern als den steuerlich unterstellten 50 Jahren und Zinserhöhungen die Vorteilhaftigkeit verloren gehen kann. Ein Kompromiss kann daher darin liegen, die Absenkung der Modernisierungsumlage mit einer ohnehin gebotenen Erhöhung der steuerlichen Abschreibung zu verknüpfen. Das heutige System der Modernisierungsumlage weist jedoch einen wesentlichen Fehlanreiz auf. Sofern die Renditen positiv sind, lohnt es sich die Kosten möglichst hoch anzusetzen, da mit jedem eigesetzten Euro dann ein Gewinn verbunden ist. In ausgeglichenen und entspannten Wohnungsmärkten wird dies über die Mieter sanktioniert, die dann günstigere Wohnungen wählen oder dies zumindest potenziell könnten, in angespannten Wohnungsmärkten fehlt die-ses Korrektiv jedoch.

R38|Wohnungspolitik in NRW: Mietpreisbremse, Eigenheimförderung und sozialer Wohnungsbau. Schriftliche Stellungnahme zu den Anträgen 17/799, 17/816 und 17/1118|Der Wohnungsmarkt in NRW ist durch divergierende Entwicklungen gekennzeichnet. Während viele Groß- und Universitätsstädte in den letzten Jahren zahlreiche Einwohner gewonnen haben, verlieren einige ländliche Regionen sowie strukturschwache Städte an Einwohnern. Dieser Entwicklung muss die Wohnungspolitik gerecht werden. Eine Unterstützung der Haushalte in der Wohneigentumsbildung ist grundsätzlich zu rechtfertigen, allerdings sollte sich die Politik vor allem auf den Mangel an Kapital konzentrieren. Darüber hinaus sollten Unterstützungen so gestaltet werden, dass es gerade in demografisch belasteten Regionen keine zusätzlichen Anreize für Neubauten gibt. Daher sollten sich eventuelle Förderprogramme dort auf den Bestand fokussieren. Die Mietpreisbremse hat bisher nicht zur Dämpfung der Mieten beigetragen, eine Verschärfung könnte sich längerfristig eher gegen die Mieter wenden, da umfangreiche Mietpreisregulierungen - wie internationale Beispiele belegen - zur Verdrängung des privaten Mietwohnungsmarktes beitragen. Auch die soziale Wohnraumförderung weist eklatante Mängel auf, vor allem hinsichtlich der Treffsicherheit.

R38|The billion pound drop: the blitz and agglomeration economics in London|This paper exploits locally exogenous variation in the location of bombs dropped during the Blitz to quantify the effect of density restrictions on agglomeration economies in London: an elite global city. Employing microgeographic data on office rents and employment, this analysis points to effects for London several multiples larger than the existing literature which primarily derives its results from secondary cities. In particular, doubling employment density raises rents by 25%. Consequently if the Blitz had not taken place, the resulting loss in agglomeration economies to present day London would cause total annual office rent revenues to fall by $4:5 billion {equivalent to 1:2% of London's annual GDP. These results illuminate the substantial impact of land-use regulations in one of the world's largest and most productive cities.
R38|Fiscal Equalization as a Driver of Tax Increases: Empirical Evidence from Germany|This paper exploits a recent devolution of tax setting powers in the German federation to study the effects of fiscal equalization on subnational governments’ tax policy. Based on an analysis of the system of fiscal equalization transfers, we argue that the redistribution of revenues provides incentives for states to raise rather than to lower their tax rates. The empirical analysis exploits differences in fiscal redistribution among the states and over time. Using a comprehensive simulation model, the paper computes the tax-policy incentives faced by each state over the years and explores their empirical effects on tax policy. The results support significant and substantial effects. Facing full equalization a state is predicted to set the tax rate from the real estate transfer tax about 1.3 percentage points higher than without. Our analysis also shows that the incentive to raise tax rates is proliferated by the equalization system because the states’ decisions to raise their tax rates have intensified fiscal redistribution over time.
R38|Aglomeración empresarial y eficiencia técnica: un enfoque de frontera estocástica en la producción para Bogotá D.C|En este documento se presenta una metodología para identificar y delimitar las aglomeraciones urbanas en la ciudad de Bogotá D.C. Sumado a lo anterior, se estiman dos modelos de frontera estocástica de producción para evaluar la situación de eficiencia técnica entre firmas ubicadas en zonas de la ciudad altamente aglomeradas y zonas no aglomeradas. La evidencia encontrada sugiere que, la distribución de la actividad económica comercial, industrial y de servicios no es aleatoria, por el contrario se encuentran concentradas en 80 aglomeraciones que comprenden el 22.1% del perímetro urbano de la ciudad. Por otro lado, se encuentra que índices de eficiencia técnica en la producción para el sector industrial y de servicios exhiben un comportamiento creciente en la medida que se incrementa el grado de aglomeración; para el sector comercial, dada su naturaleza se encuentra gran dispersión de su localización en el territorio y no se aprecian diferencias significativas de mayor eficiencia según se incrementa el grado de aglomeración empresarial.
R38|Measuring Stick-Style Housing Policies: a Multi-Country Longitudinal Database of Governmental Regulations|This paper introduces a new international longitudinal database of governmental housing policies. The regulations are measured using binary variables based on a thorough analysis of the real-time country-specific legislation. Three major restrictive policies are considered: rent control, protection from restriction, and housing rationing. The database covers 47 countries and states between 1910 and 2018. This allows comparisons of regulation stringency across both time and space. The analysis reveals a surge of all restrictive policies in the first half of the 20th century. However, following World War II, the evolution of policies diverged: while rent control became more flexible or was phased out, tenure security stabilized at a high level or even increased, while housing rationing became used less frequently. An application of dynamic multivariate longitudinal clustering permits dividing the sample in two groups. One cluster comprises countries with more flexible rent control, stronger tenure security, and more housing rationing. It mostly includes European continental countries. Another cluster unifies countries with a more rigid rent control, weaker tenant protection, and rarely used housing rationing.
R38|From periphery to core: measuring agglomeration effects using high-speed rail|We analyze the economic impact of the German high-speed rail (HSR) connecting Cologne and Frankfurt, which provides plausibly exogenous variation in access to surrounding economic mass. We find a causal effect of about 8.5% on average of the HSR on the GDP of three counties with intermediate stops. We make further use of the variation in bilateral transport costs between all counties in our study area induced by the HSR to identify the strength and spatial scope of agglomeration forces. Our most careful estimate points to an elasticity of output with respect to market potential of 12.5%. The strength of the spillover declines by 50% every 30 min of travel time, diminishing to 1% after about 200 min. Our results further imply an elasticity of per-worker output with respect to economic density of 3.8%, although the effects seem driven by worker and firm selection.
R38|Empty homes, longer commutes: The unintended consequences of more restrictive local planning|We investigate the impact of land use regulation on housing vacancy rates. Using a 30-year panel dataset on land use regulation for 350 English Local Authorities (LAs) and addressing potential reverse causation and other endogeneity concerns, we find that tighter local planning constraints increase local housing vacancy rates: a one standard deviation increase in restrictiveness causes the local vacancy rate to increase by 0.9 percentage points (23%). The same increase in local restrictiveness also causes a 6.1% rise in commuting distances. The results underline the interdependence of local housing and Labour markets and the unintended adverse impact of more restrictive planning policies.
R38|The Billion Pound Drop: The Blitz and Agglomeration Economies in London|This paper exploits locally exogenous variation in the location of bombs dropped during the Blitz to quantify the effect of density restrictions on agglomeration economies in London: an elite global city. Employing microgeographic data on office rents and employment, this analysis points to effects for London several multiples larger than the existing literature which primarily derives its results from secondary cities. In particular, doubling employment density raises rents by 25%. Consequently if the Blitz had not taken place, the resulting loss in agglomeration economies to present day London would cause total annual office rent revenues to fall by $4:5 billion { equivalent to 1:2% of London's annual GDP. These results illuminate the substantial impact of land-use regulations in one of the world's largest and most productive cities.
R38|Does federal contracting spur development? Federal contracts, income, output, and jobs in US cities|Firms and governments alike frequently court federal government contracts to generate more jobs and trigger economic growth. However, the employment and output impact of government contracts remains controversial. We use georeferenced data on United States (US) federal contracts, distinguishing between the location of the recipient and the location of the activity, for the years 2005–2014 in order to assess the employment and output impacts of federal contracting in metropolitan areas of the US. We resort to a shift-share instrument and precise location-specific fixed effects to estimate the causal impact of spending. Cities that receive more contract expenditure witness an expansion in output – with contracts generating $1.4 per dollar spent – but experience only modest increases in employment. The impact is also constrained geographically and short-lived. The results suggest that, on average, the effects of federal contracting on local economies are modest, meaning that attracting federal contracts may not be an effective urban development strategy.
R38|Broken Market or Broken Policy? The Unintended Consequences of Restrictive Planning|This paper summarises the evidence from recent research relating to the British Planning system's impact on the supply of development. Planning serves important economic and social purposes but it is essential to distinguish between restricting development relative to demand in particular places to provide public goods and mitigate market failure in other ways, including ensuring the future ability of cities to expand and maintain a supply of public goods and infrastructure; and an absolute restriction on supply, raising prices of housing and other urban development generally. Evidence is presented that there are at least four separate mechanisms, inbuilt into the British system, which result in a systematic undersupply of land and space for both residential and commercial purposes and that these have had important effects on both our housing market and the wider economy and on welfare more widely defined.
R38|Rental Housing Affordability in the Southeast: Data from the Sixth District|Housing data are available for most large metropolitan regions in the Atlanta Fed's Southeast region. However, many midsized metropolitan, micropolitan, and nonmetro areas lack detailed data on rental housing affordability and housing supply needs by income level. These data are important for state and local governments, affordable housing developers, and housing advocates to inform housing policy. Therefore, the Atlanta Fed partnered with the Shimberg Center at the University of Florida to analyze census data using a methodology developed for Shimberg's periodic Rental Market Study for the state of Florida (Shimberg Center for Housing Studies, 2013, 2016). This paper covers the six states that are fully or partially in the Atlanta Fed's District: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. {{p}} In this paper, the authors provide a regional snapshot of housing affordability and the availability of affordable rental housing units at several scales for the Atlanta Fed's District, using data from the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). They include figures for city, metropolitan, and state areas as well as regional figures for nonmetro areas. The authors segment the data by household income using the area median income (AMI) of each respective region. They provide estimates for renter households within five major income brackets: extremely low income (0 to 30 percent AMI), very low income (30.01 to 50 percent AMI), low income (50.01 to 80 percent AMI), moderate income (80.01 to 120 percent AMI), and upper income (more than 120 percent AMI). {{p}} The authors use two measures of housing affordability: 1) the share of cost-burdened households and 2) affordable and available rental housing supply. Metrics include the percent of cost-burdened renter households (people who pay more than 30 percent of their income on housing) and extremely cost-burdened renter households (people who pay more than 50 percent of their income on housing). Metrics also include the deficit or surplus in rental units that are both available and affordable to households at each of the above area median-income brackets. These measures tend to correlate, with high percentages of cost-burdened households associated with significant deficits in affordable and available units for low- and moderate-income households.
R38|Financing Affordable and Sustainable Homeownership with Fixed-COFI Mortgages|The 30-year fixed-rate fully amortizing mortgage (or “traditional fixed-rate mortgage”) was a substantial innovation when first developed during the Great Depression. However, it has three major flaws. First, because homeowner equity accumulates slowly during the first decade, homeowners are essentially renting their homes from lenders. With this sluggish equity accumulation, many lenders require large down payments. Second, in each monthly mortgage payment, homeowners substantially compensate capital markets investors for the ability to prepay. The homeowners might have better uses for this money. Third, refinancing mortgages is often very costly. Expensive refinancing may prevent homeowners from taking advantage of falling rates.{{p}}{{p}}To resolve these three flaws, we propose a new fixed-rate mortgage, called the Fixed-Payment-COFI mortgage (or “Fixed-COFI mortgage”). This mortgage has fixed monthly payments equal to payments for traditional fixed-rate mortgages and does not require a down payment. Also, unlike traditional fixed-rate mortgages, Fixed-COFI mortgages do not bundle mortgage financing with compensation paid to capital markets investors for bearing prepayment risks; instead, this money is directed toward lower monthly payments or toward purchasing the home. The Fixed-COFI mortgage exploits the often-present prepayment-risk “wedges” between the fixed-rate mortgage rate and the estimated cost of funds index (COFI) mortgage rate. In addition, the Fixed-COFI mortgage is a highly profitable asset for many mortgage lenders.{{p}}{{p}}We discuss two variations of the Fixed-COFI mortgage. Homeowners with “affordable” Fixed-COFI mortgages are rebated the “wedges” between the traditional fixed-rate mortgage payments and the COFI mortgage payment. After the “wedges” are rebated, these homeowners may pay substantially less to purchase their homes in 30 years than homeowners with traditional fixed-rate mortgages. This mortgage design may help alleviate housing affordability pressures in many areas of the United States.{{p}}{{p}}The other variation of Fixed-COFI mortgage is the “homeownership” Fixed-COFI mortgage. With the “homeownership” Fixed-COFI mortgage, the homeowner commits to a savings program based on the difference between fixed-rate mortgage
R38|Valuing the Urban Hukou in China: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design in Housing Price| This paper explores the demand side of hukou (household registration) acquisition in China by estimating the market valuation of urban hukou. According to the provisions in Jinan City’s “Acquiring Hukou by Purchasing Houses” policy, this paper uses houses slightly larger than the minimum required floor area as the treatment group, and houses slightly smaller than the minimum required floor area as the control group to perform regression discontinuity design. Empirical results show that residents’ willingness to pay for urban hukou in Jinan City was between approximately 90,000 and 126,000 yuan (RMB) in 2017. Our finding is robust to both parametric and nonparametric estimates and different model specifications. We also perform falsification tests by assuming a false policy introduction date and placebo tests based on rental data. Our analysis also offers insights for reform of the hukou system and designs for the provision of public services or welfare.
R38|An Examination of the Link between Urban Planning Policies and the High Cost of Housing and Labor|Past research has established positive empirical relation between city-level land use regulations and housing costs. One interpretation of these findings is that building restrictions raise the cost of producing housing. Alternatively, these price effects could reflect greater willingness to pay for quality urban design. Disentangling and identifying cost versus amenity factors empirically is an unresolved challenge. This paper presents an alternative to empirical tests, relying instead on the predictions of neoclassical urban theory. Simulations of an open city model demonstrate that theoretical predictions differ substantially from those obtained from empirical testing in two main ways. First, restrictions on land use and housing density influence the price level but not the elasticity of housing supply. Second, the effects of land use restrictions on average house prices are ambiguous and depend on the precise location of the planning restriction. Furthermore, the model generates direct estimates of effects on wages and demonstrates that transportation impediments are more consequential for housing prices than land use restrictions. This indicates a potentially fruitful path for future empirical work, and the possibility of omitted variable bias if transportation impediments are correlated with land use regulation.
R38|The HSR competition in Italy: How are the regulatory design and practices concerned?|Italy is nowadays the only European country to have organized a head-on competition on its whole high speed railway (HSR) network. This paper discusses the issues of this new market structure for the Italian Rail Regulator, both in terms of regulatory design and economic regulation practices. Such HSR competition and regulation took place in a very specific and ambivalent context (including declining Italian railway demand, negative European macroeconomic environment), together with a new ambitious and innovating private competitor (NTV) and strong reactions from the incumbent (Trenitalia). The Italian Rail Regulator's interventions look like more or less a set of everyday life decisions and empirical trade-off than a duly achieved economic doctrine and policy. The level of access charges seems to be a strategic variable to enlarge the scope for profitable entry in Italy. However, this new context still does not answer the question whether HSR operators reach their economic equilibrium in open access competition.
R38|Moving to Opportunity or Isolation? Network Effects of a Randomized Housing Lottery in Urban India|A housing lottery in an Indian city provided winning slum dwellers the opportunity to move into improved housing on the city's periphery. Fourteen years later, winners report improved housing but no change in tenure security, family income, or human capital. Winners also report increased isolation from family and caste networks and reduced informal insurance. We observe significant program exit: 34 percent of winners never took up subsidized housing and 32 percent eventually exited. Our results suggest negligible long-run economic value of this expensive public program and point to the importance of considering social networks in housing programs for the poor.

R38|Determinants Of Weanling Thoroughbred Auction Prices| Determinants of prices of 1,302 weanling Thoroughbreds sold at the 2010 November Breeding Stock Sale at the Keeneland Association, Inc. are investigated. Weanlings, who are less than one-year-old, are of unknown breeding and racing quality; still, prices at auctions display high variability. A hedonic price analysis is utilized to identify the determinants of weanling sales prices, and the corresponding marginal values of those determinants are estimated. Prices were highly responsive to variables related to pedigree quality, including the sire’s stud fee, whether the sire was relatively new in his breeding career or not, and whether the dam or the dam’s progeny had earned black type. In addition, prices were influenced by individual characteristics such as gender, age, state of birth. The weanling’s placement in the sale and pinhooked weanlings also influenced price. Results can be used as a decision tool by both buyers and sellers.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R38|Sun, Regulation and Local Social Networks|The aim of this paper is to explain over-regulation and local social capital as barriers to immigration. The interest of social networks is that conflict resolution is independent of the law. Hence, if local individuals develop local social capital and regulation, foreigners without social networks are disadvantaged and can less easily migrate. We develop a two-country search-theoretic model where we endogenize the choice of procedural formalism (PF) and the network size. This model features two different equilibria: a Mediterranean equilibrium with PF and dense local social network and a Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon equilibrium without PF and local social networks.
R38|Transmission of Monetary Policy in Times of High Household Debt|"This paper explores whether the effectiveness of monetary policy can be affected by the degree of household indebtedness. We take an interacted panel VAR approach using a panel of 28 countries and thereby obtain several interesting findings. That is, the responses of consumption and investment to monetary shocks are stronger in the state of high household debts. Such responses furthermore become larger in a contractionary monetary policy stance rather than in an expansionary one. Finally, we find that the negative impact of contractionary monetary shocks on the real economy is stronger in the countries with a higher share of adjustable rate loans. We conjecture that these findings lend support for the presence of ""cash flow channel"" with respect to the transmission of contractionary monetary policy."
R38|Options to Manage FHAâ€™s Exposure to Risk From Guaranteeing Single-Family Mortgages|The Federal Housing Administration insures the mortgages of people who might otherwise have trouble getting a home loan. This report analyzes policy options to reduce FHAâ€™s exposure to risk from its program to guarantee single-family mortgagesâ€”including creating a larger role for private lenders and restricting the availability of FHAâ€™s guaranteesâ€”while continuing to fulfill the agencyâ€™s primary mission of ensuring access to credit for first-time homebuyers and low-income borrowers.
R38|Transferring Credit Risk on Mortgages Guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac|In 2013, at the direction of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began to transfer some of the credit risk of their mortgage guarantees to investors. This report examines how they have done so and analyzes two approaches for expanding their efforts: increasing the amount of risk shared on new guarantees and transferring some of the risk on mortgages guaranteed before 2013.
R38|The Compact City in Empirical Research: A Quantitative Literature Review|The 'compact city' is one of the most prominent concepts to have emerged in the global urban policy debate, though it is difficult to ascertain to what extent its theorised positive outcomes can be substantiated by evidence. Our review of the theoretical literature identifies three main compact city characteristics that have effects on 15 categories of outcomes: economic density, morphological density and mixed land use. The scope of our quantitative evidence-review comprises all theoretically relevant combinations of characteristics and outcomes. We review 321 empirical analyses in 189 studies for which we encode the qualitative result along with a range of study characteristics. In line with theoretical expectations, 69% of the included analyses find normatively positive effects associated with compact urban form, although the mean finding is negative for almost half of the combinations of outcomes and characteristics.
R38|Transfer taxes and household mobility: Distortion on the housing or labor market?|We estimate the effect of the UK Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) – a transfer tax on the purchase price of property or land – on different types of household mobility using micro data. Exploiting a discontinuity in the tax schedule, we isolate the impact of the tax from other determinants of mobility. We compare homeowners with self-assessed house values on either sides of a cut-off value where the tax rate jumps from 1 to 3 percent. We find that a higher SDLT has a strong negative impact on housing-related and short distance moves but does not adversely affect job-induced or long distance mobility. Overall, our results suggest that transfer taxes may mainly distort housing rather than labor markets.
R38|The energy costs of historic preservation|We explore the impact of historical preservation policies on domestic energy consumption. Using panel data for England from 2006 to 2013 and employing a fixed effects-strategy, we document that (i) rising national energy prices induce an increase in home energy efficiency installations and a corresponding reduction in energy consumption and (ii) this energy saving effect is significantly less pronounced in Conservation Areas and in places with high concentrations of Listed Buildings, where the adoption of energy efficiency installations is typically more costly and sometimes legally prevented altogether. Preservation policies increase private energy costs and the social cost of carbon per designated dwelling by around £8,000 and £2,550, respectively. These costs ought to be weighed against any benefits of preservation
R38|Welfare Cost of the Real Estate Transfer Tax|"This paper considers the welfare implications of a tax on real estate transfers. A theoretical analysis shows how the discouragement of mutually beneficial transactions as well as tax- sheltering activities give rise to a welfare loss that can be estimated using the empirical elasticity of the tax base. In the absence of tax planning and tax capitalization effects, the elasticity of the tax base is determined by the hazard rate to deter transactions at the margin. With tax planning, the elasticity of the tax base is also driven by the ""technology"" of tax sheltering. The paper also shows how tax capitalization effects can be accounted for in the welfare analysis. Empirical evidence on the deadweight loss is obtained from the analysis of real estate transfer taxes in Germany. After a constitutional reform has granted the German states the right to set the local rate of the real estate transfer tax, over the last ten years many states have made use of this discretion and have increased the tax rate - some of them repeatedly. Based on the empirical estimate of the revenue effect of these tax increases and of tax capitalization effects, the paper shows that the German experience points to a substantial welfare cost of real estate transfer taxation."
R38|Low Homeownership in Germany - A Quantitative Exploration|The homeownership rate in Germany is one of the lowest among advanced economies. To better understand this fact, we analyze the role of three specific policies which discourage homeownership in Germany: an extensive social housing sector with broad eligibility criteria, high transfer taxes when buying real estate, and no tax deductions for mortgage interest payments by owner-occupiers. We build a lifecycle model with uninsurable income risk and endogenous homeownership in order to quantify the policy effects on homeownership and welfare. We find that all three policies have sizable effects on the homeownership rate. At the same time, household welfare would be reduced by moving to a policy regime with low transfer taxes and mortgage interest tax deductions, but it would improve in the absence of social housing, in particular when coupled with housing subsidies for low-income households.
R38|The Macroeconomic Effects of Government Asset Purchases: Evidence from Postwar U.S. Housing Credit Policy|We document the portfolio activity of federal housing agencies and provide evidence on its impact on mortgage markets and the economy. Through a narrative analysis, we identify historical policy changes leading to expansions or contractions in agency mortgage holdings. Based on those regulatory events that we classify as unrelated to short-run cyclical or credit market shocks, we find that an increase in mortgage purchases by the agencies boosts mortgage lending, in particular refinancing, and lowers mortgage rates. Agency purchases also influence prices in other asset markets, stimulate residential investment, and expand homeownership. We compare these effects to those of conventional monetary policy shocks, and we provide evidence on the interactions between housing credit and monetary policies.

En primer lugar, se realiza una aproximación del efecto del tamaño de clase sobre el rendimiento en las pruebas de estado por medio de efectos fijos para controlar por la heterogeneidad no observada de los colegios. Posteriormente, se propone una metodología de variable instrumental con el fi n de contar con una estrategia de identi ficación que vaya más allá de hacer una simple comparación del desempeño de los estudiantes con diferentes tamaños de clase.
R38|The impact of Urban Enterprise Zones on establishment location decisions and labor market outcomes: evidence from France|In this article, we study the impact of a French enterprise zone program—the ‘Zones Franches Urbaines’ (ZFUs) policy—on establishment location decisions and on labor market outcomes. Our main identification strategy, which combines spatial and time differencing, shows that conditional on locating in a municipality that hosts a ZFU, the policy has a positive and sizable impact on the probability to locate in the ZFU part rather than in the non-ZFU part of municipalities. However, the impact is highly heterogeneous across zones, industries and firms. We also show that this positive effect is entirely due to within-municipality diversion effects. Regarding labor market outcomes, the policy has a positive effect on employment, especially for low-wage workers. As for wages, the effect is null for low-wage workers, and negative for high-wage ones.
R38|Are inclusionary housing programs color-blind? The case of Montgomery County MPDU program|Relying on exhaustive administrative data spanned over four decades, this paper studies the treatment of African American applicants by the Moderately Priced Dwelling Unit (MPDU) program in Montgomery County, MD. We show that this program was equally accessible to African-American applicants, except between 1995 and 2000, when African Americans’ conditional probability of purchasing a home through the program was lowered by 10% compared to that of other applicants, maybe as a temporary response to the sudden surge in African American applicants that occurred at that time, even though we cannot rule out that this may also have reflected changes in applicant behavior. Turning to the outcome of the allocation process, we show that African American MPDU beneficiaries purchase homes located in cheaper neighborhoods and that the spatial allocation of beneficiaries does reflect preference-based sorting patterns observed on the private housing market at the neighborhood level. However, we also show that the program seems to induce some scattering of different ethnic groups at the most local level: when comparing beneficiaries living in the same housing development, but at different addresses, we find that African American beneficiaries have fewer African–American neighbors.
R38|Macroeconomic Effects of Rental Housing Regulations: The Case of Germany in 1950-2015|Despite rather skeptical attitude of the economists toward the state intervention in the housing markets, the policy makers and general public typically are supporting it. As a result, in many European countries, since World War I the rent and eviction controls as well as social housing policies remain an important element of the government economic policies. Nevertheless, the macroeconomic effects of such regulations are largely unknown. In this paper, we evaluate the effects of government rental market regulations on real house prices, price-to-rent, and price- to-income ratios, real rents, and new housing construction in Germany in 1950_2015. The regulations are measured by the indices developed by the authors based on a thorough analysis of the legal acts issued mostly by the central government but also by the regional authorities between 1914 and 2015.
R38|Landlords avoid tenants who pay with vouchers|This paper uses a correspondence experiment with fictional housing applicants to test how landlords respond to tenants paying with a subsidized voucher. Landlords respond positively to those wishing to pay by voucher only half as often as to those indicating no such desire. Within the set of apartments eligible for voucher rent limits, the voucher penalty increases with monthly rent. Landlord behavior places quantitatively important restrictions on the quantity and type of apartments available to voucher recipients.
R38|Addressing household indebtedness: Monetary, fiscal or macroprudential policy?|In this paper, we build a dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium model with housing and household debt, and compare the effectiveness of monetary policy, housing-related fiscal policy, and macroprudential regulations in reducing household indebtedness. Excessive household debt arises due to exuberance shocks on house price expectations, which drive a wedge between the actual and the underlying fundamental value of houses. The estimated model also features long-term fixed-rate borrowing and lending across two types of households, and differentiates between the flow and the stock of household debt. Our main findings can be summarized as follows: (i) Monetary tightening is able to reduce the stock of real mortgage debt, but leads to an increase in the household debt-to-income ratio. (ii) Among the policy tools we consider, tightening in mortgage interest deduction and regulatory loan-to-value (LTV) are the most effective and least costly in reducing household debt, followed by increasing property taxes and monetary tightening. (iii) Although mortgage interest deduction is a broader tool than regulatory LTV, and therefore potentially more costly in terms of output loss, it is effective in reducing overall mortgage debt, since its direct reach also extends to home equity loans. (iv) Lowering regulatory LTV and mortgage interest deductions from their current levels would be welfare improving, while we find weak support for systematic leaning against household imbalances through monetary policy.
R38|The Right to Buy public housing in Britain: A welfare analysis|We investigate the impact on social welfare of the United Kingdom (UK) policy introduced in 1980 by which public housing tenants (council housing in UK parlance) had the right to purchase their houses at heavily discounted prices. This was known as the Right to Buy (RTB) policy. Although this internationally-unique policy was the largest source of public privatization revenue in the UK and raised home ownership as a share of housing tenure by around 15%, the policy has been little analyzed by economists. We investigate the equilibrium housing policy of the public authority in terms of quality and quantity of publicly-provided housing both in the absence and presence of a RTB policy. We find that RTB can improve the aggregate welfare of low-income households only if the council housing quality is sufficiently low such that middle-wealth households have no incentive to exercise RTB. We also explore the welfare effects of various adjustments to the policy, in particular (i) to reduce discounts on RTB sales; (ii) to loosen restrictions on resale; (iii) to return the proceeds from RTB sales to local authorities to construct new public properties; and (iv) to replace RTB with rent subsidies in cash.
R38|To build above the limit? Implementation of land use regulations in urban China|This paper studies the implementation of land use regulations in urban China. In particular, we investigate land developers’ compliance with floor-to-area ratio (FAR) regulations using a unique set of residential land parcel data from 30 major Chinese cities matched with the corresponding residential development projects built on those parcels. In our sample, in more than 20% of the cases, developers built above the regulatory FAR limits in the ex post land development, and the total floor area built in those cases increased 21.5% over the regulatory limit. Our analysis finds that attractive land location attributes tend to induce developers to pursue upward adjustments of FAR. Moreover, developers who are more likely to have special relationships with government officials tend to make larger upward adjustments. Our estimates suggest that there exists a significant gap between the privately optimal FAR that maximizes land value and the regulatory FAR. This gap is only modestly reduced by corrupt ties with government officials, implying that FAR regulations have imposed a highly restrictive constraint on China's urban land development even given imperfect compliance.
R38|Public subsidies, TFP and efficiency: A tale of complex relationships|This paper evaluates the impact of subsidies on the different components of TFP for granted firms’ long-term growth. The impact of capital subsidies is captured by a quasi–experimental method (Multiple RDD), exploiting the conditions for a local random experiment created by an Italian industrial policy. Results show that capital subsidies negatively affect TFP growth in the short term, and signals of positive effects appear only after 3–4 years. This positive medium-long term impact comes especially through technological change and not through scale impact change, as may have been expected.
R38|The Energy Costs of Historic Preservation|We explore the impact of historical preservation policies on domestic energy consumption. Using panel data for England from 2006 to 2013 and employing a fixed effects-strategy, we document that (i) rising national energy prices induce an increase in home energy efficiency installations and a corresponding reduction in energy consumption and (ii) this energy saving effect is significantly less pronounced in Conservation Areas and in places with high concentrations of Listed Buildings, where the adoption of energy efficiency installations is typically more costly and sometimes legally prevented altogether. Preservation policies increase private energy costs and the social cost of carbon per designated dwelling by around £8,000 and £2,550, respectively. These costs ought to be weighed against any benefits of preservation.
R38|Developing Inclusive Communities: Challenges and Opportunities for Mixed-Income Housing|"Over the past decade, housing costs have risen faster than incomes. The need for affordable rental housing has well outpaced the number of available units as well as funding allocations at the federal level. Local regulation and land use policies that increase the cost of subsidized, mixed-income housing construction and preservation have contributed to the affordability problem. {{p}} To meet the affordable housing needs in U.S. communities, innovation, creativity, and ""out of the box"" thinking may be required, particularly as it relates to reducing the rapidly increasing costs of development. Another consideration is pursuing mixed-income development, as it is more financially sustainable than low-income housing. Mixed-income neighborhoods are also desirable as they can lead to substantially better outcomes for families because the higher disposable incomes of a broader economic mix of families attract additional private investment, amenities, and opportunities. {{p}} This discussion paper explores new ideas about how affordable housing in an economically integrated, mixed-income community setting could be developed and operated in an environment of declining government subsidies. Based on interviews with housing stakeholders in Atlanta, Georgia, Jacksonville, Florida, and Nashville, Tennessee, we have compiled ideas that could be scalable and replicable and could result in substantial cost savings without compromising mission, integrity, performance, or accountability. Specific suggestions include standardizing qualifying income targets and other standards imposed by funders and reducing building and permitting barriers to development, such as limited zoning for multifamily housing and regulations limiting wood frame construction. More generally, participants thought existing stakeholders could better address the underlying political environment by creating a unified constituency to advocate for more mixed-income communities. These ideas and lessons learned from the mixed-use, mixed-income revitalization experience may inform and assist cities in rebuilding or enhancing their urban core."

However, it has three major flaws. First, because homeowner equity accumulates slowly during the first decade, homeowners are essentially renting their homes from lenders. With so little equity accumulation, many lenders require large down payments. Second, in each monthly mortgage payment, homeowners substantially compensate capital markets investors for the ability to prepay. The homeowner might have better uses for this money. Third, refinancing mortgages is often very costly. We propose a new fixed-rate mortgage, called the Fixed-Payment-COFI mortgage (or ""Fixed-COFI mortgage""), that resolves these three flaws. This mortgage has fixed monthly payments equal to payments for traditional fixed-rate mortgages and no down payment. Also, unlike traditional fixed-rate mortgages, Fixed-COFI mortgages do not bundle mortgage financing with compensation paid to capital markets investors for bearing prepayment risks; instead, this money is directed toward purchasing the home. The Fixed-COFI mortgage exploits the often-present prepayment-risk wedge between the fixed-rate mortgage rate and the estimated cost of funds index (COFI) mortgage rate. Committing to a savings program based on the difference between fixed-rate mortgage payments and payments based on COFI plus a margin, the homeowner uses this wedge to accumulate home equity quickly. In addition, the Fixed-COFI mortgage is a highly profitable asset for many mortgage lenders. Fixed-COFI mortgages may help some renters gain access to homeownership. These renters may be, for example, paying rents as high as comparable mortgage payments in high-cost metropolitan areas but do not have enough savings for a down payment. The Fixed-COFI mortgage may help such renters, among others, purchase homes."
R38|Neighborhood Choices, Neighborhood Effects and Housing Vouchers|"We study how households choose neighborhoods, how neighborhoods affect child ability, and how housing vouchers influence neighborhood choices and child outcomes. We use two new panel data sets with tract-level detail for Los Angeles county to estimate a dynamic model of optimal tract-level location choice for renting households and, separately, the impact of living in a given tract on child test scores (which we call “child ability"" throughout). We simulate optimal location choices and changes in child ability of the poorest households in our sample under various housing-voucher policies. We demonstrate that a Moving-to-Opportunity type voucher, in which people residing in high poverty tracts are given a voucher to move to low-poverty tracts, does not affect child ability as households use the voucher to move to relatively inexpensive, low-impact neighborhoods. When vouchers are restricted such that they can only be applied in tracts with large effects on children, we demonstrate the total benefits of any voucher less than $700 per month exceed the costs and the voucher that maximizes total social surplus is $300 per month."
R38|Land-use regulations, property values, and rents: Decomposing the effects of the California Coastal Act|Land-use regulations can lower real estate prices by imposing costs on property owners, but may raise prices by restricting supply and generating amenities. We study the effects of the California Coastal Act, one of the nation’s most stringent land-use regulations, on the price and rental income of multifamily housing. The Coastal Act applies to a narrow section of the California coast, allowing us to compare properties just on either side of the jurisdictional boundary. The setting is advantageous for the study of land-use regulation: boundary location is plausibly exogenous, which we confirm with historical data on boundary placement, and orthogonal to other jurisdictional divisions. We decompose the effects of the regulation into (i) a neighbor effect, the value of restrictions on adjacent properties, (ii) a local effect, which reflects the net effect of own-lot restrictions and the neighbor effect, and (iii) an external effect, the value of amenities generated by restrictions on all properties within the regulated area. Our analysis of multifamily housing prices reveals local and external effects of approximately +6% and +13%, respectively. We use data on rental income to estimate a zero neighbor effect. Together with evidence on building ages and assessed building and land values, this suggests that property owners anticipate that the Coastal Act will provide protection from undesirable development on adjacent properties, even though material differences have not yet appeared.
R38|First-Time Homebuyers: Toward a New Measure|Existing data sources show divergent estimates of the number of homes purchased by first-time homebuyers as a share of all home purchases. In this paper, we use a new data set to construct a time series of the share of first-time homebuyers. This series, based on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Equifax Consumer Credit Panel (CCP), shows a significant decline in this share, particularly for young households, which is consistent with the decline in homeownership in this age cohort since the early 2000s.
R38|Sun, Regulation and Local Social Networks|The aim of this paper is to explain over-regulation and local social capital as barriers to immigration. The interest of social networks is that conflict resolution is independent of the law. Hence, if local individuals develop local social capital and regulation, foreigners without social networks are disadvantaged and can less easily migrate. We develop a two-country search-theoretic model where we endogenize the choice of procedural formalism (PF) and the network size. This model features two different equilibria: a Mediterranean equilibrium with PF and dense local social network and a Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon equilibrium without PF and local social networks.
R38|The effect of land lease on house prices|In Amsterdam, houses located on private land and houses with various land-lease contracts coexist. In this paper, we investigate the impact of future land-lease payments on the house price. We look at the impact on house prices of: (i) the number of years that the land lease has been paid in advance and (ii) the amount that must be paid up front. Houses on privately owned land are on average 10% more expensive. Houses with a land-lease contract that has been paid in advance are 0.41% more expensive for each year that no land lease has to be paid. We find a large and negative impact of the land-lease rent that needs to be paid on the house price.

R38|Housing Policy of Non-Bolshevik Governments During the Russian Civil War|This paper analyzes the governmental regulation of the rental housing market in the states that arose on the ruins of the Russian Empire during the Russian Civil war in 19181922. It examines and compares three major tools of the housing policy of those times: rent control, protection of tenants from eviction, and housing rationing. It shows evolution and continuity of the housing legislation of the non-Bolshevik governments and its relationship with the housing policies of Bolsheviks.
R38|Macroeconomic effects of varied mortgage instruments studied using agent-based model simulations|Mortgage instruments differ in many respects. Their microeconomic effects might be easily calculated but their effects on a macroeconomic level are not always easily understood. Agent-based models can be used to study the macroeconomic effects that emerge from the microeconomic behavior of multiple interacting agents. Using a macroeconomic model of a credit network economy we have found that inflation-indexed mortgages can mislead households’ expectations of risk, encouraging them to buy more housing due to their low initial amortizations which, in turn, stimulates housing prices. The results further hint that in long-run inflation-indexed mortgages create relatively more uneven housing wealth distribution in between households. We also find that the effectiveness of standard monetary policy tools is diminished when inflation-indexed mortgages are used. Banks partake in the interest rate risk with fixed rate mortgages but bear little or no risk with adjustable rate or inflation-indexed mortgages. We have seen in this study that mortgage types, macroprudential tools and other policy tools can be experimented on, give insights into the interplay between agents and insight into the effects that certain policy settings may have on a macroeconomic level.
R38|The Impacts of Tax Reforms on REITs. An International Empirical Study|Tax exemption is one of the REIT’s most unique characteristics. To improve the development of REITs market, the Congress had passed several Tax Reform Acts. Plenty of previous study had already explored the effects of tax legislation changing on REITs market. However the findings had not come to consensus. This might because most of them explored this topic by event study, which cannot control other events happening on the even dates. This paper tries to avoid the complications encountered in previous research by investigating the tax reform effects through the normal panel model with the data in the United States and then retest the hypothesis by a novel empirical model with panel market data in both U.S. and Australia. The results provide evidence that the Tax Reforms would truly affect the REIT’s performance with more solid empirical evidences. Furthermore, the results shed light on the tax policy and governance of a REITs market.
R38|Housing, the ‘Great Income Tax Experiment’, and the intergenerational consequences of the lease|This paper provides an analysis of how the New Zealand tax system may be affecting residential property markets. Like most OECD countries, New Zealand does not tax the imputed rent or capital gains from owner-occupied housing. Unlike most OECD countries, since 1989 New Zealand has taxed income placed in retirement savings funds on an income basis, rather than an expenditure basis. The result is likely to be the most distortionary tax policy towards housing in the OECD. Since 1989, these tax distortions have provided incentives that should have lead to significant increases in house prices and the average size of new dwellings, should have reduced owner-occupier rates, and should have led to a worsening of the overseas net asset position. The tax settings are likely to be regressive, and are not intergenerationally neutral, as they impose significant costs on current and future generations of young New Zealanders (and new migrants). Since it does not appear to be politically palatable to tax capital gains or imputed rent, to reduce the distortionary consequences of the tax system on housing markets New Zealand may wish to reconsider how it taxes retirement savings accounts by adopting the standard OECD approach.
R38|A Narrative Analysis of Mortgage Asset Purchases by Federal Agencies|This paper provides a narrative analysis of regulatory policy changes affecting the purchases and holdings of mortgages and related securities of five US government entities over the 1968–2014 period. We focus on federal government policies that aim to influence the allocation and/or supply of residential mortgage credit. We use contemporary primary sources and various institutional histories to identify significant policy interventions, to document their economic and regulatory context, surrounding motives, and pertinent timing, as well as to quantify projected impacts on agencies’ mortgage holdings. Finally, we classify each significant policy change as either ‘cyclically motivated’ or ‘non-cyclically motivated.’ The results of the narrative analysis of federal housing credit policy changes yield a record of events that can be used as an instrumental variable for agency purchase activity.
R38|Changes in the regulation and control of mortgage markets and access to owner-occupation among younger households|This paper looks at the issue of access to home ownership for younger people in OECD countries, from the point of view of changes in mortgage market regulation and control. It sets out the factors determining the demand for and supply of mortgages, particularly for first time buyers and it provides a review of the relevant literature and comparative data. The paper provides an overview of regulatory change since 2008 for over 20 countries. The paper also includes case studies of a subset of countries with mature mortgage markets that are known to face relevant issues and for which data are more readily available: Canada, Denmark, the United Kingdom and the United States.
R38|Regional regulators in health care service under quality competition: A game theoretical model|In several countries, health care services are provided by public and/or private subjects, and they are reimbursed by the government, on the basis of regulated prices (in most countries, diagnosis‐related group). Providers take prices as given and compete on quality to attract patients. In some countries, regulated prices differ across regions. This paper focuses on the interdependence between regional regulators within a country: It studies how price setters of different regions interact, in a simple but realistic framework. Specifically, we model a circular city as divided in two administrative regions. Each region has two providers and one regulator, who sets the local price. Patients are mobile and make their choice on the basis of provider location and service quality. Interregional mobility occurs in the presence of asymmetries in providers' cost efficiency, regulated prices, and service quality. We show that the optimal regulated price is higher in the region with the more efficient providers; we also show that decentralisation of price regulation implies higher expenditure but higher patients' welfare.
R38|Quality Competition in Healthcare Services with Regional Regulators: A Differential Game Approach|Abstract This article proposes a differential game model, in order to analyze markets in which regional regulation is operative and competition is based on quality. The case we have in mind is healthcare public service, where consumers (patients) choose the provider mainly basing on the providers’ location and the quality of services, while prices play a more limited role. In most European countries, within the same State, regional (or local) providers compete on quality to attract demand. Market regulation is set at national and/or regional level. Our model highlights the features of equilibrium in such a framework and specifically investigates how the differences in product quality evolve among regions and how inter-regional demand flows behave. Differently from some available similar models, that do not take into account the regional dimension of the decision process, we find that quality differentials among regions may persist in equilibrium.
R38|Modeling interregional research collaborations in German biotechnology using industry directory data: A quantitative social network analysis|We use industry directory data as a novel source of information to model the strength of interregional research collaboration in German biotechnology. Specifically, we gather data on the number of research collaborations for biotech actors listed in the BIOCOM Year and Address book and aggregate this information to the level of German NUTS3 regions. This allows us to set up a modeling framework that treats individual regions as nodes of the biotech research network. We then specify the collaboration activity between regional nodes as a function of research and economic capacities at the regional level, the geographical proximity between regions, and policy variables. Our results show that the strength of interregional research collaboration can be related to both node properties and the relationship between nodes. As such, we find that modern locational factors are positively correlated with the extent of interregional research collaboration, while geographical distance is found to be an impediment to collaboration. The results further show that the pursuit of network and cluster policies in the biotech sector, particularly through collaborative R&D funding, is positively related to the strength of the interregional collaboration activity.
R38|Die Umsetzung der EU-Richtlinie über Wohnimmobilienkredite<BR>[The Implementation of the EU Mortgage Credit Directive – on the Necessity of a Legislative Amendment]|Zusammenfasssung Die Richtlinie über Wohnimmobilienkreditverträge für Verbraucher wurde bei ihrer Umsetzung in deutsches Recht um neue Regelungen zur Kreditwürdigkeitsprüfung ergänzt. Die „außergewöhnliche“ Geldpolitik der Europäischen Zentralbank ist für den Immobilienmarkt mit Gefahren verbunden, tatsächlich besteht durchaus eine mögliche Konnexität zum Regulierungsvorstoß. Der Beitrag thematisiert die Zielsetzungen der Richtlinie, stellt die neuen Grundsätze einer Kreditwürdigkeitsprüfung der bisherigen Praxis gegenüber und analysiert die Auswirkungen für Banken und potenzielle Kreditnehmer. Der Autor kritisiert die EU-weite Regulierung auf diesem Sachgebiet und konkretisiert Ansatzpunkte einer richtlinienkonformen Änderung der deutschen Umsetzung.
R38|Place-Based Policies and the Housing Market|We study the economic effects of place-based policies in the housing market, by investigating the effects of a place-based program on prices of surrounding owner-occupied properties. The program improved the quality of public housing in 83 impoverished neighborhoods throughout the Netherlands. We combine a first-difference approach with a fuzzy regression-discontinuity design to address the fundamental issue that these neighborhoods are endogenously treated. Improvements in public housing induced surrounding housing prices to increase by 3.5%. The program's external benefits are sizable and at least half of the value of investments in public housing.
R38|Economic Challenges of Lagging Regions II: Recent Structural Reforms, Outstanding Needs and Governance Issues|This report is concerned with analysing, for eight EU Member States with lagging regions, the main structural reforms carried out over the past five to ten years, essentially those which are relevant for the European Structural and Investment Funds. Furthermore it provides an overview of the remaining structural reforms needed, including to the system and operation of governance, and their relevance for lagging regions. The identification of the remaining reforms needed is based on a detailed analysis of the main indicators that can be identified to assess the situation in each of the eight countries concerned and, so far as possible, in the lagging regions in them. An additional concern is to gauge the effects of the reforms carried out with a particular focus on the lagging regions. The first subsection of the report briefly sets out the structural reforms covered by the analysis and the rationale for choosing these from among all those subject to the European Council’s Country-Specific Recommendations. It then presents for each of the eight countries and the lagging regions the main structural imbalances in the form of a concise summary bringing out the main points emerging from the detailed analysis for each country. The second sub-section assesses the effects of labour market reforms on investment, productivity and competitiveness. A third sub-section examines the business environment in each of the countries and the lagging regions within these as well as the structure of enterprises and business demography, and attempts to relate this to the business environment. It also considers the reforms which have been carried out over recent years which have been aimed at improving the situation in which businesses operate.
R38|Economic Challenges of Lagging Regions III: Recent Investment Trends and Needs|This report focuses on investment in eight EU Member States and their lagging regions. Additionally, the analysis assesses the regional development strategies of the eight Member States and evaluates the main investment needs and complementary alternative support options of the lagging regions over the next ten years. The analysis is performed in two steps. The first step identifies the investment needs of the lagging regions from the countries’ own as well as from a European perspective. It analyses to what extent and in what form investments in the lagging regions have to be supported in order to satisfy the needs. The identification of investment needs is approached from two sides, a) the countries’ own assessments of investment needs and b) a comparative analysis of the lagging regions with more prosperous EU-28 regions that had similar economic development characteristics as the (Southern) lagging regions. The second step analyses the main national and regional investment trends over the last 10-15 years, and covers different types of investment, depending on whether they are seen from a National Accounts, European or international perspective.
R38|The clash of rural-urban migrants and real estate investors on Phnom Penh's housing market: Prospects for garment workers|Housing markets of large cities around the world, particularly in so-called developing and emerging countries, are currently experiencing a clash: On the one hand, large numbers of labour migrants arrive from rural areas and need cheap rental housing. On the other hand, international real estate investment, particularly in the upper market segment, is strong. The resulting mismatch of housing demand and supply increases segregation, marginalises the vulnerable and leads to massive urban development problems. Phnom Penh illustrates this particularly well: Along with Cambodia's rapid globalisation in the last decades, hundreds of thousands of migrants, particularly garment workers, have moved to the capital. Housing for them is insufficient both in terms of supply and quality, though, because Phnom Penh's entrepreneurial mode of governance also attracts many investors, who focus on more profitable and prestigious real estate projects, often linked to speculation. These push land values up and push cheap rental housing further and further outside the city. This study carries out an indepth analysis of the prospects for rural-urban migrant workers on Phnom Penh's investor-driven housing market by firstly outlining both migration and real estate investment trends and by secondly examining the case of garment workers' housing. To complement the scarce literature on the topic, field research and expert interviews have been conducted. From these, an assessment of the status quo, of stakeholders' approaches to it and finally, proposals for action are derived.
R38|Does Fiscal Equalization Lead to Higher Tax Rates? Empirical Evidence from Germany|This paper explores the role of fiscal equalization as a driver of states’ tax policy in Germany. We argue that fiscal redistribution of tax revenues provides an incentive for states to increase their tax rates. The analysis exploits differences in the degree of fiscal redistribution among the states over time. The results show a significant effect on tax policy: with full equalization of revenues from the real estate transfer tax the tax rate is about one percentage point higher than without.
R38|Welfare Cost of the Real Estate Transfer Tax|This paper considers the welfare implications of a tax on real estate transfers. A theoretical analysis shows how the discouragement of mutually beneficial transactions as well as tax-sheltering activities give rise to a welfare loss that can be estimated comprehensively from the empirical elasticity of the tax base. In the absence of tax planning, the elasticity of the tax base is determined by the hazard rate to deter transactions at the margin. With tax planning, the elasticity of the tax base is also driven by the “technology” of tax sheltering. Empirical evidence on the deadweight loss is obtained from the analysis of real estate transfer taxes in Germany. After a constitutional reform has granted the German states the right to set the local rate of the real estate transfer tax, over the last ten years many states have made use of this discretion and have increased the tax rate - some of them repeatedly. Based on the empirical estimate of the revenue effect of these tax increases, the paper shows that the German experience points to a substantial welfare cost of real estate transfer taxation. The preferred estimate suggests that each additional Euro of revenues raised is associated with an increase of the deadweight loss of about 67 cents.
R38|The Costs and Benefits of Alternative Development Patterns: A Paradigm of Two Universities|Cities are places where innovation, invention, technological and knowledge spillovers occur. However, they are also places where unemployment, crime, pollution, and exploitation of human resources occur. One major problem of cities of today is the low density leapfrog/scattered development pattern that leads to high service provision costs and reduces the welfare of society. This study aims at comparing the cost of smart versus scattered development patterns for Pakistan. Due to data limitations two universities are selected for analysis purpose. On the basis of observational analysis QAU is labeled as leapfrog/scattered whereas COMSATS is categorized as Compact Development. We hypothesize that low density scattered development leads to higher service provision and social costs and compact development can lead to cost savings. The empirical exercise consisted of a randomized survey indicate that COMSATS students have better access to different facilities due to compact development pattern. The ordinal probit model was employed on survey results. Connectivity was found to be significantly associated with walkability though association is not the same as causation. The comparative analysis for service provision cost showed striking cost differential, as QAU spends a lot more than COMSATS to provide basic facilities. The results prove the baseline hypothesis. It is suggested that. QAU should use elements of smart growth like infill development and should make better use of large land endowment rather than it has become a curse. Both universities should work to raise social interaction among students. The real benefits of smart growth lie with the cities, and each city should apply smart growth to achieve cost savings and higher social capital.
R38|Industry Clustering and Unemployment in US Regions: An Exploratory Note|Much has been written by various scholars and practitioners over the years about the benefits of industrial clustering, whether the clustering revolves around mature industries or around new and innovative industries (innovation clustering). The benefits of such clustering or local agglomeration economies supposedly include greater regional exports, greater employment growth, greater payroll growth, and greater new business establishment creation, among other impacts. However, the work for this research note has not uncovered much if any literature on how agglomeration affects United States regional unemployment rates. In general, greater clustering is associated with lower US metro area unemployment rates on average, although this depends upon how one defines a cluster. Additionally, most growing industrial and innovation clusters over the last two decades or so require highly educated and skilled workers. Since most of the unemployed at any given time tend to be less educated and less skilled than most workers on average, local and state economic development policies that focus on clustering must be careful in targeting lower unemployment rates as a policy goal or outcome. On the other hand, greater clustering and greater industry concentration do not seem to be associated with greater levels of unemployment during stagnant economic times as some may expect. That is, it does not appear that diversity of industry has an advantage over industry clustering and concentration in bad economic times. Finally, the arguments that decentralized or local economic development planning is better for the macroeconomy than centralized planning at the national level is discussed in light of the results for industrial clustering found in this paper.
R38|Evaluating direct and indirect treatment effects in Italian R&D expenditures|"During the last decades SUTVA has represented the ""gold standard"" for the identification and evaluation of causal effects. However, the presence of interferences in causal analysis requires a substantial review of the SUTVA hypothesis. This paper proposes a framework for causal inference in presence of spatial interactions within a new spatial hierarchical Difference-in-Differences model (SH-DID). The novel approach decomposes the ATE, allowing the identification of direct (ADTE) and indirect treatment effects. In addition, our approach permits the identification of different indirect causal impact both on treated (AITET) and on controls (AITENT). The performances of the SH-DID are evaluated by a Montecarlo Simulation. The results confirm how omitting the presence of interferences produces biased parameters of direct and indirect effects, even though the estimates of the ATE in the traditional model are correct. Conversely, the SH-DID provides unbiased estimates of both total, direct and indirect effects. On this basis, we provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of public policies in Italy. The estimates show the additionality of the policies on R&D expenditures. Decomposing the ATE, we demonstrate positive and significant direct effects, while the indirect impact is negative and meaningful, even if limited to the treated."
R38|Competition for Foreign Capital under Asymmetric Revenue-Orientation|This paper develops a model of inter-regional competition for mobile capital considering that regions may have different revenue-orientations. It shows that, if regions are asymmetric in terms of revenue-orientation, the less revenue-orientated region obtains higher tax-revenue and higher social welfare in the equilibrium than the more revenue-oriented region. However, if regions are symmetric, the equilibrium tax-revenue and social welfare are higher in the case of greater revenue-orientation of regions. Moreover, regions spend on public-investment and end up with Pareto-inferior equilibrium outcome, regardless of whether regions are symmetric or asymmetric. It also analyses implications of public-investment spill-over on equilibrium outcomes.
R38|Endogenous UK Housing Cycles and the Risk Premium: Understanding the Next Housing Crisis|Despite the lessons of the post-2007 housing crisis, it would be dangerous to suggest that there will be no similar future events. Here we define a 'crisis' as a period of sustained worsening in affordability followed by a collapse in house prices, both of which were features of the 1996-2009 period. Extending the standard life-cycle housing approach to a three-asset model which incorporates interactions with financial markets and uncertainty, it can be shown that endogenous housing cycles can explain volatility. Three parameters drive the system - the income and price elasticities of housing demand and the degree of risk aversion. Furthermore, a key feature of UK housing policy over the last ten years or more has been an attempt to increase housing supply in order to stabilise affordability. The model demonstrates that stabilisation is impossible for any plausible level of construction, if affordability is measured by the ratio of house prices to incomes. Nevertheless, the market has built-in stabilisers; this is demonstrated through the use of stochastic simulations, which illustrate the dynamics of house prices implied by our expected utility model. The model derives explicitly a housing risk premium as a key determinant of the user cost and, hence, house prices and affordability, a factor commonly ignored in many housing models. Moreover, we find that exogenous, persistent 'ups and downs' similar to the Great Moderation - Global Financial Crisis period complement the endogenous propagation mechanism of our model.
R38|The Persistent Effects of Place-Based Policy: Evidence from the West-German Zonenrandgebiet|Using a natural experiment, we show that temporary place-based subsidies generate persistent effects on economic density. The spatial regression discontinuity design controls for continuous local agglomeration externalities, so we attribute an important role to capital formation in explaining persistent spatial patterns of economic activity. This persistence is driven by higher local public investment levels, which local governments could maintain after the end of the program because of a persistently higher tax base. We also find evidence for significant local relocation of economic activity, which raises doubts that the net effect of the policy is positive. Finally, we show that transfers have capitalized in land rents such that pretreatment land owners have benefited from the program.
R38|Stimulating Housing Markets|This paper studies temporary policy incentives designed to address capital overhang by inducing asset demand from buyers in the private market. Using variation across local geographies in ex ante program exposure and a difference-in-differences design, we find that the First-Time Homebuyer Credit induced a cumulative increase in home sales of 397 to 546 thousand, or 7.8 to 10.7 percent, nationally. We find little evidence of a sharp reversal of the policy response; instead, demand comes from several years in the future. The program likely sped the process of reallocating homes from distressed sellers to high value buyers, which stabilized house prices. The response is concentrated in the existing home sales market, implying the stimulative effects of the program were less important than its role in accelerating reallocation.
R38|Multilevel Transmission of Cultural Attitudes and Entrepreneurial Intention: Evidence from High-School Students|Intention toward any occupational choice can be widely categorized as a rational choice process combined with a subjective attitude function. There is extensive literature dealing with the formation of intention toward entrepreneurship in adolescents, in particular as a result of either parental (vertical) transmission of social capital or network effects from peers or neighbours (the latter two being two different levels of horizontal transmission varying in proximity in terms of bonding and bridging). We contribute to this literature by considering the joint effect of all these three levels simultaneously, in order to avoid an underspecification of the model due to omission of important cultural factors. We hypothesize that such three levels identify a mechanism where the individual perception of their importance interacts with their objective characteristics. With data for second-year high-school students, and employing empirical triangulation through Logit and 3SLS methods, we find evidence for a strong parental effect and of secondary peer effects on student intention. We also detect clear endogenous effects from the neighbourhood and the overall cultural context. Moreover, entrepreneurship is confirmed to be perceived, even by students, as a buffer for unemployment and social mobility.
R38|The Housing Market and Housing Policies in Japan|Housing policies in Japan after World War II were focused on the quantitative supply of houses with a wide range of targeted groups and public rental houses. The Japan Housing Corporation (now the Urban Renaissance Agency) and the Government Housing Loan Corporation (now the Japan Housing Finance Agency) have served to address these policy targets accordingly. The restoration of housing stock was successful, but the collapse of the property bubble in the early 1990s caused negative impact on the real economy and created persistent loss of confidence among the Japanese people, which is exacerbated by deflation and negative demographic factors (decrease of the population and aging of society). Enhancement of the quality of houses is an important part of the housing policy in Japan, but, at the same time, there needs to be a balance between new construction and the activation of existing housing stocks. Given the social experiments currently underway, there is need to closely monitor the changes of market trends.
R38|Housing Policies in Singapore|Singapore has developed a unique housing system, with three-quarters of its housing stock built by the Housing & Development Board (HDB) and homeownership financed through Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings. As a result, the country’s homeownership rate of 90% is one of the highest among market economies. At different stages of its economic development, the Government of Singapore was faced with a different set of housing problems. An integrated land–housing supply and financing framework was established in the 1960s to solve the severe housing shortage. By the 1990s, the challenge was that of renewing aging estates and creating a market for HDB transactions. Housing subsidies in the form of housing grants were also introduced. Recent challenges include curbing speculative and investment demand, as well as coping with increasing income inequalities and an aging population. These have brought about carefully crafted macroprudential policies, targeted housing grants, and schemes to help elderly households monetize their housing equity. This paper analyzes key pillars of the housing policy, specifically land acquisition, the HDB–CPF system, the role of markets, housing market interventions, the Ethnic Integration Policy, and the Lease Buyback Scheme. It concludes with lessons learned for other countries.
R38|Housing Policies in Hong Kong, China and the People’s Republic of China|This paper analyzes the housing markets and housing policies in Hong Kong, China and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Both markets face housing affordability problems due to limited land supply, for which the solutions vary considerably. Hong Kong, China has adopted a railway and property development model, which involves close collaboration between the government and property developers in compact urban areas, while leaving most greenbelts and surrounding islands underdeveloped. Although the PRC has pledged to maintain a minimum level of basic farmland to feed its large population, this target has often been compromised due to local governments’ fiscal constraints and growth concerns.
R38|Housing policies in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the United States: lessons learned|We provide an analysis of the housing market and current housing policies in three developed countries: the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the United States. We focus on these three countries mainly because of the marked differences in their institutional settings. The United Kingdom is characterized by fiscal centralization and an extraordinarily rigid planning system. The consequences of this setting, which make housing supply extremely unresponsive to changes in house prices, are a high degree of urban containment, a severe housing affordability crisis, and a housing shortage, particularly for the young. The key UK policy, Help-to-Buy, which focuses on stimulating housing demand, fails to address the affordability crisis, because increasing demand only pushes up house prices further without expanding housing supply. Fiscal decentralization and a lax zoning system—both are encouraging residential development—and an extraordinarily low homeownership rate explain why Switzerland’s main political concerns are sprawl and rent stabilization. The country’s key policies aim to tackle these two concerns, but those same policies have some important unintended consequences. The United States is characterized by fiscal federalism and an enormous variation in the tightness of land use restrictiveness across metropolitan areas. The key policy concern across the country is homeownership attainment and the key policy to tackle this issue is the mortgage interest deduction (MID). This policy backfires in metropolitan areas that are prosperous and where land use is tightly regulated— “superstar cities”—because, in these places, the policy-induced demand increase mainly pushes up house prices. The MID increases homeownership attainment of only higher-income households in metropolitan areas with lax land use regulation. The net effect of the policy on homeownership attainment across the country is essentially zero. We conclude that the assessment of housing policies crucially depends on the fiscal and regulatory environment in local housing markets. Policies that stimulate housing demand, such as the MID or Help-to-Buy, are doomed to fail in markets with tight regulation or otherwise tight supply.
R38|Housing Policy in the Republic of Korea|This paper evaluates housing policy in the Republic of Korea over the past several decades, describes new challenges arising from the changing environment, and draws lessons for other countries. The most important goals of the housing policy have been to alleviate housing shortages and to stabilize housing prices. To achieve these goals, the government has been engaging the private sector while establishing public sector institutions and legal framework, providing developable land, and allocating housing units to intended target groups. Thanks to the sustained and massive provision of new housing since the 1980s, the country’s absolute housing shortage has been resolved, and overall housing conditions have improved substantially. Since the turn of the new millennium, enhancing the housing welfare of low-income households and the underprivileged has been added to housing policy goals. The supply of public rental housing was increased, and a housing benefit was introduced to address the new policy goal, but more work needs to be done. Today, the Republic of Korea also faces new housing challenges regarding the country’s demographic and socioeconomic changes.
R38|Housing System and Urbanization in the People’s Republic of China|This paper examines how transformations in the housing system in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) influence the PRC pattern of urbanization. It first discusses how housing policies determine the supply and demand of housing in urban PRC and subsequently analyzes how the changes in the mode of housing provision have affected rural–urban migration, intercity labor mobility, the financing of urban infrastructure, and general urban economic activities in the PRC. The PRC experience of the interaction between the housing system and urbanization is unique, but it clearly indicates that an effective housing system that can responsively provide adequate and affordable housing is crucial to the success of inclusive and equitable urbanization.
R38|Social Interactions and the Effectiveness of Urban Policies|Why does the implementation of urban policies with similar characteristics achieve disparate results? Why do the same policies work in certain social and economic environments, but not in others? What are the reasons explaining the varied outcomes? This presentation claims that social interactions, including neighborhood and network effects, may play a key role at explaining the effectiveness of urban policies. It is argued that the availability of new and better information, such as recent data obtained from social experiments, might provide new insights on how non-market interactions may condition policy interventions in an urban setting.
R38|The effect of local taxes on firm performance: evidence from geo-referenced data|This paper studies the impact of municipal non-residential property taxation on firms' performance using a panel data of italian manufacturing firms in 2001-2010. In the spirit of Duranton et al. (2011), we use a pairwise spatial difference instrumental variable es- timator which allows to tackle the endogeneity of local taxation. As well as providing robust inference to arbitrary cross-sectional dependence and serial correlation, our em- pirical strategy also improves on existing work by exploiting the exogenous variation in local taxes generated by the political alignment of each jurisdiction with the central government. We find that non-residential property taxation exert a negative impact on firms' employment, capital and sales to such an extent as to significantly affect total factor productivity.
R38|The Effect of Local Taxes on Firm Performance: Evidence from Geo-referenced Data|This paper investigates the impact of business property taxation on firms' performance using a panel of italian manufacturing firms. To account for endogeneity in local taxation, we exploit a pairwise spatial differenced generalized method of moments estimator. As well as providing robust inference, we also improve on existing work by exploiting the exogenous variation in local taxes generated by the political alignment of each local government with the central one. We find that property taxation exerts a negative impact on firms' employment, capital and sales to such an extent as to significantly affect total factor productivity.
R38|El precio de la «modernidad»: la evolución de la desigualdad en la propiedad de la tierra en la campaña de Buenos Aires, 1839-1914|This article studies the impact on inequality of land ownership distribution of the laws implemented during liberalization. It is based on the study of fiscal and demographic sources from three jurisdictions in the province of Buenos Aires between 1839 and 1914, a period covering the shifts from the provincial expansion of cattle farming to the Argentinian agricultural and livestock export boom. The methodology used here consists of the application of the Gini coefficient for the entire period, and for partial periods, as well as certain alternative and less mainstream criteria for comparing inequality, such as demographic changes and variations in the ratio of ownership over total population. While demonstrating the increase in inequality, results show uneven outcomes in terms of the actual impact of the implementation of the legal norms.
R38|Vamos a la Playa vs. Standing at the Gates: Beaches in Bulgaria|Beaches at the Bulgarian Black Sea coast were primarily a public good until the mid 1990s. By then the Bulgarian government granted private investors temporary property rights by providing concessions. Consequently, many beaches show characteristics of club goods nowadays. On a national level the process can be considered as a reallocation of public resources, thus affecting the well-being of many. This paper focuses on three aspects of this process and contributes to the ongoing discussion of how to handle public resources by addressing the case of beaches in Bulgaria. Firstly, we describe the process as it could be observed for beaches in Bulgaria in order to provide an analytical basis for further research. Secondly, stakeholders and their interests are identified. Thirdly, the paper points at conflicts between the different types of shareholders.
R38|The problem of land value betterment: a simplified agent-based test|Abstract In this paper, we employ behaviour-driven cellular automata as a simplified agent-based modelling approach to test the seminal Coase theorem, with a policy focus on the land value betterment effect of urban infrastructure provision. Four prototypical development regimes are identified from international practice: (1) the private developer-oriented Metroland model dating back to the suburbanisation of London in the nineteenth century England; (2) the private household-led special district model, which can be observed in many contemporary US suburbs; (3) the public planning-regulated model, as featured in most post-war European welfare state countries, including the present-day UK; (4) the public state-as-developer model, which characterises what has been taking place in China. A repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on the results of a large number of cellular automata simulations suggests no significant difference between models I and II in terms of their welfare outcomes measured by aggregate utility. However, models III and IV are both found to generate significantly less welfare than models I and II, under strict assumptions of zero transaction costs, perfect information, perfect capital markets and perfect competition.
R38|The location of initial public offering headquarters: An empirical examination|We study the headquarters location of U.S. firms with an initial public offering (IPO) over the 2001–2011 period. Specifically, we examine IPO intensity, defined as IPOs in a state scaled by state population. We find that IPO intensity is positively related to various measures of education. We also find that IPO intensity is positively related to an economic climate (freedom) index, degree of urbanization, and whether a state contains a financial center. Some economists see IPOs as a driver of economic growth. Thus, our results suggest factors that government officials may consider to increase the number of IPOs headquartered in their states.

Manche Krisen wiederum gingen scheinbar spurlos am deutschen Wohnimmobilienmarkt vorbei.
R38|Real Estate And The Great Crisis: Lessons For Macroprudential Policy|Credit conditions have caused real estate booms and busts, owing to an underpricing of credit risk aided by regulatory arbitrage and shadow financing. Across countries, real estate price and credit bubbles have reflected not only inelastic land supply and thin trading, but also the amplification of shocks via backward‐looking price expectations and financing based on distorted prices. Macroprudential lessons from the Great Crisis include preventing excess real estate financing and limiting the amplification and correlation of risks. Nonetheless, the costs and benefits of recent regulations require re‐evaluation amid an ongoing need to address correlated risks from shadow financing and securitization.

R38|Government Expropriation Increases Economic Growth and Racial Inequality: Evidence from Eminent Domain|Is it justified for states to appropriate private property rights? If so, should governments expropriate or regulate?We test three conventional views: insecure property rights cause underinvestment, moral hazard cause overinvestment, or public use cause economic growth.We embed these mechanisms in a model and measure them using the random assignment of U.S. federal court judges setting geographicallylocal precedent. For a half-century, racial minority Democrats were more likely to strike down government appropriations while Republican former federal prosecutors were more likely to uphold them. We find that pro-government physical takings precedent stimulated subsequent takings, expropriation of larger parcels, highway construction, and growth in construction, transportation, and government sectors as well as agriculture, retail, and financial sectors, overall economic growth, and property values. However, racial minorities were increasingly displaced, unemployed, and living in public housing, and the service sector declined. Pro-government regulatory takings precedent also spurred economic growth and property values, but did not increase displacement or racial inequality.

R38|The stickiness of national competitiveness: Implications for Switzerland and beyond|"This paper postulates that a country's competitiveness is sticky, i.e. it does not react immediately to changes in underlying framework conditions. The causes of this stickiness can be categorized along three dimensions. First, there is a delay between policy actions and their impact on competitiveness (""pipeline effect""). Second, visible reactions of firms to changes in framework conditions lag behind insofar as firms react relatively quickly on the margin, i.e. with new projects, but react only slowly with existing activities due to sunk-cost effects (""overflow effect""). Third, as politics reacts only to visible changes in competitiveness, and given that these actions again need time to take effect, reactions are systematically delayed. Policymaking should take into account all three of these dimensions of stickiness to prevent major damage to a country's competitiveness. This is especially relevant in a small open economy like Switzerland, as the relatively small size of the home market compared to exports amplifies the effect of changes in framework conditions on competitiveness. We therefore conclude by presenting policy measures to help anticipate and dissipate the negative effects of stickiness."
R38|Housing and Tax Policy| This paper investigates the effects of housing‐related tax policy measures on macroeconomic aggregates using a dynamic general‐equilibrium model featuring borrowing and lending across heterogeneous households, financial frictions in the form of collateral constraints tied to house prices, and a rental housing market alongside owner‐occupied housing. We analyze the effects of various tax policies and find that they all lead to significant output losses, with large long‐run tax multipliers of around 2. Among them, reducing the mortgage interest deduction is the most effective in raising tax revenue per unit of output lost, whereas reducing the depreciation allowance for rental income is the least effective.
R38|Causes and consequences of the Protestant Reformation|The Protestant Reformation is one of the defining events of the last millennium. Nearly 500 years after the Reformation, its causes and consequences have seen a renewed interest in the social sciences. Research in economics, sociology, and political science increasingly uses detailed individual-level, city-level, and regional-level data to identify drivers of the adoption of the Reformation, its diffusion pattern, and its socioeconomic consequences. We take stock of this research, pointing out what we know and what we do not know and suggesting the most promising areas for future research.
R38|Strip Clubs, â€œSecondary Effects,â€ and Residential Property Prices|"The ""secondary effects"" legal doctrine allows municipalities to zone, or otherwise regulate, sexually oriented businesses. Negative ""secondary effects"" (economic externalities) justify limiting First Amendment protection of speech conducted inside strip clubs. One example of a secondary effect, cited in no fewer than four United States Supreme Court rulings, is the negative effect of strip clubs on the quality of the surrounding neighborhood. Little empirical evidence that strip clubs do, in fact, have a negative effect on the surrounding neighborhood exists. To the extent that changes in neighborhood quality are reflected by changes in property prices, property prices should decrease when a strip club opens up nearby. We estimate an augmented repeat sales regression model of housing prices to estimate the effect of strip clubs on nearby residential property prices. Using real estate transactions from King County, Washington, we test the hypothesis that strip clubs have a negative effect on surrounding residential property prices. We exploit the unique and unexpected termination of a 17 year moratorium on new strip club openings in order to generate exogenous variation in the operation of strip clubs. We find no statistical evidence that strip clubs have ""secondary effects"" on nearby residential property prices."

R38|Deregulation and the determinants of network access: evidence from the German interurban bus industry| We investigate the characteristics of cities gaining access to the German interurban bus network in the first two years following the deregulation of the industry in January 2013. Applying both parametric and semi-parametric survival models, we find strong evidence that the probability of a city to be added to a provider’s network increases not only with the mere size of its population but also with further demographic characteristics such as average income or the share of young and old inhabitants. Additionally, while an increasing importance of tourism has a further positive effect, a rising automobile density is imposing a significantly negative impact on the probability of a city to gain access to the network.
R38|The Effects of Exposure to Better Neighborhoods on Children: New Evidence from the Moving to Opportunity Experiment|The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment offered randomly selected families housing vouchers to move from high-poverty housing projects to lower-poverty neighborhoods. We analyze MTO's impacts on children's long-term outcomes using tax data. We find that moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood when young (before age 13) increases college attendance and earnings and reduces single parenthood rates. Moving as an adolescent has slightly negative impacts, perhaps because of disruption effects. The decline in the gains from moving with the age when children move suggests that the duration of exposure to better environments during childhood is an important determinant of childrenâ€™s long-term outcomes.

R38|Does the EITC Buffer against Neighborhood Transition? Evidence from Washington, DC|Gentrification in major cities has led to concerns that poor and nonwhite residents are being displaced. This paper uses administrative data on tax filing households in Washington DC to examine the potential role that increases in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) plays in the location choices of the working poor. Its principal findings suggest small effects of the EITC on move decisions. Married households with dependents who received increased EITC payments are slightly more likely to remain in gentrifying neighborhoods. By contrast, single parent filers receiving EITC payments are more likely to exit these neighborhoods.
R38|The Economic Impact of Syrian Refugees on Host Countries: Quasi-experimental Evidence from Turkey|The Syrian Conflict generated forced immigration from northern Syria to southeastern Turkey. Arrival of refugees resembles a natural experiment, which offers good opportunities to study the economic impact of immigration. I study three main outcomes: labor markets, consumer prices, and housing rents. I document moderate employment losses among native informal workers, which suggests that they are partly substituted by refugees. Prices of the items produced in informal labor intensive sectors declined due to labor cost advantages generated by refugee inflows. Finally, refugee inflows increased the rents of higher quality housing units, while there is no effect on lower quality units.
R38|The Vulnerability of Minority Homeowners in the Housing Boom and Bust|This paper examines mortgage outcomes for a large sample of individual home purchases and refinances linked to credit scores in seven major US markets. Among those with similar credit scores and loan attributes, black and Hispanic homeowners had much higher rates of delinquency and default in the downturn. These estimated differences are especially pronounced for loans originated near the peak of the housing boom. These findings suggest that black and Hispanic homeowners drawn into the market near the peak were especially vulnerable to adverse economic shocks and raise concerns about homeownership as a mechanism for reducing racial disparities in wealth.

R38|"""Too small to farm, too big to mow”: The impact of large-lot zoning on the exurban landscape"| This study looks for one unintended consequence of large-lot zoning: the possibility that it will increase the amount of land converted from rural land cover to suburban lawn, even as it reduces the number of homes that are built in a community. This is one definition of “urban sprawl.” Few zoning studies consider selection bias in the choice of the zoning treatment. When the dependent variable measures parcel development (0 or 1) or land cover change (% of land converted), controls for selection bias are even less common, because these models employ nonlinear link functions. The present study uses inverse propensity score weighting to control for selection bias across six zoning classes in a study of the percentage of land cover change in northwestern New Jersey from 1995 to 2002
R38|Regional variation in margin response, participation, and potential federal expenditures under Dairy Margin Protection Program| Dairy policy under the 2014 farm bill is an insurance program based on national milk and feed prices, despite considerable regional variation in feed costs and milk prices. Milk production response to low margin periods between 2000 and 2012 is compared by region. Consistent with prior research, the response is much greater in the West. There is no evidence that eastern and mid-western dairies reduce production in response to low margins. Implications for potential total and regional government expenditures for the Dairy Margin Protection Program are evaluated in the context of historical supply response and 2015 participation rates.
R38|Mobilidade também é renda? Impacto das faixas exclusivas de ônibus nos preços de imóveis da Cidade de São Paulo: Uma análise por meio de painéis espaciais|Este presente trabalho tem como objetivo estudar os efeitos que as faixas exclusivas de ônibus possuem no preço de imóveis na cidade de São Paulo, entre os anos de 2011 e 2014. Nos últimos anos, têm-se intensificado a implantação desse tipo de política, e é importante analisar seus impactos objetivamente. A literatura teórica e empírica corrobora a tese de que políticas desse tipo tem impacto positivo nos preços. No entanto, esses estudos são escassos no Brasil e a aplicação de econometria espacial e dados longitudinais é recente. Utilizando diversos tipos de modelos e metodologias de maneira a se garantir a robustez dos resultados, a conclusão é que os as faixas de ônibus tiveram impacto positivo na cidade, e que a preocupação com os efeitos espaciais é importante e possuí efeitos relevantes.
R38|The effects of China's Sloping Land Conversion Program on agricultural households| In the late 1990s, China aimed to mitigate environmental degradation from agricultural production activities by introducing the world's largest “Payments for Environmental Servicesˮ program: the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP). We develop a microeconomic Agricultural Household Model, which can model the production, consumption, and nonfarm labor supply decisions of agricultural households in rural China in a theoretically consistent fashion. Based on this theoretical model, we derive an empirical specification, which we econometrically estimate using the Hausman–Taylor method and a large longitudinal farm household data set. The empirical results significantly differ between regions, but are generally consistent with the results of our theoretical comparative static analysis, for example, that the SLCP significantly decreases agricultural production. While the SLCP only increases nonfarm labor supply and total consumption in some regions, these effects could not be observed in others. The recent reduction of the SLCP compensation payment rates generally had negligible effects on agricultural production and off-farm work and only very small effects on household consumption.
R38|The Impact of the Home Valuation Code of Conduct on Appraisal and Mortgage Outcomes|Superseded by Working Paper 15-28. During the housing crisis, it came to be recognized that inflated home mortgage appraisals were widespread during the subprime boom. The New York State Attorney General’s office investigated this issue with respect to one particular lender and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The investigation resulted in an agreement between the Attorney General’s office, the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the GSEs’ federal regulator) in 2008, in which the GSEs agreed to adopt the Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC). Using unique data sets that contain both approved and nonapproved mortgage applications, this study provides an empirical examination of the impact of the HVCC on appraisal and mortgage outcomes. The results suggest that the HVCC has reduced the probability of inflated valuations and induced a significant increase in low appraisals. The HVCC also made it more difficult to obtain mortgages in the aftermath of the financial crisis.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R38|Multilevel Transmission of Cultural Attitudes and Entrepreneurial Intention: Evidence from High-School Students|Intention toward any occupational choice can be widely categorized as a rational choice process combined with a subjective attitude function. There is extensive literature dealing with the formation of intention toward entrepreneurship in adolescents, in particular as a result of either parental (vertical) transmission of social capital or network effects from peers or neighbours (the latter two being two different levels of horizontal transmission varying in proximity in terms of bonding and bridging). We contribute to this literature by considering the joint effect of all these three levels simultaneously, in order to avoid an underspecification of the model due to omission of important cultural factors. We hypothesize that such three levels identify a mechanism where the individual perception of their importance interacts with their objective characteristics. With data for second-year high-school students, and employing empirical triangulation through Logit and 3SLS methods, we find evidence for a strong parental effect and of secondary peer effects on student intention. We also detect clear endogenous effects from the neighbourhood and the overall cultural context. Moreover, entrepreneurship is confirmed to be perceived, even by students, as a buffer for unemployment and social mobility.

Les enjeux des politiques publiques zonées|This paper examines urban public policies for deprived areas in the light of urban economics theories and their lessons for the socio-economic organization of cities.?While improving living conditions is indeed a factor in enhancing the socio-economic standing of urban neighbourhoods, the process operates by attracting wealthier new inhabitants and driving out the existing poorer ones.?We emphasize that urban economics struggles to demonstrate the emergence of stable mixed urban patterns.?Either such patterns must be considered as transitional stages between two states of equilibrium in terms of segregation or attempts must be made to establish sustainable positive social interaction between privileged and deprived households within neighbourhoods.?Lastly, public action to promote urban regeneration, although subject to criteria of equity, enhances neighbourhood property values and may seek out leverage effects from private actors.?The final question seems to be that of city-wide transformation?: it is pointless reasoning on the scale of deprived neighbourhoods as if they were isolated.?Geographical ?lock-in? causes friction that detracts from the success of area-specific policies. And conversely, social opening-up is not geographically neutral because policies can only transform the geography of urban segregation. Classification JEL?: H31, R2, R31, R38, R58.

R38|The Net Benefit of Demolishing Dilapidated Housing: The Case of Detroit|We conduct an analysis of the costs and benefits of public investment in demolishing dilapidated residential housing in Detroit. While we estimate a positive net impact of teardowns on nearby property values, we also calculate a low marginal impact on local property tax collections. Under existing housing market conditions in Detroit, demolition costs exceed the present value of additional property tax revenues resulting from demolitions over 50 years. Using efficiency as the criteria for justifying spending public funds on demolition, average property values would have to increase by a factor of five to justify the demolition program.

Using extensive information on wind resources, transmission, electricity price and other restrictions that might affect the siting of wind farms, I calculate the predicted profitability of wind power projects for all the possible places across the contiguous US, use it as a counterfactual for profit-maximizing wind power investment and compare it to the actual placement of wind farms."
R38|The Preservation of Historic Districts - Is it Worth it?|I investigate the welfare effect of conservation areas that preserve historic districts by regulating development. Such regulation may improve quality of life but does so by reducing housing productivity - the efficiency with which inputs (land and non-land) are converted into housing services. Using a unique panel dataset for English cities and an instrumental variable approach, I find that cities with more conservation areas have higher house prices for given land values and building costs (lower housing productivity) and higher house prices for given wages (higher quality of life). The overall welfare impact is found to be negative.
R38|Traffic Externalities and Housing Prices: Evidence from the London Congestion Charge|This study exploits the introduction of the London Congestion Charge (CC) that greatly improves traffic conditions in Central London to provide new evidence on the capitalization of traffic externalities onto housing values. The Congestion Charge restricts traffic into the cordoned area by imposing a flat fee on drivers whenever they enter during charging periods. I show that the introduction of the CC in the Western Extension Zone (WEZ) increases home prices by 3.68\% relative to untreated housing units within 1 kilometre away from the CC boundary. These estimates, which measures the marginal willingness to pay to avoid negative traffic externalities, are robust to many changes in specifications, suggesting that homeowners pay to avoid traffic so as to reduce commuting time, to enjoy better air quality and less traffic noise, and to travel on safer roads.
R38|Does tax competition make mobile firms more footloose?|We examine a two-period regional model with evolving economic geography, potentially creating incentives for firm relocation between periods. We argue that tax competition makes firms more footloose, but that this increases efficiency relative to the laissez-faire outcome. We establish that: (i) tax competition leads to efficient investment outcomes and (ii) firm mobility is greater with tax competition than with a laissez-faire regime. When relocation is costly, there can be too little mobility over time, as firms do not take into account the impact of FDI on social welfare in each country. With lump-sum taxes or transfers, firms capture these benefits and internalize them, such that tax competition leads to the efficient outcomes. When more time periods are examined, tax competition induces firm relocation sooner than in its absence.
R38|The Home Front: Rent Control and the Rapid Wartime Increase in Home Ownership|The US home ownership rate rose by 10 percentage points between 1940 and 1945, about half the size of the net change over the 20th century, despite severe restrictions on construction during World War II. I present evidence that wartime rent control which covered over 80 percent of the 1940 U.S. rental housing stock played an important role in this shift, as suggested by Friedman and Stigler (1946). The empirical test exploits features of the central authority's method of imposing rent control, which generated variation in the size of rent reductions for cities that had seen similar increases in rents prior to control. Greater rent reductions were associated with greater increases in home ownership over the rst half of the 1940's. This relationship does not appear to be driven by di erential trends in housing demand or other unobserved factors potentially correlated with variation in rent reductions. The estimates suggest that rent control may explain 65 percent of the urban increase in home ownership over the rst half of the 1940's.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R38|Die Mietpreisbremse wirkt bisher nicht|On June 1, 2016, the much-discussed rental brake will have been in force for exactly one year. Since then, the rental brake has been implemented in 308 German cities. Prior fears that it would hamper urgently needed construction activity have not materialized, neither have hopes that the new regulations would allow low earners an improved access to the housing market. However, a purely descriptive analysis of the available data is not sufficient to properly assess the impact of rent regulations. Therefore, the present study examines how rents would have changed if no regulations had been in place and to what extent investors would have seen their expected earnings affected by the regulations. Housing rents and prices were analyzed by concentrating at the postal code districts, where the rental brake had been introduced, and the adjacent postal code districts, where the market remains unregulated. The findings of this differencein- differences approach suggest that the rental brake has not slowed the increase in rents. On the contrary, in the short term, it actually led to greater rent hikes in the regulated markets. Even investors seem to be of the opinion that the regulations will have no substantial effect in the future: the causal effects of the rental brake on the development of housing prices—as a reflection of future rental income—are relatively small. In order to provide a sustainable solution to the housing shortage, priority should be given to measures that stimulate an expansion of construction activity and make the housing supply more flexible. From a social policy point of view, a temporary rental brake can still be justified. It must, however, be structured in such a way that it does not restrict incentives for housing construction in the future. Am 1. Juni 2016 ist die viel diskutierte Mietpreisbremse ein Jahr in Kraft. Seither wurde sie in 308 Städten eingeführt. Die im Vorfeld geäußerten Befürchtungen, die dringend benötigte Bautätigkeit würde damit massiv ausgebremst, haben sich ebenso wenig bewahrheitet wie die Hoffnungen, die Neuregelung könne den Zugang von GeringverdienerInnen zum Wohnungsmarkt spürbar verbessern. Um die Wirkung der Mietregulierung zu beurteilen, reicht der alleinige Blick auf einzelne statistische Reihen allerdings nicht aus. Die vorliegende Studie untersucht deshalb, wie sich die Mieten verändert hätten, wenn keine Regulierung vorgenommen worden wäre und in welchem Umfang die Investoren ihre Ertragserwartungen durch die Regulierung beeinträchtigt sehen. Dazu werden Mieten und Wohnungspreise in benachbarten Postleitzahlbezirken analysiert, die sich darin unterscheiden, dass in einem Bezirk die Mietpreisbremse eingeführt wurde, während in dem anderen Bezirk der Markt unreguliert blieb. Die Ergebnisse dieses sogenannten Difference-in-Differences-Ansatzes legen nahe, dass die Mietpreisbremse den Anstieg der Mietpreise nicht entschleunigen konnte. Im Gegenteil: Sie hat kurzfristig sogar zu einem stärkeren Mietpreisanstieg in regulierten Märkten geführt. Auch scheinen Investoren der Auffassung zu sein, dass die Regulierung auch in Zukunft keine substanzielle Wirkung entfaltet: Die kausalen Effekte der Mietpreisbremse auf die Entwicklung der Wohnungspreise – als Reflektion zukünftiger Erträge aus der Vermietung – sind relativ gering. Um das Problem der Wohnungsknappheit nachhaltig zu lösen, sollten Maßnahmen im Vordergrund stehen, die eine Ausweitung der Bautätigkeit und eine Flexibilisierung des Wohnungsangebots ermöglichen. Aus sozialpolitischen Gesichtspunkten kann eine Mietpreisbremse temporär dennoch gerechtfertigt sein. Allerdings muss sie so gestaltet werden, dass sie die Anreize für den Wohnungsbau nicht beschneidet.

R38|Housing and mortgage dynamics: evidence from household surveys|This paper discusses research that uses Dutch household survey data to study housing and mortgage dynamics. After introducing broad developments and summarizing related work on heterogeneity, this paper focuses on the role of loan-to-value ratios. Household survey data suggests that the increase of loan-to-value ratios for first-time buyers in the housing market has come to a halt. Using ordered logit regressions, we find that house characteristics and demographic variables can explain heterogeneity in LTV ratios.
R38|Exports versus export-platform FDI with endogenous wage determination|In this paper, we explain why unionized MNFs in the same industry choose different entry modes between export and export-platform FDI when serving the same market. The platform-type FDI becomes more likely, ceteris paribus, with higher wage-oriented behavior by the unions, deeper trade liberalization in the host country, and lower fixed costs incurred in the FDI. Some of our results are counter-intuitive. It is particularly shown that a non-unionized MNF undertakes FDI whereas a unionized MNF remains in the domestic country even in the absence of productivity differences between the firms. Under certain conditions, trade liberalization in the host country might cause a complete reversal in the location pattern between unionized and non-unionized firms. Moreover, FDI induced by trade liberalization might hurt the domestic economy as a whole due to the loss of union rents and rival firms' profits, which provides a rationale for the use of lump-sum production subsidies as a government policy.
R38|The spatial decay in commuting probabilities: Employment potential vs. commuting gravity|We show that an employment potential capitalisation model produces estimates of the spatial decay in employment impact on land prices that are very close to the decay observed in commuting data.
R38|Reducing the impact of real estate foreclosures with Amortizing Participation Mortgages|We employ Amortizing Participation Mortgage (APM) to offer a novel ex post renegotiation method of a foreclosure. APM belongs to the family of home loan credit facilities advocated in the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 2010. In our framework, APMs reduce the endemic agency costs of debt by improving affordability. These benefits increase the demand for real estate in bust times and reduce fragility of the financial system thereby preventing foreclosures. We evaluate APMs in a stochastic control framework and provide solutions for an optimal amortization schedule. We generalize our approach to partially amortizing and commercial mortgages which encompass balloon payments. Finally, we provide concrete numerical examples of home loan modifications. We also offer detailed sensitivity analysis to market parameters such as house price volatility and interest rates.
R38|FHA loan performance and adverse selection in mortgage insurance|Using propensity score matching and survival analysis, we examine the performance of FHA- and privately-insured home purchase mortgages relative to uninsured mortgages. Privately-insured loans are more likely to default than uninsured loans with comparable risk characteristics, indicating the presence of adverse selection. By contrast, loans insured by FHA are not more likely to default than similar uninsured loans. Hazard ratios for both insurance types fall when an adjusted rate spread variable, but does not eliminate the disparity between uninsured and privately-insured loans. On the other hand, privately-insured loans are less likely to prepay while FHA-insured loans are more likely to prepay relative to uninsured loans.
R38|Preserving history or restricting development? The heterogeneous effects of historic districts on local housing markets in New York City|Since Brooklyn Heights was designated as New York City's first landmarked neighborhood in 1965, the Landmarks Preservation Commission has designated 120 historic neighborhoods in the city. This paper develops a theory in which landmarking has heterogeneous impacts across neighborhoods and exploits variation in the timing of historic district designations in New York City to identify the effects of preservation policies on residential property markets. We combine data on residential transactions during the 35-year period between 1974 and 2009 with data from the Landmarks Preservation Commission on the location of the city's historic districts and the timing of the designations. Consistent with theory, properties just outside the boundaries of districts increase in value after designation. Further, designation raises property values within historic districts, but only outside of Manhattan. As predicted, impacts are more positive in areas where the value of the option to build unrestricted is lower. Impacts also appear to be more positive in districts that are more aesthetically appealing.
R38|Housing wealth accumulation: The role of public housing|The public housing sector provides housing units at below-market rents, potentially allowing its tenants to save for a downpayment more quickly than they would have otherwise. In this paper, we analyze the effect of a spell in public housing on age at first-time homeownership using the French Housing Survey. We use a pseudo-panel approach that takes into account the specificities of the local housing market, to derive individual tenure transitions from multiple cross-sections data, for the period 1979–2006. Using an IV strategy to control for a potential selection into public housing, we jointly estimate public housing tenancy and duration before first-time homeownership, and take into account unobserved heterogeneity. Our results indicate that a spell in public housing increases the hazard to homeownership, supporting the idea that, in France in the study period, the public housing policy provided an important pathway to homeownership.
R38|Overreaction to policy changes in the housing market: Evidence from Shanghai|With the data of housing transaction records of Shanghai during 2004–2015, this paper comprehensively analyzes the housing market in this metropolis, and pays special attention to the market dynamics related to the frequent policy changes. We focus on the secondary market, and build repeat sales indexes. Then the AR(1)–GARCH(1,1) model is applied to estimate the weight of housing consumption incentives relative to investment incentives. It turns out that the overall market features strong consumption incentives, especially in the suburb area. Moreover, the market tends to overreact to policy changes. Compared with the suburb area, downtown features more investment incentives, lower returns and volatility, and less overreaction to policy changes. We infer that long-term investors overreact less than consumers. Finally, the purchase restriction policy and the issue of non-local buyers are discussed.
R38|The spatial decay in commuting probabilities: employment potential vs. community gravity|We show that an employment potential capitalisation model produces estimates of the spatial decay in employment impact on land prices that are very close to the decay observed in commuting data.
R38|Demanda de vivienda de los hogares en México|This article analyzes the demand for housing in Mexico through the approach of spending on housing services and user cost of owner-occupied of each representative household by income percentile. The hypothesis of permanent income as a function of the socio-demographic characteristics and the degree of education of the household head is included in the model. We obtain the elasticity of income, wealth, age of head of household, size of household and number of occupied; as well as the semi-elasticity of the user cost of residential capital. It should be noted that expenditure on housing is inelastic, although it is more sensitive to current income than the permanent income. We show that this market structure is regressive, therefore a sensitivity analysis is performed in order to measure the impact on the housing expenditure related to certain variations of the long-run user cost of owner-occupied.// Este artículo analiza la demanda de vivienda en México a través del gasto en servicios de vivienda y el costo de uso del capital residencial de cada hogar representativo por percentil de ingreso. La hipótesis de ingreso permanente se considera como función de las características sociodemográficas y el grado de educación del jefe del hogar. Asimismo, se obtienen las elasticidades de ingreso, riqueza, edad del jefe de familia, tamaño del hogar y número de empleados, así como la semielasticidad del costo de uso de capital residencial. El gasto en vivienda es inelástico, aunque es más sensible al ingreso corriente que al permanente. También demostramos que existe una estructura regresiva en este mercado y se realiza un análisis de sensibilidad con el fin de medir el impacto en el gasto de vivienda ante ciertas variaciones del costo de uso residencial de largo plazo
R38|Industrial cluster policy and transaction networks: Evidence from firm-level data in Japan|Cluster policy is designed to facilitate inter-firm networking. We examine industrial clusters in Japan based on firm-level transaction data. Firms in clusters expand transaction networks at a higher speed, but significantly only with firms in the agglomerated core Tokyo, not with local firms within the same region. We confirm the robustness by regional historical background as instruments. By disaggregating firms by their main bank types, we find that cluster firms expanding networks are mainly financed by regional banks, not by banks with nation-wide operations. This suggests the importance of intensive relationship with the main banks for inter-firm network formation.
R38|Finance and System of Provision of Water; The Case of Istanbul|Unlike many other metropolises around the world, water supply in Instanbul has been subject to commercial practices since the 19th century. The difference today, however, it is in the stage of a privatisation process of water resources, rather than the provision of water itself to the consumers. The role of the state at different levels still has an important and major role in the provision of water. Even if the water resources are started to be privatised, the financialisation of water provision is quite limited. That is why this paper focuses on the changing finance tools and the changing role of the state in water provision in Istanbul in a historical context.
R38|The Role of the State in Financialised Systems of Provision: Social Compacting, Social Policy, and Privatisation|This paper draws on a series of case studies to consider the Role of the State, using the systems of provision (SoP) approach where the state and market are not considered to be dichotomous entities (as in most orthodox literature). Rather, markets are organised by the state in ways that are continually evolving. Our coverage of this extensive topic has been delimited by focusing on three aspects of the role of the state. The first of these is social compacting which considers the ways in which economic, political and ideological interests relate to the state. This section considers the state’s role in representing different social interests with a declining influence of labour. The second aspect addressed here is the state’s role in social policy and the provision of basic services. The paper shows that this increasingly comes down to providing for the hard to serve while wider concerns of equity and redistribution are neglected. Finally the paper explores the role of the state in connection with privatisation. Using the empirical evidence of the case studies, the paper shows that implementation and outcomes have been diverse across sectors and countries but common strands are emerging. These sectors are far from competitive, and privatisation has created conditions for significant rent extraction in ways that were unintended at the time of privatisation
R38|Thirteen Things You Need to Know about Neoliberalism|This paper examines the theories and practices of neoliberalism drawing upon five case studies of housing and water across Poland, Portugal, South Africa, Turkey and the United Kingdom. This examination ranges across thirteen aspects of (‘things you need to know about’) neoliberalism. They include the argument that neoliberalism is not reducible to a cogent ideology or a change in economic or social policies, nor is it primarily about a shift in the relationship between the state and the market or between workers and capital in general, or finance in particular. Instead, neoliberalism is a stage in the development of capitalism underpinned by financialisation. Neoliberalism is highly diversified in its features, impact and outcomes, reflecting specific combinations of scholarship, ideology, policy and practice. In turn, these are attached to distinctive material cultures giving rise to the (variegated) neoliberalisation of everyday life and, at a further remove, to specific modalities of economic growth, volatility and crisis. Finally, this paper argues that there are alternatives, both within and beyond neoliberalism itself.
R38|Housing and Water in Light of Financialisation and “Financialisation”|This paper addresses the impact of financialisation on the systems of provision (SoPs) drawing on a series of case studies in housing and water – both non-financial sectors. In order to understand this more fully, the paper first considers some of the theoretical constructs connecting money, commodities and finance, exploring the theories of money, the extension of that theory to finance and the specification of the processes attaching finance to the non-financial. The paper shows that both case-study sectors have increasingly been subject to market forms with, for example, land markets in housing and cost recovery practices in water provision. However there are different forms of monetary relations across the case studies. Simply to equate financialisation with commodification would be misleading. The diversity of arrangements across sectors and locations is addressed in the paper by making the distinction between commodification (production for private profits), the commodity form (periodic payments for a good or service in the absence of a profit motive) and commodity calculation (application of a monetary logic without money changing hands). Each of these is associated with different forms of marketization and “market forces” but they are underpinned by different economic and social structures. The paper then goes on to tie these insights to financialisation and contemporary capitalism more generally with reference to the case studies. For housing there is variegation in the extent to which the expansion of finance coincides with expansion of material provision, as shown with for example the different outcomes from expanding lending for house production as opposed to mortgage lending for consumption. In water, there is diversity in the extent and nature of privatisation and this has led to differences in the extent and depth of financial intervention across the case studies. England and Wales lies at one extreme with heavily entrenched financialisation while this is considerably less significant in the case studies with less privatisation. The final section of this paper considers the implication of the different forms of financialisation for economic and social reproduction including gender.
R38|What determines the level of local business property taxes?|Conventional economic theory intuitively holds that local business property taxes, which account for over one-third of the state and local taxes that firms pay, should be efficiently structured in order to recover the exact cost of providing public services to these firms. However, this conceptual thinking does not accord with observed geographic and over-time variation in business taxation. To better explain these discrepancies, the author develops an alternative theoretical model with heterogeneous firms, some of which are more profitable than others in certain locations. This model more precisely captures observed business tax revenues and its implications are empirically tested using a nationally-representative database of effective tax rates for commercial property and owner-occupied housing. The alternative model better reflects the political and policy tradeoffs that local government officials face between balancing the need for government revenue while maintaining an attractive profit-making environment for businesses and attracting firms that will supply jobs for their constituents.
R38|The baraccati of Rome: internal migration, housing, and poverty in fascist Italy (1924-1933)|"Newly discovered archival material is used to document the standard of living of slum dwellers in fascist Rome. As part of the regime's effort to suppress growing shanty towns in the capital, the Governorate of Rome conducted a census in 1933, gathering information on the identity and living conditions of their inhabitants, the ""baraccati"". The paper analyzes the mostly migrant families of the shanty towns, identifying their social and demographic characteristics."
R38|The Effect of Local Taxes on Firm Performance: Evidence from Geo-referenced Data|This paper studies the impact of municipal non-residential property taxation on firms' performance using a panel data of italian manufacturing firms in 2001-2010. In the spirit of Duranton et al. (2011), we use a pairwise spatial difference instrumental variable estimator which allows to tackle the endogeneity of local taxation. As well as providing robust inference to arbitrary cross-sectional dependence and serial correlation, our empirical strategy also improves on existing work by exploiting the exogenous variation in local taxes generated by the political alignment of each jurisdiction with the central government. We find that non-residential property taxation exert a negative impact on firms' employment, capital and sales to such an extent as to significantly affect total factor productivity.
R38|How Inheritance Affects the Real Estate Market in an Aging Economy: Evidence from Transaction and Registry Data|The impact of population aging on real estate prices has been closely scrutinized by Mankiw and Weil (1989) and others. This paper sheds new light on the literature on asset meltdown by examining the mechanism how the death of property owners and subsequent inheritances affect the realty market. By combining the unpredictable nature of death and inheritance and the unique characteristics of the Japanese tax system, which provides an incentive to heirs to sell inherited properties shortly after inheriting them, we use the incidence of inheritance to instrument for the supply of real estate and examine the causal relationship between supply and realty prices to find the following. First, a higher incidence of inheritance results in a larger number of properties for sale. Second, a larger number of properties for sale as a result of inheritances decreases transaction prices in the real estate market. And third, there exists a substantial difference in the demand elasticity of real estate property depending on whether land use regulations were relaxed or tightened.

R38|How do housing purchase limits affect firm default risks in Mainland China?|The rapid rise in the price of housing in Mainland China in the past decade raised concerns over the potential risks to the economy, leading to the implementation of a policy that placed a limit on housing purchases in many cities in 2010 and 2011. This paper, by using the difference-in-difference method, investigates the effect of the policy on firm default risks. It shows that the impact of housing purchase limits is not homogeneous across cities. While the policy has significantly lowered firm default risks in big cities (especially those cities caught in the first two rounds of policy implementation), it is ineffective in relatively small cities and, in some cases, even caused firm default risks to rise. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the purchase limit on firm default risks becomes weaker when sectors those firms belong to have limited links to the real estate sector. While the purchase limit focuses on default risks arising from the demand side, the risk arising from the housing supply side remains under the current fiscal system and land sales mechanism. Therefore, the housing purchasing limit should be supplemented by fiscal reforms that could mitigate land price increase and hence lower default risks in the long run.
R38|Economic Effects From Change In Tourism Policy On An Island Economy|Taiwanese government adjusted its tourism policy toward Chinese people in 2008, hoping it would enhance its economic prosperity and create the employment. Motivated the economic effects generated by the relaxation of the policy were unclear, we have employed both the industry-related spillover model to examine the economic scale and the number of persons employed created, and to investigate the extent of the effect. Our findings were that the economic spillover effects were brief and transient. Nonetheless, it could overcome Taiwanâ€™s economic challenges. Only through the sustainable management of the tourism-related industry could long-term economic effects be created
R38|Circumstances, Intents, Hardships and Risks when Transiting from a Production-Led Economy to one Focused on Consumer|Chinese economy has grown rapidly and substantially for decades, without facing a serious crisis or destabilization and without suffering a correction, but this doesnâ€™t mean that it has definitely avoided corrections. On the contrary, it might signify that a correction is possible anytime, risking to be the harsher the later it happens. Chinaâ€™s numerous achievements are undeniable, but some of the very mechanisms that have nourished its successes â€“ mainly the distorted price system (relying on controlled, low prices for labour, capital, energy, land, natural resources, national currency, zero pollution costs, etc.) â€“ are the ones which now hinder its further modernization and growth dynamism. Excessively forced to grow very fast, Chinese economy developed structural imbalances and economic bubbles in almost each of its systems. This paper looks at some of the most dangerous economic bubbles and their linkage, as well as at the challenges and risks posed by the Chinese economy transition from export-and-production-led growth, to consumption-driven development.
R38|The Right to Buy public housing in Britain: a welfare analysis| We investigate the impact on social welfare of the United Kingdom (UK) policy introduced in 1980 by which public housing tenants (council housing in UK parlance) had the right to purchase their houses at heavily discounted prices. This was known as the Right to Buy (RTB) policy. Although this internationally-unique policy was the largest source of public privatization revenue in the UK and raised home ownership as a share of housing tenure by around 15%, the policy has been little analyzed by economists. We investigate the equilibrium housing policy of the public authority in terms of quality and quantity of publicly-provided housing both in the absence and presence of a RTB policy. We find that RTB can improve the aggregate welfare of low-income households only if the council housing quality is sufficiently low such that middle-wealth households have no incentive to exercise RTB. We also explore the welfare effects of various adjustments to the policy, in particular (i) reduce discounts on RTB sales; (ii) loosen restrictions on resale; (iii) return the proceeds from RTB sales to local authorities to construct new public properties; and (iv) replace RTB with rent subsidies in cash.
R38|Industrial Cluster Policy and Transaction Networks: Evidence from firm-level data in Japan|Cluster policy is designed to facilitate inter-firm networking. We examine industrial clusters in Japan based on firm-level transaction data. Firms in clusters expand transaction networks at higher speeds, but do so significantly only with firms agglomerated in Tokyo and not with local firms within the same region. By disaggregating firms according to their main bank types, we find that cluster firms expanding networks are mainly financed by regional banks and not by banks with nationwide operations. This suggests the importance of intensive relationships with main banks for inter-firm network formation.
R38|Housing Policy at the Municipal Level – The English Experience|Municipal housing is highly capital-intensive and therefore the majority of local government units (LGUs) in Poland cannot afford to provide council housing fast enough to shorten the waiting lists. Strengthening and development of municipal or affordable rent housing sector is one of the key challenges that housing policy at the municipal level in Poland has to face. According to the author, an interesting solution in this respect is to incorporate public-private partnership into the toolkit for implementing housing policy. This solution has been used for a long time in England, where the burden of providing housing to low income households was passed from LGUs to private non-profit organisations.
R38|“Porter vs Krugman”: History, Analysis and Critique of Regional Competitiveness|"The subject of this study is to determine the competitiveness through an interdisciplinary approach of the theories of the new economic geography and regional economy. This article describes in detail the theory of competitiveness, which is defined differently by many authors, with particular emphasis on opposing views of Michael Porter and Paul Krugman. One of the first writers who stressed the importance of the geographical position was Michael Porter. In his model, the author emphasizes that the geographical concentration of firms enhances productivity, innovation and export sector. Following this theory, many authors have focused on the research of the ""location problem "", which led to better connection of economics and geography. The result of these activities is the new guidelines that have been developed, such as the new theory of economic geography and regional economy. The new economic geography is mainly related to the Nobel prized, Paul Krugman, whose theories often conflict with those of Porter. This study initially sets out the views of both authors, in terms of competitiveness and then attempts to make a comparative analysis between the theories they developed."
R38|Who Wants Affordable Housing in Their Backyard? An Equilibrium Analysis of Low Income Property Development|We estimate the spillovers of properties financed by the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) onto surrounding neighborhood residents. We nonparametrically estimate the impact of LIHTC development on nearby house prices by developing a new difference-in-differences style estimator which exploits smoothness in housing prices across geographic distance and time. We find LIHTC development helps revitalize low income neighborhoods, driving up house prices 6.5%, lowering crime rates, and attracting a more racially and income diverse population. LIHTC development in higher income, low minority areas leads to local house price declines of 2.5% and attracts lower income households. We link these housing price effects to homeowner and renter preferences by developing a generalized hedonic model. Our estimates indicate that an affordable housing development in a low-income area improves welfare by $23,000 per local homeowner and $6500 per local renter, with aggregate welfare benefits to society of $115 million. When viewed as a place-based policy, affordable housing appears to be a desirable way to invest in and revitalize low-income communities.
R38|Stimulating Housing Markets|We estimate the effect of the 2009 and 2010 First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit program on house purchases and prices using variation across local geographies in ex ante exposure to the program. Using this instrument and a difference-in-differences design, we find that the program induced a cumulative increase in home purchases in high exposure places nearly double that of low exposure places. We find little evidence of a sharp reversal in the post period; instead, demand appears to come from several years in the future. While the policy had a limited impact as direct fiscal stimulus, it sped the process of reallocating homes from distressed sellers to fundamental buyers, stabilized house prices, and enabled substantial deleveraging.
R38|Policies to Tame the Housing Cycle in Switzerland|Since 2000, real estate prices in Switzerland have risen rapidly. By some measures, between 2000 and 2014 apartment prices almost doubled, while those of single-family homes increased by around 60%. Price rises have varied considerably across cantons. Transactions activity in the sector has been robust, with growth in mortgage volumes strongly outpacing disposable income. As a consequence, Switzerland’s residential mortgage debt-to-GDP ratio, at 120%, is the highest in the OECD. This is despite a private ownership rate of only around 40%, one of the lowest in the OECD. Banks’ exposure to the mortgage market is the sixth highest in the OECD, with mortgages making up over 80% of domestic (non-interbank) bank loans. That said, high house prices are being supported by very low interest rates, immigration-fuelled population growth and smaller family units, while demand is being bolstered by mortgage interest tax deductibility and institutional investors. Restrictive planning regulations have also damped the supply response. These factors have contributed to low rental yields, although high compared to other assets and very low vacancy rates. A number of measures have been taken by banks and authorities over the past three years to shore up banks’ exposure and to take the heat out of the market. These include a minimum down payment of 10% of the collateral value of the property from the borrower’s own funds, which may not be obtained by pledging or early withdrawal of second-pillar pension assets, and compulsory amortisation of loans. A counter-cyclical buffer (CCB) was activated at the beginning of 2013 and obliges banks to hold additional common equity Tier 1 capital based on their risk-weighted mortgage positions secured by residential real estate in Switzerland. In January 2014, the CCB was increased from 1% to 2%. Despite these measures, house prices remain high and the risk to the banking sector elevated. This Working Paper relates to the 2015 OECD Economic Review of Switzerland (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-switzerland.htm) Politiques Visant à Maîtriser le Cycle du Marché du Logement en Suisse Depuis 2000, les prix de l’immobilier en Suisse ont connu une croissance rapide. Selon certains indices, les prix des appartements ont presque doublé entre 2000 et 2014, ceux des maisons individuelles augmentant d’environ 60 %. Les hausses de prix ont varié sensiblement d’un canton à un autre. Le nombre de transactions dans le secteur s’est maintenu à un niveau élevé, la croissance du volume de prêts hypothécaires excédant largement celle du revenu disponible. Résultat, à 120 %, le ratio dette hypothécaire résidentielle-PIB de la Suisse est le plus élevé de la zone OCDE, et ce, malgré un taux d’accessibilité à la propriété d’environ seulement 40 %, un des plus faibles de la zone. L’exposition du secteur bancaire au marché des prêts hypothécaires est la sixième plus élevée de la zone OCDE, les prêts hypothécaires représentant plus de 80 % de l’ensemble des concours bancaires au plan national, hors marché interbancaire. Cela dit, les prix élevés des logements sont soutenus par des taux d’intérêt très bas, une croissance démographique portée par l’immigration et une baisse de la taille des ménages, alors que la demande est tirée par la déductibilité fiscale des intérêts hypothécaires et par les investisseurs institutionnels. La réglementation restrictive des plans d’aménagement locaux a également modéré les réactions du côté de l’offre. Ces facteurs expliquent la faiblesse des rendements locatifs, qui restent toutefois élevés par rapport à ceux d’autres actifs, ainsi que le niveau très modeste des taux d’inoccupation. Ces trois dernières années, les banques et les autorités ont adopté différentes mesures en vue de consolider les engagements des banques et de soulager les tensions sur le marché. Parmi ces mesures, on peut citer l’instauration, pour les emprunteurs, d’un apport personnel de 10 % minimum de la valeur des biens, qu’il n’est pas possible de se procurer en procédant à un nantissement ou en retirant de manière anticipée des actifs du deuxième pilier du régime de retraite, et l’amortissement obligatoire des prêts. Un matelas de fonds propres contracyclique mis en place au début de 2013 oblige les banques à détenir des fonds propres de base supplémentaires déterminés en fonction de leurs positions hypothécaires pondérées des risques et garanties par des biens résidentiels en Suisse. En janvier 2014, le matelas de fonds propres contracyclique a été porté de 1 % à 2 %. Malgré ces mesures, les prix des logements demeurent élevés, tout comme le risque pesant ainsi sur le secteur bancaire Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de la Suisse 2015 (http://www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-suisse.htm).
R38|Structural reforms to boost inclusive growth in Greece|This paper takes stock of the main structural reforms that Greece has undertaken since 2010, those currently proposed and that are in the process of implementation, and quantifies the medium and long‑term effects on output. Special attention is given to three issues that are relevant to understanding reform dynamics in Greece: i) the short-term impact of reforms; ii) the effect of some reforms on income inequality and other socioeconomic outcomes; iii) implementation problems that might undermine the ability of structural reforms to deliver their expected outcomes. The reforms, if fully implemented, could raise output by more than 13% over the next decade. Reforms in product markets are particularly important in boosting growth. Poverty and inequality have increased despite policies to mitigate the social impacts of Greece’s deep depression since 2009. Better social policies are needed to strengthen the social safety net and make growth more inclusive. Much of the burden of adjustment has been borne by labour. Labour market institutions should balance the objectives of increasing jobs, reallocating workers to where they can earn the most, and ensuring the fruits of the economic recovery are widely shared. Des réformes structurelles pour une croissance inclusive en Grèce Ce document a pour objet de faire le point sur les principales réformes structurelles que la Grèce a engagées depuis 2010, tant celles qui sont actuellement proposées que celles qui sont en cours de mise en oeuvre, et de chiffrer les effets à moyen et à long terme de ces réformes sur la production. Une attention particulière est accordée aux trois aspects qui comptent pour appréhender la dynamique des réformes en Grèce : i) les effets à court terme des réformes ; ii) les effets de certaines réformes sur les inégalités de revenu et sur d’autres résultats socioéconomiques ; iii) les difficultés de mise en oeuvre qui pourraient compromettre l’obtention des résultats attendus des réformes structurelles. Si elles sont pleinement mises en oeuvre, les réformes pourraient permettre d’accroître la production de plus de 13 % au cours des dix prochaines années. Les réformes des marchés de produits sont particulièrement importantes pour la dynamisation de la croissance. La pauvreté et les inégalités se sont aggravées malgré les mesures prises pour atténuer les conséquences sociales de la profonde dépression dans laquelle la Grèce est plongée depuis 2009. Il faut améliorer les politiques sociales pour renforcer le système de protection sociale et rendre la croissance plus inclusive. Le fardeau de l’ajustement a reposé pour une bonne partie sur la main-d’oeuvre. Il conviendrait que les institutions du marché du travail parviennent à concilier les objectifs que sont la création d’emplois, le redéploiement des travailleurs vers les emplois les mieux rémunérés et un large partage des fruits de la reprise économique.
R38|Historic amenities, income and sorting of households|We aim to estimate the impact of historic amenities on house prices and sorting of households. Historic district boundaries enable us to measure the external view effect of historic amenities, defined as the effect of a historic amenity on the price of other buildings through an improved view from the other buildings. We use a semiparametric regression-discontinuity approach to control for unobserved location characteristics and focus on houses constructed after 1970. It is shown that the (external) view effect of historic amenities is 3.5% of the house price. Rich households have a higher willingness to pay for a view on historic amenities and therefore sort themselves in historic districts, which contributes to an explanation for the substantial spatial income differences within cities.
R38|Estimating Neighborhood Choice Models: Lessons from a Housing Assistance Experiment|We use data from a housing-assistance experiment to estimate a model of neighborhood choice. The experimental variation effectively randomizes the rents which households face and helps identify a key structural parameter. Access to two randomly selected treatment groups and a control group allows for out-of-sample validation of the model. We simulate the effects of changing the subsidy-use constraints implemented in the actual experiment. We find that restricting subsidies to even lower poverty neighborhoods would substantially reduce take-up and actually increase average exposure to poverty. Furthermore, adding restrictions based on neighborhood racial composition would not change average exposure to either race or poverty. (JEL I32, I38, R23, R38)
R38|Can Tax Breaks Beat Geography? Lessons from the French Enterprise Zone Experience|This paper shows that urban geography matters to the effectiveness of place-based policies, using the French enterprise zone program as a case study. Whereas this program created more jobs in spatially integrated neighborhoods, its impact on local wages was only visible in the more isolated ones. In addition, a focus on the average impact of the program would lead to the conclusion that it mostly succeeded in displacing preexisting firms, but a lower level of spatial isolation was a clear determinant of the decision to create new firms from scratch. (JEL H25, H32, L52, R32, R38)
R38|Housing Vouchers and the Price of Rental Housing|We estimate the effect of increasing the supply of housing vouchers on rents using a panel of housing units in the American Housing Survey. We do not find that an increase in vouchers affected the overall price of rental housing but do estimate differences in effects based on an individual unit's rent before the voucher expansion. Our results are consistent with voucher recipients renting more expensive units after receiving the subsidy. We also find that the largest price increases were for units near the maximum allowable voucher rent in cities with an inelastic housing supply. (JEL H23, I38, R31, R38)
R38|Regulating housing vacancies away? The paradoxical effects of mismatch|Policy makers agree that vacant houses are undesirable. Moreover the existence of empty houses is used as an argument for allocating less land for new construction. So higher vacancy rates tend to trigger tighter restrictions on the supply of land. Such tighter restrictions lead to higher prices and, because of the incentives this creates for occupying housing, to lower housing vacancies (‘opportunity cost effect’). There is, however, a second effect ignored by planners: more restrictive planning policies impede the matching process in housing markets so leading to higher vacancies (‘mismatch effect’). Which of these two forces dominates is an empirical question. This is our focus here. Addressing potential reverse causation and other endogeneity concerns, we use a unique panel data set on land use regulation for 350 Local Authorities in England from 1981 to 2011. Our results show that tighter local planning constraints increase local housing vacancy rates, suggesting that the mismatch effect dominates. A one standard deviation increase in local regulatory restrictiveness causes the average local vacancy rate to increase by about 0.9 percentage points (23 percent). The results are economically meaningful and show that pointing to the existence of vacant houses as a reason for being more restrictive in allocating land for housing is counterproductive.
R38|Strategic Housing Policy, Migration and Sorting around Population Thresholds|We analyse whether, when and how local office-holders respond to the personal, economic incentives embedded in exogenously imposed population thresholds leading to an increased number and/or remuneration of local office-holders. Using data from all 589 Belgian municipalities over the period 1977-2014, local politicians are found to purposefully influence population growth through policy measures aimed at stimulating net in-migration when approaching important population thresholds. We provide evidence that strategic housing policy decisions – i.e. granting additional building permits early in the election cycle to maximize population growth just before the ‘deadline’ to surpass a population threshold – act as a key mechanism.

R38|Forced Asset Sales and the Concentration of Outstanding Debt: Evidence from the Mortgage Market|We provide evidence that lenders differ in their ex post incentives to internalize price-default externalities associated with the liquidation of collateralized debt. Using the mortgage market as a laboratory, we conjecture that lenders with a large share of outstanding mortgages on their balance sheets internalize the negative spillovers associated with the liquidation of defaulting mortgages and are thus less inclined to foreclose. We find that zip codes with higher concentration of outstanding mortgages experience fewer foreclosures, more renegotiations of delinquent mortgages, and smaller house prices declines. These results are not driven by prior local economic conditions, mortgage securitization or unobservable lender characteristics.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R38|The Governance Of Economic Resilience: 20 Years Of Urban Adaptation Projects In Brussels|This paper is an empirical investigation on how cities use urban renovation projects to adapt to structural economic change. We use methodological triangulation with case study evidence from Brussels to investigate causal links between the governance and the implementation of a large ongoing urban renovation programme that started in 1993. Having classified all investments in our database according to a list of urban adaptation tools, we are able to document how the governance of the programme influenced a) the allocation of funds to different adaptation tools; b) the content of intangible investments; c) the link between tangible and intangible investments. We conclude that urban renovation in Brussels is similar to policies in other cities in that it invested substantial resources both at the top and the bottom of adaptation governance, but that a disconnection between bottom-up and top-down strategies risks foregoing potential complementarities and synergies.
R38|Local taxation and urban development. Testing for the side-effects of the Italian property tax|Land is an essential yet limited natural resource. Its current unsustainable use asks for a better understanding of the main determinants of urban expansion. A heuristic approach is used to analyze urban development in Italy. In particular, the paper estimates an econometric model to test the impact of the Italian property tax (ICI) on the local authorities' behavior and, in particular, on urban planning and development. It tests whether its introduction has fostered rather than dampened construction activity. The hypothesis put forward is that, because of the concurrent market conditions, the introduction of the tax has facilitated urban development. The structure of the tax and the devolution process that began in the '90s induced local municipalities to adopt less tight (accommodative) urban policies to offset budgetary needs. A more elastic urban policy reduces price volatility. However, its overall welfare effect is not clearly determined. Indeed, ceteris paribus, geographical areas with more elastic housing supply witness larger land consumption. The land use changes we witnessed in the last decades could be the combined effect of financial and fiscal aspects. If this is so, careful attention should be given to the issue of whether leaving urban planning and the power to levy property taxes under the same jurisdiction.
R38|Factors underlying short sales|The short sale process has emerged as the most common alternative to the traditional foreclosure process in the recent mortgage crisis. This paper examines the factors that affect the liquidation outcome between these two ways of disposing the housing asset. We find that better quality borrowers such as those with higher credit scores and with full documentation status are more likely to prefer and obtain approval of short sales, involvement of mortgage insurance firms and second lien holders reduces short sales, and that state foreclosure laws such as longer foreclosure delay and the statutory right of redemption reduce short sales. The results have implications for ostensibly borrower-friendly measures promoted by governmental entities.
R38|The credit-risk implications of home ownership promotion: The effects of public subsidies and adjustable-rate loans|This study analyzes the credit risk of housing loans with a particular focus on mechanisms that may help disentangling the financial constraints of low-income borrowers: public support and access to adjustable-rate loans. Using a large database of French housing loans covering the years 2000–2010, we show the following: supplying loans with financial assistance helps financially constrained borrowers to absorb income shocks, adjustable-rate loans are riskier on average, and the combination of public support and adjustable rates can lead to a concentration of risk in the lender’s portfolio. The risk measurement methodology used in this paper extends the one-factor economic capital model underlying the Basel 2 regulatory credit-risk formulas. This portfolio approach leads to the credit risk of housing loans being handled as a portfolio management issue for the lender. From this perspective, our results also illustrate that the ability to promote access to homeownership to low-income borrowers may be determined by the lender’s capacity to identify diversification benefits at the portfolio level. Thus, risky borrowers may have a limited credit-risk level from the lender’s perspective, which facilitates the supply of housing finance.
