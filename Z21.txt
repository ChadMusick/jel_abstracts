Z21|Running the Risk of an Injury in the NFL: Short-Run and Career Consequences|Similar to other workers in industrial settings NFL running backs can choose to provide additional work effort with possible negative health consequences. We find that the most informative measure for running backs is yards gained after contact, which not only increases total rushing yards but also increases injuries that can cause subsequent lost income due to future games missed. We econometrically examine the decisions running backs reveal in trading off injury risk against total yards gained and salary in the short run and how the tradeoff appears in the longer run where career length considerations come into play. Our estimates reveal subtle nonlinearities and interpersonal heterogeneity in risky effort and the associated short and long run injury risk and economic payoffs.
Z21|Measuring competitive balance in Formula One Racing|The Formula One Championship (F1) is one of the biggest sports businesses in the world. But, however, it seems to astonish that only very few scholarly articles analyze the F1 business. The aim of this study is to contribute to closing two gaps in the existing literature: it contributes (1) to the (sports) economic analysis of the F1 business and (2) to the literature on competitive balance in non-team sports. Like competitive balance in team sport leagues, also for F1 racing three dimensions can be distinguished: (a) race-specific competitive balance, (b) within-season competitive balance, and (c) between-season competitive balance. In addition to classical tools and data, some new and F1 specific indicators, like average lead changes or leading distance, are employed. Also, pitfalls induced especially by the used data source or calculation method are highlighted.
Z21|How does online streaming affect antitrust remedies to centralized marketing? The case of European football broadcasting rights|The collective sale of football broadcasting rights constitutes a cartel, which, in the European Union, is only allowed if it complies with a number of conditions and obligations, inter alia, partial unbundling and the no-single-buyer rule. These regulations were defined with traditional TV-markets in mind. However, the landscape of audiovisual broadcasting is quickly changing with online streaming services gaining popularity and relevance. This also alters the effects of the conditions and obligations for the centralized marketing arrangements. Partial unbundling may lead to increasing instead of decreasing prices for consumers. Moreover, the combination of partial unbundling and the no-single-buyer rule forces consumers into multiple subscriptions to several streaming services, which increases transaction costs. Consequently, competition authorities need to rethink the conditions and obligations they impose on centralized marketing arrangements in football. We recommend restricting the exclusivity of (live-)broadcasting rights and mandate third-party access to program guide information to redesign the remedies.
Z21|Determinantes de la demanda por entradas a partidos de fútbol de primera división. El caso uruguayo para la década 2006 - 2016|The present paper proposes the identification of factors that have effects on the demand for uruguayan first division football tickets for matches played between august 2006 and December 2016. It uses a panel data for all the matches played on the period, based on García y Rodríguez (2002). Four models have been estimated: a linear model estimated by OLS, Between Effects, Fixed Effects and Random Effects, concluding through a Hausman test that the Fixed Effects regression is the most suitable for predicting the amount of tickets sold due to the consistency of it estimators. Between the socioeconomic variables it is observed that the unemployment rate and the average income have both a negative effect on the tickets sold, being the uruguayan football an inferior good for the period. The only sportive variable with significative effect is the amount of victories obtained by the local team in the last three matches. Other factors like the weather and the previous team’s positions are also significative.
Z21|The distribution of soccer leagues scores that generates the minimum of competitive balance: Truncated-Cascade Distribution|Competitive balance can be measured using standardized indexes, such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI). The standardized HHI calculus is based on knowing the maximum value of HHI. This value corresponds to the minimum value of the competitive balance. Measuring competitive balance is affected by the scoring system used. There are competitions that have scoring systems that do not award twice as many points for winning as they award for ties. In this case, the scores distribution representative of the minimum competitive balance is unstable because the total points at the end of the championship can vary. This issue has been addressed by reconstructing the results obtained in leagues. Nevertheless, this solution generates cardinal and ordinal negative effects, that we verify for the major European soccer leagues over twenty seasons. The aim of this article is to redefine the perfectly unbalanced distribution in order to construct a new one that generates the maximum level of concentration: we call this truncated-cascade distribution. Thus, we show that the instability problem does not involve recalculating the scoring based on the results. The minimum value of competitive balance is generated by a truncated-cascade distribution of results at a level that can be previously calculated. Thus, we calculate the cut-off point of the truncated-cascade distribution using a 5-grade polynomial equation obtained by recurrent calculation. Besides, we provide the cut-off points and maximum HHI values for leagues with different number of teams.
Z21|On-field Performance Assessment in Football: Applying the Connected Network Data Envelopment Analysis Model|In this paper, we apply for the first time the connected network Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model to assess the on-field performance of football clubs during a league season. Specifically, we separately measure football clubs’ technical efficiency in offense, defense, and points’ earning by using their: (i) attacking and defending moves as the inputs of offense and defense, respectively; (ii) goals scored and goals conceded as the intermediate measures that simultaneously serve as both: (a) the single outputs of offense and defense, respectively; and (b) the inputs of the points’ earning process; (iii) points earned as the single output of the points’ earning process. To illustrate the usefulness of our theoretical framework, we make use of aggregate match statistics from the 2013-2014 Greek premier football league.
Z21|Perception Versus Reality - Competitive Balance In Major League Soccer From 1996 – 2016|For different sports leagues, studies show the positive effect of competitive balance on fan interest and consequently revenues. Particularly for Northern American leagues, competitive balance is a core concept in the construction of such, also to ensure financial stability of teams. Nevertheless, most studies in the literature concentrate on measuring competitive balance in European football leagues. To enhance the existing literature, our paper analyzes competitive balance in Major League Soccer (MLS), a comparatively young and therefore still developing league. To encompass ex-post results, as well as the ex-ante perception of fans if a league or match is uncertain in its outcome, we distinguish between ´actual´ and ´perceived´ competitive balance. Based on compiled data for MLS from 1996 until 2016 we measure the ´actual´ level of competitive balance in MLS with several commonly used competitive balance measures. Considering the corresponding decimal odds predictions and team wage bill information from 2006 until 2016, the ´perceived´ competitive balance is measured using a seemingly unrelated regression and further explanatory statistics. While the results of the ´actual´ competitive balance measurements indicate a league that becomes more balanced over time, the perception points towards an imbalanced league with clear favorites and reduced uncertainty of outcome.
Z21|Performance, Diversity and National Identity Evidence from Association football|The increasing national diversity of co-workers has no consensus on its impact on performance. Using a team’s predominant nationality as proxy for national diversity and national identity, there is robust evidence that it affects performance. Detailed worker-level data from a highly globalized industry, association football, shows a non-linear relationship between performance and the predominant nationality of a team’s roster. As the number of members from the predominant nationality increase, performance declines. However, beyond a threshold level, performance rises. It implies that performance benefits from national diversity when the predominant nationality is small and from national identity when it is large.
Z21|An Overview of Sports Betting Regulation in the United States|The United States employs an ad hoc, unconventional method of regulating sports betting, banning it almost everywhere while granting a monopoly to firms in a single state, Nevada. This approach encourages illegal sports betting markets, ignores negative externalities, and generates welfare losses among the large population of responsible recreational gamblers. I review the current state of sports betting regulation in the U.S. and assess its economic viability in advance of the Supreme Court of the United States decision on the landmark Christie v. National Collegiate Athletic Association case.
Z21|Football Point Spreads|Point spreads â€œlevel the playing fieldâ€ for favorites and underdogs in football. Point spreads can do the same for coaches. Those from lesser known schools are often passed over in polls for best coaches as criteria typically emphasize the national titles, bowl victories, and top rankings that accrue exclusively to big-time programs. Success against the spread creates its own poll in this study and recognizes coaches who might otherwise be overlooked for coaching honors.
Z21|Loss aversion, upset preference, and sports television viewing audience size|A growing body of research examines the effect of loss aversion (LA) on consumers' decisions to watch or attend sporting events. Much of this research focuses on live game attendance. In contrast to the predictions of uncertainty of outcome hypothesis (UOH), loss-averse consumers prefer watching either potential upsets, or dominant performances by strong favorites, to events with uncertain outcomes. We test for LA vs. UOH effects in television viewing audience data for free over-the-air broadcasts of 304 Spanish football matches from 2008/09 to 2015/16. This setting generates substantial variation home team win probabilities because of the presence of two dominant teams (Real Madrid CF and FC Barcelona). The results support the importance of LA/upset preferences: audience size for matches when home teams are large underdogs and when heavily favored are larger than for matches with uncertain outcomes, even when controlling for observable and unobservable factors affecting the number of viewers.
Z21|Artificial Pitches and Unfair Home Advantage in Professional Football|In the Netherlands, in the top tier of professional football some teams play their home matches on an artificial pitch while other teams play their home matches on natural grass. This paper investigates whether or not home teams who play on an artificial pitch have an additional home advantage to the regular home advantage. The main finding is, that this is indeed the case. This implies that artificial pitches generate an unfair home advantage in a competitive sport.
Z21|A strategy to predict association football players’ passing skills|Transfers are big business in association football. This paper develops a generalized additive mixed model that aids managers in predicting how a football player is expected to perform in a new team. It does so by using event-level data from the Spanish and the Colombian football leagues. Using passes as a performance proxy, the model exploits the richness of the data to account for the difficulty of each pass attempt performed by each player over an entire season. The model estimates are then used to determine how a player transferred from the Colombian league should perform in the Spanish league, taking into account that teammates and rivals’ abilities are different in the latter.
Z21|Zahlungsbereitschaften für deutsche Erfolge bei den Olympischen Winterspielen 2014 in Sotschi und die Austragung Olympischer Spiele in Deutschland|In diesem Beitrag werden erstens positive Zahlungsbereitschaften für sportliche Erfolge der deutschen Mannschaft bei den Olympischen Winterspielen 2014 in Sotschi untersucht und zweitens die positive oder auch negative Zahlungsbereitschaft für die Austragung Olympischer Spiele in Deutschland. Wichtige positive Faktoren der Zahlungsbereitschaft für einen vorderen deutschen Platz im Medaillenspiegel sind Interesse am Wintersport, das Verfolgen der Winterspiele, die Einschätzung einer hohen nationalen Bedeutung eines guten Abschneidens und ein eher niedriges Einkommen (1.000 bis 2.000 € statt über 4.000 €). Signifikant negativ in den Schätzungen sind interessanterweise eigenes Sporttreiben, eine höhere Identifikation mit der deutschen Mannschaft und ein mittleres Alter. Hochgerechnet auf Deutschland ergibt sich eine aggregierte Zahlungsbereitschaft von 2,7, 1,6 bzw. 1,0 Mrd. € für einen ersten, zweiten oder dritten deutschen Platz im Medaillenspiegel, während für eine einzige Goldmedaille in der jeweiligen Lieblingssportart die aggregiert Zahlungsbereitschaft bei 5,2 Mrd. € läge. Für eine Austragung Olympischer Spiele in Deutschlang gibt es aggregiert eine positive Zahlungsbereitschaft von 6,7 Mrd. €, der jedoch Kompensationsforderungen in Höhe von 3,1 Mrd. € gegenüberstehen, was zu einem positiven Saldo von 3,6 Mrd. € führt.
Z21|The 'Typical' Club? A Configuration Analysis of Scottish Football Clubs|The focus of this paper is the complex relationships amongst ownership, financing, accountability and governance structures on the performance, resilience and perceived value of Scottish professional football clubs. However, there are numerous clubs which would regard themselves as successful without recently, or indeed ever, winning a trophy. For many, avoiding relegation or surviving until the end of the season could constitute success. Many contemporary professional football clubs are now complex businesses, intrinsically concerned with financial matters. Yet it is not uncommon for financially secure clubs to be criticised while the owners of clubs with extreme levels of indebtedness are praised for their commitment. We conceptualise football clubs as boundary objects; organizations that co-exist in different social worlds, serving different functions for those in these social worlds. Football clubs can be seen as spaces where different values/ideas can be translated and exchanged, and therefore the value of a football club is something that a club co-determines through engagement with its key stakeholders. The resilience of a football club is likely to be affected by a combination of different notions of value and the diversity of roles demanded by its network of stakeholders. This suggests that it is the alignment between a clubâ€™s ownership structure, governance mechanisms, accountability and methods of financing and the demands from the social worlds in which it inhabits that will be critical for the success, however defined, of a club.
Z21|Going for the Gold: The Economics of the Olympics|"In this paper, we explore the costs and benefits of hosting the Olympic Games. On the cost side, there are three major categories: general infrastructure such as transportation and housing to accommodate athletes and fans; specific sports infrastructure required for competition venues; and operational costs, including general administration as well as the opening and closing ceremony and security. Three major categories of benefits also exist: the short-run benefits of tourist spending during the Games; the long-run benefits or the ""Olympic legacy"" which might include improvements in infrastructure and increased trade, foreign investment, or tourism after the Games; and intangible benefits such as the ""feel-good effect"" or civic pride. Each of these costs and benefits will be addressed in turn, but the overwhelming conclusion is that in most cases the Olympics are a money-losing proposition for host cities; they result in positive net benefits only under very specific and unusual circumstances. Furthermore, the cost–benefit proposition is worse for cities in developing countries than for those in the industrialized world. In closing, we discuss why what looks like an increasingly poor investment decision on the part of cities still receives significant bidding interest and whether changes in the bidding process of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will improve outcomes for potential hosts."
Z21|Hedonic Price Analysis of Risk Preferences in Yearling Thoroughbred Buyers| A hedonic pricing model is used to investigate yearling thoroughbred buyer’s risk preferences to illustrate how they correlate with the economic climate. Using data from Keeneland September Yearling Sale from 2006-2009, we analyze the marginal effect of sires with unknown quality on sale prices of one-year-old thoroughbreds to discuss the possible correlation between buyers’ willingness of paying for freshman sires’ offspring and the economic recession. This gives us a better standing of thoroughbred action industry as well as how it is important for evaluating the health and confidence of the entire industry. A study by C. J. Stowe (2013) identifies the importance of buyer’s risk preference. It was also shown that yearling prices are influenced by individual characteristics as well as macro-economic variables (Buzby J.C. 1994). However, the link between buyers’ willingness of paying for freshman sires’ offspring and the economic recession has not yet been discussed. We anticipate that buyers are willing to pay a premium for progeny by stallions of unknown quality when the market is stable and strong. Negative correlations between hammer price and year 2008 and year 2009 are expected.

Z21|"«…At the end they always win»: Econometric approaches to the prediction of the results of performance of national football teams at major international tournaments<BR>[""А Побеждают Всегда..."": Эконометрические Подходы К Предсказанию Результатов Выступления Национальных Сборных По Футболу На Крупных Международных Турнирах]"|Several more factors have a significant impact on international performance of the football team apart from economic and political factors, national, cultural, demographic and climate characteristics that are usually considered as important. Chances to win once again increase when a national football team is already won the World Cup. Also chances to win the World Cup or a continental tournament rise immediately after a big success. A comprehensive table is analyzed to show how major tournament football serial success depends on status of dynasty team. National football federation’s efforts to naturalize football players and establishing of complex programs for searching and upbringing of talented youth are also crucial. This paper concludes with some predictions concerning performance of Russia’s national football team on 2016 European Cup in France.

Оценка Справедливой Стоимости Спонсорских Соглашений]|The article reviews the main attributes of sponsorship agreements in sports, focusing on professional football. The authors assess the specifics of sponsorship package formation and analyze the sponsorship portfolios of football clubs. During the course of the research, 3 major sponsorship packages were determined. These packages include general sponsorship, technical sponsorship and naming rights sponsorship. The authors also identifued the key determinants of football sponsorship pricing and approaches for estimating their fair value. Based on the conducted analysis the authors form conclusions on the future development of football sponsorship and its application in Russia.
Z21|Do all sporting prizes have a significant positive impact on attendance in a European national football league? Competitive intensity in the French Ligue 1<BR>[Действительно Ли Все Спортивные Призы Оказывают Значимое Положительное Воздействие На Посещаемость Игр?]|This article investigates the determinants of attendance at French football Ligue 1 matches over the 2008–2011 period, with a focus on the effect of competitive intensity. This is measured by dummies that are functions of the point difference for the home team in relation to the different sporting prizes: title, qualification in UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) club competitions, relegation. The objective is to answer the following question: do all sporting prizes have a significant positive impact on attendance? We specified and estimated a standard attendance equation including 35 explanatory variables of which 9 are related to sporting prizes. The estimations are based on a Tobit model with individual cut-off points to allow for truncation of attendance at the upper bound given by stadia capacity (i.e. sold-out games). 1135 observations are included. Our results show that all sporting prizes have a significant positive impact on attendance. In particular, there is a significant impaact of prizes for potential qualification in the UEFA Europa League which are dependent on the outcome of domestic cups (known only in the last part of season). This research contributes to the optimization of competition format and knowledge on competitive intensity and determinants of attendance. It provides an argument in favor of current sporting prizes for managers in the main European national football leagues.
Z21|I Take Care of My Own: A Field Study on How Leadership Handles Conflict between Individual and Collective Incentives|In most collective actions, individuals' incentives are not perfectly aligned with the goals of the group/team they are part of. We investigate how individual specific incentives affect both individuals and team leaders' strategies in a natural setting. We use a discontinuity in individual rewards in batsmen scoring in cricket to identify the causal effect of such incentives on behavior. We find that batsmen react to the presence of individual-specific incentives by adopting strategies that may be suboptimal at the team level. More surprisingly, we also find that team captains react to these individual incentives by adopting suboptimal strategies at the team level, which may bring large benefits to the individual players. These results suggest a complex interplay of individual and team incentives which we conjecture may arise in repeated team interactions.
Z21|Tennessee Williams' Camino Real- Ein Traumspiel zwischen Materialismus und Idealismus|Im Gegensatz zur Majorität seiner sonstigen Dramen zählt Camino Real zu jenen Stücken von Tennessee Williams, die bislang nur vergleichsweise stief­ mütterlich von der Literaturwissenschaft behandelt wurden. Dies mag zum einen mit der unbe­ streitbaren Brillanz seiner anderen Hauptwerke in Zusammenhang stehen, zum anderen aber auch mit der unkonventionellen und verwirrenden Struktur von Camino Real, welche in den zahlreichen (Negativ)Rezensionen und Analysen in den Mittel­ punkt gerückt wurde. Auch wenn dieses als eher schwächeres und unbedeutenderes Werk des Dramatikers aus Mississippi angesehen wird, so war es natürlich dennoch im Laufe der vergangenen 70 Jahre Gegenstand amerikanistischer Untersu­ chungen. So vielfältig und divergent die unter­ schiedlichen Ansätze jener auch gewesen sein mögen, der inhärente ökonomische Aspekt des Stückes war in all diesen zumeist von keiner oder nur von geringer Relevanz. Dies ist umso erstaun­ licher, da Camino Real seinem Leser/Zuschauer eine klare Stellungnahme bezüglich der dichotomischen Frage Materialismus/Idealismus abverlangt. Jene wissenschaftliche Lücke soll mit dem folgenden Beitrag ausgefüllt werden.

Z21|Network Dynamics in Emerging Regions of Europe|This important book focuses on post-Lisbon Agenda issues of alignment and misalignment on different dimensions of European society and the European economy, including industrial systems, R&D systems, educational systems and job markets. It also looks in particular at the peripheral regions of Europe — the less developed parts of ‘old’ Europe, the parts of old Europe that are outside or only half-inside the EU, the new member-states of the EU, and Turkey as the most important EU candidate country. It takes as its methodological starting point the theory of network alignment as developed in SPRU, notably by Nick von Tunzelmann, and builds on this to produce an incisive assessment of the institutions, individual actors and markets that drive the knowledge economy. In all of this, it sets the European picture firmly in the context of global developments in investment, labour and intellectual property flows. Key authors include the editor himself, von Tunzelmann, Andrea Salavetz of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Matija Rojec of the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia.
Z21|Assessing the Impact of the FIFA World Cup Germany 2006TM – Some Methodological and Empirical Reflections|Big tourist events have undoubtedly a considerable economic dimension. The spectators of these events buy entrance tickets, use the traffic system and take advantage of the services of the restaurant and hotel business. The organizers invest in the extension of tourism facilities and traffic networks and provide the means of production for the smooth running of the event. Especially big sports events are important advertising media. Furthermore, the rights of television broadcast and the contributions of sponsors are an important source of finance. For the respective region, carrying out such an event often means a strain e. g. regarding the volume of traffic. At the same time the event may lead to a lasting improvement of the regional infrastructure. Last but not least the regions' image will be improved by carrying out the event only due to the media coverage. Assessing the impact of tourist events is rather difficult because such events have always significant regional economic effects but not necessarily appreciable overall economic effects (comp. Ahlert, 2001, p. 116). Only in the case of international tourist events their spending determine definitely positive the outcome on regional as well as on national economic level, but especially in the case of such major international tourist events the positive macroeconomic effects are associated with substantial external effects. The paper gives an overview of various economic studies – cost-benefit analysis (Rahmann et al., 1998; Kurscheidt, Rahmann, 1999), impact analysis (Ahlert, 2000; Meyer, Ahlert, 2002; Ahlert, 2005) and regional studies (Meyer, Ahlert, 2000; Wegweiser GmbH, 2004) which have been prepared in Germany in the past to identify the potential tangible and intangible effects of the FIFATM World Cup 2006. It explains the strength and weakness of the different approaches and how these different types of analysis can perfectly fit together for identifying the potential regional, sectoral and national socioeconomic effects. Besides that, the paper shows what kind of mistakes respective misinterpretation of such studies and their results can be frequently observed.
