F11|Estimating the Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Total Exports|This paper shows that real effective exchange rate (REER) regressions, the standard approach for estimating the response of aggregate exports to exchange rate changes, imply biased estimates of the underlying elasticities. We provide a new aggregate regression specification that is consistent with bilateral trade flows micro-founded by the gravity equation. This theory-consistent aggregation leads to unbiased estimates when prices are set in an international currency as postulated by the dominant currency paradigm. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to compare elasticity estimates based on this new “ideal-REER” regression against typical regression specifications found in the REER literature. The results show that the biases are small (around 1 percent) for the exchange rate and large (around 10 percent) for the demand elasticity. We find empirical support for this prediction from annual trade flow data. The difference between elasticities estimated on the bilateral and aggregate levels reduces significantly when applying an ideal-REER regression rather than a standard REER approach.
F11|The Impact of a Trade War: Assessment of the Current Tariffs and Alternative Scenarios|This note uses Charbonneau and Landry’s (2018) framework to assess the direct impact of the current trade tensions on the Canadian and global economies, as well as possible implications if the conflict escalates further. Overall, my findings show that the estimated impact of current tariffs on real gross domestic product (GDP) remains relatively small, which is in line with the literature on gains from trade, but the impact on trade is much larger. With a modest escalation of trade tensions, monetary policy in Canada could face a situation of rising prices and falling real GDP. This dilemma would be worse if Canada takes an active role in the trade conflict. If trade tensions rise more dramatically, the effect on Canada would depend on Canada’s access to the US market. A significant and more broad-based rise in tariffs could lead to large global impacts.
F11|Global Value Chains in Mexico: A Historical Perspective|This paper performs a historical analysis of Mexico's insertion into Global Value Chains (GVCs) and links it to the notion of competition underlying traditional theoretical models of international trade. In contrast with existing studies, it uses both new analytical tools pertaining to the GVC literature and tools based on the traditional notion of comparative advantage. This combination allows identifying three periods: (i) since NAFTA's signature until 2001, Mexico deepened its insertion into GVCs and reallocated resources to the production of more skilled-intensive goods; (ii) this higher GVC participation vanished when China entered the WTO; and (iii) since the second half of the 2000s, Mexico recovered the ground lost due to higher integration in the automotive sector and a reallocation of resources to the production of more unskilled-intensive goods, likely generated by an efficient response to competition with China. Hence, Mexico used two different models of GVC insertion entailing production processes with different characteristics in terms of skill-usage.

F11|The Comparative Advantage of Firms|Multiproduct firms dominate production, and their product turnover contributes substantially to aggregate growth. Theories propose that multiproduct firms grow by diversifying into products which need the same know-how or capabilities, but are less clear on what these capabilities are. Input output tables show firms co-produce in industries that share intermediate inputs, suggesting input capabilities drive multiproduct production patterns. We provide evidence for this in Indian manufacturing: the similarity of a firm’s input mix to an industry’s input mix predicts entry into that industry. We identify the direction of causality from the removal of size-based entry barriers in input markets which made firms more likely to enter industries that were similar in input use to their initial input mix. We rationalize this finding with a model of industry choice and economies of scope to estimate the importance of input capabilities in determining comparative advantage. Complementarities driven by input capabilities make a firm on average 5% (and up to 15%) more likely to produce in an industry. Entry barriers in input markets constrained the comparative advantage of firms and were equivalent to a 10.5 percentage point tariff on inputs.
F11|Technology Gaps, Trade and Income|This paper studies the origins and consequences of international technology gaps. I develop an endogenous growth model where R&D efficiency varies across countries and productivity differences emerge from firm-level technology investments. The theory characterizes how innovation and learning determine technology gaps, trade and global income inequality. Countries with higher R&D efficiency are richer and have comparative advantage in more innovation-dependent industries where the advantage of backwardness is lower and knowledge spillovers are more localized. I estimate R&D efficiency by country and innovation-dependence by industry from R&D and bilateral trade data. Calibrating the model implies technology gaps, due to cross-country differences in R&D efficiency, account for around one-quarter to one-third of nominal wage variation within the OECD.
F11|Globalization and Taxation: Theory and Evidence|We construct a theoretical model to capture the compensation and efficiency effects of globalization in a set up where the redistributive tax rate is chosen by the median voter. The model predicts that the two alternative modes of globalization- trade liberalization and financial openness- could potentially have different effects on taxation. We then provide some empirical evidence on the relationship between taxation and the alternative modes of globalization using a large cross-country panel dataset. We make a distinction between de jure and de facto measures of globalization and find a robust negative relationship between de jure measures financial openness and tax rates. There is no robust relationship between de facto measures of finanical openness and taxation. As well, the relationship between trade liberalization (both de jure and de facto measures) and tax rates is not robust and depends on the measures of taxation as well as the time period of analysis.

F11|Increasing resistance to globalization: The role of trade in tasks|We show in this paper that trade in tasks can explain increasing resistance to globalization in industrialized countries. In a traditional trade model of a small open economy, we demonstrate that schooling provides protection against losses from trade if trade increases the relative price of the skill-intensive good. Furthermore, increasing public schooling expenditure may help securing support for trade reform by a majority of voters. However, this conclusion is no longer true, if education provides task-specific skills and trade in tasks makes some of these skills obsolete in the open economy. In this case, increasing public schooling expenditure may be of limited help to secure support for trade reform by a majority of voters, even if the reform is welfare-improving. Our analysis suggests to change the education system to one that provides broader, less-specialized skills in order to facilitate trade reforms. Although such skills may be less productive, they do not become obsolete in the open economy and therefore increase the likelihood that a proposal for a welfare-improving trade reform is successful in a referendum.
F11|GDP is a measure of output, not welfare. Or, HOS meets the SNA|What effect, if any, do changes in the terms of trade have on the level of output (GDP) or welfare? I examine this issue through two versions of a textbook, Hecksher-Ohlin-Samuelson (HOS), two-good model of a small, open economy. In the first version both goods are for final consumption. In the second, one good is an imported intermediate input into the other. In both versions, economic theory suggests that an improvement in the terms of trade raises welfare (consumption) but leaves aggregate output (GDP) unchanged. This follows from a continuous-time analysis using Divisia index numbers. I then show that a national income accountant applying the principles of the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA) would reach the same conclusions.
F11|Search Frictions in International Good Markets|We develop and estimate a model of search frictions in international good markets and study its implications for individual and aggregate trade flows. We introduce random meeting of buyers in an otherwise standard Eaton and Kortum (2002) (EK) framework. We show that search frictions impede aggregate exports but have a non-trivial impact on individual firms' trade. A reduction in these frictions increases sellers' exposure to foreign buyers but also reduces their chance to be the lowest cost supplier because of more competition among sellers. We build on this model to structurally estimate search frictions faced by French exporters using a generalized method of moments and firm-to-firm French export data. We document the magnitude of these frictions across sectors and destinations and show that their presence help; i) reconcile the EK framework with heterogeneity in firm-level export behaviours; and ii) quantify the relative role of search frictions and productivity heterogeneity in the selection of firms into export.
F11|Trade, Technology and the Great Divergence|"This paper develops a model that captures the key features of the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence between the industrializing \North"" and the lagging \South."" In particular, a convincing story is needed for why North-South divergence occurred so dramatically during the late 19th Century, a good hundred years after the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. To this end we construct a trade/growth model that includes both endogenous biased technologies and intercontinental trade. The Industrial Revolution began as a sequence of unskilled-labor intensive innovations which initially incited fertil- ity increases and limited human capital formation in both the North and the South. The subsequent co-evolution of trade and technological growth however fostered an inevitable di- vergence in living standards - the South increasingly specialized in production that worsened their terms of trade and spurred even greater fertility increases and educational declines. Biased technological changes in both regions only reinforced this pattern. The model high- lights how pronounced divergence ultimately arose from interactions between specialization from trade and technological forces."

F11|Optimal Transport Networks in Spatial Equilibrium|We study optimal transport networks in spatial equilibrium. We develop a framework consisting of a neoclassical trade model with labor mobility in which locations are arranged on a graph. Goods must be shipped through linked locations, and transport costs depend on congestion and on the infrastructure in each link, giving rise to an optimal transport problem in general equilibrium. The optimal transport network is the solution to a social planner’s problem of building infrastructure in each link. We provide conditions such that this problem is globally convex, guaranteeing its numerical tractability. We also study cases with increasing returns to transport technologies in which global convexity fails. We apply the framework to assess optimal investments and inefficiencies in observed road networks in European countries.
F11|The Textbook Case for Industrial Policy: Theory Meets Data|The textbook case for industrial policy is well understood. If some sectors are subject to external economies of scale, whereas others are not, a government should subsidize the first group of sectors at the expense of the second. The empirical relevance of this argument, however, remains unclear. In this paper we develop a strategy to estimate sector-level economies of scale and evaluate the gains from such policy interventions in an open economy. Our benchmark results point towards significant and heterogeneous economies of scale across manufacturing sectors, but only modest gains from industrial policy, below 1% of GDP on average. Though these gains can be larger in some of the alternative environments that we consider, they are always smaller than the gains from optimal trade policy.
F11|Demand Shocks, Sector-level Externalities, and the Evolution of Comparative Advantage|Does production size play any role in industrial productivity? And how important is its contribution to the evolution of comparative advantage over time? In this paper, I develop a multi-country multi-sector general equilibrium model of trade characterized by the presence of inter-temporal sector-level externalities. The model makes explicit the mechanism linking size and productivity and delivers at the equilibrium a dynamic gravity model of trade that can be empirically tested. I structurally estimate the dynamic scale parameter by exploiting exogenous demand shocks uncorrelated to any supply-side component of production. Results show that industrial production scale can be a potential source of comparative advantage, with an estimated average dynamic scale parameter of 0.18. However, potential gains are heterogeneous, with values ranging between 0.12 and 0.20 across different industries.

F11|What Does Financial Crisis Tell Us About Exporter Behavior and Credit Reallocation?|Using Japanese firm data covering the Japanese financial crisis in the early 1990s, we find that exporters' domestic sales declined more significantly than their foreign sales, which in turn declined more significantly than non-exporters' sales. This stylized fact provides a new litmus test for different theories proposed in the literature to explain a trade collapse associated with a financial crisis. In this paper we embed the Melitz's (2003) model into a tractable DSGE framework with incomplete financial markets and endogenous credit allocation to explain both the Japanese firm-level data and the well-documented aggregate trade collapse during a financial crisis in world economic history. The model highlights the role of credit reallocation between non-exporters and exporters as the main mechanism in explaining exporters' behaviors and trade collapse following a financial crisis.
F11|The US trade dispute: blunt offense or rational strategy?|This article evaluates the recent protectionist US trade policy and the retaliation of the EU and China. The article employs a New Quantitative Trade Theory model and an Armington model for comparison. The simulation results show that US car tariffs are a credible threat to the EU, but the steel and aluminum tariffs are not. China suffers considerably from the US tariffs, especially the extended, tightened tariffs that have been announced. The retaliation measures of the EU and China, however, do not cause US welfare losses compared to the situation without such a trade policy.
F11|Macroprudential Policies in the EAGLE FLI Model Calibrated for Hungary|In this paper we develop the Hungarian version of the EAGLE FLI (Euro Area GLobal Economy model with Financial LInkages) model which is the EAGLE model enriched with financial frictions and country-specific banking sector. The EAGLE FLI features the intermediation of loanable funds (ILF) view in banking whereby the creation of new loans requires banks to collect additional deposits. Households and firms borrow in the model using housing as collateral. We find that macroprudential policies such as an increase in capital requirements, decreases in the loan-to-value ratio or loan-to-income ratio of borrower households (and firms) limits banks’ credit creation with negative spillover effects to the real economy due to the financial accelerator mechanism in the model. On the other hand, these policies strengthen banks’ capital and limit the vulnerability of households and firms to negative financial shocks.
F11|Spatial Correlation, Trade, and Inequality: Evidence from the Global Climate|This paper shows that greater global spatial correlation of productivities can increase cross-country welfare dispersion by increasing the correlation between a country's productivity and its gains from trade. We causally validate this prediction using a global climatic phenomenon as a natural experiment. We find that gains from trade in cereals over the last half-century were larger for more productive countries and smaller for less productive countries when cereal productivity was more spatially correlated. Incorporating this role for spatial interdependence into a projection of climate-change impacts raises projected international inequality, with higher welfare losses across most of Africa.
F11|Quality, Variable Markups, and Welfare: A Quantitative General Equilibrium Analysis of Export Prices|"Modern trade models attribute the dispersion of prices across countries to physical and man-made barriers to trade, to the pricing-to-market by heterogeneous producers, and to differences in the quality of output offered by firms. This paper analyzes a quantitative general equilibrium model that incorporates all three of these mechanisms. Estimating the model parameters from Chinese firm-level trade data, we find that our model that incorporates per unit trade costs imply lower gains from trade relative to standard models because these costs are a greater burden to the most productive firms. We also show that changes in specific trade costs induce larger shifts in import prices than do changes in ad valorem trade costs that equivalently restrict trade. The results highlight the importance of modelling ""Washington Apples"" effects in quantitative trade models."
F11|Networks, Barriers, and Trade|We study a non-parametric class of neoclassical trade models with global production networks. We characterize their properties in terms of sufficient statistics useful for growth and welfare accounting as well as for counterfactuals. We establish a formal duality between open and closed economies and use it to analytically quantify the gains from trade. Accounting for nonlinear (non-Cobb-Douglas) production networks with realistic complementarities in production significantly raises the gains from trade relative to estimates in the literature. We use our general comparative statics results to show how models that abstract away from intermediates, no matter how well calibrated, are incapable of simultaneously predicting the costs of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. Given trade volumes and elasticities, accounting for intermediates doubles the losses from tariffs. Better quantitative accuracy demands the use of more complicated, oftentimes computational, models. This paper seeks to help bridge the gap between computation and theory.
F11|The Margins of Trade|We introduce quality differentiation and an extensive margin of products into a standard quantitative, general equilibrium model of international trade. Both the quality and the quantity of a product play a role in its contribution both to consumption and to production. The framework allows bilateral trade to vary at the extensive and intensive margins and the intensive margin of trade to vary at the quantity and unit-value margins. We estimate the parameters of the model using bilateral data on trade flows and on unit values in trade. The model captures (i) the well-documented increasing relation between unit values and both importer and exporter per capita income and (ii) how the extensive margin rises with importer and exporter size. But, unlike other contributions to the literature confronting these margins in international trade, our framework delivers a standard gravity formulation for trade flows and standard measures of the gains from trade apply.

F11|The Relationship between Economic Growth, Exports and Imports in Morocco: An Empirical Validation Based on VAR Modeling Techniques and Causality in the Meaning of Granger|This paper analyzes the relationship between economic growth, export and import in Morocco. VAR modeling techniques and Granger causality are used in empirical work. The study showed a causal effect ranging from economic growth in exports. Evidence shows that economic growth favors exports. However, there is no effect that goes for export to growth. In addition, there is no relationship between imports and economic growth.
F11|Does Agricultural Trade promote Chinese economic growth? ARDL Approach|Since the beginning of the third millennium, the Chinese agricultural exports increase at a strong pace. In this context, this paper aims to answer the question if the agriculture trade promotes Chinese economic growth by employing the ARDL bounds testing for the study period from 1984 to 2017. In the long-run, our highlights reported that domestic investment and agricultural exports have a positive effect on economic growth. However, agricultural imports have a significant negative impact on growth. In the short-run, our insights reported a positive and significant effect of domestic investment, agricultural imports and agricultural exports on economic growth. The positive impact of agriculture exports on growth is due to the importance of agriculture in terms of creating jobs and opportunities for the economy as a whole. Also, sufficient national investment in the agriculture sector leads to enlarging these opportunities and then improves the Chinese economic growth.
F11|The Impact of Domestic and Foreign Direct Investment on Economic Growth: Fresh Evidence from Tunisia|This paper aims to analyze the impact of domestic investment and Foreign Direct Investment on economic growth in Tunisia during the period 1976–2017. This study is based on the Auto-Regressive Distributive Lags (ARDL) approach that is proposed by Pesaran et al (2001). Bound testing approaches to the analysis of level relationships. According to the results of the analysis, domestic investment and foreign direct investment have a negative effect on economic growth in the long run. However, in the short run, only domestic investment causes economic growth. The findings are important for Tunisian economic policy makers to undertake the effective policies that can promote and lead domestic and foreign investments to boost economic growth.
F11|Domestic Investment, Export, Import and Economic Growth in Brazil: An Application of Vector Error Correction Model|This paper aims to investigate the nexus between domestic investment, exports, imports, and economic growth for the Brazilian economy during the period 1970-2017, using the VECM methodology. In the short-run, our empirical results pointed out that import, exports, and domestic investment cause economic growth. Also, economic growth causes exports. Exports, imports, and economic growth cause domestic investment. However, in the long-run, our results revealed that domestic investment and exports have a positive effect on economic growth. Also, imports have a negative effect on economic growth. The results recorded a positive impact of economic growth and imports on domestic investment. Exports have a negative effect on domestic investment. Finally, we record the absence of significant impact of economic growth, exports and domestic investment on imports, and economic growth, domestic investment, and imports on exports. Due to the importance of these aspects to the economic performance of Brazil, the policymakers are invited to orient these issues towards the sustainability facets to guarantee a sustained growth path.
F11|Demographics and the Evolution of Global Imbalances|The age distribution evolves asymmetrically across countries, influencing relative saving rates and labor supply. Emerging economies experienced faster increases in working age shares than advanced economies did. Using a dynamic, multicountry model I quantify the effect of demographic changes on trade imbalances across 28 countries since 1970. Counterfactually holding demographics constant reduces net exports in emerging economies and boosts them in advanced economies. On average, a one percentage point increase in a country’s working age share, relative to the world, increases its ratio of net exports to GDP by one-third of a percentage point. These findings alleviate the allocation puzzle.
F11|The Comparative Advantage of Firms|Multiproduct firms dominate production, and their product turnover contributes substantially to aggregate growth. Theories propose that multiproduct firms grow by diversifying into products which need the same know-how or capabilities, but are less clear on what these capabilities are. Input-output tables show firms co-produce in industries that share intermediate inputs, suggesting input capabilities drive multiproduct production patterns. We provide evidence for this in Indian manufacturing: the similarity of a firm's input mix to an industry's input mix predicts entry into that industry. We identify the direction of causality from the removal of size-based entry barriers in input markets which made firms more likely to enter industries that were similar in input use to their initial input mix. We rationalize this finding with a model of industry choice and economies of scope to estimate the importance of input capabilities in determining comparative advantage. Complementarities driven by input capabilities make a firm on average 5% (and up to 15%) more likely to produce in an industry. Entry barriers in input markets constrained the comparative advantage of firms and were equivalent to a 10.5 percentage point tariff on inputs.
F11|Competing Gains From Trade|Differences in growth rates across countries imply a strong relation between factor-proportions-based trade and key aggregate economic outcomes. We construct two macro-trade datasets and illustrate that this relation is rather weak empirically. Employing a dynamic two-country model, we propose a simple explanation for this finding. By limiting the substitutability between domestic and foreign tradable varieties, the presence of intra-industry trade implies that pronounced trade specialization patterns culminate in a loss of varieties. Accordingly, intra-industry trade acts to suppress inter-industry trade dynamics, thus realigning the behavior of standard models with the empirical evidence.
F11|Trade in tasks: Revisiting the wage and employment effects of offshoring|"We revisit Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg's (2008) famous result, that under certain conditions offshoring of low-skilled labor tasks raises the domestic wage for low-skilled workers. Our re-examination features a less benign environment where Rybczynski-type reallocation of factors to absorb offshoring-induced job displacement is ruled out. We allow for simultaneous offshoring of both skilled and unskilled labor, and we derive new results on the role of factor-bias in offshoring, identifying conditions under which offshoring has a ""lifiting-all-boats"" effect benefitting all workers. Extending our analysis to a frictional labor market with equilibrium unemployment due to costly matching, we demonstrate that under these same conditions offshoring is also associated with rising employment."
F11|Reformatory Policies and Factor Prices in a Developing Economy with Informal Sector|Effects of different reformatory policies have always been a pulsating concern for the researchers and policy makers. Considering this concern, this paper attempts to check various effects of reformatory policies such as labor market reform, tariff cut, change in subsidy, bureaucratic reform in a typical small open economy comprising of both formal and informal sectors. It has been found that the implications of labor market reform and tariff liberalization for factor prices and wage disparity are distinctly opposite. However, skilled labor of the economy benefits from both labor market reform and export subsidy. Next we extend the basic model to bring in related corruption in the informal sector for its illegal nature. This calls for the existence of a sector which helps hassle free informal production. There we find that unskilled workers lose owing to both bureaucratic reform and labor market reform. Nevertheless, though traditionally labor market reform is supposed to harm workers, wage disparity gets ameliorated whereas tariff reform leads to worsening of it.
F11|Structural Transformation to Manufacturing and Services: What Role for Trade?|Understanding how and why economies structurally transform as they grow is crucial for sound national policy making. Typically analysts of this issue focus on sectoral shares of GDP and employment. This paper extends that to include exports, including of services. It also considers mining in addition to agriculture and manufacturing, and recognizes some of the products of those four sectors are nontradable. The theory section's general equilibrium model provides hypotheses about structural change in different types of economies as they grow, and tests them econometrically with annual data for a sample of 117 countries for the period 1991-2014. The results point to the futility of adopting protective policies aimed at slowing de-agriculturalization and subsequent de-industrialization in terms of sectoral shares, since those trends inevitably will accompany economic growth. Fortuitously governments now have far more efficient and equitable ways of supporting the adjustments needed by people choosing or being pushed to leave declining industries.
F11|The Impact of Agricultural Trade on Economic Growth in North Africa: Econometric Analysis by Static Gravity Model|The contribution of this paper is investigating the influence of agricultural exports and agricultural imports on economic growth in North Africa Countries since it’s never been processed before. To endeavor this purpose annual data was collected for the period 1982 – 2016 and was tested by using correlation analysis and the static gravity model. Empirical analyses show that agricultural trade has a positive correlation with gross domestic product, but it appears that agricultural exports and gross domestic product have a weak correlation. The static gravity model estimation shows that agricultural exports have a positive on economic growth. However, agricultural imports have not any effect on economic growth. These results appear that agricultural exports are a fountain of economic growth in North Africa Countries. For this reason, it is very important to refine agricultural investment, and create more dynamic agricultural trade openness policies.
F11|Survey of gravity models of trade and labour, and a proposed trade-employment gravity model for the Philippines|A review of literature on gravity models on international trade, with a proposed model for the Philippines linking trade and employment. This review of literature provides other aspects of gravity modelling, from its elementary formulation as proposed by Timbergen (1962) to current theoretical and empirical extensions.
F11|Time Zone Differences, Communication Cost and Service Trade|The paper explains how service trade has been facilitated because of the availability and development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). With this, the paper points out to the budding theory of time zone (TZ) differences and trade where time zone difference between two countries evokes service trade given the availability of ICT. A general equilibrium framework is taken to explain the effect of trade across non overlapping time zones on factor prices and output. Results show a rise in wage of skilled labour and a fall in rent. The result is conditional on the assumptions of factor intensity. In case of output, the sector exploiting the time zone difference is seen to expand while the other contracts. This outcome, however is independent of the assumption of factor intensity.
F11|The Nexus Between Industrial Exports And Economic Growth In Tunisia: Empirical Analysis|This paper investigates the relationship between industrial exports and economic growth in Tunisia. In order to achieve this purpose, annual data for the periods between 1969 and 2015 were tested using the Johansen co-integration analysis of Vector Error Correction Model and the Granger-Causality tests. According to the result of the analysis, it was determined that there is a negative relationship between industrial exports and economic growth in the long run. Otherwise, and on the basis of the results of the Granger causality test, we noted the absence of a causal relationship between industrial exports and economic growth in the short term. These results provide evidence that industrial exports, thus, are not seen as the source of economic growth in Tunisia and suffer a lot of problems and poor economic strategy.
F11|Do Agricultural Raw Materials Imports Cause Agricultural Growth? Empirical Analysis from North Africa|The aim of this paper is to study empirically the impact of agricultural raw materials imports on agricultural growth since it never done before. We have made this study in the context of three countries from North Africa (Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt) for the period 1965 – 2016. By using cointegration analysis and vector error correction model, empirical analysis proves that agricultural raw materials imports produce a positive effect on agricultural growth in the long run for all the three countries and cause agricultural growth in the short run in the case of Tunisia and Egypt. It is seen that agricultural raw materials imports are a source of economic growth in the agricultural sector. For this reason, countries of North Africa should adopt to integrate foreign technology imports and not technological innovation to stimulate agricultural sector.

F11|Capital, technical progress and international trade|(Abstract) CAPITAL, TECHNICAL PROGRESS AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE Much has been written about the objection originally formulated by Piero Sraffa to the use of production functions and aggregate capital and of the disputes that ensued, but there seems to be no systematic explanation in one place of why this objection is crucial to the foundations of economic theory and why the various attempts to escape it fail. This paper is an attempt provide one. First, it presents the reasoning of the objection and shows how the arguments against it are either fallacious or too restricted to be useful. Second, it shows how technical progress and international trade give two more reasons for the same objection, which, though logically independent, only became apparent because of the first. From these it follows that neither technical progress nor international trade can be plausibly described or explained if capital goods are not treated as heterogeneous goods manufactured with the use of capital goods. This leads to a more realistic depiction of technical progress as the outcome of the R&D of competing firms. (For brevity, government activities are left out.) The implications for international trade are described briefly. This paper is not a survey; it is confined to the minimum needed to establish its contentions. Its discussion of the disputes has mostly been said before, but it covers some gaps that seem to have been overlooked. It adds to the discussion in that the disputes did not take up the implications of technical progress and international trade.
F11|Redistributing the gains from trade through progressive taxation|Should a nation's tax system become more progressive as it opens to trade? Does opening to trade change the benefits of a progressive tax system? We answer these question within a standard incomplete markets model with frictional labor markets and Ricardian trade. Consistent with empirical evidence, adverse shocks to comparative advantage lead to labor income losses for import-competition-exposed workers; with incomplete markets, these workers are imperfectly insured and experience welfare losses. A progressive tax system is valuable, as it substitutes for imperfect insurance and redistributes the gains from trade. However, it also reduces the incentives for labor to reallocate away from comparatively disadvantaged locations. We find that optimal progressivity should increase with openness to trade with a ten percentage point increase in openness necessitating a five percentage point increase in marginal tax rates for those at the top of the income distribution.

F11|International Outsourcing, Environmental Costs, and Welfare|We explore the welfare consequences of international outsourcing in the presence of resulting environmental damage in a three-stage model of North–South trade. In stage 1, outsourcing firms in the North (e.g., United States and Europe）cause environmental damage to the vendor country in the South, as exemplified by the People’s Republic of China. But, as its primary goal, the South pursuing economic development is willing to bear the costs of environmental degradation. Moving into Stage II, the environmental deterioration becomes so severe in the South that the vendor country begins to tackle the environmental problem by enacting government regulations. As a result, the costs and, hence, the prices of outsourced goods and services tend to increase for the firms in the North. However, the environmental protection measures undertaken generally fall short of the levels needed to restore the environmental quality acceptable by World Health Organization standards. We present a framework for analyzing the effects of international outsourcing on environment and, ultimately, social welfare in terms of gains and losses under three alternative scenarios regarding no, partial, or full accountability for outsourcing induced environmental damages. The policy implication is clear: to fully resolve the environmental problem in Stage III, the implementation of strong regulations or the fostering international cooperation is desirable; that is, until the environmental costs of outsourcing are fully accounted for by the outsourcing firms in the North. Such firms, however, may react by resorting to insourcing, diversified outsourcing and other strategies.
F11|Additional Source of Gains From Trade: The Response of the Labor Market to a Decline in Tariffs|A standard model of international trade has a setting with constant labor supply. However, this model introduces a consumption-leisure choice into a traditional model of international economics. Therefore, this paper focuses on the response of labor to changes in tariffs. Moreover, I show that there exists a positive optimal tariff rate which maximizes welfare in a setting with endogenous labor and compare this result quantitatively with the standard models using constant labor supply. This paper also focuses on the welfare implications of a decline in trade barriers (in terms of tariffs). I utilize a version of computational general equilibrium model of international trade (based on Armington assumption) where countries are potentially asymmetric in terms of labor endowment, productivity, etc. Eaton and Kortum (2002) derive a simple formula which shows the gains from trade and this formula is generalized by Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodriguez-Clare (2012) in the case of iceberg costs and exogenously fixed labor supply. I generalize this formula in Armington setup with tariffs and endogenous labor supply and highlight the importance of both revenue generating tariffs and consumption-leisure choice.
F11|Capital accumulation and dynamic gains from trade|We compute welfare gains from trade in a dynamic, multicountry model with capital accumulation and trade imbalances. We develop a gradient-free method to compute the exact transition paths following a trade liberalization. We find that (i) larger countries accumulate a current account surplus, and financial resources flow from larger countries to smaller countries, boosting consumption in the latter, (ii) countries with larger short-run trade deficits accumulate capital faster, (iii) the gains are nonlinear in the reduction in trade costs, and (iv) capital accumulation accounts for substantial gains. The net foreign asset position before the liberalization is positively correlated with the gains. The tradables intensity in consumption goods production determines the static gains, and the tradables intensity in investment goods production determines the dynamic gains that include capital accumulation.
F11|The Impact of Contract Enforcement Costs on Outsourcing and Aggregate Productivity|Legal institutions affect economic outcomes, but how much? This paper documents how costly supplier contract enforcement shapes firm boundaries, and quantifies the impact of this transaction cost on aggregate productivity and welfare. I embed a contracting game between a buyer and a supplier in a general-equilibrium macro-model. Contract enforcement costs lead suppliers to underproduce. Thus, firms will perform more of the production process in-house instead of outsourcing it. On a macroeconomic scale, in countries with slow and costly courts, firms should buy relatively less inputs from sectors whose products are more specific to the buyer-seller relationship. I first present reduced-form evidence for this hypothesis using cross-country regressions. I use microdata on case law from the United States to construct a new measure of relationship-specificity by sector-pairs. This allows me to control for productivity differences across countries and sectors and to causally identify the effect of contracting frictions on industry structure. I then proceed to structurally estimate the key parameters of my macro-model. Using a set of counterfactual experiments, I investigate the role of contracting frictions in shaping productivity and income per capita across countries. Setting enforcement costs to US levels (alternative: zero) would increase real income by an average of 3.6 percent (7 percent) across all countries, and by an average of 10 percent (13.3 percent) across low-income countries. Hence, transaction costs and firm boundaries are important on a macroeconomic scale.
F11|Roadways, Input Sourcing, and Patterns of Specialization|We propose a model where the internal transport network facilitates the sourcing of intermediate goods from different locations. A denser internal transport network promotes thus the growth of industries that rely on a large variety of inputs. The model shows that heterogeneities in internal transport infrastructures can become a key factor in shaping comparative advantage and specialization. Moreover, when sufficiently pronounced, such heterogeneities may even overshadow more traditional sources of specialization based on factor productivities. Evidence based on industry-level trade data grants support to the main prediction of the model: countries with denser road networks export relatively more in industries that exhibit broader input bases. We show that this correlation is robust to several possible confounding effects proposed by the literature, such as the impact of institutions on specialization in complex goods. Furthermore, we show that a similar correlation arises as well when the density of the local transport network is measured by the density of their internal waterways, and also when road density is instrumented with measures of terrain roughness.
F11|Solving Leontief's Paradox with Endogenous Growth Theory|Theories of international trade have severe difficulties in explaining why, despite i) substantial differences in factor-proportions across industries and ii) considerable cross-country differences in capital-labor ratios, the iii) the evidence for factor-proportions trade is rather weak. We propose a simple explanation of this well known finding: standard trade theories treat important forces such as the distribution of productivity within the economy as exogenous. We argue instead that the productivity allocation is endogenous and counter-balances factor-proportion differentials be- tween countries. Consequently, comparative advantage across countries of different development levels is negligible and this is why the incentives for trade are low.
F11|A Synthesis of the Lewis Development Model and Neoclassical Trade Models|A simplifed Lewis model with evidence-based assumptions treats all rural output as nontraded, and pays rural workers a convex combination of their average and marginal products. Lewis style transition is characterized as an increase in the weight on marginal product in the determination of the rural wage. This integration with standard trade models underscores the importance of trade for development, and predicts a real exchange rate appreciation for economies undergoing a Lewis style transition.
F11|Demographics and FDI: Lessons from China’s One-Child Policy|Lucas (1990) argues that the neoclassical adjustment process fails to explain the relative paucity of FDI inflows from rich to poor countries. In this paper we consider a natural experiment: using China as the treated country and India as the control, we show that the dynamics of the relative FDI flows subsequent to the implementation of China’s one-child policy, as seen in the data, are consistent with neoclassical fundamentals. In particular, following the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the capital-labor (K/L) ratio of China increased relative to that of India, and, simultaneously, relative FDI inflows into China vs. India declined. These observations are explained in the context of a simple neoclassical OLG paradigm. The adjustment mechanism works as follows: the reduction in the (urban) labor force due to the one-child policy increases the savings per capita. This increases the K/L ratio and reduces the marginal product of capital (MPK). The reduction in MPK (relative to India) reduces the relative attractiveness of investment in China and is thus associated with lower FDI/GDP ratios. Our paper contributes to the nascent literature exploring demographic transitions and their effects on FDI flows.
F11|Gender, Informal Employment and Trade Liberalization in Mexico| We study how trade liberalization affects labour reallocation in formal and informal jobs across gender. We link the Mexican labour force survey with data on tariffs at the 4-digit level from 1993 to 2001, and find that a tariff reduction increases the probability of holding a formal job for both men and women within industries. Constructing a regional tarif measure, we show that local effects of changes in trade policy differ between gender and industries. At the regional level, trade liberalization decreases the probability of working formally for women, but increases the probability of working formally for high- skilled men. Then, controlling for sectoral differences, we find that in the manufacturing sector, men benefit more from the formalization of jobs induced by trade liberalization. While in the service sector, workers, especially low- skilled women, have higher chances to work informally.
F11|A Perfect Specialization Model for Gravity Equation in Bilateral Trade based on Production Structure|Specialization models are important in providing a solid theoretical ground for gravity equation in bilateral trade. Some research papers try to improve specialization models by adding imperfect specialization to them, but we believe it is unnecessary complication. We provide a perfect specialization model based on the phenomenon that we call tradability, which overcomes the problems with simpler models. We provide empirical evidence using estimations on panel data of bilateral trade of 40 countries over 10 years that support the theoretical model.
F11|The Trade War in Numbers|We build upon new developments in the international trade literature to isolate and quantify the long-run economic impacts of tariff changes on the United States and the global economy. In particular, we apply the most recent data and trade elasticity estimates to the Ricardian model of Caliendo and Parro (2015) to quantify the long-run impacts of the recently applied and proposed tariff changes, including the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and the rounds of additional tariffs between the United States and China. To fit the reality of the current trade policy shift, our analysis also allows for quotas and endogenizes trade balances. Overall, our results suggest that the newly imposed and proposed tariff schemes imply considerable changes in trade flows and sectoral output reallocations, but modest impacts on long-run aggregate prices and output levels.
F11|Estimating the Impacts of Tariff Changes: Two Illustrative Scenarios|We build upon new developments in the international trade literature to construct a quantitative Ricardian framework similar to Caliendo and Parro (2015) to isolate and estimate the long-run economic impacts of tariff changes. Our framework incorporates the most recent data and shows that the trade elasticities have changed considerably since the 1990s—highlighting the need to use recent data to quantitatively evaluate newly imposed and proposed tariff schedules. We apply our model and use our estimated elasticities to measure the long-run economic impact of the recently announced US tariffs on steel and aluminum and the first round of additional tariffs between the United States and China. Our results suggest that modifying the current global tariff schedules would imply considerable changes in trade flows and sectoral reallocations, but modest impacts on longrun output levels.
F11|The economics of revoking NAFTA|In a world economy interconnected by global value chains (GVCs), domestic productivity depends on the availability of imported inputs and the vast majority of workers stands to lose from protectionism. To exemplify this, we provide a quantitative assessment of the aggregate and distributional effects of one hypothetical protectionist measure - the case of revoking the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Using a multi-country, multi-sector, quantitative model of global production, we show that a full revocation extending to both tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers would result in a real annual GDP loss of US$ 37 billion in Canada, US$ 22 billion in Mexico, and US$ 40 billion in the USA. In contrast, annual combined losses would amount to less than US$ 5 billion if only tariff rates were to be increased. For both counterfactuals, the distributional impacts across sectors would be an order of magnitude larger than the aggregate effects. Combining these results with information on the geographic distribution of sectoral employment, we show that almost all regions in North America would record reductions in their average real wage.
F11|Offshoring and skill-upgrading in French manufacturing|Using French manufacturing firm-level data for the years 1996–2007, we uncover a novel set of stylized facts about offshoring behavior: (i) Low-productivity firms (“non-importers”) obtain most of their inputs domestically. (ii) Medium-productivity firms offshore skill-intensive inputs to skill-abundant countries and are more labor intensive in their domestic production than non-importers. (iii) Higher-productivity firms additionally offshore labor-intensive inputs to labor-abundant countries and are more skill intensive than non-importers. We develop a model in which heterogeneous firms, subject to fixed costs, can offshore intermediate inputs of different skill intensities to countries with different skill abundance. This leads to endogenous within-industry variation in domestic skill intensities. We provide econometric evidence supporting the factor-proportions channel through which reductions in offshoring costs to labor-abundant countries have significantly increased firm-level skill intensities of French manufacturers.
F11|Aggregating from Micro to Macro Patterns of Trade|We develop a new framework for aggregating from micro to macro patterns of trade. We derive price indexes that determine comparative advantage across countries and sectors and the aggregate cost of living. If firms and products are imperfect substitutes, we show that these price indexes depend on variety, average demand/quality and the dispersion of demand/quality-adjusted prices, and are only weakly related to standard empirical measures of average prices, thereby providing insight for elasticity puzzles. Of the cross-section (time-series) variation in comparative advantage, 50 (90) percent is accounted for by variety and average demand/quality, with average prices contributing less than 10 percent.
F11|The network origins of the gains from trade|This paper argues that the determinants of the welfare gains from trade have fundamentally changed with the emergence of a global production network. Towards this end, we study a Ricardian trade model featuring trade in intermediate inputs, and develop a novel comparative statics approach to decompose the total welfare effect of an arbitrary trade cost shock into several meaningful, easily quantifiable, channels. This decomposition uncovers a unique feature of supply chain trade: the gains from trade are not so much determined by a country's access to the technologies and markets of its direct trade partners, but rather by a country's network exposure to countries further up- or downstream in the global production network. We develop a set of simple statistics to measure each country's network exposure, show how it predicts the gains from trade, and identify each country's key trade intermediaries, i.e., countries that primarily determine its network exposure.
F11|Roadways, Input Sourcing, and Patterns of Specialisation|We propose a model where the internal transport network facilitates the sourcing of intermediate goods from di¤erent locations. E¢ cient internal transportation promotes thus the growth of industries that rely on a large variety of inputs. The model shows that heterogeneities in internal transport infrastructures can become a key factor in shaping comparative advantage and specialisation. Moreover, when su¢ ciently pronounced, such heterogeneities may even overshadow more traditional sources of specialisation based on factor productivities. Evidence based on industry-level trade data grants support to the main prediction of the model: countries with denser road networks export relatively more in industries that exhibit wider input bases. We show that this correlation is robust to several possible confounding e¤ects proposed by the literature, such as the impact of institutions on specialisation in complex goods. Furthermore, we show that a similar correlation also arises when the density of the local transport network is measured by the density of their internal waterways, rather than by roadway density.
F11|The US Gains from Trade: Valuation Using the Demand for Foreign Factor Services|About eight cents out of every dollar spent in the United States is spent on imports. What if, because of a wall or some other extreme policy intervention, imports were to remain on the other side of the US border? How much would US consumers be willing to pay to prevent this hypothetical policy change from taking place? The answer to this question represents the welfare cost from autarky or, equivalently, the welfare gains from trade. In this article, we discuss how to evaluate these gains using estimates of the demand for foreign factor services.
F11|Robots, Trade, and Luddism: A Sufficient Statistic Approach to Optimal Technology Regulation|Technological change, from the advent of robots to expanded trade opportunities, tends to create winners and losers. How should government policy respond? And how should the overall welfare impact of technological change on society be valued? We provide a general theory of optimal technology regulation in a second best world, with rich heterogeneity across households, linear taxes on the subset of firms affected by technological change, and a nonlinear tax on labor income. Our first results consist of three optimal tax formulas, with minimal structural assumptions, involving sufficient statistics that can be implemented using evidence on the distributional impact of new technologies, such as robots and trade. Our second result is a comparative static exercise illustrating that while distributional concerns create a rationale for non-zero taxes on robots and trade, the magnitude of these taxes may decrease as the process of automation and globalization deepens and inequality increases. Our final result shows that, despite limited tax instruments, technological progress is always welcome and valued in the same way as in a first best world.
F11|Structural transformation to manufacturing and services: what role for trade?|Understanding how and why economies structurally transform as they grow is crucial for sound national policy making. Typically analysts of this issue focus on sectoral shares of GDP and employment. This paper extends that to include exports, including of services. It also considers mining in addition to agriculture and manufacturing, and recognizes some of the products of those four sectors are nontradable. The theory section’s general equilibrium model provides hypotheses about structural change in different types of economies as they grow, and tests them econometrically with annual data for a sample of 117 countries for the period 1991-2014. The results point to the futility of adopting protective policies aimed at slowing de-agriculturalization and subsequent de-industrialization in terms of sectoral shares, since those trends inevitably will accompany economic growth. Fortuitously governments now have far more efficient and equitable ways of supporting the adjustments needed by people choosing or being pushed to leave declining industries.
F11|The Economics and Politics of Revoking NAFTA|We provide a quantitative assessment of both the aggregate and the distributional effects of revoking NAFTA using a multi-country, multi-sector, multi-factor model of world production and trade with global input-output linkages. Revoking NAFTA would reduce US welfare by about 0.2%, and Canadian and Mexican welfare by about 2%. The distributional impacts of revoking NAFTA across workers in different sectors are an order of magnitude larger in all three countries, ranging from -2.7 to 2.26% in the United States. We combine the quantitative results with information on the geographic distribution of sectoral employment, and compute average real wage changes in each US congressional district, Mexican state, and Canadian province. We then examine the political correlates of the economic effects. Congressional district-level real wage changes are negatively correlated with the Trump vote share in 2016: districts that voted more for Trump would on average experience greater real wage reductions if NAFTA is revoked.
F11|Gains from Trade: Does Sectoral Heterogeneity Matter?|This paper assesses the quantitative importance of including sectoral heterogeneity in computing the gains from trade. Our framework draws from Caliendo and Parro (2015) and Alvarez and Lucas (2007) and has sectoral heterogeneity along five dimensions, including the elasticity of trade to trade costs, the value-added share, and the input-output structure. The key parameter we estimate is the sectoral trade elasticity, and we use the Simonovska and Waugh (2014) simulated method of moments estimator with micro price data. Our estimates range from 2.97 to 8.94, considerably lower than those obtained with the Eaton and Kortum (2002) price-based method. Our benchmark model is calibrated to 21 OECD countries and 20 sectors. We compute the gains from trade in our benchmark model, and in several re-calibrated versions of the model in which we eliminate one or more sources of sectoral heterogeneity. Our main result is that sectoral heterogeneity does not always lead to an increase in the gains from trade. There are two reasons for this. First, the magnitudes of our estimated sectoral trade elasticities are relatively high, while the magnitude of our estimated aggregate trade elasticity is low. All else equal, this will lead to higher gains for the aggregate, one-sector model. Second, the sectors with low trade elasticities (hence, implying high gains from trade) are not the sectors with low value-added shares and with high initial trade shares (which would magnify the gains). Hence, the sectoral heterogeneity in our calibrated model does not exert complementary gains from trade effects.
F11|Export Variety, Productivity, And Country Size In A Multi-Good Ricardian Model Of Export Diversification|This paper addresses the lack of connection between theory and empirics in most export diversification–economic development studies. We provide a Ricardian-based theoretical explanation of countries’ relative export variety as a function of the level of technology and country size assessed with respect to the rest of the world. Relative export diversification is an outcome of two forces: a relative productivity change (technological progress) and a relative country size change (labour force growth). The model predictions are confirmed in a sample of 132 countries (1988–2014), including 53 low-income countries, for which we measure export variety using product-level trade data. The influence of technology differences on export variety is: (i) stronger than is the effect of cross-country differences in size and (ii) non-linear, driving diversification at the beginning of the development process. The results are robust to the measurement of export variety, the inclusion of control variables, and estimation methods.
F11|Firm heterogeneity, comparative advantage and the transfer problem|This paper studies the transfer problem in a model featuring comparative advantage, monopolistic competition, trade costs, and firm heterogeneity in factor intensity. The results are very different from those of the previous literature. First, a transfer creates a secondary burden in situations where the neoclassical version of the Heckscher–Ohlin model would not. Second, a transfer affects wage inequality. Third, a transfer is not neutral to world welfare. Fourth, floating exchange rates do not substitute for deflation. Fifth, a simulation exercise shows that the quantitative effects of trade imbalances are comparable in magnitude to those arising from major trade agreements.
F11|The Stable Coexistence of Oligopolies and the Competitive Fringe|In this paper, we introduce a simple new theory on mixed competition between oligopolistic firms and the competitive fringe, assuming a comparative advantage for big firms and free entry for small _rms. Oligopolies are defined as conglomerates, each part of which benefits from joint operations through lower costs. Our theory implies that (i) industries with a few oligopolies arise as a stable outcome of mixed competition; (ii) mixed competition differs from the monopolistic competition of single-product firms due to the underproduction of oligopolistic firms and differs from pure oligopolistic competition sine constraints on this underproduction are imposed by the competitive fringe; (iii) a positive shock in the market size an strengthen or weaken the competitiveness of the economy through the growth of the number of oligopolies
F11|Fragmentation and Gains from Trade|In this paper, we estimate the competitiveness of countries in intermediate goods and in final goods. We find that China’s competitiveness in both intermediate goods and final goods increased exceptionally rapidly during 1995-2011. We also find that the gains from trade of countries with strong comparative advantage in final goods can be substantially under-estimated if we do not separately take into account trade flows in intermediate goods and final goods. We also find that, during 1995-2011, the average increase in gains from intermediate goods trade across all countries in our sample is distinctly higher than the average increase in gains from final goods trade. This suggests that gains from trade due to international fragmentation of production is becoming more important over time relative to gains from trade in final goods.
F11|The Heckscher—Ohlin—Samuelson Trade Theory and the Cambridge Capital Controversies: On the Validity of Factor Price Equalisation Theorem|This paper examines the validity of the factor price equalisation theorem (FPET) in relation to capital theory. First, it presents a survey of the literature on Heckscher—Ohlin—Samuelson (HOS) models that treat capital as a primary factor, beginning with Samuelson (1953). In addition, by consulting the Cambridge capital controversies, this paper observes that the validity of the FPET relies crucially on this setting. It does no longer hold whenever capital is assumed to be a bundle of reproducible commodities. This paper also refers to the recent literature on the dynamic HOS trade theory and argues that such studies ignore the difficulties posed by the capital controversies. It thereby concludes that the FPET holds even when capital is modelled as a reproducible factor. In conclusion, the paper suggests the necessity of reconstructing basic theories of international trade without relying on the FPET.
F11|The 2018 Trade War: Data and Nascent General Equilibrium Analysis|This study introduces a database of 2018 tariff increases resulting from the recent trade war and quantifies the impacts using the canonical GTAPinGAMS model calibrated to GTAP version 9 accounts. We report relatively modest economy-wide welfare impacts in this perfect-competition Armington model, with substantial impacts on the pattern of trade and output in important sectors.

F11|How does BREXIT affect production patterns of multinational enterprises?|This paper explores how the British exit (Brexit) from the European Union (EU) potentially affects the United Kingdom (UK) economy and the production patterns of multinational enterprises that choose the UK as either a destination market or a gateway to the EU market. Utilizing an extended version of the knowledge-capital model, simulation analysis reveals the following points: (1) Brexit will encourage firms in both the EU and the UK to change strategies to incorporate more horizontal-type affiliates so that Brexit will not reduce inward foreign direct investment (FDI) to the UK as long as the UK is attractive as a final market; and (2) In contrast, export-platforms serving the EU market owned by firms in non-EU countries will completely withdraw by the time Brexit is completed. To cover losses from the reduction in the number of export-platforms, efforts to enhance the attractiveness of the UK as a destination market would be a solution in the short-run, while seeking new economic partnership programs with both EU and non-EU countries will work in the long-run.

F11|Imperfect Mobility Of Labor Across Sectors And Fiscal Transmission|This paper develops a two-sector open economy model with imperfect mobility of labor across sectors in order to account for time-series evidence on the aggregate and sectoral effects of a government spending shock. Using a panel of sixteen OECD coun- tries over the period 1970-2007, our VAR evidence shows that a rise in government consumption i) increases hours worked and GDP and produces a simultaneous decline in investment and the current account, ii) increases non traded output relative to GDP and thus its output share (in real terms) and lowers the output share of tradables, and iii) causes both the relative price and the relative wage of non tradables to appreciate. While the second set of findings reveals that the government spending shock is biased toward non tradables and triggers a shift of resources for this sector, the third find- ing indicates the presence of labor mobility costs, thus preventing wage equalization across sectors. Turning to cross-country differences, empirically we detect a positive relationship between the magnitude of impact responses of sectoral output shares and the degree of labor mobility across sectors. Our quantitative analysis shows that our empirical findings for aggregate and sectoral variables can be rationalized as long as we allow for a difficulty in reallocating labor across sectors along with adjustment costs to capital accumulation. Finally, the model is able to generate a cross-country relationship between the degree of labor mobility and the responses of sectoral output shares which is similar to that in the data.
F11|Quantitative Analysis of Multi-Party Tariff Negotiations|This paper develops a model of international tariff negotiations to study the design of the institutional rules of the GATT/WTO. We embed a multi-sector model of trade between multiple countries into a model of inter-connected bilateral negotiations over tariffs. Using 1990 trade flows and tariff outcomes from the Uruguay Round of GATT/WTO negotiations, we estimate country-sector productivity levels, sector-level productivity dispersion, iceberg trade costs, and country-pair bargaining parameters. We use the estimated model to simulate an alternative institutional setting for multilateral tariff negotiations in which the most-favored-nation requirement is abandoned. We find that abandonment of the most-favored-nation requirement would result in inefficient over-liberalization of tariffs and a deterioration in world-wide welfare relative to the negotiated outcomes in the presence of the most-favored-nation requirement.
F11|Firm Sorting and Agglomeration|The distribution of firms in space is far from uniform. Some locations host the most productive large firms, while others barely attract any. In this paper, I study the sorting of heterogeneous firms across locations and analyze policies designed to attract firms to particular regions (place-based policies). I first propose a theory of the distribution of heterogeneous firms in a variety of sectors across cities. Aggregate TFP and welfare depend on the extent of agglomeration externalities produced in cities and on how heterogeneous firms sort across them. The distribution of city sizes and the sorting patterns of firms are uniquely determined in equilibrium. This allows me to structurally estimate the model, using French firm-level data. I find that nearly half of the observed productivity advantage of large cities is due to firm sorting. I use the estimated model to quantify the general equilibrium effects of place-based policies. I find that policies that decrease local congestion lead to a new spatial equilibrium with higher aggregate TFP and welfare. In contrast, policies that subsidize under-developed areas have negative aggregate effects.
F11|Gravity and Comparative Advantage: Estimation of Trade Elasticities for the Agricultural Sector|In this paper, a structural gravity model is presented which features intra-sector heterogeneity in agricultural productivity systematically linked to land and climate characteristics. The “systematic heterogeneity” (SH) gravity model predicts that countries with similar land and climate characteristics tend to specialize in the same agricultural products. Agricultural trade flow elasticities then depend on comparative advantage, with larger-magnitude trade flow responses predicted among countries more likely to specialize in similar agricultural products and thus compete head-to-head in foreign markets. This is in contrast to standard log-linear gravity models, which impose a restrictive pattern of trade flow elasticities that depend only on absolute advantage in the agricultural sector. We also show how the SH gravity model can accommodate product-specific trade costs. This allows the model to analyze changes in the dispersion of trade costs across products. Such analysis cannot be carried out in a standard gravity model, in which trade costs are assumed constant. Our results confirm economically and statistically significant heterogeneity in the effects of the variables that typically proxy for trade costs in gravity models and demonstrate that the SH gravity model is able to overcome the limitations imposed by the restrictive pattern of elasticities in a standard gravity model.
F11|Robots, Trade, and Luddism: A Sufficient Statistic Approach to Optimal Technology Regulation|Technological change, from the advent of robots to expanded trade opportunities, tends to create winners and losers. How should government policy respond? And how should the overall welfare impact of technological change on society be valued? We provide a general theory of optimal technology regulation in a second best world, with rich heterogeneity across households, linear taxes on the subset of firms affected by technological change, and a nonlinear tax on labor income. Our first results consist of three optimal tax formulas, with minimal structural assumptions, involving sufficient statistics that can be implemented using evidence on the distributional impact of new technologies, such as robots and trade. Our second result is a comparative static exercise illustrating that while distributional concerns create a rationale for non-zero taxes on robots and trade, the magnitude of these taxes may decrease as the process of automation and globalization deepens and inequality increases. Our final result shows that, despite limited tax instruments, technological progress is always welcome and valued in the same way as in a first best world.
F11|Border Walls|What are the economic impacts of a border wall between the United States and Mexico? We use detailed data on bilateral ows of primarily unauthorized Mexican workers to the United States to estimate how a substantial expansion of the border wall between the United States and Mexico from 2007 to 2010 affected migration. We use these effects to estimate a general equilibrium spatial model featuring multiple labor types and quantify the economic impact of the wall expansion. At a construction cost of approximately $7 per person in the United States, we estimate that the border wall expansion harmed Mexican workers and high-skill U.S. workers, but benefited U.S. low-skill workers, who on average achieved welfare gains equivalent to an increase in per capita income of $0.28 per year.
F11|The economics and politics of revoking NAFTA|Abstract We provide a quantitative assessment of both the aggregate and the distributional effects of revoking NAFTA, using a multi-country, multi-sector, multi-factor model of world production and trade with global input-output linkages. Revoking NAFTA would reduce US welfare by about 0.2%, and Canadian and Mexican welfare by about 2%. The distributional impacts of revoking NAFTA across workers in different sectors are an order of magnitude larger in all three countries, ranging from -2.7 to 2.26% in the United States. We combine the quantitative results with information on the geographic distribution of sectoral employment, and compute average real wage changes in each US congressional district, Mexican state, and Canadian province. We then examine the political correlates of the economic effects. Congressional district-level real wage changes are negatively correlated with the Trump vote share in 2016: districts that voted more for Trump would on average experience greater real wage reductions if NAFTA is revoked.
F11|Demographics and FDI: Lessons from China's one-child policy|"Following the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the capital-labor (K/L) ratio of China increased relative to that of India, and, simultaneously, FDI inflows relative to GDP for China versus India declined. These observations are explained in the context of a simple neoclassical OLG paradigm. The adjustment mechanism works as follows: the reduction in the growth rate of the (urban) labor force due to the one-child policy permanently increases the capital per worker inherited from the previous generation. The resulting increase in China's (domestic K)/L thus ""crowds out"" the need for FDI in China relative to India. Our paper is a contribution to the nascent literature exploring demographic transitions and their effects on FDI flows."
F11|Trade-Driven Sectoral Upgrading and the Global Balances|This paper analyzes how trade integration may affect international financial flows in a world with heterogeneous financial development. In the presence of financial frictions and sector-specific minimum investment requirements, the static gains from trade trigger the cross-sector investment reallocation on the extensive margin, which may allow the more financially developed country (North) to offshore low-return production activities and upgrade to high-return activities. This way, trade-driven sectoral upgrading in North becomes a mechanism through which the substantial decline in trade and communication costs and the resulting boom in supply-chain trade may contribute to the global imbalances in the recent decades.
F11|Local Discoveries and Technological Relatedness: the Role of Foreign Firms|"We explore the role of local intra and extra-regional product-specific capabilities in foster ing the introduction of new products by firms active in the Turkish manufacturing sector. We model firms' product additions to their product basket as dependent on extra and intra-regional knowledge. We find that regional ""discoveries"", that is newly introduced products never produced before in the region, are positively and significantly affected by external related knowledge spurring from foreign firms active in the same location as well as by firm internal capabilities. Technologically related intra-regional knowledge spillovers and extra-regional knowledge spilling from imported inputs do not play a relevant role. The former, however, matter when we extend the analysis to all new products introduced by firms, regardless of their previous presence in the regional production basket. We interpret this evidence as foreign affiliates bringing new and exclusive capabilities which are missing in the region where they locate, thus providing a stimulus for regional production diversification and upgrading. This hypothesis is validated by exploring the heterogeneous role of the different intra and extra-regional knowledge sources according to products' complexity."
F11|Comparative Advantage in Innovation and Production|This paper develops a multi-country, general equilibrium, semi endogenous growth model of innovation and trade in which specialization in innovation and production are jointly determined. The distinctive element of the model is the ability of the agents to direct their research efforts to specific goods, in a context of heterogeneous innovation capabilities across countries and contemporaneous decreasing returns to R&D. The model features a two-way relationship between trade and technology absent in standard quantitative Ricardian trade models. I calibrate the model using a sample of 29 countries and 18 manufacturing industries and quantify the importance of endogenous adjustments in technology. I find that endogenous adjustments in technology due to directed research can account for up to 52.8% of the observed variance in comparative advantage in production. In addition, the model suggests that standard Ricardian models overestimate the reductions in real income from increases in trade costs and underestimate the increment in real income due to trade liberalizations.
F11|Learning and the Value of Relationships in International Trade|We use U.S. import data to explore the characteristics of importer-exporter relationships. While many relationships split up after only one period, others are very persistent. Even when a relationship breakup occurs, importers overwhelmingly replace imports from that partner by buying from a supplier familiar to them. Furthermore, 43% of new product purchases come from firms that the importer interacted with in an earlier year. These results indicate the presence of large matching frictions in international trade. We develop a model to study and quantify the role of reputation and learning in explaining the observed patterns of importer-exporter relationships. Predictions of the model regarding the correlation between switching behavior and source country institutions, the number of export partners, and the number of products purchased are borne out in the data.
F11|Capital Goods Trade, Relative Prices and Economic Development|International trade in capital goods has quantitatively important effects on economic development through capital formation and TFP. Capital goods trade enables poor countries to access more efficient technologies, leading to lower relative prices of capital goods and higher capital-output ratios. Moreover, poor countries use their comparative advantage and allocate their resources more efficiently, and increase their TFP. We quantify these channels using a multisector, multicountry, Ricardian model of trade with capital accumulation. The model matches several trade and development facts within a unified framework. Frictionless trade in capital goods reduces the income gap between rich and poor countries by 40 percent. More than half of the reduction in the income gap is due to the TFP channel.

F11|The European Unionâ€“West Africa Economic Partnership Agreement| Despite recent modifications, the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between the European Union (EU) and West African (WA) countries is still being criticized for its potential detrimental effects on WA countries. This paper provides updated evidence on the impact of the EPA on these countries. A dynamic multicountry, multisector computable general equilibrium trade model with modeling of the dual-dual economy and with a consistent tariff aggregator is used to simulate a series of new scenarios that include updated information on the agreement. We also go beyond estimating macrolevel economic effects to analyze the impacts on poverty. The policy simulation results show that the implementation of the EPA between the EU and WA countries would have marginal but positive impacts on Burkina Faso and CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire and negative impacts on Benin, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, and Togo. The impact on poverty indicators in Ghana and Nigeria would be marginal. From the perspective of WA countries, this study supports the view that recent EU concessions are not sufficient and that domestic fiscal reforms are needed in WA countries themselves.
F11|Core labour standards and exports|"(english) Core labour standards defined by the ILO in 1998 are universal, but applied very differently across countries. Compliance is much higher in high income countries. However, the causality between improved labour standards and economic growth remains a controversial issue. Export-led growth strategies might encourage developing countries to curb the process of standards improvement. In this way, they can raise the volume of their unskilled labour endowments (child and/or forced labour) in order to strengthen their comparative advantage over compliant countries and pursue ""social dumping"" strategies, which aim more directly at increasing competitiveness. We use a gravity model to assess the trade impact of curbing the level of compliance with core labour standards, distinguishing the effects on bilateral trade (geographical specialization) from the multilateral effects on all exports and imports. We show that, other things being equal, countries that meet the labour standards tend to trade more with each other, while non-compliant countries tend to trade more with compliant countries. These effects are identified mainly with respect to child labour and freedom of association. All other things being equal, countries that meet the labour standards tend to be less open than non-compliant countries, but differently depending on the standards, with a non-linear relationship for some of them. Less compliant countries, frequently the poorest ones, may simultaneously step up their trade and labour standards. For median countries, mainly the emerging countries, the level of compliance with labour standards is “optimal” from a mercantilist point of view. For the most compliant countries, the developed ones, their strict compliance with labour standards implies a trade shortfall. _________________________________ (français) Les normes de travail fondamentales définies par l'OIT en 1998 sont universelles, mais différemment appliquées dans les pays. Leur respect est beaucoup plus élevé dans les pays à haut revenu. Toutefois, la causalité entre l'amélioration des normes de travail et la croissance reste un sujet débattu. Les stratégies de croissance par les exportations pourraient encourager les pays en développement à ralentir le processus d'amélioration des normes. Ils peuvent ainsi accroître leur dotation relative en travail non qualifié (travail des enfants et/ou forcé) pour renforcer leurs avantages comparatifs par rapport aux pays qui les respectent et poursuivre des politiques dites de ""dumping social"" qui visent encore plus directement à accroître leur compétitivité. Nous utilisons un modèle de gravité pour évaluer l'impact du commerce sur le respect des normes fondamentales de travail en séparant les effets sur le commerce bilatéral (spécialisation géographique) des effets sur l'ouverture multilatérale. Nous montrons que, toutes choses égales par ailleurs, les pays qui respectent les normes de travail tendent à échanger davantage entre eux alors que les pays qui ne les respectent pas tendent à échanger davantage avec les pays qui les respectent. Ces effets sont particulièrement nets avec le travail des enfants et la liberté d'association. Les pays qui respectent les normes de travail tendent à être moins ouverts que les pays qui ne les respectent pas, mais avec des différences selon les normes avec une relation non linéaire pour certaines d'entre elles. Les pays qui les respectent le moins, généralement les plus pauvres, améliorent simultanément leur commerce et leurs normes. Pour les pays intermédiaires en terme de respect des normes, principalement les pays émergents, le niveau de respect des normes de travail est “optimal” d'un point de vue mercantiliste. Pour les pays les plus respectueux, ce niveau élevé de normes conduit à réduire leur commerce."
F11|Assessing potential coupling factors of European decoupled payments with the Modular Agricultural GeNeral Equilibrium Tool (MAGNET)|"In 2020, decoupled payments will represent about 42% of the CAP budget (green payments excluded). This report assesses potential effects of European decoupled payments on farmers' production decisions, prior to a sensitivity analysis of different coupling factors using the Modular Applied GeNeral Equilibrium Tool (MAGNET). Scientific literature reveals different coupling channels such as capitalisation in land value, farmers' risk behaviour, credit accessibility, uncertainty about future policies and labour allocation through which European decoupled payments influence farm choices and thus output. For each of these channels the relevant literature introducing theoretical and empirical assessments is evaluated with the aim to derive parameters that improve the representation of decoupled payments in economic simulation models. Within MAGNET, the traditional representation of decoupled payments is a subsidy to the land factor. Nevertheless it appears that the most suitable approach seems to split decoupled payments value into two components, capitalized into the land factor on the one hand, distributed across all factors of production on the other hand. A sensitivity analysis concludes that if one assumes a ""degree"" of coupling, it does have some implication for output and price results when conducting policy analysis."
F11|Production patterns of multinational enterprises: the knowledge-capital model revisited|To prepare an answer to the question of how a developing country can attract foreign direct investment (FDI), this paper explored the factors and policies that may help bring FDI into a developing country by utilizing an extended version of the knowledge-capital model. With a special focus on the effects of a free trade agreement (FTA) or an economic partnership agreement (EPA) between a pair of market and non-market countries, simulations with the model revealed the following: (1) although FTA/EPA generally tends to increase FDI to a developing country, the possibility of improving welfare through increased demand for skilled and unskilled labor decreases as the size of the country grows; (2) a developing country may suffer severe welfare losses through FTA/EPA if the availability of skilled labor is extremely limited; and (3) a developing country can enhance welfare gains from a FTA, and it is even possible to recover the welfare effects from negative to positive, by making the arrangement an EPA.
F11|Trade Patterns and the Ecological Footprint - a theory-based Empirical Approach|"With global specialization and trade, countries make directly but also indirectly use of the environment via traded goods. Based on the theory of comparative advantages, the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek approach, we are using the Ecological Footprint as a broad measure of environmental use because its methodology explicitly accounts for the environmental use embodied in the traded goods. The comparative advantages depend on the endowment of environment as well as on the stringency of environmental policy which regulate the access to these factors. We empirically analyse the determinants of the ecological side of the trade pattern, i.e. whether the net export of the Ecological Footprint, embodied in the traded goods, depends on the comparative advantages as predicted by the theory, but also on a couple of control variables. A special focus is put on the role of environmental policy stringency which links our analysis to the ""Pollution Haven"" hypothesis. We also briefly analyse the role of FDI flows for the emergence of the ecological specialization pattern of production and trade."
F11|Public infrastructure for production and international trade in a small open economy: a dynamic analysis|Abstract This paper develops a dynamic trade model with a stock of public infrastructure, which has a property of “unpaid factor of production”. We show that a country with a smaller (larger) labor endowment tends to become an exporter of a good whose productivity is more (less) sensitive to the stock of public infrastructure. We also show that after the opening of trade, the labor-scarce country becomes unambiguously better off but the labor-abundant country may become worse off. Overall, these results contrasts with those obtained in the case of public intermediate goods with a “creation of atmosphere” property.
F11|Convergence and Overtaking in a Dynamic two Country Model|Abstract In two-sector infinite-horizon trade models with factor–price-equalization, convergence of aggregate capital-labor ratios and incomes does not occur because the Euler equations imply equal growth rate of consumption in all economies. In a two-country dynamic specific factors model, we show that factor–price-equalization occurs only in the long run. Per capita incomes and consumptions do not necessarily converge. These depend on the endowments of the primary factors. Depending on these endowments, an initially poorer economy may end up as the richer economy in the steady state, overtaking the initially richer one.
F11|It's a jungle out there: International trade when bargaining power matters|Anti-globalisation protesters often claim that the gains from trade accrue primarily to large countries. This contradicts conventional trade models, which predict that small countries gain more from trade than do large countries. We first present evidence which shows that the terms of trade do indeed move in favour of countries which become larger. We then develop a model of international trade based on Ricardian comparative advantage, in which the terms of trade are derived based on the bargaining power of the two trading partners. If bargaining power depends on country size, the terms of trade will be in the larger countryâ€™s favour. However, general equilibrium adjustments mean that the larger country may not be better off under Nash bargaining than under free trade. The smaller country is unambiguously worse off compared to free trade.
F11|Sensitive Sectors in Free Trade Agreements|"This paper documents the presence of ""sensitive sectors"" in Free Trade Agreements, defined as sectors for which the within-FTA tariffs remain positive. The paper includes some brief theoretical discussion of the welfare implications of these, but the main emphasis is on reporting two measures of this phenomenon for countries in FTAs that entered into force between 1994 and 2003. One measure is the percentage of tariff lines that remain dutiable, and the second is the change, from before the FTA to after, in the average maximum (across 6-digit products) positive tariffs. Both measures are derived from data in the UNCTAD TRAINS database, and are then related to measures of country characteristics that might explain them. Low per capita GDP countries tend to have larger fractions of dutiable tariff lines, while higher income countries tend to post larger increases in average maximum positive tariffs. Both suggest that the favored treatment of sensitive sectors is undermining the potential gains from trade that FTAs could provide."
F11|Comparative Advantage in Digital Trade|Digital trade takes a variety of forms, several of which are examined here with regard to whether they can be explained by comparative advantage. The five forms of digital trade considered are 1) physical products that are advertised, ordered, and/or paid for digitally, but transported by normal trade means; 2) digital products (music, movies, books, software) that are transmitted to purchasers via the internet and are most likely to be marketed and paid for via that as well; 3) services that are provided remotely by digital means; 4) data storage and computer applications accessible in the ÒcloudÓ; and 5) web platforms that serve an international audience and are supported by advertising. I argue that the first three of these can be well explained by comparative advantage, but there are problems with the last two.
F11|The EAGLE model for Hungary - a global perspective|In this paper we adopt the Hungarian version of the EAGLE (Euro Area GLobal Economy) model. The version of the EAGLE model used in this paper allows for the high import content of export a typical feature of small open economies such as Hungary. We study the effects of four globally important shocks on Hungary: i) a slowdown of the Chinese economy, ii) more restrictive US monetary policy, iii) a reduction in oil prices, and iv) more protectionist US trade policy. We found these policies to have non-negligible indirect e/ects (beyond the relatively small direct ones) on Hungary mostly due to the workings of the shock to the eurozone which is our main trade partner.
F11|What is the Price of Tea in China? Towards the Relative Cost of Living in Chinese and U.S. Cities|We examine the price and variety of products at the barcode level in cities within China and the United States. In both countries, there is a greater variety of products in larger cities. But in China, unlike the United States, the prices of products tend to be lower in larger cities. We attribute the lower prices to a pro-competitive effect, whereby large cities attract more firms which leads to lower markups and prices. Combining the effect of greater variety and lower prices, it follows that the cost of living for grocery-store products in China is lower in larger cities. We further compare the cost-of-living indexes for particular product categories between China and the United States. In product categories with a significant presence of U.S. brands in the Chinese market, the availability of additional Chinese brands leads to greater variety than in the United States, and therefore lower Chinese price indexes for that reason. In product categories with much less presence of U.S. brands in the Chinese market, however, the observed prices differences between the countries (usually lower prices in China) are partially or fully offset by the variety differences (less variety in China), so that the cost of living in China is not as low as the price differences suggest, especially in smaller cities.
F11|The Lerner Symmetry Theorem: Generalizations and Qualifications|The Lerner Symmetry Theorem (Lerner, 1936) establishes the equivalence between import tariffs and export taxes in a simple neoclassical economy with two countries, two final goods, and no trade costs. In this paper we provide a number of generalizations and qualifications of this well-known result. Among other things, we show that the absence of trade deficits is neither necessary nor sufficient for Lerner Symmetry to hold. We conclude by discussing its implications for border tax adjustments.
F11|On the Geography of Global Value Chains|This paper studies the optimal location of production for the different stages in a sequential global value chain. We develop a general-equilibrium model featuring a proximity-concentration tradeoff: slicing global value chains across countries allows to better exploit agglomeration economies, but such fragmentation comes at the cost of increased transportation costs. We show that, other things equal, it is optimal to locate relatively downstream stages of production in relatively central or well-connected locations, while upstream stages of production are optimally assigned to more remote locations. We illustrate this result by working out the optimal location of production for a few basic topologies featuring a low number of countries and stages. Exact solutions to the problem for a larger number of countries and stages are computationally complex, but can be obtained using combinatorial optimization tools. We apply the model to study the optimal specialization within chains in eleven countries in Factory Asia.
F11|Endowments, Skill-Biased Technology, and Factor Prices: A Unified Approach to Trade|We develop a multi-factor, multi-sector Eaton-Kortum model in order to examine the impact of trade costs, factor endowments, and technology (both Ricardian and factor-augmenting) on factor prices, trade in goods, and trade in the services of primary factors (value-added trade). This framework nests the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) model and the Vanek factor content of trade prediction. We take the model to the data using skilled and unskilled data for 38 countries. We have two findings. First, the key determinants of international variation in the factor content of trade are endowments and international variation in factor inputs used per dollar of output. Input-usage variation in turn is driven by (1) factor-augmenting international technology differences and (2) international factor price differences. Second, our estimates of factor-augmenting international technology differences — which imply cross-country variation in skill-biased technologies — are empirically similar to those used to rationalize cross-country evidence on income differences and directed technical change.
F11|Export performance and potential with regional partners: The case of a landlocked LDC, Nepal|"This paper assesses export performance and potentials for increased bilateral trade with regional partners of Nepal, a least-developed country (LDC) in South Asia. Following an overview of the country's export performance, and the distinct policy and logistical challenges it faces as a landlocked country, an econometric analysis of the determinants of bilateral exports is undertaken using the gravity modelling framework. The results suggest that the 'structural' factors such supply-side constraints, distance to markets, and cultural proximity as geographical and cultural proximity have mattered more than trade and other policy barriers imposed by destination markets. The paper also identifies partners to which Nepal appears to be ""under-exporting,"" and concludes that there is much room for the country to integrate further with regional markets if it were to overcome its supply side constraints."
F11|Preferential Trade Agreements and Rules of the Multilateral Trading System|In a three-country model of endogenous trade agreements, we study the effects of major WTO rules governing the conduct of free trade agreements (FTAs). We show that FTA members retain positive internal tariffs even if they seek to maximize their joint welfare. Requiring FTAs to eliminate internal tariffs â€” as stipulated by current WTO rules â€” makes the non-member better oÂ§ although it simultaneously reduces the likelihood of achieving global free trade by encouraging free-riding on its part. While the WTOâ€™s non-discrimination constraint is not necessarily conducive to reaching global free trade, it raises welfare in a tariff-ridden world.
F11|Appraisal of Trade Potency on Economic Growth in Sudan: New Empirical and Policy Analysis|This paper investigates the relationship between domestic investment, exports, imports, and economic growth in Sudan. In order to achieve this purpose, annual data were collected from the reports of World Bank for the periods between 1976 and 2015, was tested by using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillip-Perron (PP) stationary test, co integration analysis of Vector Error Correction Model and the Granger-Causality tests.? According to the result of the analysis, unit root tests show that economic growth, domestic investment, exports and imports series become stationary when first difference is considered. Also, it was determined by using co integration analysis that there is relationship between the four variables in Sudan. Also, and according to the Vector Error Correction Model, there is no relationship between variables in the long run term. On the other hand, and according to the Granger-Causality tests, we defined that in the short run term, only economic growth cause domestic investment. These results provide evidence that Reforms and measures in economic strategies are still insufficient to make trade and domestic investment able to boost the Sudan?s economy.
F11|The Long Run and Short Run Impacts of Exports on Economic Growth: Evidence from Gabon|This study investigates the impact of exports on economic growth in Gabon using annual time series data for the period 1980 - 2015 by implementing cointegration analysis and error correction model. The empirical results show that in the long run, investment and exports affect negatively on economic growth. However, in short run investment and export cause economic growth. These results provide evidence that investment and exports are necessary in Gabon's economy and are presented as an engine of growth since they cause economic growth in the short term. But they are not carried out and treated with a solid and fair manner, which offer new insights into Gabon’s openness policy for promoting economic growth.
F11|The Impact of Vegetables Exports on Economic Growth in Tunisia|The aim of this paper is to investigate the long run term and the short run term impacts of vegetables exports on economic growth of Tunisia. In order, to achieve this purpose, annual data were collected from the reports of World Bank for the periods between 1970 and 2015, was tested by using Correlation Analysis, Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillip-Perron (PP) stationary test, co integration analysis of Vector Error Correction Model. According to the result of the analysis, vegetables exports have a positive effect on economic growth in the long run term and in the short run term. These results provide on evidence that vegetables exports, thus, are seen as source of economic growth in Tunisia. For this reason, it is very important to refine investment in this sector.
F11|Why is South Africa Still a Developing Country?|Despite the abundance of goods and natural resources that characterize South Africa, and despite the remarkable progress in the field of industry and manufacturing, it is still in the list of developing countries. The aim of this article is to re-examine the causes of this node by studying the basic pillars for the creation of solid economic growth as is the case for all developing countries by looking at the impact of domestic investment, exports and imports on South Africa's economic growth in the short and long term. Our empirical analyses show that imports present the main barrier of prosperity and progress in South Africa.
F11|The Three-Way Linkages Between Export, Import And Economic Growth: New Evidence From Tunisia|This study investigates the nexus between exports, imports and economic growth in Tunisia using annual time series data for the period 1965 - 2016 by implementing cointegration analysis and vector error correction model. The empirical results show that in the long run (i) exports affect negatively on economic growth, (ii) imports have positive effect on economic growth, (iii) economic growth have positive effect on exports, and imports have positive effect on exports. However in the short run empirical results show that there is (i) bi-directional causal relationship between exports and economic growth, (ii) uni-directional causal relationship from exports to imports, (iii) uni-directional causal relationship from imports to economic growth. These results provide evidence that imports and exports are necessary in Tunisia's economy and are presented as an engine of growth since they cause economic growth in the short term. But exports are not carried out and treated with a solid and fair manner according to their negative effect on economic growth in the long run, which offer new insights into Tunisia’s openness policy for promoting economic growth.
F11|The Impact Of Citrus Exports On Economic Growth: Empirical Analysis From Tunisia| The contribution of this paper is to investigate the impact of citrus exports on the economic growth on Tunisia since it never been treated before. In order to achieve this purpose, annual data were collected from the reports of Tunisian Central Bank for the periods between 1970 and 2016 was tested by using co integration analysis of Error Correction Model. According to the result of the analysis, citrus exports do not influence on economic growth in the long term. However, empirical results show that there is a positive unidirectional causality from citrus exports to economic growth in the short run. These results provide evidence that citrus exports, thus, are not seen as source of economic growth in Tunisia because the miserable economic strategy. For this reason, it is very important to make new reforms and to create robustness strategies to refine investment and trade strategy in this sector, so it can support economic growth in Tunisia.
F11|The Impact of Olive Oil Exports on Economic Growth: Empirical Analysis from Tunisia|The contribution of this paper is investigating the influence of olive oil exports on Tunisian economic growth since it's never been treated before. With a view to fulfill this aim, annual data were compiled from the reports of Tunisian Central Bank for the periods between 1970 and 2016, was put to the proof by using Co integration analysis of Error Correction Model. According to the outcome of the analysis, olive oil exports have a positive incidence of economic growth in the long term and in the short run. These results appear that olive oil exports are a provenance of economic growth in Tunisia and emphasize the application of policies and strategies to encourage better exploitation in this strip.
F11|Implications of multilateral tariff bindings on the formation of preferential trade agreements and quest for global free trade|Using an endogenous preferential trade agreement (PTA) formation model under all possible multilaterally negotiated bound tariff rates, we examine the effects of multilateral trade liberalization on the role of PTAs in achieving global free trade. We first show that, when countries are completely symmetric, no country has an incentive to unilaterally deviate (free ride) from free trade network while exclusion incentives arise when bound tariffs are sufficiently low. Due to the relatively flexible nature of the FTA formation, such exclusion incentives go unexercised and free trade always obtains as the coalition-proof Nash equilibrium (CPNE) of the FTA game. However, such flexibility does not exist under the CU game and thus countries are able to exercise the exclusion incentive and free trade fails to be CPNE when the bound tariff rates are sufficiently low. We then consider a scenario where countries are asymmetric with respect to their comparative advantage. The country with a weaker comparative advantage has an incentive to free ride on trade liberalization of the other two countries and lower bound tariff rates disciplines this incentive via limiting the ability to set optimal tariffs. As a result, multilateral free trade is more likely to be a CPNE as the multilateral negotiated bound tariff rates decline. This result provides support for the idea that multilateral trade liberalization acts as a complement to the FTA formation in achieving global free trade.
F11|International transmission of financial shocks without financial integration|In a two-country model of Ricardian trade with a continuum of goods and financial frictions, it is shown that a credit crunch in a country can trigger a synchronized economic downturn even in the absence of international financial transactions.
F11|The Effect Of Agricultural Exports On Economic Growth In South-Eastern Europe: An Empirical Investigation Using Panel Data|The contribution of this paper is investigating the effect of agricultural exports on economic growth in South Eastern Europe Countries since it’s never been treated before. To attempt this aim annual data was collected from the World Bank for the period 2006 – 2016 and was tested by using correlation analysis and the static gravity model. Empirical analyses show that agricultural exports have a positive strong correlation with gross domestic product and have a positive effect on economic growth. These results appear that agricultural exports are a provenance of economic growth in South Eastern Europe Countries. For this reason, it is very important to refine investment in agricultural sector, and create more effective agricultural trade openness policies.
F11|Liberalization and Welfare Conditions of a Developing Economy: A General Equilibrium Analysis|The paper attempts to analyze the impact of trade liberalization policy, in terms of FDI, on the level of informal competitive wage rate as well as on the size of the informal sectors of a developing economy with dualistic economic structure in a general equilibrium framework. The wage rate earned by the informal workers has been considered here as a proxy for their living standard. In this paper it is found that FDI raises the level of wage rate of the informal workers and consequently raises their standard of living. It is also found in this paper that FDI expands both formal and informal manufacturing sectors in the urban areas whereas it contracts the rural agricultural informal sector. In this structure an attempt has also been made to analyze the effects on the welfare level of the economy for a drive towards liberalization through FDI by assuming Sen (1974) type social welfare function which considers inequality in income distribution.
F11|Economic Liberalization and urban unemployment in the presence of informal sector|In this paper, we construct a three sector general equilibrium model of a small open economy with informal sector. The paper examines the impact of less protectionist policy on the output levels, factor prices, and the level of urban employment. Here, it has been shown that the urban unemployment rate has been lowered with the contraction of import competing manufacturing sector consequent upon a reduction in tariff. The informal intermediate sector has contracted as well. It is further shown here that there is a possibility of expansion of exportable agricultural sector with increased wage rate. The paper is then extended to introduce foreign capital inflow and examine on the output effects and the level of unemployment. Interestingly, in the extended model urban unemployment is aggravated due to an inflow of foreign capital.
F11|An Analysis of Impact of Exchange Rate Volatility on the Indian Manufacturing Exports|This paper analyses the impact of real exchange rate volatility of Indian on bilateral exports of India’s manufactured commodities. Four major commodities viz Engineering goods, Cotton yarn, fabrics made ups, etc., Chemicals & allied products, and Leather & manufactures, for the period 1999 to 2013. Five major trading partners of India i.e., USA, UK, Germany, Italy, and Hong-Kong are chosen for the panel data analysis. Result shows the statistically insignificant impact of exchange rate volatility on the exports of all commodities except for Chemicals and Allied product. Real GDP found to be positive and significant for all commodities. The real exchange rate has no significance in explaining exports of these commodities. The results support forex market efficiency with regard to exports.
F11|Trade, Inequality and Distribution-Neutral Fiscal Policy- An Elementary Framework|Theoretical discussion on compensating mechanisms involving the Pareto criterion that address inequality rather than absolute welfare is non-existent in trade literature. In a simple HOS model we consider taxtransfer policies that keep the pre-trade degree of inequality unchanged between skilled and unskilled workers rather than the absolute income of the losing group. We discuss the problem of existence of such an inequality-neutral tax rate which generates a positive increment in the after tax skilled wage and unskilled wage. Such a mechanism exists and is independent of whether the tax is progressive or proportional. Thus the compensating mechanism that is available in this standard model is stronger than the conventional Pareto criterion.
F11|Quantitative Trade Models: Developments and Challenges|Applied general equilibrium (AGE) models, which feature multiple countries, multiple industries, and input–output linkages across industries, have been the dominant tool for evaluating the impact of trade reforms since the 1980s. We review how these models are used to perform policy analysis and document their shortcomings in predicting the industry-level effects of past trade reforms. We argue that, to improve their performance, AGE models need to incorporate product-level data on bilateral trade relations by industry and better model how trade reforms lower bilateral trade costs. We use the least-traded-products methodology of Kehoe et al. (2015) to provide guidance on how improvements can be made. We provide further suggestions on how AGE models can incorporate recent advances in quantitative trade theory to improve their predictive ability and better quantify the gains from trade liberalization.
F11|Gravity, distance, and international trade|The authors review and interpret the main theoretical developments in the gravity literature from its very early, a-theoretical applications to the latest structural contributions. They also discuss challenges and implement methods to estimate empirical gravity equations. They finish with a presentation and examples of numerical simulations with the structural gravity model. Throughout the analysis they attempt to emphasize the links and importance of transportation costs for the trade literature, and outline avenues where they believe interdisciplinary contributions between the international trade and transportation economics fields will be most valuable.
F11|Preferential Trade Agreements and Rules of the Multilateral Trading System|Preferential trade agreement (PTA) members have to eliminate internal tariffs with each other but are allowed to discriminate against non-members. This can be in potential conflict with the WTO's overall non-discrimination clause. Using a competing exporters model of endogenous trade agreement formation, we study the central rules that govern PTAs. We find that the free trade agreements' (FTAs) requirement to eliminate internal tariffs increases total welfare when circumstances are such that global free trade is infeasible. However, it also reduces the likelihood of reaching global free trade. We also find that the MFN constraint does not just contribute to the achievement of global free trade but also delivers a welfare-superior outcome when global free trade is not possible. Finally, we show that the MFN constraint complements the PTA rules in achieving global free trade for only FTAs but not customs unions (CUs). However, when global free trade is infeasible, the MFN constraint is welfare improving for both types of PTAs. We conclude that while the likelihood of global free trade within the WTO requirements depends on the nature of PTAs, these requirements are necessarily welfare improving in a tariff-ridden world.
F11|Implications of multilateral tariff bindings on the formation of preferential trade agreements and quest for global free trade|Using an endogenous preferential trade agreement (PTA) formation model under all possible multilaterally negotiated bound tariff rates, we examine the effects of multilateral trade liberalization on the role of PTAs in achieving global free trade. We first show that, when countries are completely symmetric, no country has an incentive to unilaterally deviate (free ride) from free trade network while exclusion incentives arise when bound tariffs are sufficiently low. Due to the relatively flexible nature of the FTA formation, such exclusion incentives go unexercised and free trade always obtains as the coalition-proof Nash equilibrium (CPNE) of the FTA game. However, such flexibility does not exist under the CU game and thus countries are able to exercise the exclusion incentive and free trade fails to be CPNE when the bound tariff rates are sufficiently low. We then consider a scenario where countries are asymmetric with respect to their comparative advantage. The country with a weaker comparative advantage has an incentive to free ride on trade liberalization of the other two countries and lower bound tariff rates disciplines this incentive via limiting the ability to set optimal tariffs. As a result, multilateral free trade is more likely to be a CPNE as the multilateral negotiated bound tariff rates decline. This result provides support for the idea that multilateral trade liberalization acts as a complement to the FTA formation in achieving global free trade.
F11|A Gravity-Based Revealed Comparative Advantage Estimator|I propose a method of moments estimator of revealed comparative advantage based on a flexible specification of trade flows that is consistent with a large class of gravity models of international trade. I show that this estimator has many desirable properties. It is theoretically consistent with the classical notion of Ricardian comparative advantage and is easily computed, even for very large samples. Statistical inference is straightforward, and it is closely related to a commonly-used estimator in the gravity literature that is known to be robust to various forms of heteroskedasticity and measurement error common to trade data.
F11|On the Factor Content of Trade|Theories of international trade have severe difficulties in explaining why, despite i) substantial differences in factor-proportions across industries and ii) considerable cross-country differences in capital-labor ratios, the iii) capital intensity of U.S imports does not vary systematically across countries. We propose a simple explanation: standard trade theories treat the distribution of productivity across industries as exogenous. In a standard macroeconomic model we show that endogenizing this driving force eradicates the gains from factor-proportions trade and can thus reconcile the three aforementioned stylized facts.
F11|On the Interaction of Growth, Trade and International Macroeconomics|Standard economic theories have severe difficulties in simultaneously explaining a number of key aggregate empirical facts: i) there are substantial differences in capital-labor ratios across time ii) despite continuously increasing capital-labor ratios, both factors still earn non-negligible shares in income iii) labor hours per capita are rather stable amid expanding consumption possibilities iv) price levels are higher in more developed countries v) there are no large gains from factor-proportions trade vi) the world trade-to-output ratio increases over time. I argue that standard economic theories ignore the vast improvements in goods quality and new products. I present an augmented standard model that incorporates these features and jointly rationalizes these six empirical facts.
F11|The Heckscher–Ohlin model with monopolistic competition and general preferences|I extend the neoclassical 2×2×2 trade model to general preferences over a variety of goods supplied under monopolistic competition in a sector while the other sector is perfectly competitive. Non-homothetic preferences deliver pricing to market, incomplete pass-through and market size effects. Under realistic conditions, the differentiated goods are sold at a higher price in the capital-abundant country.
F11|Heterogeneous Technology Diffusion and Ricardian Trade Patterns|Migration and trade are often linked through ethnic networks boosting bilateral trade. This study uses migration to quantify the importance of Ricardian technology differences for international trade. The framework provides the first panel estimates connecting country-industry productivity and exports, and the study exploits heterogeneous technology diffusion from immigrant communities in the United States for identification. The latter instruments are developed by combining panel variation on the development of new technologies across US cities with historical settlement patterns for migrants from countries. The instrumented elasticity of export growth on the intensive margin with respect to the exporter’s productivity growth is between 1.6 and 2.4, depending upon weighting. This provides an important contribution to the trade literature of Ricardian advantages, and it establishes a connection of migration to home country exports beyond bilateral networks.
F11|Ricardo's Numerical Example Versus Ricardian Trade Model: a Comparison of Two Distinct Notions of Comparative Advantage|The so-called Ricardian trade model of contemporary economic textbooks is not a rational reconstruction of Ricardo's famous numerical example in chapter seven of the Principles. It differs from the latter in terms of the definition of the four numbers, relevant cost comparison, rule for specialisation, assumptions and theoretical implications. Thus, the widespread critique regarding the unrealistic assumptions of the textbook trade model does not apply to Ricardo's original proof of comparative advantage.
F11|Exchange rate implications of Border Tax Adjustment neutrality|This paper investigates the implications for the nominal exchange rate of a Border Tax Adjustment (BTA) when there is BTA neutrality. A border tax adjustment is a change from an origin-based system of taxation, that taxes exports but exempts imports to a destination-based system that taxes imports but exempts exports. Both indirect taxes (e.g. a VAT) and direct taxes (e.g. a cash-flow corporate profit tax) can be subject to a BTA. In the US, a BTA for the corporate profit tax is under discussion. There is BTA neutrality when the real equilibrium, including measures of profitability and competitiveness, of an open economy is unchanged when it moves from an origin-based to a destination-based tax. The conventional wisdom on the exchange rate implications of a neutral BTA is that the currency of the country implementing the BTA will strengthen (appreciate) by a percentage equal to the VAT or CPT tax rate. The main insight of this note is that this 'appreciation presumption' is not robust, even when all conditions for full BTA neutrality are satisfied. Indeed, plausible alternative assumptions about constancy (or stickiness) of nominal prices support a weakening (depreciation) of the currency by the same percentage as the tax rate. On the basis on the very patchy available empirical information, it is not possible to take a view with any degree of confidence on the implications of a BTA for the nominal exchange rate, even if full BTA neutrality prevailed. Whether BTA neutrality itself is a feature of the real world is also a disputed empirical issue. Therefore, buyer (or seller) beware.
F11|The dynamic and distributional aspects of import tariffs|We use a dynamic trade model with two sectors and two types of workers to analyze the optimal setting of income-generating tariffs. This approach allows us to take account of adjustment dynamics, distributional aspects and the time horizon of policy makers and workers. In response to a unilateral increase in tariffs aggregate consumption increases only sluggishly so that policy makers with a short time horizon tend to set lower tariffs. Workers' preferences for tariffs depend on the sector where they are employed as well as their skill class, with the relative weight of both aspects determined by the time horizon of the workers. Unskilled workers in the unskilledintensive sector are the ones most in favor of protectionism and might even benefit from a trade war.
F11|Offshoring, industry heterogeneity and employment|"Economies and production systems are subject to incessant processes of structural change fuelled by the dynamics of demand, technology and international competition. The increasing international fragmentation of production, also known as ""offshoring"", is an important element of such a (global in scale) process of structural change having important implications for employment and on the way employment gains and losses are distributed across firms, industries, national economies and components of the labour force. This paper assesses the employment impact of offshoring, in five European countries (Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom), distinguishing between different types of inputs/tasks offshored, different types of offshoring industries and types of professional groups affected by offshoring. Results provide a rather heterogeneous picture of both offshoring patterns and their effects on labour, and the presence of significant differences across industries. Along with this variety of employment outcomes, the empirical evidence suggests that offshoring activities are mainly driven by a cost reduction (labour saving) rationale. This is particularly the case for the manufacturing industry where offshoring is found to exert a negative impact among the less qualified (manual) or more routinized (clerks) types of jobs, while the main difference between high- and low-technology industries has to do with the type of labour tasks that are offshored and the types of domestic jobs that are affected. In hightech industries the negative effects of offshoring on employment are concentrated among the most qualified professional groups (managers and clerks). A specular pattern is found in the case of the low-tech industries where job losses are associated to the offshoring of the least innovative stages of production and manual workers are those most penalised."
F11|The welfare effects of a partial tariff reduction under domestic distortion in Japan|We examine a partial tariff reduction policy in a speci c factor model with two import-competing sectors. When one of them enjoys a higher tariff and is also subject to a production subsidy, will a tariff reduction in the other import-competing sector be welfare improving? We argue that this second-best type question is highly relevant to Japan, and calibrate our model to its 2013 economy. We nd that the policy is undesirable and that even a complete subsidy removal is insufficient to make it desirable. Making it welfare improving requires the other sector's tariff be more than halved.
F11|Nonparametric Counterfactual Predictions in Neoclassical Models of International Trade|We develop a methodology to construct nonparametric counterfactual predictions, free of functional form restrictions on preferences and technology, in neoclassical models of international trade. First, we establish the equivalence between such models and reduced exchange models in which countries directly exchange factor services. This equivalence implies that, for an arbitrary change in trade costs, counterfactual changes in the factor content of trade, factor prices, and welfare only depend on the shape of a reduced factor demand system. Second, we provide sufficient conditions under which estimates of this system can be recovered nonparametrically. Together, these results offer a strict generalization of the parametric approach used in so-called gravity models. Finally, we use China's recent integration into the world economy to illustrate the feasibility and potential benefits of our approach.
F11|Bargaining over Entry with a Compulsory License Deadline: Price Spillovers and Surplus Expansion|We analyze bargaining between a developing country (South) and a multinational firm over the local price of its patented product. We use an alternating offers bargaining game in which the South can resort to compulsory licensing (CL) if the two parties fail to reach agreement by a certain deadline. The presence of international price spillovers introduces two novel features into the standard bargaining problem: the surplus from entry prior to the CL deadline may be negative, and CL can yield higher surplus than entry. We establish conditions under which equilibrium may exhibit immediate entry, preemptive entry just prior to the CL deadline, or the occurrence of CL. The South necessarily gains from the threat of CL if the joint payoff under entry is higher relative to CL but can lose if it is lower.
F11|Determinants of the Exports of Hungary: Trade Theory and the Gravity Model|The end of the Communist regime brought about great changes in the economies of Central and Eastern Europe; the restructuring of foreign trade was one of the biggest challenges for these countries. After the transition period, Hungary became a very open country, with its trade to GDP ratio around 1.5, while trading with more than 190 countries. The aim of this paper is to analyse the determinants of exports between 1993–2014, with an emphasis on the impact of factor endowments. According to our results, economic size, common border, and free trade agreements had a statistically significant positive effect on exports, while the coefficient of distance had the expected negative sign. We measured factor endowments with several approaches and our results show that exports change in line with the Linder hypothesis, i.e. Hungary tends to trade more with countries having similar factor endowments, and thus its trade is based on differentiated products.
F11|Comment on Suzuki’s rebuttal of Batra and Casas|Batra and Casas (1976) claimed that ‘a strong Rybczynski result’ arises in the three-factor two-good general equilibrium trade model. In subsequent comments, Suzuki (1983) contended that this could not be the case. Among his comments, Suzuki found that the set of three equations holds for the Allen-partial elasticity of substitution under the assumption of perfect complementarity, and he applied these to his analysis. In the following, I demonstrate that these are impossible, hence his dissenting proof is not plausible.
F11|Vertical Specialization and Gains from Trade|"Multi-stage production is widely recognized as an important feature of the modern global economy. This feature has been incorporated into many state-of-the-art quantitative trade models, and has been shown to deliver significant additional gains from international trade. Meanwhile, specialization across stages of production, or “vertical specialization,"" has been largely ignored in these models. In this paper, I provide evidence that vertical specialization is a salient feature in the international trade data, which implies that the assumption made in standard models is inaccurate. I then develop a model with multi-stage production where country-level productivity differences provide a basis for vertical specialization and additional global gains from trade beyond those currently accounted for in standard models. I quantify the gains from vertical specialization according to the model. Despite the importance of vertical specialization in the data, I find that the average gains from trade are only slightly higher than the gains suggested by standard models with multi-stage production. Moreover, much of the impact of across-stage specialization is largely offset by across-sector intermediate input linkages. These results suggest that vertical specialization is not the source of missing gains from trade that have recently confounded trade economists."
F11|Firm Size and the Intensive Margin of Import Demand|We use French microdata to test an ubiquitous property of firm-based models of importing. When firm efficiency is factor neutral and input prices and qualities are common across firms, firm size should have no effect on expenditure shares on the different products and varieties sourced, holding the extensive margin constant. We show that this property is not supported by the data. Holding the sourcing strategy fixed, we find that larger firms (i) have lower import shares, (ii) concentrate their import spending on their top varieties and (iii) pay higher prices for their imported inputs. Our findings imply that input trade, through the intensive margin, is less beneficial for larger firms. Our results are consistent with a complementarity between firm productivity and input quality.
F11|Do Multinationals Transfer Culture? Evidence on Female Employment in China|We study the global diffusion of culture through multinationals, focusing on gender norms. Using data on manufacturing firms in China over 2004-2007, we find that foreign affiliates from countries with a more gender-equal culture tend to employ proportionally more women and appoint female managers. They also generate cultural spillovers, increasing domestic firms’ female labor shares in the same industry or city. Based on a multi-sector model with firm heterogeneity in productivity, gender biases, and learning, we perform counterfactual exercises. Hypothetically eliminating firms’ gender biases raises China’s aggregate total factor productivity by 5%, of which spillovers from multinationals account for 19%.
F11|Trade, Inequality and Distribution-Neutral Fiscal Policy - An Elementary Framework|Theoretical discussion on compensating mechanisms involving the Pareto criterion that address inequality rather than absolute welfare is non-existent in trade literature. In a simple HOS model we consider tax-transfer policies that keep the pre-trade degree of inequality unchanged between skilled and unskilled workers rather than the absolute income of the losing group. We discuss the problem of existence of such an inequality-neutral tax rate which generates a positive increment in the after tax skilled wage and unskilled wage. Such a mechanism exists and is independent of whether the tax is progressive or proportional. Thus the compensating mechanism that is available in this standard model is stronger than the conventional Pareto criterion.
F11|A theory of trade policy under dictatorship and democratization|This paper develops a new model of trade policy under dictatorship and democratization. The paper makes two contributions. One is to provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between political institutions and economic efficiency by studying the endogenous interaction between the form of government and trade policy. The paper's second contribution is to show how a dictatorship can manipulate trade policy to maintain its grip on power in the face of permanent world price shocks, thus opening the door to a re-examination of trade policy responses to technology shocks. The model is used to explain an interesting episode of trade policymaking between 1815 and 1846, during which time Britain substantially liberalized trade while Prussia, on the other side of the grain market, significantly increased protectionism.
F11|Firm Size and the Intensive Margin of Import Demand|We use French microdata to test an ubiquitous property of firm-based models of importing. When firm efficiency is factor neutral and input prices and qualities are common across firms, firm size should have no effect on expenditure shares on the different products and varieties sourced, holding the extensive margin constant. We show that this property is not supported by the data. Holding the sourcing strategy fixed, we find that larger firms (i) have lower import shares, (ii) concentrate their import spending on their top varieties and (iii) pay higher prices for their imported inputs. Our findings imply that input trade, through the intensive margin, is less beneficial for larger firms. Our results are consistent with a complementarity between firm productivity and input quality.
F11|Continued export trade, screening-matching and gender discrimination in employment|The screening mechanism of export trade facilitates enterprises to increase their recruitment threshold, which in turn has a biased impact on the employment of heterogeneous individuals. Incorporating export trade, screening-matching and gender discrimination in employment into a unified analysis and applying propensity score matching estimation on the basis of the theoretical framework of micro-enterprise and the optimized behavior of job seekers, this paper examines the relations between export trade of industrial enterprises and female labor employment levels in China during 2005–2007. The results indicate that: (1) the number and ration of female employees are increasing with the size and growth of the enterprise export, regardless of enterprise exports continuity. It demonstrates that export expansion does play a critical role in mitigating gender discrimination in employment. (2) For the enterprise with higher export continuity, there is a significant effect toward improving the number and proportion of female employees, conversely the worse effect. Thus, it is significantly meaningful to mitigate gender discrimination in employment by ensuring the continued export capacity of enterprises. (3) Comparing to the promoting effect of growth in the number of female employees, export has limit effect up on increasing the proportion of female employees. Therefore, it is rather difficult to resolve the issue of gender discrimination in employment by relying completely on exports expansion. Based on research findings, this paper discusses the policy implications in terms of easing gender discrimination in employment and promoting employment equity.
F11|Indivisibilities in the Ricardian model of trade|The idea that goods or factors of production may not be perfectly divisible has important implications for many areas of economics. This paper introduces both types of indivisibilities into the standard Ricardian model of international trade. Indivisibilities give rise to new results compared to the standard model with perfectly divisible goods and factors of production. Both types of indivisibility may result in complete specialisation even in autarky, while goods indivisibility may result in (ex ante) identical consumers consuming different bundles of goods, and hence enjoying different levels of welfare. Both types of indivisibilities lead to efficiency losses relative to the perfectly divisible case. International trade may eliminate efficiency losses resulting from indivisibility in the factors of production, but not those resulting from goods indivisibility. This suggests that the presence of indivisibilities leads to a second-best world, with the consequent implications for policy. The results of the paper are consistent with existing empirical evidence.
F11|Intra-national home bias: New evidence from the United States commodity flow survey|This paper estimates the US intra-national home bias in trade using Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood methodology to complement and extend Wolf’s (2000) work. We use Wolf’s data from the 1993 Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) and add the 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012 waves. We claim that Wolf’s home bias magnitude is overestimated due to the log-linearization of the gravity equation and the control for distance used in the cross-sectional study. Our results with panel data and latest econometric estimators show that the levels of US States home bias are in between 50% and 60% lower than in Wolf’s. However, since 2002 the home bias has experienced substantial growth, which suggests that the US market is less commercially integrated in 2012 than in 1993.
F11|Balanced-budget income taxes and aggregate stability in a small open economy|In a closed economy, a balanced-budget fiscal policy rule with endogenous income tax rates can generate aggregate instability due to self-fulfilling expectations (e.g., Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 1997). This paper shows, both analytically and numerically, that beliefs-driven aggregate instability associated with such a balanced-budget rule is less of a problem in a small open economy integrated in the world asset and goods markets. This is because cross-border capital flows and endogenous international price adjustments produce income effects that reduce the likelihood of sunspot equilibria. From a policy perspective, our results relieve possible concerns that balanced-budget rules and reliance on income taxes to achieve budget objective could have destabilizing effects on the economy.
F11|Trade, Domestic Frictions, and Scale Effects|Because of scale effects, idea-based growth models imply that larger countries should be much richer than smaller ones. New trade models share the same counterfactual feature. In fact, new trade models exhibit other counterfactual implications associated with scale effects: import shares decrease and relative income levels increase too steeply with country size. We argue that these implications are largely a result of the standard assumption that countries are fully integrated domestically. We depart from this assumption by treating countries as collections of regions that face positive costs to trade among themselves. The resulting model is largely consistent with the data.
F11|A Balls-and-Bins Model of Trade: Comment|We show that the Armenter and Koren model's firm-product-country results rely on the assumption that export shipment size is independent of firm size, and this assumption is contradicted by the data. When actual shipment sizes are used in the balls-and-bins model, it cannot reproduce the data on single product/single country exporters. Beyond just showing that the shipment size assumption matters to balls-and-bins outcomes, our results highlight the important fact that shipment size is an economic decision, co-determined with other export choices. For this reason, we argue that a balls-and-bins model cannot be a purely statistical benchmark model. (JEL F11, F14, O13, O19, Q37)
F11|A Balls-and-Bins Model of Trade: Reply|Blum, Claro, and Horstmann (2016) make two statements about the balls-and-bins model of Armenter and Koren (2014). First, that using firm-level shipment data changes some of our results. Second, that the balls-and-bins model is not an appropriate statistical method. We respond to the first statement and argue that the second statement is unfounded and unrelated to the first. Indeed, the work of Blum, Claro, and Horstmann (2016) is a perfect example of how to use balls-and-bins in a rich dataset to spot interesting data patterns. (JEL F11, F14)
F11|Internal Geography, International Trade, and Regional Specialization|We introduce an internal geography to the canonical model of international trade driven by comparative advantages to study the regional effects of external economic integration. The model features a dual-economy structure, in which locations near international gates specialize in export-oriented sectors while more distant locations do not trade with the rest of the world. The theory rationalizes patterns of specialization, employment, and relative incomes observed in developing countries that opened up to trade. We find regional specialization patterns consistent with the model in industry-level data from Chinese prefectures. (JEL F11, O18, P23, P25, P33, R12, R32)
F11|Asymmetric Trade Flows and Their Implication for Competitiveness, Efficiency and Trade| The asymmetric trade flow of agricultural goods can serve as a clue to help understand unobservable agricultural competitiveness, infrastructural efficiency for exports, and net openness to imports. In order to identify these three factors from agricultural trade data, we adapt a trade model developed by Eaton and Kortum. Unlike Eaton and Kortum, we interpret specific country dummy variables as proxies representing these three factors. This study makes four important findings. First, agricultural trade flow is strongly related to net openness to imports but less to agricultural competitiveness. Second, agricultural competitiveness is more related to land endowments than economic development. Third, economic development improves infrastructural efficiency for agricultural exports. Finally, existing agricultural import restrictions are shown to be punitive.
F11|Eco-Labelling and the Gains from Agricultural and Food Trade: A Ricardian Approach| Following a modern Ricardian approach, trade in environmental products with eco‐labelling is modelled. Based on the model, expressions are derived for the share of products an importer purchases from a specific exporter for low‐cost and environmentally‐friendly technologies. It is then shown that, using bilateral trade and production data, the share equation for low‐cost‐technologies can be estimated, from which parameters describing trade costs and average productivity can then be retrieved. Using the latter parameters, it is also shown how the share equation for environmentally‐friendly technologies can then be used to retrieve a parameter describing eco‐labelling costs. The consumer and environmental gains from eco‐labelling are also analyzed, along with a discussion and comparison of the effects of mutual recognition versus harmonization of countries’ eco‐labelling regimes.
F11|Wage Inequality and Skill Supplies in a Globalised World|We investigate empirically how the relative wages of skilled and unskilled workers vary with their relative supplies in open economies. The investigation is based on a Heckscher-Ohlin model that is more general than the canonical version and related to recent advances in trade theory. Our results bridge the gap between trade economists and labour economists in views on the role of national labour markets in wage determination when countries trade. As labour economists believe, relative wages are sensitive to variation in skill supplies in open economies. As trade economists believe, however, this sensitivity decreases with openness to trade.
F11|Intra-Industry Trade in the Visegrad Countries: Does the Linder Hypothesis Hold?|In 1961, Staffan Linder attacked mainstream trade economics by diverging from the generally accepted factor endowments theory and focusing on alternative explanations of why countries trade with each other. He was among the first economists to recognise the growing importance of intra-industry trade and presented his hypothesis that the more similar the per capita income levels of countries, the more they tend to trade with each other. This observation has since become one of the main pillars of modern trade theory. The present paper assesses the empirical validity of the Linder hypothesis in the Visegrad countries. Using a variant of the gravity model, it finds that when controlling for other factors, the Visegrad countries tend to trade more with countries with similar per capita income levels than with significantly richer or poorer countries. This observation is consistent with the Linder hypothesis. OLS regressions, Tobit regressions, and robustness checks all support the hypothesis.
F11|For God's sake. The impact of religious proximity on firms' exports|"Using a rich firm level data set for Turkish manufacturing, we test whether the sharing of similar religious beliefs with potential contracting parties drives a firm.s first time entry in export markets. We exploit variation in the practice of Islam across Turkish provinces andwe find that firms located in provinces characterised by stronger religiousness are more likely to enter export destinations with a higher share ofMuslims among their population. This result is robust to the control for trade, cultural and migration ties, reverse causality and to several further sensitivity checks. Religious proximity, in particular, eases export entry for producers of ""trust intensive"" goods and mitigates the role of export experience in subsequent foreign market entries. All in all, our evidence hints at the important role of religious proximity in reducing export entry sunk costs by fostering higher trust among contracting parties."
F11|Exchange Rate, Cross Elasticities Between Exports and Imports and Current Account Sustainability: The Spanish Case|This paper presents an analytical reformulation of the traditional approach to current account sustainability. We adopt a perspective according to which the independence of GDP and exchange rates cannot be postulated in very open economies, hence, the Marshall-Lerner condition cannot be met. Therefore, we analyze four different propositions based on different cross elasticities between exports and imports. Those propositions have theoretical implications about sustainability of the current account and the external debt . We use a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DGSE) macroeconomic model to simulate the impact of variations in exchange rates, cross elasticity between imports and exports, and consumption tax rate on the Spanish economy and, particularly, on its current account sustainability.
F11|How deep is your love? A quantitative spatial analysis of the transatlantic trade partnership|This paper explores the quantitative effects of trade liberalization envisioned in a transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP) between the United States and the European Union. We use a quantitative trade model that, in contrast to other works, features consumptive and productive uses of land and we allow for labor mobility and a spatial equilibrium. Our calibration draws mainly on the world inputâ€“output database (WIOD). The eventual outcome of the negotiations is uncertain. Tariffs in E.U.â€“U.S. trade are already very low, however, so that an agreement will have a major impact only by eliminating nontariff barriers. These are extremely hard to quantify. We address these uncertainties by considering a corridor of tradeâ€ liberalization paths and by providing numerous robustness checks. Even with ambitious liberalization, real income gains within a TTIP are in the range of up to 0.46 percent for most countries. The effect on outside countries is typically negative, yet even smaller. Taking land into account scales down the welfare effects strongly. Interestingly, we find that all German counties derive unambiguous welfare gains even though the model allows for negative termsâ€ ofâ€ trade effects. Our analysis also implies that in order to arrive at the same welfare gains as under a TTIP, a multilateral liberalization would have to be much more ambitious for the U.S. than for the E.U.
F11|Producer Heterogeneity, Value-Added, and International Trade|Standard new trade models depict producers as heterogeneous in total factor productivity. In this paper, I adapt the Eaton and Kortum (2002) model of international trade to incorporate tradable intermediate goods and producer heterogeneity in value-added productivity. In equilibrium, this yields a positive relationship between the international trade elasticity and the share of intermediate goods in production. This relationship is absent from the standard model and is driven by the extensive margin of trade. I then use cross-country sectoral data from 1995 to 2010 and estimate the trade elasticity, finding empirical support for this relationship and for the importance of the extensive margin. This model yields results that are similar to those of the standard model with respect to the overall magnitude of gains from trade. Importantly, however, whereas the standard model suggests that gains from trade are higher in sectors that use intermediate goods, I find that this is no longer true under the value-added heterogeneity model.
F11|Measuring and understanding trade in service tasks|The revolution in information and communications technologies has put service tasks with strong tradability characteristics at high risk of being offshored. This article reviews studies proposing indicators of service tradability, exploring the labour market implications of service offshoring and developing theories to rationalize the facts. It suggests that both skill intensity and tradability are determinants of wage and employment effects. Nonetheless, the lack of widely accepted definitions of tradability, the absence of high‐quality data on service trade flows and the difficulty of measuring import competition at higher disaggregation levels pose difficulties in achieving further progress, pointing to areas for future research.
F11|The Gains from Input Trade with Heterogeneous Importers|Firms differ substantially in their participation in foreign input markets. We develop a methodology to measure the aggregate effects of input trade that takes such heterogeneity into account. We provide a theoretical result that holds in a variety of settings: the firm-level data on value added and domestic expenditure shares in material spending is sufficient to compute the change in consumer prices due to a shock to the import environment. We characterize the bias of approaches that rely on aggregate statistics. In an application to French data, input trade reduces the prices of manufacturing products by 27 percent.
F11|Potential Pareto-Improving Move Toward Most Favored Nation Tariffs|We use a multi-country asymmetric oligopolistic framework for segmented markets to study the welfare effects of reducing tariff discriminations - which we call a move towards Most Favored Nation tariffs. Both unilateral and multilateral reforms are considered. We investigate this issue under different scenarios such as when initial tariffs are arbitrary and when they are optimal. Conditions under which such harmonizations are potentially Paretoimproving are derived. We also analyze the effects on individual countries.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F11|Deconstructing the Gains from Trade: Selection of Industries vs Reallocation of Workers|In a Ricardian model with CES preferences and general distributions of industry efficiencies, the sources of the welfare gains from trade can be precisely decomposed into a selection and a reallocation effect. The former is the change in average efficiency due to the selection of industries that survive international competition. The latter is the rise in the weight of exporting industries in domestic production, due the reallocation of workers away from less-efficient non-exporting industries. This decomposition, which is hard to calculate in the general case, simplifies dramatically if industry efficiencies are Fréchet distributed, providing easy-to-quantify model-based measures of these two effects. Under this assumption, we also show that when the gains from trade are small, it is the selection effect that matters most; as the gains from trade rise and the size of the export sector grows, so does the importance of the reallocation effect.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F11|Migration Policy, African Population Growth and Global Inequality|According to recent UN projections more than 50 percent of the growth in world population over the next half century will be due to population growth in Africa. Given this, any policy that influences African demography will have a significant impact on the world distribution of income. In this paper we discuss the potential for migration policies to affect fertility and education decisions, and hence, population growth in Africa. We present the results from different scenarios for more or less restrictive/selective migration policies and derive their implications for the evolution of world inequality.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F11|Import Competition and Post-displacement Wages in Korea: Whom You Trade with Matters|Using longitudinal survey data from Korean workers, we examine whether the effects of import competition on post-displacement wages are heterogeneous between skilled and unskilled workers for trading partners with different endowments of (un)skilled labor. Reemployment wages of displaced workers show a decrease for skilled workers but an increase for unskilled ones when imports from an advanced country rise, whereas they decrease for unskilled workers but increase for skilled ones when imports from a developing country rise. The results provide support for the Stolper–Samuelson theorem.
F11|World-Trade Growth Accounting|We undertake a trade-growth accounting exercise by decomposing data on changes in bilateral international trade flows into their direct (endowment accumulation, productivity growth, changes in trade costs, changing preferences) and indirect components (general equilibrium effects). Furthermore, we distinguish between the (potentially partly endogenous) direct and the deep drivers of trade by extending standard new trade models to include endogenous factor accumulation, R&D driven productivity growth, and endogenous changes in expenditures shares on manufacturing goods and services. We quantify the importance of the direct and deep drivers of the growth of bilateral and multilateral trade of 67 economies over 20 consecutive years since 1988 for three trade outcomes: changes in growth rates across different country pairs, changes in levels of trade flows, and changes in trade to GDP ratio. The results suggest that changes in shocks to endogenous endowment accumulation and trade costs have been the most important drivers of trade in the sample at hand, whereas productivity growth and changes in preferences appear to have been quantitatively less important.
F11|Trade, Luxury Goods, And A Growth-Enhancing Tariff|This article presents a Ricardian model of trade with learning-by-doing to study the effect of barriers to trade in products with low growth potential on the long-run economic growth. The model shows that, when elasticity of demand for the product with a lower learning potential is greater than unity, a tariff imposed on this product can shift the demand toward the product with a higher learning potential, thus enhancing growth in the exporter economy. Therefore, although with some possible negative effect on the welfare in the short run, barriers for the export of natural luxury goods may be beneficial for developing economies in the long run, since they increase their incentive to develop sectors with higher growth potential.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F11|How Large Are the Gains from Economic Integration? Theory and Evidence from U.S. Agriculture, 1880-1997|In this paper we develop a new approach to measuring the gains from economic integration based on a generalization of the Ricardian model in which heterogeneous factors of production are allocated to multiple sectors in multiple local markets based on comparative advantage. We implement this approach using data on crop markets in approximately 2,600 U.S. counties from 1880 to 1997. Central to our empirical analysis is the use of a novel agronomic data source on predicted output by crop for small spatial units. Crucially, this dataset contains information about the productivity of all units for all crops, not just those that are actually being grown—an essential input for measuring the gains from trade. Using this new approach we find substantial long-run gains from economic integration among US agricultural markets, benefits that are similar in magnitude to those due to productivity improvements over that same period.
F11|The Globalization Risk Premium|We investigate how globalization is reflected in asset prices. We use shipping costs to measure firms' exposure to globalization. Firms in low shipping cost industries carry a 8 percent risk premium, suggesting that their cash-flows covary negatively with investors' marginal utility. We find that the premium emanates from the risk of displacement of least efficient firms triggered by import competition. These findings suggest that foreign productivity shocks are associated with times when consumption is dear for investors. We discuss conditions under which a standard model of trade with asset prices can rationalize this puzzle.
F11|Disentangling the Wage Impacts of Offshoring on a Developing Country: Theory and Policy|The various channels through which a reduction in the cost of offshoring can improve wages in a developed country are by now well understood. But does a similar reduction in the offshoring cost also benefit workers in the world's factories in developing countries? Using a parsimonious two-country model of offshoring we find very nuanced results. These include cases where wages monotonically improve or worsen as well as those where wages exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship in response to parametric reductions in the cost of offshoring. We identify qualitative conditions under which wages and welfare increase or decrease in the developing world as a result of a reduction in offshoring costs. Since global welfare always rises with an improvement in offshoring technology, we find that there is a role for a wage tax or a minimum wage in the developing country. We derive the optimal levels of such policies.
F11|Trade Elasticity of China|"This paper presents a simple methodology to approximate trade elasticity of China by only using her 2016 firm-level trade data, wherein the exporting country is replaced by the country' most populous destination (a base country) when calculating the export intensity. With Hong Kong being the base country, the estimated trade elasticity to China exports is Î¸ = 8.78 (if Ïƒ = 6.56). This methodology also provides a way to examine the relative ""resistance"" of a country's trading partners while taking them as the base countries: the larger their estimated trade elasticity, the greater their resistance to trade."
F11|Transportation Costs And The Great Divergence|This work shows the asymmetric effect of the reduction in transportation costs across different sectors in the process of the Great Divergence. Specifically, the analysis indicates that reductions in transportation costs of industrial goods enhance convergence of the growth rates of trading economies. In contrast, reductions in transportation costs of non-industrial goods contribute to a further divergence across countries.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F11|The Effects of Tianjin’s Openness on Economic Development in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region Based on Extended Solow Model|Opening has an important impact on economic development. However, due to the fact that various regions have different economic structure and development level, there are differences in the size of its actual effect. Using extended Solow model and 2002-2013 panel data among 13 major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, this paper analyzed the effects of Tianjin’s openness on economic development in Jing-Jin-Ji area. The result shows that improving the degree of Tianjin’s openness has a very significant impact on the joint development of Jing-Jin-Ji area and regional economy. Therefore, we must further promote structural reforms and improve Tianjin’s openness to give full play to its role in driving economic development in Jing-Jin-Ji area in the future.
F11|Competitiveness of the Chinese Economy and its Link to the Global Energy Prices Development|The article analyses the relationship between competitiveness of the Chinese economy and the prices of energy resources. Based on theoretical framework of the most important economists and international organizations in the field of research, the authors analyze statistical data concerning Chinese competitiveness embodied in real effective exchange rate and oil, natural gas and coal global prices using basic correlation and regression analysis and advanced quantitative methods (Granger causality test, cointegration analysis). Secondly, the authors choose the producer prices index as next indicator of competitiveness of the Chinese producers, as the one of the key inputs determining final selling prices are prices of energy carriers. By comparing these two indicators to global energy prices reflected by indexes or in real prices, the authors analyse to what extent these indicators affect each other and what are the ultimate implications for competitiveness of the Chinese economy
F11|Cities export specialization| We analyse whether more populated cities have an export specialization different from the one of less populated cities. Using very detailed product-level export data for Brazilian urban areas over the period 2000–2013, we show that more populated cities export proportionately more skill-intensive and complex goods than less populated cities. This result is consistent with the larger diversity of skills and the higher share of skilled workers in more populated cities.
F11|Rural-led exchange rate appreciation in China|The departure of a factor in excess supply in a non-traded rural sector leads to a Rural-led Exchange Rate Real Appreciation (RERA), in a dual economy setup. The RERA highlights for the first time a potential link between intra-national factor movements and real exchange rates. In China, where there is excess labor employed in the production of (largely) non-traded rural goods, we attribute around one third of the recent appreciation of the real exchange rate – defined as the relative price of nontradables – to a RERA effect.
F11|Measuring openness to trade|In this paper we derive a new measure of openness—trade potential index—that quantifies the potential gains from trade as a simple function of data. Using a standard multicountry trade model, we measure openness by a country׳s potential welfare gain from moving to a world with frictionless trade. In this model, a country׳s trade potential depends on only the trade elasticity and two observable statistics: the country׳s home trade share and its income level. Quantitatively, poor countries have greater potential gains from trade relative to rich countries, while their welfare costs of autarky are similar. This leads us to infer that rich countries are more open to trade. Our trade potential index correlates strongly with estimates of trade costs, while both the welfare cost of autarky and the volume of trade correlate weakly with trade costs. Thus, our measure of openness is informative about the underlying trade frictions.

F11|Migration and FDI: Reconciling the standard trade theory with empirical evidence|This article focuses on an apparent conflict between the standard trade theory and available empirical evidence on factor flows. Theoretically, labor and capital flows must be substitutes. However, empirical papers find migration and FDI to be either substitutes or complements, depending upon the skill content of migration. To reconcile the standard theory with these empirical results, we develop a two-country general equilibrium model. We consider three factors – capital, unskilled and skilled labor – and two internationally traded goods. Countries only differ in their factor endowments. The first country is a developing country amply endowed with unskilled labor; the second one is a developed country well endowed with skilled labor. Under imperfect factor mobility, we find that capital and unskilled labor flows are substitutes, while capital and skilled labor flows are complements.
F11|Goods trade, factor mobility and welfare|We develop a quantitative spatial model that incorporates a rich geography of trade costs and labor mobility with heterogeneous worker preferences across locations. We provide comparative statics for the unique equilibrium with respect to the primitives of the model. We show how the model can be used to undertake counterfactuals using only data in an initial equilibrium. In these counterfactuals, the welfare gains from trade depend on changes in both domestic trade shares and reallocations of population across locations. We show that factor mobility introduces quantitatively relevant differences in the counterfactual predictions of constant and increasing returns to scale models.
F11|The composition of trade flows and the aggregate effects of trade barriers|A widely used class of quantitative trade models implicitly assumes that patterns of comparative advantage take a specific form such that they have no influence over the effect of trade barriers on aggregate trade flows and welfare. In this paper, I relax this assumption, developing a framework in which to analyze the role of interactions among countries' patterns of comparative advantage in determining the aggregate effects of trade barriers. My model preserves much of the tractability of standard aggregate quantitative trade models while allowing for the effects of any pattern of comparative advantage, across many products and countries, to be taken into account. After fitting my model to product-level trade data, I find that the composition of trade flows is quantitatively important in determining the welfare gains from trade and the aggregate effects of trade barriers. A key finding is that the welfare gains from trade tend to be larger and more skewed in favor of low-income countries than an aggregate model would suggest.
F11|External trade diversion, exclusion incentives and the nature of preferential trade agreements|In a game of endogenous trade agreements between three countries, we show that while the pursuit of customs unions (CUs) prevents global free trade from emerging as a coalition-proof Nash equilibrium, the pursuit of free trade agreements (FTAs) does not. This result reflects the relatively flexible nature of FTAs: whereas each FTA member can independently undertake further trade liberalization with respect to the non-member, CU members must do so as a group due to their common external tariff. By diverting members’ exports away from the non-member, both types of trade agreements induce the non-member to voluntarily lower its import tariffs.

F11|Capital heterogeneity as a source of comparative advantage: Putty-clay technology in a ricardian model|This paper considers how heterogeneity in capital goods affects international trade patterns, and shows a novel source of comparative advantage: the magnitude of heterogeneity in capital goods. Capital goods are heterogeneous in their vintage and productivity, and due to capacity constraints, only productive capital goods are activated in the equilibrium. Through this selection, the distribution of capital goods determines industry-level productivity: industry-level productivity is higher in an industry with relatively larger variation in capital goods. Hence in a perfectly competitive two-country, two-good, two-factor equilibrium, the industry has Ricardian comparative advantage. An extension of the model, which includes fixed trade cost, describes a sorting situation in which the most productive production units (which are generally newer vintage) export, the moderately productive units serve the domestic market, and the least productive units (older) do not operate.
F11|Trade, education, and the shrinking middle class|We develop a new model of trade in which educational institutions drive comparative advantage and the distribution of human capital within and across countries. Our framework exploits a multiplicity of sectors and a continuous support of human capital choices to demonstrate that freer trade can induce crowding out of the middle occupations toward the skill acquisition extremes in one country and simultaneous expansion of middle-income industries in another. Individual gains from trade may be non-monotonic in workers' ability, and middle ability agents can lose the most from trade liberalization. Comparing trade and education policies, our model indicates that targeted education subsidies like Trade Adjustment Assistance are the most effective mechanism to bolster the middle class.
F11|Assignment reversals: Trade, skill allocation and wage inequality|The allocation of skilled labor across industries shapes inter-industry wage differences and wage inequality. This paper shows the ranking of industries by workforce skill differs between developed and developing countries and develops a multi-sector assignment model to understand the causes and consequences of this fact. Heterogeneous agents leverage their ability through their span of control over an homogeneous input. In equilibrium, higher skill agents sort into sectors where the cost per efficiency unit of input is lower. Consequently, skill allocation is endogenous to country-sector specific variation in input productivity and costs and when the ranking of sectors by effective input costs differs across countries there is an assignment reversal. Assignment reversals between North and South have novel implications for how trade affects wages because they imply the Stolper–Samuelson theorem does not hold. Instead, each country has a comparative advantage in its high skill sector and output trade integration causes the relative wage of high skill workers, and wage inequality within the high skill sector, to increase in both countries.
F11|The evolution of comparative advantage: Measurement and welfare implications|Using novel estimates of sectoral total factor productivities for 72 countries across 5 decades we provide evidence of relative productivity convergence: productivity grew systematically faster in initially relatively less productive sectors. These changes have had a significant impact on trade volumes and patterns, and a non-negligible welfare impact. Had productivity in each country׳s manufacturing sector relative to the US remained the same as in the 1960s, trade volumes would be higher, cross-country export patterns more dissimilar, and intra-industry trade lower than in the data. Relative sectoral productivity convergence – holding average growth fixed – had a modest negative welfare impact.
F11|Intergenerational altruism and the transfer paradox in an overlapping generations model|This study investigates how intergenerational altruism affects the possibility of the transfer paradox occurring in a two-country, one-sector overlapping generations model. We derive the conditions under which the transfer paradox occurs in our model where a generation within each country has altruism toward the subsequent generation. Contrary to earlier results in the literature, we find that altruism does not enter the conditions under which the transfer paradox occurs in the steady state. Moreover, we show that although altruism affects the condition of the transfer paradox along the transition path, its effect on this condition vanishes as the economy converges to the steady state.
F11|International outsourcing, terms of trade and non-immiserization|This paper investigates the ramifications of international outsourcing for an outsourcing country. It shows that for a small country which is a price taker in the world market, outsourcing occurring in any traded-good sector is welfare-enhancing. For a large country with monopsony power in the world market, outsourcing occurring in the exportable (importable) sector entails pro-trade (anti-trade) effect and deteriorates (improves) the terms of trade weakening (strengthening) the welfare effect — however, outsourcing cannot be immiserizing in any case. These findings are considered vis-à-vis China's outsourcing with its major trading partners including US, EU, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and Hong Kong.
F11|Welfare effects of tourism-driven Dutch disease: The roles of international borrowings and factor intensity|This paper develops a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model to analyze the welfare implications of the Dutch disease induced by the demand shock arising from a tourism boom. Compared with the existing literature, we introduce two new elements, namely, international borrowings and the relative factor-intensiveness, and examine their interplay with the welfare effects of the Dutch disease. We show that (i) when the household can freely borrow from the world financial market, the Dutch disease will not affect welfare; (ii) when the economy is closed to the world financial market, the Dutch disease is beneficial (harmful) to the residents' welfare if the tourism good sector is capital-intensive (labor-intensive). Moreover, this paper provides a simulation analysis to examine the welfare effect of both the steady-state and the transitional responses arising from a tourism boom.

F11|The revealed comparative advantages of late-Victorian Britain|This paper calculates indicators of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) and revealed symmetric comparative advantage (RSCA) for 17 British manufacturing industries for the years 1880, 1890, and 1900. The resulting indicators show that the late-Victorian ‘workshop of the world’ was at a marked comparative disadvantage in a number of manufacturing industries. The paper then proceeds to identify the factor determinants of Britain’s manufacturing comparative advantages (disadvantages) using a four-factor Heckscher-Ohlin model that relies upon these indicators. In contrast with previous scholarship, the manufacturing comparative advantages of late-Victorian Britain were in the relatively labour non-intensive industries, and this pattern became more pronounced throughout the period. The paper concludes with the observation that the factor determinants of Britain’s manufacturing comparative advantages appear closer to those of the United States than had traditionally been thought.
F11|Terrorism, Trade and Welfare: Some Paradoxes and a Policy Conundrum|We present a standard trade model and show that terrorism can be trade inducing, starting from autarky. In addition, terrorism can be shown to be welfare augmenting for a group of nations. Finally, we present some qualitative conditions that identify when a nation’s trade volume may rise (or fall) in response to a greater incidence of terrorism. Our trade and welfare results point to potential difficulties in international coordination of counterterrorism policy because of terrorism’s differential impact across nations.
F11|Offshoring in Developing Countries: Labor Market Outcomes, Welfare, and Policy|Does a reduction in offshoring cost benefit workers in the world's factories in developing countries? Using a parsimonious two-country model of offshoring we find very nuanced results. These include cases where wages monotonically improve, worsen, as well as where wages exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship with the offshoring cost. We identify qualitative conditions under which these relationships hold. Since global welfare always rises with an improvement in offshoring technology, we find that there is a role for a wage tax or a minimum wage in the developing country. We derive the optimal levels of such policies.
F11|Trade Liberalization and the Great Labor Reallocation|The extent to which a country can benefit from trade openness crucially depends on its ease of reallocating resources. However, we know little about the role of domestic frictions in shapingthe effects of trade policies. I address this question by analyzing the impact of tariff reductions on the spatial allocation of labor in China, and how this impact depends on migration frictions that stem from China's household registration system (hukou). I first provide reduced-form evidence that input trade liberalization has induced significant spatial labor reallocation in China, with a stronger effect in regions with less hukou frictions. Then, I construct and estimate a quantitative spatial model with input-output linkages and hukou frictions to examine the general equilibrium effects of tariff reductions and perform counterfactuals. The quantitative exercise shows that trade liberalization increases China's welfare by 0.63%. Abolishing the hukou system leads to a direct welfare improvement of 1.51%. Additionally, it increases gains from tariff reductions by 2% and alleviates its negative distributional consequences. In this process, I develop a novel measure of migration frictions associated with the hukou system.
F11|A critical review of the normative theory of international trade|Recent events around the world suggest that the issue of the gains from international trade is as relevant and alive today as it was during the Mercantilist era many centuries ago. Normative trade theorists have long been striving to answer two basic questions. First, in what sense can trade be regarded as gainful (or harmful) to a country? Second, what are the circumstances under which trade is gainful (or harmful) to a trading country? The principal aim of this paper is to provide a succinct and updated review of the progress of normative trade theorists in finding answers to the above two questions. The paper suggests that it was Montesquieu, rather than Adam Smith, who raised the first question in a meaningful way. The first question is then shown to be satisfactorily answered by Pareto. However, the answer to the second question is still incomplete despite tremendous progress the past 45 years, especially in the case of finite, competitive and barter economies. The answer is incomplete in the sense that, outside the perfectly competitive framework, there is no general proposition that describes the conditions which are compatible with trade gains and conditions which are compatible with trade losses.
