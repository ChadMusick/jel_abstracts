B16|Note sur quelques limites de la méthodologie de Pareto et ses interprétations|: L'article évalue les limites de la méthodologie que Pareto applique à l'économie et à la sociologie. La première partie revisite les fondements sur lesquels repose la méthode logico-expérimentale et des approximations successives que Pareto propose pour les deux disciplines. La deuxième partie explicite les étapes qui définissent l'expérimentalisme de Pareto en sociologie. La troisième montre que les résultats que Pareto met en évidence impliquent qu'il n'applique pas la même méthodologie à l'économie et à la sociologie. La quatrième partie explique pourquoi les formes méthodologiques auxquelles Pareto recourt ne permettent pas la synthèse des résultats qu'il prêtant réaliser.
B16|La conception de l'homme dans la théorie de l'Echange Composite de François Perroux : entre homo economicus et homo religiosus|Cet article réexamine les fondements, analytiques, conceptuels et philosophiques sur lesquels repose la conception de l'homme que Perroux promeut pour définir l'Echange Composite par rapport à l'homo œconomicus propre à l'Echange Pur. Une première partie montre que l'Echange Composite constitue -i- une critique du rationalisme des modèles d'Echange pur marginalistes et d'équilibre général -ii- que cette critique repose sur une série de concepts qui ont contribués à définir le système que Perroux a toujours défendu (effets de domination, luttes-concours, conflits-coopérations, coûts de l'homme, dons et transferts contraints). Une seconde partie met en évidence que ces concepts trouvent leur origine dans une philosophie spécifique à la fois spiritualiste et communautariste qui s'inscrit dans l'oecuménisme chrétien de Perroux et qui fonde sa conception de l'homme.
B16|Is Non-State Money Possible?|Depending on how one interprets the question that forms the topic of my talk, one can argue that the answer is obvious, or one can argue just the opposite. In one sense of course, it’s obvious that non-state money is possible. That’s the sense in which we ask only whether some kinds of non-state money are possible. And of course, the answer is yes. The vast majority of payments today, in Poland as elsewhere, are made with privately produced forms of money – that is, with bank deposits of various kinds – transferable by cheque or using debit cards. And there is nothing surprising about that. But of course, my assigned question can also be understood in a different and more interesting way. The interesting question is not whether some kinds of non-state- supplied money are possible. It is a different question, or rather two different questions. One of these is whether non-state circulating monies, or currencies, are possible. Can we rely on the private sector to supply hand-to-hand circulating means of payment? The other even more fundamental question is whether we can have a complete monetary system in which all forms of money supplied privately, and the state plays no substantial regulatory role.
B16|The Identification Zoo - Meanings of Identification in Econometrics|Over two dozen different terms for identification appear in the econometrics literature, including set identification, causal identification, local identification, generic identification, weak identification, identification at infinity, and many more. This survey: 1. gives a new framework unifying existing definitions of point identification, 2. summarizes and compares the zooful of different terms associated with identification that appear in the literature, and 3. discusses concepts closely related to identification, such as normalizations and the differences in identification between structural models and causal, reduced form models.
B16|Could a large scale asset purchase programme have mitigated the Great Depression?|Since Friedman and Schwarz (1963), the role of the Federal Reserve during the Great Depression has been an issue of debate. In this paper, we focus on the purchases of government securities by the Federal Reserve over a four-month period in 1932. Using a Bayesian VAR model, we estimate the effect of an extension of this programme in conjunction with an interest rate cut on a range of variables capturing prices, output and macro-financial linkages. Our results indicate that this policy would have substantially shortened and reduced the impact of the Great Depression.
B16|The permanent-transitory confusion: Implications for tests of market efficiency and for expected inflation during turbulent and tranquil times|Even when all past and present information is known individuals usually remain uncertain about the permanence of observed variables. After reviewing the history and role of adaptive expectations and its statistical foundations in modeling this permanent-transitory confusion the paper investigates the consequences of this confusion for tests of market efficiency in the treasury bill and foreign exchange markets. A central result is that the detection of serial correlation in efficiency tests based on finite samples does not necessarily imply that markets are inefficient. The second part of the paper utilizes data on Israeli inflation expectations from the capital market to estimate the implicit speed of learning about changes in inflation and to examine the performance of adaptive expectations in tracking the evolution of those expectations during the 1985 Israeli shock stabilization as well as during the stable inflation targeting period.
B16|François Perroux : Echange pur contre échange composite - Controverses et enjeux de justice|Cet article examine les enjeux du concept d’Echange Composite que François Perroux propose pour critiquer celui d’Echange pur. La première partie étudie les critiques que Perroux adresse aux modèles marginalistes, néo-marginalistes, d’équilibre général et d’optimalité parétienne pour définir l’Echange Composite. La seconde partie apprécie les concepts qui caractérisent l’Echange Composite (effet de domination, luttes-concours, conflits-coopérations, coûts de l’homme, dons et transferts contraints). Nous étudions les enjeux de ces concepts par rapport aux formes de justice distributive que Perroux envisage pour définir l’Echange Composite par rapport aux théories de la justice de Walras et de Rawls.
B16|From Methodology to Practice (and Back): Georgescu-Roegen's Philosophy of Economics and the Flow-Fund Model|Despite his early contribution to the rise of mathematics in economics, Georgescu-Roegen's later methodological criticism of models has received little attention from historians and philosophers of economics. This paper attempts to fill this gap following two lines. First, I examine his explicitly methodological claims and connect them with related topics in economic methodology. Building on the distinction between dialectical and arithmomorphic concepts, I characterise his approach to theory-making as a three steps process of idealisation, isolation and arithmetisation. In this framework, models perform two functions, checking for logical consistency and facilitating understanding, which can be related to the idea of modelling as theorising. I then confront these general principles with Georgescu-Roegen's flow-fund model of production. I use the methodology as a reading grid of this theory, while examining its limits and complementary principles in practice. This shows a great deal of consistency, where idealisation provides conceptual foundations, isolation determines the relevant problems, and models are built according to structural consistency. The two functions of models are then illustrated by the logical derivation of older principles formulated by Babbage and Smith, and the understanding of the different organisational patterns of production. But some slightly different functions also appear when specific configurations of the model enable to check the conceptual consistency of other theories, or the understanding provided by the model contributes to the formation of new concepts. Hence, the consistency and the complementarity between Georgescu-Roegen's methodology and practice of theory-making provide interesting insights and a useful background for further investigations

B16|Toward a new microfounded macroeconomics in the wake of the crisis|The Great Recession that followed the financial crisis of 2007 is not only the largest economic crisis after the Great Depression of the 1930s, it also signals a crisis of economics as a discipline. This is not only the consequence of the inadequacy of mainstream macroeconomics, and specifically the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) workhorse model, to forecast such a huge event, or at least to detect the worrying tendencies towards it. Even more relevant is the choice to explicitly avoid the modeling of large crises (that for someone is a motivation for not attacking pre-crisis DSGE models focused on the analysis of small deviations from the steady-state), so denying the intrinsic nature of capitalism, a system that necessarily proceeds through cycles and (extended) crises. The replies of the DSGE approach to critics have led to extensions regarding for instance the role of financial frictions, heterogeneous agents, and bounded rationality (though typically in the form of quasi-rational expectations). The alternative paradigm of agent-based (AB) macroeconomics can take into account all these elements at once within an evolutionary modeling framework based on heterogeneity and interaction, so capable to endogenously reproduce complex dynamics, from small fluctuations to large crises, due to innovation and industrial dynamics, rising inequality and financial instability, and so on. The integration between AB macroeconomics and the (post-Keynesian) stock–flow consistent approach represents a promising way for the future development of this research field.
B16|Ricardo’s Theory of Value is Still Alive and Well in Contemporary Capitalism|The purpose of this article is, on the one hand, to shed light on some significant aspects of Ricardo's theory of value and on the other hand to show that Ricardo's insights about the explanatory power of the relative labour times on the movement of relative prices were in the right direction. For this purpose, Ricardo's theory of value is cast rigorously and in modern terms such that by using detailed intertemporal data from input-output tables of two major economies to show that Ricardo's insights are absolutely consistent with the facts.
B16|Zur mathematischen Struktur der Wertformen von Karl Marx in 'Das Kapital'<BR>[About the mathematical structure of the form of value of Karl Marx in 'Das Kapital']|In the first section of Das Kapital by Karl Marx different forms of values are analysed. From a mathematical point of view one can find therein structures, which correspond to elements of the mathematical theory of categories. These are especially the limit of cones and the definition of subobjects as morphisms. Using the limit cone, the concept of money contains the categorial product of commodities. The concept of the value of a commodity contains the categorial definition of a subobject.
B16|Piketty’s (r – g) Law is Pareto’s Law: Consistent Analyses of Income Distribution Predicated on Inconsistent Definitions of Inequality|On the face of it, Pareto’s law and Piketty’s (r – g) law are inconsistent, with Pareto arguing that real per capita economic growth is the solution to the problem of income inequality and Piketty arguing for redistribution to be funded from a wealth tax. This study, however, establishes that when the same definition of inequality is adopted by the two scholars, Piketty’s and Pareto’s laws are the same economic law. It also establishes that Piketty’s assertion that Pareto treats income distribution as “rock stable” overlooks the critical aspects of Pareto’s law that emphasise change.
B16|The Neoclassicals' Conundrum: If Adam Smith Is the Father of Economics, It Is a Bastard Child|Neoclassical economists of the current era frequently pay lip service to Adam Smith's theories to certify the validity of natural-laws-based, laissez-faire policies. However, neoclassical theories are fundamentally disconnected from Adam Smith's notion of value, his understanding of the economic individual and their interactions in society, his methodology, and the field of study he afforded to political economy. Instead, early neoclassical economists parted ways with the theories of Adam Smith in an effort to construct economic laws that would validate the existing capitalist order as universal, natural, and harmonious.
B16|Application of the PROperty FITting Method (PROFIT) to Classification of EU Countries Based on Their Innovation Level|As it is known, innovativeness can be measured by using many known indices, such as the Global Innovation Index, the Summary Innovation Index, etc. and often these indices are based on different methodologies and take into consideration different sets of diagnostic variables. As a consequence, the final evaluation of innovativeness may strongly depend on the innovation index used. Obviously, some groups of indices lead to similar ranks of the EU countries. Nevertheless, if there are at least two groups of indices which provide different ranks of these countries, a problem with the proper evaluation of their real innovativeness arises. One of the solutions is to select the most valuable indices by observing the impact of all indices on forming distances between innovativeness levels of the EU countries. Following this option, the main aim of this paper is classification of the EU countries with respect to their innovativeness and the evaluation of international index influences on the classification obtained. The aim of the paper is to conduct the research on differences in innovation intensity across the EU member countries. For the purpose of the article, the PROFIT (PROperty FITting) method, an extension of multidimensional scaling (MDS), was applied. The ultimate goal of MDS techniques is to produce a geometric map that illustrates the underlying structure of complex phenomena, for instance, innovativeness of the EU countries. It is a widely used method which collects attribute ratings for each object (country) and then finds the best correspondence of each attribute to the derived perceptual space. Applying the PROFIT method needs linear regression techniques and provides some additional information, i.e. the impact of the considered set of diagnostic variables on the shape of the perception map. The final result is a two-dimensional map of the EU countries which reflects distances among their innovativeness levels along with vectors presenting the influence of international indices of innovativeness on the structure of this map. The nature of the results and the ways in which they are interpreted are subsequently reviewed. The main conclusion drawn from the perception map created concerns the interpretation of the above-mentioned vectors, i.e. the information about the role of each international innovation index in clustering the EU countries with respect to their innovation intensity is obtained.
B16|The Importance Of Quality In Customer Service On The Example Of The Banking Sector|Competitive counts the provider that rendered by the customer service better than the other and through the quality strategy overcomes the competitors and reaches a commercial success. In view of the particular attention should be paid to the quality of the service which significantly affect the customer loyalty. The aim of this study was to investigate the importance of quality in customer service individual commercial banks. For this purpose a SERVQUAL using the questionnaire especially by which was calculated difference between expectations and insight from the consumers on the areas being audited quality customer service. Research background: Cooperative Bank in Kalisz Pomorski (Pomeranian province), Bank of Environmental Protection in Bydgoszcz (Kujawsko - Pomorskie), and a third bank, who reserved to publish their data in research. Purpose of the article: The aim of this study was to investigate the importance of quality in customer service individual commercial banks. Methodology/methods: The method used in the work to analyze the results of the survey method was SERVQL. Findings & Value added: Each subject area of service quality in the assessment of customers' needs some improvements, because in each of them there is a discrepancy between expectations and insights. Banks as service companies must be aware that the quality of service, appropriate communication with the client, contributes not only to improve their image, but primarily becomes a factor distinguishing them from competitors.
B16|Global Infrastructure Projects as the Factor of National Economies’s Development (the case of the Turkish Stream Gas Pipeline)|The current stage of the economy’s development differs from the past ones in that the role of global infrastructure projects acquires ever more importance and that forming and designing of such programs becomes now a much more sophisticated process, all of this has led to a situation where we have to revise our system of economic methods of the evaluation benefits of a global infrastructure project for all involved countries. The existing methods and ways of evaluation influence global infrastructure projects on socio-economic development of the participating countries are to be complemented by new approaches reflecting the market changes and the advent of new financial instruments and stratagems. The aim of the paper is to evaluate influence the global infrastructure project on socio-economic development of the participating countries in the globalized world economy with respect to its main economic and social consequences and synergy effects (the case of the Turkish Stream gas pipeline). The aim of the paper is to evaluate influence the global infrastructure project on socio-economic development of the participating countries in the globalized world economy with respect to its main economic and social consequences and synergy effects (the case of the Turkish Stream gas pipeline). The authors crated methodological approach to the study of infrastructure projects influence on socio-economic development of the members based on the identification, evaluation and prediction of the influence of factors external and internal environment on the changing economic potential of the infrastructure projects participants. Adequate investment in the development of infrastructure is an important driver of long-term economic growth. Traditionally, infrastructure has been funded mostly through public investment. However, in view of scarcity of budgetary resources and lack of capacity within the government to implement these ambitious programs, the strategy of the government relies significantly on promoting investment through a combination of public investment and private participation (include foreign investors). The presented methodological approach allows to define and early diagnose the global infrastructure projects which facilitate a multiplication effect within the national economy.

B16|Influence of Group Purchasing Organizations On Financial Situation Of SMEs|Research background: SMEs often operate in markets where they compete with large companies. A fight for the customer, payment backlogs, problems with debt collection and new branches make management seek solutions that will influence positively on the situation of financial companies. Maintaining liquidity and generating income are the primary steps to build a competitive position and a progressive development of enterprises. One of the most popular methods that allows companies to do profitable business and increase their chances for safety is operation within group purchasing organizations. Currently in the market there are many different types of GPOs (Group Purchasing Organizations). The choice of the right one is a chance to improve their financial situation. Purpose of the article: This article presents functioning of enterprises within group purchasing organizations and their impact on financial situation of enterprises. In the article the classification of groups is done and there are shown the benefits that commercial enterprises operating in them gain. The article presents some obstacles to join specific group purchasing organizations and difficulties faced by companies operating in them. Methodology/methods: The studies will be carried out on the basis of 60 SMEs. These companies operate in five Polish GPOs. The groups were divided into branch and multi-branch ones. The study period covered the years 2013-2015. In order to analyze the impact of purchasing groups on the financial situation of enterprises there were used selected groups of financial ratios and a preliminary analysis of financial balance sheets and profit and loss account was conducted Findings: The analysis showed that the choice of an appropriate group purchasing organization has a large impact on financial situation of companies. Different opportunities can be offered by a sectoral purchasing group than the multi-sectoral one. Research has shown that better results relate to dynamics of revenues, costs, liquidity, profitability that gives the operation within the sectoral purchasing groups.

B16|Methodological Problems With Evaluating Change Efficiency|Research background: Changes result from a turbulent environment and internal situation of an organization. Rarely do changes happen spontaneously, usually they stem from decisions consciously shaped and taken by the management. Both the reasons as well as consequences of changes appear on multiple grounds and areas, often strongly interrelated. This leads to far-reaching consequences, mainly difficulties in practical operations as well as consequences for studies, analyses and related scientific generalizations and the conclusion-drawing process in both domains. Purpose of the article: Purpose of this article is to present and make a critical analysis of the existing achievements in the area of evaluating change efficiency, and indicate opportunities and difficulties in formulating new, in particular synthetic, indicators of change efficiency. Methodology/methods: Methodology applied in this paper is hypothetical and deductive. Findings & Value added: Managers need synthetic measures that are hard to develop. Various methods may be used in order to do it, starting from simple and complex point scales and ending up with methods applied in other sciences, e.g. the Geneva method or its variations applied to evaluate the standard of living and development. Still this requires the isolation of main analytical measures, their upper and lower thresholds, in subsequent change or process areas, and the application of statistical methods to calculate change status or effect. Such action requires longer change planning and preparation, readiness on the part of the managerial staff, and continuous monitoring with active participation of leaders and change managers.
B16|Die Selbstwahrnehmung der Wirtschaft: Entstehung und Wandel von Statistik und Ökonomik als Theorie für Eliten|"Die Statistik war in ihren Anfängen ""Staatszustandswissenschaft"", Fürsten erfassten darin in der Kammer ihr jeweiliges Territorium. Durch die Bevölkerungswissenschaft wandelte sie sich schrittweise zu einer formalmathematischen Theorie. Parallel dazu setzte sich die Geldökonomie immer mehr als herrschende Form durch und transformierte auch die Vorstellung von den handelnden Subjekten. Durch das Prinzip, nur jeweils Durchschnitte zu erfassen, wurde vor allem in der schottischen Tradition des Liberalismus aus der Ökonomik als ""moral science"" eine naturalistische Theorie autonomer Marktprozesse. Die Selbstwahrnehmung der Wirtschaft in Statistik und Ökonomik dient – ungeachtet ihrer vermeintlich neutralen, äußerlichen und formal-mathematischen Struktur – vorwiegend den Interessen einer herrschenden Elite."
B16|Economics and Physics: A Forgotten Discussion|This paper has the objective of reviewing some of the key aspects that involve the association between physics and economics. It also invites to considerate the history behind the neoclassical model and how its physical origin is not well known. It is curious to see the close relation between these two sciences, but it is also curious how this could lead to misinterpretations and beliefs of economics being dependent on physics, which clearly is not the case.
B16|Institutional conditioning of the German labour market in the face of the global economic crisis 2008–2009|Aim: The scientific objective of this study is an attempt to clarify the institutional aspects of the functioning of the labour market in Germany that are relevant to the response to the global economic crisis of 2008–2009. Motivation: The reaction of German labour market was totally different than during previous recessions and the explanation of the sources of this response constitutes the main motivation to undertake this study. The considerations rely on the thesis that it could be attributed to the institutional infrastructure combined with clever economic policy of the state and responsible behaviour of social partners. The economic theory suggests how an isolated institution functions, but in the real world they works in the whole institutional network. Therefore the broader context and some linkages are mentioned. Results: After a brief review of the main macroeconomic indicators and selected labour market institutions in Germany in comparison to the OECD countries, the labour market reforms undertaken in the period between 2002 and 2007 will be discussed. Then, selected on the basis of literature studies, institutional buffers of the labour market mitigating shocks are examined with particular emphasis on the instruments of internal flexibility, social partners’ behaviour and institutional connections of labour markets with other domains of economic order. The elements of institutional framework are subject to qualitative analysis backed up by available official statistical data.
B16|Dinero e inflación en Bolivia en los albores del siglo XXI|El propósito de este documento es evaluar la relación dinámica entre dinero e inflación para los albores del siglo XXI mediante una modelización de Vectores Autoregresivos (VAR). Se emplearon diversas mediciones de cantidad de dinero (emisión monetaria, base monetaria, agregado monetario M1 y M2), así como el índice de precios al consumidor (IPC). Se utilizaron series mensuales de enero del 2000 hasta diciembre del 2015. De manera general, los resultados muestran que la inflación causa al crecimiento de dinero (M1 y M2) y no en sentido inverso para el corto plazo. Sin embargo, la inflación responde a una expansión de política monetaria en el tercer mes de forma positiva y significativa.
B16|Fluctuaciones dinámicas entre dinero e inflación en Bolivia|El objetivo de este documento es evaluar la relación dinámica entre las fluctuaciones cíclicas de la oferta monetaria y la inflación. Mediante filtros de series de tiempo se encuentran los componentes cíclicos para las series, se toman diversas mediciones de cantidad de dinero (la emisión monetaria, la base monetaria, el agregado monetario M1, M2, M3 y M4), así como el índice de precios al consumidor global (IPC), y el índice de precios al consumidor subyacente o núcleo (IPCS). Se emplearon series mensuales desde 1980 (enero) hasta el 2015 (abril) En términos generales, los resultados señalaron que la inflación es contemporánea al agregado monetario M1 (asociación más fuerte en el mismo período); asimismo, la inflación sigue al agregado monetario M2 (en su máxima asociación positiva para dos meses). El perfil dinámico señala que la relación entre la emisión monetaria y la inflación ha cambiado en el tiempo: 1) de grado fuerte, desde mediados de 80’s hasta principios de los 90’s; 2) con una relación débil-moderada desde mediados de los 90’s hasta el 2005; 3) con una transición de grado débil a grado fuerte desde el 2006 al 2013. Sin embargo, en el corto plazo (2005-2013) cabe destacar que la inflación sigue a las operaciones de mercado abierto (en una máxima asociación positiva en dos meses), con un grado de relación fuerte y tendencia estable.
B16|Mathematical Analysis of the Historical Economic Growth with a Search for Takeoffs from Stagnation to Growth|Data describing historical economic growth are analysed. Included in the analysis is the world and regional economic growth. The analysis demonstrates that historical economic growth had a natural tendency to follow hyperbolic distributions. Parameters describing hyperbolic distributions have been determined. A search for takeoffs from stagnation to growth produced negative results. This analysis throws a new light on the interpretation of the mechanism of the historical economic growth and suggests new lines of research.
B16|Skewed Wealth Distributions: Theory and Empirics|Invariably across a cross-section of countries and time periods, wealth distributions are skewed to the right displaying thick upper tails, that is, large and slowly declining top wealth shares. In this survey we categorize the theoretical studies on the distribution of wealth in terms of the underlying economic mechanisms generating skewness and thick tails. Further, we show how these mechanisms can be micro-founded by the consumption-saving decisions of rational agents in specific economic and demographic environments. Finally we map the large empirical work on the wealth distribution to its theoretical underpinnings.
B16|Monetary Expressions of Labour Time and Market Prices: Theory and Evidence from China, Japan and Korea| This article presents estimates of labour values and prices of production following two approaches: the first is based on the classical and Marxian theory of value and distribution; the second on the so-called ‘new solution’ to the ‘transformation problem’ and its variant, the Temporary Single-System Interpretation (TSSI). The major advantage of the latter approach is its simplicity, along with the relatively low data requirements. Our empirical findings from the economies of China, Japan and South Korea suggest that both approaches give estimates of labour values and prices of production which are extremely close to each other as well as to actual market prices. On further examination, however, we conclude that our empirical findings are absolutely consistent with the theoretical requirements of the classical approach and contradict those of the TSSI.
B16|The Transformation of Values into Prices of Production in Marxâ€™s Scheme of Expanded Reproduction|This paper analyzes the formation of a general rate of profit and the subsequent prices of production in the context of Marxâ€™s two-sector scheme of expanded reproduction. We show that a consistent solution of the transformation problem can be derived by incorporating the original transformation procedure into the inter-temporal equilibrium framework provided by the scheme of accumulation. Previous solutions for the special case of simple reproduction are also examined, and it is shown that all these solutions rest on the restrictive assumption of constant wage rates.
B16|Causality As A Tool For Empirical Analysis In Economics|This paper deals with the causal determination of phenomena (briefly causality) as a tool for empirical analysis in economics. Although is the causality difficult to grasp, they are built on the basis of many scientific theories, including economic theory. Causality is very hot topic today, both in philosophy and economics. The causality is used in many multi-sectorial disciplines and the concept of causality is different in various disciplines. In economics, we encounter many assertions that connect cause and effect, but causal relationships are not clearly expressed. At first glance, there may be confusion between cause and effect and the phenomena studied can then be viewed in terms of causality and vice versa. The causality plays very important role in econometric and economics. The paper focused on using of causality in economics and econometric studies. The paper begins with a brief overview of theoretical definition of the causality. Then, the empirical approaches to causality in economics and econometric and selected tools of causality are presented and discussed and the case study of possible using of Granger Causality Test is shown. At the end of the paper we discuss the significance of the Grander Causality Test in economics. The aims of this paper are following: to define the different approaches to causality and describe a short history of this term, to analyse selected econometric methods in interaction with causality and to show on the example of Granger Causality Test using of causality in empirical analysis in economics.
B16|Can a Natural Economy Operate in Macroeconomy? A Caution for Deviation from Natural Economy|Abstract The fundamental problem issue of this paper is that a fundamental cause of economic crises, such as the dot-com bubble, the Lehman crash, or PIIGS, from which the current capitalist economy is suffering, lies in a large deviation from a natural economy. Any large deviation from the natural economy entails high risk. Akimoto (Int J Econ Sci III(4):1–37, 2014) proved this proposition. This leads to a question of whether a mechanism,in which a natural economy operates to begin with, exists in the macroeconomy. First, we adopt the definition by Pasinetti (Structural change and economic growth; a theoretical essay on the dynamics of the wealth of nation. Cambridge University Press, 1981) from a macroeconomic viewpoint, because it depends on the structure of the production process. However, there is no guarantee that the natural economy defined by Pasinetti (Structural change and economic growth; a theoretical essay on the dynamics of the wealth of nation. Cambridge University Press, 1981) operates in the macroeconomy. If Akimoto’s (Int J Econ Sci III(4):1–37, 2014) analysis is correct, we need to prove that a mechanism through which the natural economy operates does in fact exist in the macroeconomy. We construct a macroeconomic game with capitalists and workers as players. The macroeconomy involves circulating players’ savings to investments via capital markets. This process constructs Kaldor’s fundamental equation. We prove that a Nash equilibrium exists, which carries out a natural economy and balanced economic growth. In addition, the theoretical analysis demonstrates that Kaldor’s fundamental equation, which is Keynesian, becomes an identity, i.e., 1 $$=$$ = 1. This implies that the Keynesian equation brings about a classical result.
B16|Problematyka etyczna w pierwszych dzielach o rachunkowosci/Ethics in the Early Works of Accounting|Accountants recently had the opportunity to celebrate 20 years of existence in Poland the regulating of accounting. The act was adopted by parliament in 1994. 500 years before the treaty about double accounting was reprinted by Pacioli. The edition of Tractatus XI. Particularis de computis et scripturis was an (epic) epoch-making event designating the beginning of a new field of economic sciences. The idea of the double accounting was known before, not only because of Pacioli, but also through Cotruglio, who described it 36 years earlier. Recently in accounting, as well as in the broadly understood economy, there is a particular emphasis put on ethics, moral values and professional attitudes. It is worth considering whether and on what scale they were present in the early works of Accountancy 550 years ago, how their representatives approached the subjects the beginning of a written history of accounting. The article presents the main ideas included in the guidelines Pacioli and Cotruglio regarding double accounting, and identifies if ethical guidelines were presents among others guidelines. It turns out that the author of the essential work in the history of accounting, as well as its predecessor, devoted much attention to the moral attitude of the merchant, his appropriate behavior, attitude towards customers and other people, with whom he has a business relationship.
B16|An Empirical Approach To Financial Crisis Indicators Based On Random Matrices|The aim of this work is to build a class of financial crisis indicators based on the spectral properties of the dynamics of market data. After choosing an appropriate size for a rolling window, the historical market data inside this rolling window are seen every trading day as a random matrix from which a correlation matrix is obtained. Our goal is to study the correlations between the assets that constitute this market and look for reproducible patterns that are indicative of an impending financial crisis. A weighting of the assets in the market is then introduced and is proportional to the daily traded volumes. This manipulation is realized in order to give more importance to the most liquid assets. Our financial crisis indicators are based on the spectral radius of this weighted correlation matrix. The idea behind this type of financial crisis indicators is that large eigenvalues are a sign of dynamic instability. The out-of-sample predictive power of the financial crisis indicators in this framework is then demonstrated, in particular by using them as decision-making tools in a protective put strategy.
B16|Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz—Statistician, Economist and a European Intellectual|" type=""main"" xml:id=""insr12083-abs-0001""> Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz (1868–1931) was a European statistician. His scientific work covered theoretical economics, stochastics, mathematical statistics and radiology; today, we would call him a cross-disciplinary scientist. With his clear views on mathematical principles with their applications in these fields, he stood in conflict with the mainstream economic schools in Germany at the dawn of the 20th century. He had many prominent students (Gumbel, Leontief and Freudenberg among them), and he carved out the path of modern statistical thinking. He was a true European intellectual with a career path from St. Petersburg via Göttingen to Straßburg and finally the Berliner Universität, now Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. He is known for the precise calibration of insurance claims applying the—at that time hardly known—Poisson distribution to Prussian horse kick and child suicide data. He proposed a simple solution to the Marxian transformation problem and wrote numerous articles and books on the mathematical treatment of statistical (including radiological physical) data. In this article, we sketch his life and work and point out the prominent role that he has in today's statistical thinking."
B16|Haavelmo’S Probability Approach And The Cointegrated Var|Some key econometric concepts and problems addressed by Trygve Haavelmo and Ragnar Frisch are discussed within the general framework of a cointegrated VAR. The focus is on problems typical of time series data such as multicollinearity, spurious correlation and regression results, time dependent residuals, normalization, reduced rank, model selection, missing variables, simultaneity, autonomy and identification. Specifically the paper discusses (1) the conditions under which the VAR model represents a full probability formulation of a sample of time-series observations, (2) the plausibility of the multivariate normality assumption underlying the VAR, (3) cointegration as a solution to the problem of spurious correlation and multicollinearity when data contain deterministic and stochastic trends, (4) the existence of a universe, (5) the association between Frisch's confluence analysis and cointegrated VAR analysis, (6) simultaneity and identification when data are nonstationary, (7) conditions under which identified cointegration relations can be considered structural or autonomous, and finally (8) a formulation of a design of experiment for passive observations based on theory consistent CVAR scenarios illustrated with a monetary model for inflation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B16|Quantity-of-money fluctuations and economic instability: empirical evidence for the USA (1958â€“2006)|This paper examines the relation between the fluctuations in the quantity of money and the fluctuations in economic activity; that is, the cyclical components of each variable. The principal question posed is: how do the fluctuations in the quantity of money affect or get affected by the fluctuations of output and profitability in the US economy (1958â€“2006)? Our investigation stops in 2006 as the dynamics of the traditional economic structures changed dramatically in the US and globally after 2006. The empirical results indicate strong cyclical behaviour of most variables. Furthermore, the cyclical components of output/profitability and the quantity of money move in the same direction and there is also a significant relationship between them. A very interesting result is that fluctuations in output/profitability do cause fluctuations in the quantity of money, but fluctuations in the quantity of money do not cause fluctuations in output/profitability, giving priority to a â€˜macroeconomicâ€™ point of view, where overall economic activity, expressed through profitability and output, shapes (but is not shaped by) the quantity of money. Our empirical findings, thus, imply a revision of the usual reading which favours causality running from the quantity of money.
B16|Medición no lineal de la dependencia de la inflación sobre el tipo de cambio nominal (pass-through)|This paper aims to analyze, by using the concept of mutual information, the existing relationship between the nominal exchange rate and different inflation components. The proposed information measure captures the dependence structure between these two variables, resulting in new empirical findings not explored by previous works. Among these findings are: i) existence of bimodal bivariate distributions useful to explain regime changes, and ii) increases in dependence between the variables in low-volatility periods and decreases in dependence in uncertain environments, previously measured as pass-through. Moreover, such distributions allow studying the different transmission speeds for each inflation component.// En este trabajo se analiza, mediante el uso del concepto de información mutua, la relación existente entre el tipo de cambio nominal y los distintos componentes de la inflación. La medida de información propuesta capta la estructura de dependencia entre estas dos variables, lo que conlleva a nueva evidencia empírica no explorada por estudios previos. Entre estos resultados se encuentran: i) existencia de distribuciones bivariadas bimodales útiles para examinar cambios de régimen, y ii) aumento en la dependencia de las variables en periodos de poca volatilidad y caídas en su dependencia en ambientes de incertidumbre, previamente medido como pass-through. Asimismo, dichas distribuciones permiten estudiar las distintas velocidades de transmisión para cada componente de la inflación
B16|A Practical Approach to Financial Crisis Indicators Based on Random Matrices|The aim of this work is to build financial crisis indicators based on market data time series. After choosing an optimal size for a rolling window, the market data is seen every trading day as a random matrix from which a covariance and correlation matrix is obtained. Our indicators deal with the spectral properties of these covariance and correlation matrices. Our basic financial intuition is that correlation and volatility are like the heartbeat of the financial market: when correlations between asset prices increase or develop abnormal patterns, when volatility starts to increase, then a crisis event might be around the corner. Our indicators will be mainly of two types. The first one is based on the Hellinger distance, computed between the distribution of the eigenvalues of the empirical covariance matrix and the distribution of the eigenvalues of a reference covariance matrix. As reference distribution we will use the theoretical Marchenko Pastur distribution and, mainly, simulated ones using a random matrix of the same size as the empirical rolling matrix and constituted of Gaussian or Student-t coefficients with some simulated correlations. The idea behind this first type of indicators is that when the empirical distribution of the spectrum of the covariance matrix is deviating from the reference in the sense of Hellinger, then a crisis may be forthcoming. The second type of indicators is based on the study of the spectral radius and the trace of the covariance and correlation matrices as a mean to directly study the volatility and correlations inside the market. The idea behind the second type of indicators is the fact that large eigenvalues are a sign of dynamic instability

B16|Real and financial crises in the Keynes-Kalecki structuralist model: An agent-based approach|Agent-based models are inherently microstructures - with their attention to agent behavior in a field context - and only aggregate up to systems with recognizable macroeconomic characteristics. One might ask why the traditional Keynes-Kalecki or structuralist (KKS) model would bear any relationship to the multi-agent modeling approach. This paper shows how KKS models might benefit from agent-based microfoundations, without sacri cing traditional macroeconomic themes, such as aggregate demand, animal sprits and endogenous money. Above all, the integration of the two approaches gives rise to the possibility that a KKS system - stable over many consecutive time periods - might lurch into an uncontrollable downturn, from which a recovery would require outside intervention. As a by-product of the integration of these two popular approaches, there emerges a cogent analysis of the network structure necessary to bind real and financial agents into a integrated whole. It is seen, contrary to much of the existing literature, that a highly connected financial system does not necessarily lead to more crashes of the integrated system.
B16|Sociological Analysis of Economic Inequalities: Methodological Aspects|The paper outlines basic elements of the sociological analysis of economic inequalities. The baseline argument of the paper is that economic inequalities are a sociological concept which carries different content in comparison with economic differentiation and heterogeneity of incomes, which in turn are most often perceived as direct proxies of economic inequalities. The theoretical analysis of the concepts of economic differentiation and economic inequality made is focused on their specific interpretation schemes and measurement strategies and methods. The main problematic areas of classic measures of economic differentiation and are outlined including an analysis of most common research findings. The focus on the sociological analysis of economic inequalities (interpreted as status distances between economic roles and resources associated with these roles) includes the principle aspects of this analysis and a comprehensive research program (including concepts and indicators). Some methodological conclusions regarding the interpretations of economic inequalities are made, based on three ISSP surveys (1992, 1999, and 2009). Also based on empirical data some of elements of the outlined research program with regards to Bulgaria are explored: economic differentiation (Gini and extraction ratio), status identification its relationship to subjective social class, etc.
B16|Regional Specialisation As An Endogenous Factor In The Development Of Poland’S Provinces|The economic development of Poland and its regions results from a complex interaction of many factors, which include regional innovation policy. The task of regional innovation policy is to identify and develop smart specialisations, which may offer an opportunity of building up sustained competitive advantage of Poland’s provinces. The identification of regional specialisations for the needs of regional policy carried out by Poland’s provinces is a complex process. It must be placed within the context of all other processes of territorial development. To formulate specialisations, it is necessary to perform a thorough analysis of regional economic structures, taking into account both resources of a given region and possibilities of generating revenue. One of the methods used to identify potential regional specialisations is the Krugman dissimilarity index. In the paper, it is employed to analyse dissimilarities between economic structures of Poland’s regions.
B16|Influence Of Unemployment Benefit On Duration Of Registered Unemployment Spells|The purpose of the article is to present the analysis of the influence of unemployment benefit on the duration of registered unemployment spells. The authors made a hypothesis that the very fact of receiving the benefit extends the job seeking time and determines the intensity of unemployment exit. The power of this influence varies depending on a subgroup the unemployed person belongs to. The study was conducted on the basis of data from the Poviat Labour Office in Sulecin. The data were collected as a part of the European Union project implementation. The analysis covered two periods of time – before and after Poland’s accession to the European Union and the subsequent changes in legal regulations concerning unemployment benefits. The authors observed separate cohorts of the unemployed registered in 2001 and 2005. The closing dates of the observations were: the end of 2003 and 2007, respectively. Also, the authors examined whether the EU projects implemented after 2004 had an effect on the length of the unemployment spells as well as on the intensity of the unemployment exit. The study confirmed the research hypotheses. The fact of claiming the unemployment benefit prolonged the unemployment spells in both periods of observation. The loss of the right to the benefit increased the probability of de-registration in each sub-group.
B16|Impact Of Institutional Factors On Economic Growth In The United States In The Years 1979–2007|The purpose of this article is to isolate and determine the importance of institutional arrangements in shaping the dynamics of the U.S. GDP in the years 1979–2007. The research hypothesis which has been verified here can be summarized as follows: institutions in the U.S. economy have a positive influence on economic growth through a significant impact on improving the business environment. Having regard to the division of the economy into institutional areas: economic system, labor market, financial market, education and R&D, the author selected these institutional factors which indicated that the operation could be important for the process of economic growth in the United States, and then measured the impact in the years 1979–2007. To verify the thesis about the impact of institutions on economic growth the author used one of the most popular tools in this kind of econometric research – the multiple regression analysis. The analysis revealed that during the period of all the analyzed institutional factors it was the proportion of the working population and the degree of unionization that most strongly influenced the economic growth of the United States – an increase in one of these factors was associated with a much more than proportional increase in the rate of the economic growth.
B16|Social Relations And Environmental Influence As A Determinant Of Customer Capital|The article presents the influence of feedback and recommendations provided by the customers on the customer purchase behaviour along with the benefits resulting from the use of the customer feedback potential in the process of company value creation. On the basis of survey conducted on the beer market in Poland, it was demonstrated that the customer feedback and recommendations have a significant influence on the purchase behaviour and allow the cost reduction of customer communication. In the analysis of the results the statistical methods were used, including focus analysis, ANOVA test and factor analysis.
B16|Optimization Of The Variables Selection In The Process Of Real Estate Markets Rating|The growing significance of the real estate market prompts investors to search for factors and variables which support cohesive analyses of real estate markets, market comparisons based on diverse criteria and determination of market potential. The specificity of the real estate market is determined by the unique attributes of property. The Authors assume that developing real estate market ratings identifies the types of information and factors which affect decision-making on real estate markets. The main objective of real estate market ratings is to create a universal and standardized classification system for evaluating the real estate market. One of the most important problems in this area is collecting appropriate features of real estate market and development dataset. The main problem involves the selection and application of appropriate features, which would be relevant to the specificity of information related to the real estate market and create a kind of coherent system aiding the decision-making process. The main aim of this study is the optimization of set of variables that were used to develop the real estate market ratings. For this purpose, Hellwig’s method of integral capacity of information was applied. In this particular case, the method shows what set of variables provides information most sufficiently. The results lead to obtaining the necessary set of features that constitute essential information which describes the situation on the local real estate market.
B16|Regional specialisation as an endogenous factor in the development of Poland’s provinces|Regional and local development results from a complex interaction of many factors, including the development policy. Development priorities, contained in the strategic documents such as regional innovation strategies, emphasise building up the region’s competitive advantage by identifying and developing regional specialisations. Regions need to identify their strengths and weaknesses and they have to rely strongly on innovation to develop. The aim of the paper is to undertake a diagnostic assessment of the specialisations of Poland’s provinces, and also to validate that, in the context of the regional innovation policy, on the example of the swietokrzyskie province. The paper employs the Krugman dissimilarity index, which is computed on the basis of a comparison of a given region’s economic structure with average structure of other regions.
B16|Russian economy in the face of the global decline of crude oil prices|The purpose of this article is to present problem in which the Russia found after the imposition of her economic and political sanctions by the European Union. It also shows the impact of the global figure the crude oil price to change the size of gross domestic product and the country's budget revenues. The models were to confirm the existence of consistent relationship between the studied variables and indicate the strength of this relationship, between the crude oil price and the size of Russia's GDP and exports in the country. The first model is indicative of the relationship between the change in the size of world crude oil prices and the value of gross domestic product. The second model shows the impact of world crude oil prices on the value of exports. The resulting models confirm that values and confirm the thesis of mine. An important element that should also pay attention to a problem related to the occurrence in the Russian economy Dutch disease. Russia's strong economic dependence on oil and natural gas causes such a violent change of the economic situation of the country from fluctuations in the world prices of crude oil and is a major cause of the economic crisis which took the Russian economy in 2014.
B16|Uwarunkowania instytucjonalne niemieckiego rynku pracy wobec swiatowego kryzysu gospodarczego 2008-2009|The unemployment rate in Germany after reaching a peak of 12.1% in 2005 began to decline steadily, and the improvement of the situation on the labour market followed even in the face of the global economic crisis after 2007. These positive trends, especially in comparison with other EU countries, draw attention and are discussed in the literature. Reference is made to the exceptionally favourable macroeconomic configuration for the German economy: low interest rates (since autumn 2008), low oil prices and the weak euro (since mid-2014). Secondly, an active employment and the labour market policy is boasted in the face of crisis. Finally, the institutional aspects of the German labour market are emphasized: long-term effects of labour market reforms as part of the Hartz package of 2003-2005 and the specificity of the German model of industrial relations as an effective constellation of three key actors in the labour market: trade unions, employers' organizations and works councils. The objective of this study is an attempt to clarify the institutional conditions of the functioning of the labour market in Germany that are relevant to the response to the crisis. Accordingly, the buffers are examined to mitigate shocks with particular emphasis on instruments of internal flexibility, social partners behaviour and institutional connections of labour markets with other domains of economic order on the example of dual education system.

B16|Capital In the 21st Century: A Review|This paper reviews Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Piketty's Capital seeks to bring the issue of inequality back to the centre of social analysis and to encourage discussion about the evolution of wealth and inequality with a view to inform policy. The book uses data stretching as far back as the 1700's. The main thesis of the book is that capitalism automatically generates inequality and wealth concentration since the rate of return on capital always exceeds the growth rate of income. To resolve this problem, the book proposes a progressive tax on wealth and income. I show that Piketty's book is based on a misunderstanding of classical political economy, particularly Marx. Piketty's view of the development and phases of capitalism is inadequate. His tax proposals, though progressive, will not resolve the inequality problem. Lastly, his conclusion that modern economic growth made it possible to avoid the Marxist apocalypse is not borne out by his data.

B16|A. A. Cournot - Half-forgotten personalities of economic thought|Cournot was a French mathematician, philosopher and economist, said to be one of the most important predecessors of neoclassical economic theory. He belongs among the pioneers in econometrics and mathematical economics. He is also highlighted for creation of market prices, the demand function and the basis for marginalist firm theory. He was unacknowledged in his lifetime.
B16|A Selective Migration Review: from public policy to public health|The contribution of Steinbeck in the late-1930’s concerning motives and decisionmaking for environmental migrations did much to influence research in social science. The Tiebout’s hypothesis and theoretical model of migration, published in 1956, permitted evaluation of urban public policy implications. The impact of these two pioneers in migration theory set the stage for new models and new methods in migration research having advantage of much more data from many more environmental, economic and social sectors applied to many more accumulating, often tragic, examples. This paper looks at the state of the science as these two influential authors left it and how the public health part of the 1930’s Dust Bowl migration to California contributes to our understanding of this complex human, decision-making system. Finally, Garfield's scientometric propagation of scientific thinking was utilized for migration theories.
B16|An application of econophysics to the history of economic thought: The analysis of texts from the frequency of appearance of key words|This article poses a new methodology applying the statistical analysis to the economic literature. This analysis has never been used in the history of economic thought, albeit it may open up new possibilities and provide us with further explanations so as to reconsider theoretical issues. With that purpose in mind, the article applies the intermittency of the turbulence in different economic texts, and specifically in three important authors: William Stanley Jevons, Adam Smith, and Karl Marx.
B16|Modeling the interaction of cycles and growth in the fifties: two schumpeterian attempts|In post-war macroeconomics, economic dynamics generally refers to two distinct phenomena, economic growth and business cycles, which implies the existence of a strict dichotomy between short run and long-run analysis. In this paper we focus on two original exceptions to this prevailing view during the fifties: the attempt made by A. Smithies using ratchet effects, and the nonlinear approach initiated by Goodwin. Both explicitly refer to Schumpeter’s view on cyclical growth combined with postwar macroeconomic advances. However, they did not really succeed to overcome the major difficulties of a unified analysis of cycles and growth, stressed notably by Pasinetti in 1960. On the one hand, the introduction of ratchet effects into consumption or investment functions does not provide, contrary to Smithies’s claim, an endogenous explanation of cycles and growth. On the other hand, Goodwin’s nonlinear approach provides a promising perspective, but, in the fifties his attempt to connect a Keynesian framework with Schumpeterian insights remains rather tentative.
B16|Kuznets versus kondratieff An essay in historical macroeconometrics|Spectral analysis has had limited applications in cliometrics to date. In this paper, it is used to determine, through international comparisons, the frequency of GDP series in the long run. A reminder of the spectral methodology (I) is followed by successive examinations of the series chosen, the treatment of these series and the results of the cliometric analysis (II). We show then the macroeconomic perspectives of this type of approach and we synthesise a new major result, i.e. the existence of a single intermediate Kuznets type cycle, in contradiction with the discourse around the dating of the famous cycles of Kondratieff type.
B16|Time scales and mechanisms of economic cycles: a review of theories of long waves|This paper explores long wave theory, including Kondratieff's theory of cycles in production and relative prices; Kuznets's theory of cycles arising from infrastructure investments; Schumpeter's theory of cycles due to waves of technological innovation; Goodwin's theory of cyclical growth based on employment and wage share dynamics; Keynesâ€“Kaldorâ€“Kalecki's demand and investment-oriented theories of cycles; and Minsky's financial instability hypothesis whereby capitalist economies show a genetic propensity to boomâ€“bust cycles. This literature has been out of favor for many years but recent developments suggest a re-examination is warranted and timely.
B16|Maurice Potron and his times: state, catholicism and economic modelling|Maurice Potron (1872-1942) is a French Jesuit and a talented mathematician. A recent rediscovery of his economic model, which was left unnoticed in his times, lets Potron appear as a pioneer, both for the framework he conceived and the mathematical methods he used. Moreover, there are hints that his model was inspired by the social doctrine of the Church, as modernized by the encyclical Rerum Novarum. The present study on Potron’s life shows that his family and himself, who lived in a time of tensions between the Church and the French Republic, were involved in the new forms of action inspired by or following the encyclical. The biography follows the steps of the rediscovery of his works.
B16|A Brief History of Envelope Theorems in Economics: Static and Dynamic|This paper studies how envelope theorems have been used in Economics, their history and also who first introduced them. The existing literature is full of them and the reason is that most families of optimal value functions can produce them. The paper is driven by curiosity, but hopefully it will give the reader some new insights.
B16|General Equilibrium Theory behind the Iron Curtain: The Case of Victor Polterovich|In this article we address the story of developments in general equilibrium theory in the Soviet Union during the 1970s through the lens of a single biography. The Soviet advances in mathematical economics give an occasion to reflect on the extension of the Walrasian paradigm to nonmarket societies, as well as on the ideological effects of general equilibrium theory and its interpretations in a Soviet context. Our contribution is focused on the development of general equilibrium theorizing in the work of Victor Meerovich Polterovich (b. 1937), who has been one of the leading figures in mathematical economics and general equilibrium theory in the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia. His papers on the abstract models of exchange, dynamic general equilibrium and optimal growth theory, excess demand correspondences, monotonicity of demand functions, and disequilibrium theory were for the most part published in English and gained considerable attention within the field. We reconstruct the political and ideological basis of the general equilibrium concept and show how abstract mathematical models reflected the discursive shift from optimal centralized planning to various forms of decentralization. We argue that the Soviet work on general equilibrium was a part of the global development of mathematical economics but was not integrated into it institutionally.
B16|Literaturbeitrag / Review Book. Über die Natur und das Wesen des Geldes – J. H. von Thünens unveröffentlichtes Manuskript zur Geldtheorie / The Nature and the Essence of Money – J. H. von Thuenen’s unpublished Manuscript on Monetary Economics|The economic works of Johann Heinrich von Thuenen include 1,000 unpublished pages of drafts and notes on the basis of which he prepared the second volume of his famous “Isolated State in Relation to Agriculture and Political Economy”. It’s bulk was not made accessible until today. The analysis of a 60 pages’ manuscript treating monetary questions and preparing his theory of capital and interest shows that the economic thoughts of Thuenen are much more far-reaching than presented in his published works. Diminishing returns of cash keeping in enterprises are the basic concept of his monetary analysis. Main results are an algebraic equation of exchange, the interaction between the monetary interest rate and the rate of return on real capital and finally a synthesis of an extended quantity theory and the production cost theory of money. “The Nature and Essence of Money” includes important elements of the development in monetary economics in the late nineteenth and the beginning twentieth century mainly influenced by contributions of Irving Fisher, Knut Wicksell and John Maynard Keynes.

A Neumann-modell és a Leontief-modell éves termelési periódust feltételező, zárt, stacionárius változatának hasonló matematikai struktúrája azt a feltételezést sugallja, hogy az utóbbi a Neumann-modell sajátos eseteként értelmezhető. Az egyes modellek közgazdasági tartalmát és feltevéseit részletesen kibontva és egymással összevetve a szerző megmutatja, hogy a fenti következtetés félrevezető, két merőben különböző modellről van szó, nem lehet az egyikből a másikat levezetni. Az ikertermelés és technológiai választék lehetősége a Neumann-modell elengedhetetlen feltevése, az éves termelési periódus feltevése pedig kizárja folyam jellegű kibocsátások explicit figyelembevételét.

B16|Econometrics: An Historical Guide for the Uninitiated|This essay was written to accompany a lecture to beginning students of the course of Economic Analytics, which is taught in the Institute of Econometrics of the University of Lodz in Poland. It provides, within a few pages, a broad historical account the development of econometrics. It begins by describing the origin of regression analysis and it concludes with an account of cointegration analysis. The purpose of the essay is to provide a context in which the students can locate various aspects of econometric analysis. A distinction must be made between the means by which new ideas were propagated and the manner and the circumstances in which they have originated. This account is concerned primarily with the propagation of the ideas.
B16|Robert Torrens e a teoria clássica do lucro [Robert Torrens and the classical theoyr of profits]|This paper reconstructs the evolution of Colonel Robert Torrens' theory of profits based on its critique of the Ricardian theory of value. Initially, it describes the attack conducted by him on the idea of the amount of labor being the sole factor to regulate mercantile exchanges. After that, McCulloch's and Ricardo's arguments in defense of this principle are presented. It continues by examining the origins of Torren's systemic approach to profits, based on the reciprocal interdependence of the productive sectors. Next, the applications of such theory carried out by the Colonel are considered, especially the support for free trade. Finally, it highlights the pioneer character of his approach to profits within the overall setting of classical economics.
B16|Evaluation and Determining Risks in an Entity through Methods Adapted to Economic Vulnerability|The present economic situation in which we stand, attracts more and more the attention of specialists, researchers, managers of economic entities and governments, in order to take steps to protect primarily the economy and the survival of the business and secondly, in order to optimize the harnessing of the resources available and the discovery of new technologies for replacement of exhaustible and non-renewable raw materials. The entire company is concerned by the numerous analysis and research conducted in the idea of improving the effects of the economic crisis, the discovery in due time of the risks economic entities are exposed to and mitigation of uncertainties on the evolution of a business activity.
B16|Francesco Coletti nella storia delle scienze statistiche ed economiche italiane (Francesco Coletti in the history of Italian statistical and economic sciences)|In the course of his long and fruitful academic and extra-academic career, Francesco Coletti devoted himself to a variety of abstract as well as empirical investigations, focusing on the relations between man, society and environment. More precisely, this paper examines the intellectual path followed by the Marchesian scholar, arguing that it can be significantly illuminated when set against the evolving background of economic and statistical sciences in Italy.
B16|The Use Of Discriminant Analysis To Predict The Bankruptcy Of Companies Listed On The Newconnect Market|The aim of this article is to analyze and evaluate the usability of discriminant models in predicting bankruptcy for companies listed on NewConnect. This mar-ket was established in 2007 and operates as an alternative trading system next to Warsaw Stock Exchange S.A., which in practice means that its regulatory regime in relation to issuers and listed companies is not as strict as the one applicable to the main market, therefore shares of small and medium-size businesses, including start-ups, can be listed on NewConnect. In this paper, discriminant models are used to analyse the financial situation of four companies removed from trading on NewConnect due to bankruptcy, Perfect Line S.A., Promet S.A., InwazjaPC S.A. and Budostal-5 S.A. The analysis is based on three models: Altman's model for emerging markets, as well as two models of the highest predictive ability accord-ing to P. Antonowicz's research, Z7INEPAN model developed in the Polish Academy of Sciences and E. Maczynska's model, developed by Polish scientists and adapted to the Polish economy. The results confirm that these models are a valu-able tool in assessing the financial condition of enterprises and allow for bank-ruptcy forecasting. Their application to companies listed on NewConnect, how-ever, may be limited due to the specific profile of these entities as most of these enterprises are in fact newly formed and therefore the existing empirical data may prove insufficient.
B16|Realization Of The Aims Of Sustainable Develop-Ment In “Strategy For The Social And Economic Growth Of Eastern Poland By 2020”|The realization of the idea of the sustainable development is a direction of devel-opment of many countries in the world, also in the European Union. It is possible to find examples of such action in the structural policy conducted by the EU. It is directed at deliberate and intentional activity of the official authority aiming at the harmonious development of EU regions. In particular it is regarding eastern regions of Poland which are reporting wide financial support from the budget of the European Union for social, economic and ecological growth. Particular di-rections of that growth contains “Strategy for the social and economic growth of Eastern Poland by 2020”. The purpose of this article is to evaluate (using availa-ble statistical data) the implementation of development goals in eastern Polish regions contained in the Strategy in the context of sustainable development.
B16|The Innovativeness Of Financial Institutions In Poland – The Perspectives Of The Development|Financial services which are more and more important part of the economy in developed countries mainly absorbing the innovations are becoming simultane-ously important creators of the innovations in the area of marketing and organi-zational changes. The essence of the innovation in the financial services was introduced in the article. The basic categories of innovations in the financial services were introduced. The analyses of the level of the innovativeness of the financial institutions with the regard of the subjective differentiation were exe-cuted on the basis of the statistical data and because of the kinds of the innova-tion. The basic groups of factors influencing the innovations were identified in the article and were connected with marketing activities on the market of the financial services. The thesis is to conduct some considerations about the contin-ually insufficient level of the innovativeness of the majority of the financial insti-tutions leading their activity in Poland. The identification of the part of innovations and the perspectives of the devel-opment of innovativeness in the activity of the financial institutions functioning in Poland is the aim of the research. Certain analyses were executed in this sec-tor given statistical accumulated by GUS in 2009-2011. The objective and the subjective differentiation of the innovation were introduced. It was affirmed that financial services in Poland and in countries throughout Europe are one of the most innovative sections of the economy. Product and process innovations play larger meaning in functioning financial institutions. Research that was carried out showed that among all the enterprises numbered to the Section K-Financial and Insurance Activities (according to the classification PKD GUS) the most innovative are financial institutions belonging to the section 65 – Insurance, reinsurance and pension funding, except compulsory social security. The lower level of innovativeness are characterize however the most numerous among fi-nancial institutions enterprises numbered to section 64 – Financial service activi-ties, except insurance and pension funding. On the base of the analysis given, the perspectives of the development of the innovativeness of financial institutions in Poland were introduced.
B16|Coopetition As The Factor Of Increasing Level Of Innovativeness In The Sme Sector In Poland|Companies in Poland can realize their goals by assuring the necessary organizational conditions and by partially restricting opportunistic behavior within the limits sufficient to take stable coopetitive actions. In the face of the present financial crisis, innovativeness is one of the basic parameters in evaluation of the SME sector in Poland. The goal of the present article is to show that enhanced coopetition of the researched entities with huge holdings or concerns from Poland and with economic entities from the remaining countries of the European Union is a sine qua non of improving the level of innovativeness in the SME sector. The coopetition is defined as a phenomenon of simultaneous cooperation and competition of at least two entities, the aim of which is to better realize their goals or to work towards the common end. If levels of competition and cooperation are low, companies assume the strategies of the owners of micro-, small- or medium-sized enterprises. Being a condition necessary to improve the level of innovativeness in the Polish SME sector, coopetition is characteristic of the companies whose activities are narrowly specialized.
B16|Influence of Unemployment Benefit on Duration of Registered Unemployment Spells|The purpose of the article is to present the analysis of the influence of the unemployment benefit on the duration of the registered unemployment spells. The authors made a hypothesis that the very fact of receiving the benefit prolongs the job seeking time and determines the intensity of unemployment leaving. The power of this influence varies depending on a subgroup the unemployed person belongs to. The study was conducted on the basis of data from the Poviat Labour Office in Sulecin. The data were collected in the course of the European Union project implementation. The analysis covered two periods of time – before and after Poland’s accession to the European Union and the change in legal regulations concerning unemployment benefits. In each of the periods the authors observed separate cohorts of the unemployed registered in 2001 and 2005. The closing dates of the observations were: the end of 2003 and 2007, respectively. Also, the authors examined whether the EU projects implemented after 2004 had an effect on the length of the unemployment spells as well as on the intensity of finding a job. The study confirmed the research hypotheses. The fact of claiming the unemployment benefit prolonged the unemployment spells in both periods of observation. The loss of the right to the benefit increased the probability of de-registration in each sub-group.
B16|Specjalizacja regionalna endogenicznym czynnikiem rozwoju polskich wojewodztw|Regional and local development results from a complex interaction of many factors, including the development policy. Development priorities, contained in the strategic documents such as regional innovation strategies, emphasise building up the region’s competitive advantage by identifying and developing regional specialisations. Regions need to identify their strengths and weaknesses and they have to rely strongly on innovation to develop. The aim of the paper is to undertake a diagnostic assessment of the specialisations of Poland’s provinces, and also to validate that, in the context of the regional innovation policy, on the example of the swietokrzyskie province. The paper employs the Krugman dissimilarity index, which is computed on the basis of a comparison of a given region’s economic structure with average structure of other regions.
B16|El capital en el siglo XXI de Thomas Piketty<BR>[Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the 21st century]|This review of the book by Thomas Piketty, the capital in the XXI century, presents the central themes of the work and exposes its scope on the relationship between inequality and wealth. In particular a positive reflections on the progressive tax is added.
B16|Thomas Piketty's Capital in the 21st Century|"Thomas Piketty's ""Capital in the 21st century"" has been the most important book economy in recent times. Its aim integrates the debate theories of growth, income distribution, inequality and differences between the extremes income and income of the majority. The work predicts a slow increase in the share of capital income and inequality. His proposal for a global tax on capital is a way to evaluate such tendencies."
B16|Mean-median compromise method as an innovating voting rule in social choice theory|This paper aims at presenting a new voting function which is obtained in Balinski-Laraki's framework and benefits mean and median advantages. The so-called Mean-Median Comprise Method (MMCM) has fulfilled criteria such as unanimity, neutrality, anonymity, monotonicity, and Arrow's independence of irrelevant alternatives. It also generalizes approval voting system.
B16|Empirická analýza obchodování s opcemi na akcie Škodových závodů 1928-1938<BR>[An Empirical Analysis of Škoda Co. Equity Options Trading 1928-1938]|Recent findings have shown that the Prague Exchange featured a very active and developed stock options market right until its pre-war closure in September 1938. This paper follows up on extensive research into fragmentary archival resources, aggregating a unique collection of options quotations on the shares of Škoda, the dominant industrial firm and stock in Czechoslovakia. A rigorous review of contemporary literature has been complemented with an empirical analysis including implied volatility measurements, resulting in a detailed appraisal of the market. Even though statistical option-valuation models have already been available and generally known, these were not used by practitioners. Instead, a heuristic approach based on perfect familiarity with intrinsic valuation and hedging as well as time-value drivers, effectively used since the 19th century, has resulted in surprisingly efficient pricing, constrained - rather than by information assymmetries - primarily by transaction costs and, over a relatively brief period in 1932-33, by crisis-related liquidity issues in the market.
B16|Frank Ramsey|Frank P. Ramsey (b. 1903 – d. 1930) was a Cambridge mathematician who interacted closely to leading economists of his time such as Arthur Cecil Pigou, John Maynard Keynes and Roy Harrod. In the 1920s he was considered by many as a brilliant student who was clearly integrated to the elite group of Cambridge and who knew and was friend of such luminaries as G. E. Moore, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and also Lytton and James Strachey, Virginia Woolf, Lionel Penrose, Kingsley Martin, Richard Braithwaite, I. A. Richards, and C. K. Ogden. Despite being few in numbers, his contributions to mathematics, logic, philosophy and economics are considered by practitioners in these areas as the most profound and original work in the first half of the twentieth century. This canonization was initiated soon after the untimely death of Ramsey, before completing 27 years of age. Economists portray Ramsey as a sleeping giant, someone with almost no impact until the 1950s, when they finally learned the mathematical tools necessary to apprehend his ideas. Building on my previous works on Ramsey this article surveys his life and work, focusing on economics, and shows how this provides interesting historical windows both to the Cambridge milieu of the 1920s and to the important transformations of economics after World War II.
B16|On the interpretation of Potron’s equations as translations of the social doctrine of the Church|Although Maurice Potron’s mathematical-economic model was clearly based on Christian principles, he almost never explained the links between his model and the doctrine of the Church. This paper explores the possible sources of inspiration of Potron. We look at his family background, his Jesuit network, the Encyclical Rerum Novarum, the Semaines Sociales de France, and the Action Populaire movement. What emerges is that Potron proceeded in a very original and personal way, constructing a model incomparable to anything which existed at the time.
B16|An unexpected discovery: Johann Heinrich von Thuenen and the tragedy of the commons|William Forster Lloyd's 1833 sketch about poor cattle on the commons and the well-fed animals on the adjacent enclosures published in his 'Two lectures on the checks to population' has hitherto been assessed as one starting point of the economics of renewable resources. In the 20th century the question of the use of common property resources has initially been treated by fisheries economists, at first in unknown publications of Jens Warming in 1911 and 1931, and after a disruption of more than 40 years starting again with the contributions of Gordon and Scott in the 1950s. Important results have been the derivation and presentation of the economic criteria for the open access equilibrium case on the one hand and the private property equilibrium case on the other hand. Garrett Hardin's well known 1968 Sciences article brought a new title and increased awareness to the 'tragedy of the commons' and Elenor Ostrom's 2009 nobel prize in economics finally underlined the importance as well as the diversity of institutional rules to achieve an efficient use of the natural resources - challenging the favored liberal concept of a privatization of scarce resources. Johann Heinrich von Thuenen's contributions on the commons - hidden in an 1831 article about urban agriculture in the journal 'Neue Annalen der Mecklenburgischen Landwirtschaftsgesellschaft' and in an unpublished manuscript - have been totally neglected until now, although he published his article about the core problem of the commons two years earlier than William Forster Lloyd and almost in the clarity of the fisheries economists 80 resp. 120 years later. He not only presented the correct allocation criteria for both property rights scenarios but additionally developed a framework a) how to gain the maximal rent of a resource through an auction system - drafting the first demand table b) how to redistribute the gains to the communal property owners - developing an adequate compensation mechanism c) and finally how to establish this institutional innovation democratically - thereby applying important elements of Elenor Ostrom's Common Property Rights Framework. Due to these contributions Johann Heinrich von Thuenen deserves the title of the founder of the economics of renewable resources. Moreover, in combination with his publications on forestry, land use, soil improvement and agricultural processing industries he should also be seen as the creator of a discipline which got its name but now, the creator of bioeconomics.
B16|In Defense Of Dialectics, Multicultural Matrix And Exosomatism: The Concept Of Roegenian Bioeconomics|Dialectics, multicultural matrix and exosomatism are three major ideas marginalized by the contemporary mainstream economic thinking. Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, through the concept of bioeconomics, argumentatively defended epistemic pillars of economic science and elaborated a revolutionary paradigm based on the evolutional principle. This paper aims to integrate, in the UE approach of bioeconomics, the Romanian economist’s original vision, epistemology and methodology of economics.
B16|Sobre las Curvas de Engel. Una Breve Revisión de su Evolución Histórica|Resumen: En este ensayo se presentan algunas reflexiones sobre los cambios conceptuales y metodológicos a lo largo del pensamiento económico en los estudios referentes a curvas de Engel (CE).Comenzando por el ‘inductivismo’ bajo un espíritu no paramétrico del trabajo original de Ernst Engel (1895), hasta la posterior inclusión dentro de la teoría del consumidor del programa de investigación neoclásico o mainstream, y la problemática subsiguiente de la búsqueda de una especificación consistente, en términos de la adecuación con la teoría y del ajuste econométrico.Se sostiene que la incorporación de especificaciones no paramétricas va en línea con una mayor flexibilidad postulada para la relación de Engel siguiendo su contribución original. Sin embargo,la forma en que generalmente es planteada sigue persiguiendo su adecuación con algunos o todos los requerimientos para su consistencia en el marco de la teoría del consumidor.
B16|Accountability y gestión pública. El papel del control y la rendición de cuentas en la gestión de lo público|Este artículo analiza tres formas de gestión de acuerdo con la incorporación de la rendición de cuentas, de la accountability. El argumento central es que una gestión pública sin control ni rendición de cuentas reproduce una brecha entre Estado y ciudadanía y deforma el sentido de lo público que pasa de ser transparente y visible, a oscuro y oculto. Las democracias tienden a establecer cada vez más dispositivos de control y de rendición de cuentas, tanto por exigencias de la sociedad que demanda mayor transparencia, menor corrupción y más participación en el manejo de lo público-estatal, como por requerimientos institucionales de organismos internacionales que imponen formas de control para vigilar el buen uso de los recursos que comprometen con los gobiernos como empréstitos o como aportes al desarrollo en acciones de cooperación internacional. Podemos distinguir tres formas de gestión, las que no incluyen controles ni rendición de cuentas, las que adoptan solo formas interinstitucionales o administrativas y las que incorporan formas de accountability política, administrativa y social.
B16|Giffen’s Good: A case of mistaken identification|Giffen reported that, in the late nineteenth century, English wheat consumption rose when its price increased – the first recorded “Giffen good”. Using Giffen’s data, I explain how he reached his conclusion. I then show that his analysis was faulty: price elasticity of demand appears positive when the demand curve is incorrectly identified, but is significantly negative – like any normal good – when it is correctly identified. Since the pathological Giffen good case was actually just mistaken identification, it is no surprise that Giffen goods are impossible to find elsewhere. Popularization of the Giffen good stemmed from Marshall’s and Samuelson’s influential textbooks.
B16|Irving Fisher And Index Number Theory|There are four main approaches to bilateral index number theory: the fixed basket, stochastic, test and economic approaches. The paper reviews the contributions of Irving Fisher to these approaches to index number theory which are still in use today. The paper also reviews Fisherâ€™s contributions to multilateral index number theory. The main themes of the paper are developed in the context of a review of the early history of index number theory: a history that conveys a wealth of information and insight into the making and use of index numbers today.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B16|Public Debt and J.S. Mill’s Conjecture: A Note|Classical economists - mainly Smith, Ricardo and J.S. Mill - abhorred public debts because of their interference with capital accumulation. J.S. Mill in particular envisaged that a rising public debt leads to higher interest rates and falling real wages, a combination which may be consistent with a mildly increasing trend in the profit rate.
B16|On the Shoulders of Giants: Tracing Back the Intellectual Sources of the Current Debate on “GDP and Beyond” to the 19th Century|An eternal motive of human existence is the search for guidance.While values and beliefs retain their high relevance, today’s enlightened societies also tend to rest their aspirations and decisions on the actual facts and on a sober assessment of possible courses of events emerging from different choices. Given the complexity of modern life, it is by now well understood that this strategy requires objective, comprehensive and accessible statistical reporting. Today, the desire to provide such a valuable basis for individual decisions and policy-making finds one of its most important expressions in the international debate on “GDP and beyond”. In contrast to similar efforts displayed in previous decades, the current projects emphasize sustainability issues and focus on the accessibility of the information, using modern tools of measurement and presentation. Yet, there is ample evidence that even by the mid-19th century economists aspired to use the objectifying power of statistical analysis as an instrument to improve policy-making and to achieve societal progress. Many of the approaches entertained today have thus to be viewed as an extension of attempts started at that time.

B16|Recurrent Price Index Problems and Some Early German Papers on Index Numbers: Notes on Laspeyres, Paasche, Drobisch, and Lehr|With Laspeyres, Paasche and other authors such as Drobisch and Lehr, Germany made quite a promising start in index theory in the last decades of the 19th century. However, it soon lost ground after this period, which is described in this paper. The focus is not on biographies but on controversies where these persons acted as opponents and developed the views for which they are well known. The issues selected are primarily those which are still interesting and controversial today, e. g. the merits and demerits of certain index formulas, the definition and updating of weights, “pure” price comparison vs. chain indices etc. However, in order to aid a better understanding of how Laspeyres etc. arrived at their index formulas and views about the purposes index numbers should serve, some attention is also given to the typical disputes and prejudices of that time (e. g. regarding inflation under the regime of a gold currency).
B16|The St. Petersburg Paradox at 300|Nicolas Bernoulli’s discovery in 1713 that games of hazard may have infinite expected value, later called the St. Petersburg Paradox, initiated the development of expected utility in the following three centuries. An account of the origin and the solution concepts proposed for the St. Petersburg Paradox is provided. D’Alembert’s ratio test is used for a uniform treatment of the manifestations of the St. Petersburg Paradox and its solution proposals. It is also shown that a St. Petersburg Paradox can be solved or regained by appropriate transformations of the winnings or their utilities on the one hand or the probabilities on the other. This last feature is novel for the analysis of the St. Petersburg Paradox. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013

B16|Visualizing multinational daily life via multidimensional scaling (MDS)|One of the notable innovations in social-science methodology developed during the 1960s was Multi- Dimensional Scaling (MDS). MDS made it possible for social scientists to discover, uncover or model the under- lying spatial structure of relations between various social collectives (like countries or communities), social objects (like music or artifacts) or social attitudes. One early application of MDS described the dimensional contours of Americans’ views of other countries in terms of “perceptual maps of the world”. More recently, it has been used to map country differences in the World Values Survey. Spurred by its initial successful applica- tions, MDS was extended to time-diary data collected in the pioneering 1965 Multinational Time-Budget Study, in which it again provided insightful portrayals of daily activity across the 15 national settings in that study. This present article updates and extends these results by applying MDS methods to the most recent diary collection in the Oxford University MTUS data archive – covering more than 20 (mainly European) countries. Once again, the result was plausible (but somewhat different) configurations again emerged from MDS visualizations. Moreover, these mappings were compatible with conclusions from the 1965 mapping and with earlier more conventional analyses.
B16|Abstraction as a Mother of Order? (Historical-Methodological Reflections on the Relation of Economic Science and Economic Policy)|The article deals with the relation between assumptions of economic theories and their political implications. Two canons of economic science are being analyzed according to the degree of abstraction. A hypothesis is that the more abstract formal canon is connected with a liberal kind of economic policy whereas the more concrete canon presupposes an active state intervention in economic affairs. Several attempts at integrating both canons are studied separately (Marshall, Schumpeter, Eucken). Historic evidence is more or less consistent with the hypothesis stated above, but there happens to be one important exclusion: the general equilibrium theory is so abstract that it can imply opposite policies.
B16|A Qualitative Approach In Terms Of Fuzzy Logic Related To The Excellence Achieving Within Managerial Process Of Personnel Selection|The present article aims to design and develop a qualitative methodology using fuzzy logic in order to be a real tool for the managerial decisional factor in solving the multicriteria decisional problems related to the proper selection of the personnel and to the achievement of excellence in this field within a company. In our days, the economical environment characterized by globalization and by a continuous change, offers many times to the decisional factors some situations which are surrounded by uncertainty and ambiguity, fact that in its turn leads to a subjectivism of their reasoning, which is in fact a feature of the abstract thinking of human being itself. This aspects are manifesting also in the field of personnel selection, where the evaluations related to this process are often subjectives, materialized through qualitative linguistic values. In this context, using the proposed fuzzy methodology, embedded in a fuzzy software tool developed in the Java programming language, can offer significantly opportunities and chances to achieve the excellence in this field of research, because the future and performance of any organization depend by the human resources that are working within it
B16|Toolism! A Critique of Econophysics|Economists are fond of the physicists’ powerful tools. As a popular mindset Toolism is as old as economics but the transplants failed to produce the same successes as in their aboriginal environment. Economists therefore looked more and more to the math department for inspiration. Now the tide turns again. The ongoing crisis discredits standard economics and offers the chance for a comeback. Modern econophysics commands the most powerful tools and argues that there are many occasions for their application. The present paper argues that it is not a change of tools that is most urgently needed but a paradigm change.
B16|Vliv efektivních daňových sazeb a jejich komponent na přímé zahraniční investice - případ členských zemí EU<BR>[Impact of Effective Tax Rates and Its Components on Foreign Direct Investment - The Case of the EU Member Countries]|The empirical literature generally accepts the influence of corporate taxes on the investment decision of the multinationalities. The most papers usually consider more aspect of that tax then only statutory corporate tax rate. Using annual time series data for the period 1998-2011 this paper examines the influence of EMTR and EATR including their components on the foreign direct investments in the EU Member states. The main aim of the paper is to evaluate which of the selected types of effective tax rates explains the investment decisions of the multinationalities the best. The results show that the commonly used indicators of effective tax burden are not the best option for foreign direct investment (FDI) explanation in the investigated model. Perhaps the best indicator for evaluating dependencies between explanatory variables and FDI are the average and marginal effective tax rate from industrial buildings.
B16|Financialization and Global Imbalances|The concept of â€œfinancializationâ€ has informed recent analyses of the contemporary dynamics of monopoly capitalism. In the wake of the global financial crisis in 2007-08, the strategic role of finance and its capacity to destabilize the real economy and push it to the brink of economic depression has rekindled debates over the historical causes and institutional forms which have characterized this phase of capitalist evolution. In other words, to what extent have the neoliberal policies pursued by most OECD countries over the past 30 years contributed to the emergence of this finance-led regime of accumulation? More specifically, what are the implications of the extraordinary build-up of private debt, which has financed private consumption and fuelled successive asset price and stock market euphoric bubbles over this period? At the same time, the problem of growing global imbalances between the surplus countries/regions and the deficit countries/regions has emerged as a major source of financial instability. It will be proposed that the breakdown of the mechanisms, which have supported the dynamics of financialization, have set the stage for the current global capitalist crisis.

B16|Die „Frankfurter Schule“ in der Statistik und ihre Folgen|“Frankfurt School” (FSS) here denotes a group of statisticians (three generations of professors at the University of Frankfurt/Germany). The period in which FSS was fairly active and influential covered about six decades beginning in the 1920ies. The school focused “understanding” and verbal interpretation of statistics rather than developing mathematically advanced methods in statistics. It deliberately emphasized problems of descriptive and official statistics at the expense of a more “formal” approach. Hence one of the consequences of the temporary sway of the FSS in German statistics was Germany’s lagging behind in the respective fields of Statistics after the Second World War.

B16|Real and financial crises: A multi-agent approach|Previous analyses of macroeconomic imbalances have employed models that either focus exclusively on real-side effects or financial-side disturbances. Real-side models usually make the unrealistic assumption that firms that save more than they invest effortlessly and costlessly transfer those surpluses to deficit firms, firms that require additional savings to sustain their plans for capital accumulation. On the other hand, there exists a well-developed, rigorous and elegant literature that uses the multi-agent systems (MAS) approach to analyze the recent financial crisis. These stand-alone models of the financial sector focus on the network structure of financial interplay but typically ignore real side interactions. In this paper, we develop a MAS model that integrates real and financial elements. The focus remains on the network structure and it is seen that randomly connected networks are more crash prone than are preferentially attached networks of financial agents. when real-financial interactions are taken into account. The results cast doubt on the connection between systemic risk and financial entities that are “too big or too linked to fail.”
B16|Ellsberg Rules and Keynes’s State of Long-Term Expectation: More Than an Accordance|This paper advances an intuitive way to represent Keynes’s notion of long-term expectation. The epsilon-contamination approach is introduced and a rational and coherent decision rule is derived. The result is evidence that Ellsberg and Keynes share the notion of uncertainty and adopt the same class of decision rules.
B16|Income Mobility – Curse or Blessing? Mobility in Social Security Earnings: Data on West-German Men since 1950|Descriptions and analyses of citizens' or households' income have a long tradition in economics. A large body of research has recognized that levels of income and how income is distributed are important contributors to the wealth of nations. Within the broader context of income and its distribution, there has also been a considerable amount of research on the process underlying income distribution that is, income mobility. The relevance of income mobility is manifold. First of all, mobility is an indicator for an open society providing economic opportunities for everyone. As people are normally risk averse, they are interested in a steady income stream. This can be called the security aspect. Another facet of income mobility is the incentive aspect. Upward mobility provides incentives for successful economic activity as it is possible to move up the income ladder. If upward mobility offers the “carrot”, downward mobility epitomizes the “stick” of economic activity. Downward mobility increases insecurity and insecurity is harmful to well-being. We use data covering the whole working lives of workers/employees to shed light on income mobility. This will result in more information about the adequacy of some assumptions of the life-cycle theory concerning the development of income over time – and especially on the inverse U-shape assumption of income profiles.
B16|Institutional strengthening of the free market in the new economic history|The article highlights the current theories in the New Economic History, explaining the market social order rules imposed in the Western World in the post Renaissance period. The social order structure, based on impersonal exchange and rational prudence, differing from any other order in the history of human societies, is derived from a specific set of political and military conditions and world view. The institutional decisions taken as a result thereof enable the contemporary levels of production, trade and economic growth. The applied explanatory approach integrates on the ground of their common features the alternative concepts of this process elaborated by À. Greif, À. Acemoglu and J. Robinson, D. North, J. Wallis and B. Weingast.

B16|Revisiting Adam Smith's theory of the falling rate of profit|Purpose - This paper aims to present the salient features of Smith's argument of the falling rate of profit. This theory has usually been interpreted as a result of the intensification of competition in the markets of goods and services of the factors of production. This aspect of Adam Smith had been initially posed by Ricardo and subsequently was widely adopted by the major economists of the past as well as from the majority of the modern historians of economic thought. Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews the major interpretation of the argument from Ricardo and Marx as well as from major historians of economic thought, and then attempts to reconstruct Smith's argument, which is scattered throughout the Findings - In the author's view, Smith's analysis of the falling tendency in the rate of profit is by far more complex than usually presented and that the intensification of competition is the result of the falling rate of profit rather than its cause which is the capitalization of the production process. Originality/value - This paper presents a review of existing literature and an interpretation of Adam Smith's original model of the falling rate of profit.
B16|Malthus fs Criticism of Adam Smith and Dynamic Mechanism of Population in the First Edition of Principle of Population|Two issues are addressed in this paper. First, we analyze with a simple mathematical model Thomas Robert Malthus fs critique of Adam Smith, the most theoretically discussed part in the first edition of Principle of Population. Second, by introducing a differential equation for the dynamics of price, unlike most of the other present scholars, we explain Malthus fs dynamic mechanism of population more in detail, and thereby reconsider and reinforce his idea of encouraging investment in agriculture discussed in his critique of Smith. Thereby, we show that under the assumption set forth by Malthus, economic development created by investment in agriculture is more desirable compared to investment in manufacturing, in the view of social welfare; that Malthus fs idea implied some type of precursory Keynesian idea, that is, the creation through policy of effective demand to agriculture, not to manufacture, leads to economic growth with improvement in social welfare.
B16|On the mathematic prediction of economic and social crises: toward a harmonic interpretation of the Kondratiev wave|In Part One of this paper we use the harmonic analogy of a musical octave to analyze mathematic ratios of U.S. real GNP. These ratios are generated by bringing together figures for U.S. real GNP over intervals of time – “spreads of years” – as numerator and denominator in a single fraction. Using a range of 7-year to 18-year “spreads,” we find that this approach provides strong evidence that American economic history is composed of four 14-year quarter-cycles within a 56 year circuit in the real GNP of the United States, 1869-2007. These periods correlate closely with analysis by Nickolai Kondratiev and provide a framework for predicting an annual steady state rate of growth for the United States falling between 3.4969% and 3.4995% per year. In Part Two of this paper we provide three postscripts including: (1) correlations / speculations on the political and social consequences of this model, (2) simplification / expansion of the geometries implied and (3) analysis / prediction based upon this approach, as concluded by a brief afterword. These post-script refinements narrow the steady state rate of growth predicted to between 3.4969% and 3.4973% per year correlating closely with the 3.4971% rate for annualized quarterly data calculated for Okun’s Law, 1947-2007. The size and interconnectedness of world economies, and the virtually exact correlations provided herein, suggest that the dates predicted for future crises will see changes which are unexpectedly global, dramatic and fierce.
B16|Methodological Mistakes and Econometric Consequences|Econometric Methodology is based on logical positivist principles. Since logical positivism has collapsed, it is necessary to re-think these foundations. We show that positivist methodology has led econometricians to a meaningless search for patterns in the data. An alternative methodology which relates observed patterns to real causal structures is proposed.
B16|Keynes’s probability: An introduction to the theory of logical groups|The present work is intended to be an informal introduction to the theory of abstract logi- cal groups. This particular formalization stems from some concepts of abstract algebra and the Johnson-Keynes’s theory of groups. Therefore the aim of this paper is that of provide the readers with the logical reasoning behind this brand new theory. I shall depict the philosophical notions as bases of the Keynes’s probability and then I shall explain it in terms of group. Furthermore we shall see, albeit roughly, a first definition of abstract groups.
B16|On Keynes's Z-function|This paper is intended to give a general, but rigorous view about what is the Z-function and what are the hidden relations of the Keynes’s General Theory. In Section 1 I shall depict the concept of probability and that of the weight of argument, in Section 2 I shall introduce quite an important deﬁnitions such as the Z-function is diﬀerent from the Z∗-curve, and some paramount notions. The Section 4 is intended to grasp the importance of the chapters 20-21 of the General Theory, whereas in Section 5 I shall comment, very quickly, some properties of Z∗ in a topological view.
B16|How Capitalism, University and Mathematics as Institutions Shaped Mainstream Economics|The article shows that mainstream economics, which now includes such current as new institutional economics, is the result of an evolution shaped by three institutions (capitalism, university and mathematics) by imposing to the profession of economists their founding beliefs. These beliefs are: ‘laissez-faire’; ‘economic knowledge has a priori and exegetical character’; ‘all mathematical entities exist in reality’; ‘beauty is a criterion for theoretical constructions’; ‘scientific research is a play with axioms and rules of inference’. Because of these beliefs mainstream economics, based on mathematical constructions arbitrarily borrowed from the physics of the nineteenth century, remains cognitively sterile and socially detrimental.
B16|Steindl on Stochastic Processes|Steindl's work on stochastic processes aims to describe the economy as in a state of imbalance, due to the fact that its starting conditions are an accident of history, and nobody has a clue what tomorrow will bring. This does not mean that we cannot imagine a balanced distribution - when the various forces of change are constant - as a way of pointing out certain fundamental characteristics. Such a purpose is compatible with the use of stochastic models, because these also entail the study of systematic phenomena. In fact, what we often describe as 'random' is the result of lots and lots of independent forces acting together on a particular phenomenon.
B16|Recent Advances in Financial Engineering 2011|This book is the Proceedings of the International Workshop on Finance 2011, held in Kyoto in the summer of 2011 with the aim of exchanging new ideas in financial engineering among researchers from various countries from both academia and industry. The workshop was held as a successor to the Daiwa International Workshop (2004–2008), and the KIER-TMU International Workshop (2009–2010). This workshop was organized by the Center for Advanced Research in Finance (CARF), Graduate School of Economics, the University of Tokyo, and Graduate School of Social Sciences, Tokyo Metropolitan University — and co-organized by Life Risk Research Center, Doshisha University.
B16|On Pricing Contingent Capital Notes|AbstractA bank's stock price is modeled as a call option on the spread of random assets over random liabilities. The logarithm of assets and liabilities are jointly modeled as driven by four variance gamma processes and this model is estimated by calibrating to quoted equity options seen as compound spread options. On defining riskweighted assets as asset value less the bid price plus the ask price of liabilities less the liability value we endogenize capital adequacy ratios following the methods of conic finance for the bid and ask prices. All computations are illustrated on CSGN.VX, ADRed into USD on March 29 2011.
B16|A Survey on Modeling and Analysis of Basis Spreads|"AbstractThe recent financial crisis has spiked the credit and liquidity premia among financial products, and significant widening of basis spreads among Libors with different tenors and currencies has been observed in interest rate markets. Our previous work, ""A Note on Construction of Multiple Swap Curves with and without Collateral"" has developed an arbitrage-free curve construction method with all the relevant spreads taken into account. This short note carries out a brief survey on the existing analysis of spreads' dynamics and pricing models as a preparation for the development of a model that enables us to price and hedge generic financial derivatives under the new market condition."
B16|Conservative Delta Hedging under Transaction Costs|AbstractExplicit robust hedging strategies for convex or concave payoffs under a continuous semimartingale model with uncertainty and small transaction costs are constructed. In an asymptotic sense, the upper and lower bounds of the cumulative volatility enable us to super-hedge convex and concave payoffs respectively. The idea is a combination of Mykland's conservative delta hedging and Leland's enlarging volatility. We use a specific sequence of stopping times as rebalancing dates, which can be superior to equidistant one even when there is no model uncertainty. A central limit theorem for the super-hedging error as the coefficient of linear transaction costs tends to zero is proved. The mean squared error is also studied.
B16|The Theory of Optimal Investment in Information Security and Adjustment Costs: An Impulse Control Approach|AbstractThis paper applies the theory of real options and impulse control to information security investment and derives properties of an optimal investment rule. It also incorporates adjustment costs incurred whenever the level of the investment changes. We observe among others that if firm has opportunity of multiple investments, it behaves so cautiously that the timing is earlier and to invest more. Both adjustment costs and volatility of threat make interval of the investment longer, while vulnerability leads to shorter interval and therefore frequent investment.
B16|Strategic Investment with Three Asymmetric Firms|AbstractThis paper examines the strategic investment timing problem in the case of three firms with different cost structures. We extend the strategic investment timing problem by allowing the number of asymmetric firms to range from two to three. Surprisingly, we show that the firm with the lowest cost structure is not always the first investor in the investment timing problem with three asymmetric firms. The mechanism of strategies in the case with three asymmetric firms is quite different from that with two asymmetric firms.
B16|An Empirical Analysis of Japanese Interest Rate Swap Spread|AbstractThis paper investigates the three risk factors for interest rate swap spreads in the Japanese market: volatility of interest rate, liquidity risk, and default risk of counterparty. These factors have been regarded as main determinants by most previous researches. We compare relative importance of the risk factors among the three different regimes classified by economic conditions in Japan: Lost Decade of Japan, zero-interest rate period and global financial crisis period. We employ a standard constant-coefficient regression model with the GARCH error terms, and extend it to a timevarying coefficient regression model which allows the coefficients possibly change along with time.Our empirical results indicate that the investors' sensitivities to each factor do not stay fixed over the whole sample period, but change along with the day by day market conditions. The risk factors exhibit different properties among the different regimes. The findings of this paper shed some new insights into the interest rate swap market in Japan, and reconfirm results of previous analytical researches on the financial turmoil of Japan in the last twenty years.
B16|A Remark on Approximation of the Solutions to Partial Differential Equations in Finance|AbstractThis paper proposes a general approximation method for the solution to a second-order parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) widely used in finance through an extension of Léandre's approach (Léandre, 2006, 2008) and the Bismut identiy (e.g. chapter IX-7 of Malliavin, 1997) in Malliavin calculus. We present two types of its applications, approximations of derivatives prices and short-time asymptotic expansions of the heat kernel. In particular, we provide approximate formulas for option prices under local and stochastic volatility models. We also derive short-time asymptotic expansions of the heat kernel under general timehomogenous local volatility and local-stochastic volatility models in finance, which include Heston (Heston, 1993) and (λ-)SABR models (Hagan et al., 2002; Labordere, 2008) as special cases. Some numerical examples are shown.
B16|Optimal Trading with Cointegrated Pairs of Stocks|"AbstractIn general, stock prices are believed to evolve according to a random walk and thus the prices of the stock market cannot be predicted. However, in some stock markets, we can observe that there are pairs of stocks whose movements look similar, characterized as ""cointegration of pairs of stocks."" In this paper, we demonstrate how to search for cointegrated pairs of stocks and construct optimal portfolios based on the following two techniques: (1) Mean-variance optimization which solves a single period problem and (2) Expected utility maximization in the terminal wealth at a specified time in the future. We perform out-of-sample simulations using empirical stock price data in Japan, and then examine the effects of parameter estimation periods and transaction costs."
B16|Analytical Approximation of Pricing Average Options under the Heston Model|AbstractThis paper proposes a new approximation formula for pricing average options under Heston's stochastic volatility model. When using the formula based on the Gram-Charlier expansion, it is necessary to know any moments of an averaged underlying asset price. We try to derive an analytical solution of the moments under the Heston model. There are two key points of the derivation: One of them is to repeatedly apply change of a certain measure. Another is to sequentially solve a system of ordinary differential equations. Moreover, numerical examples support the accuracy of the proposed average option pricing formula.
B16|O “novo” consenso macroeconômico e alguns insights da crítica heterodoxa|The new consensus macroeconomics and some insights from a heterodox critique - This paper aims to survey the main contributions to the literature on the “new” consensus in macroeconomics in which the efforts for convergence among the distinct theories that support this approach are discussed. It also seemed appropriate to underscore the main authors who postulate such convergence. The resulting core for economic policies is then presented. Next, some insights on the heterodox critique are summarized. Emphasis was given to the post-Keynesian perspective. Thus, this paper amplifies the debate Arestis and Sawer (2008) proposed in an earlier issue of this journal. At this stage, the reader might find it clear that the critiques are the same as those which governed the debate among Keynes and the classics in the first half of the twentieth century. Conclusions indicate that more research is necessary in this area and that, at both sides of the debate, it is important to summarize the arguments in a coherent fashion in order to consolidate a theoretical framework.
B16|Formalizing a new approach to economic policy - Bent Hansen, Gösta Rehn and the Swedish model|In the early postwar years, two trade-union economists, Gösta Rehn and Rudolf Meidner, presented a Swedish alternative to Keynesianism. The so-called Rehn- Meidner model recommends restrictive macroeconomic policies, labor market policy programs and solidarity wages to combine price stability with economic growth, equity and full employment. In the 1950s, Bent Hansen evaluated the effects of the Rehn-Meidner policy and the validity of its underpinning theory. Hansen’s rigor analysis shall not conceal that, even together with Rehn, he was unable to shed light on the positive relationship between average profits and labor scarcity in the Rehn-Meidner model or all relations between its policy means.
B16|On Envelope Theorems in Economics: Inspired by a Revival of a Forgotten Lecture|This paper studies how envelope theorems have been used in Economics, their history and also who first introduced them. The existing literature is full of them and the reason is that all families of optimal value functions can produce them. The paper is driven by curiosity, but hopefully it will give the reader some new insights.

B16|Az egyensúlyi ráták unicitása és a bérráta pozitivitása a Neumann-modell általánosításaiban<BR>[Uniqueness of equilibrium rates and the positive value of the wage rate in generalizations from the Neumann model]|Cikkünk arról a paradox jelenségről szól, hogy a fogyasztást explicit módon megjelenítő Neumann-modell egyensúlyi megoldásaiban a munkabért meghatározó létszükségleti termékek ára esetenként nulla lehet, és emiatt a reálbér egyensúlyi értéke is nulla lesz. Ez a jelenség mindig bekövetkezik az olyan dekomponálható gazdaságok esetén, amelyekben eltérő növekedési és profitrátájú, alternatív egyensúlyi megoldások léteznek. A jelenség sokkal áttekinthetőbb formában tárgyalható a modell Leontief-eljárásra épülő egyszerűbb változatában is, amit ki is használunk. Megmutatjuk, hogy a legnagyobbnál alacsonyabb szintű növekedési tényezőjű megoldások közgazdasági szempontból értelmetlenek, és így érdektelenek. Ezzel voltaképpen egyrészt azt mutatjuk meg, hogy Neumann kiváló intuíciója jól működött, amikor ragaszkodott modellje egyértelmű megoldásához, másrészt pedig azt is, hogy ehhez nincs szükség a gazdaság dekomponálhatóságának feltételezésére. A vizsgált téma szorosan kapcsolódik az általános profitráta meghatározásának - Sraffa által modern formába öntött - Ricardo-féle elemzéséhez, illetve a neoklasszikus növekedéselmélet nevezetes bér-profit, illetve felhalmozás-fogyasztás átváltási határgörbéihez, ami jelzi a téma elméleti és elmélettörténeti érdekességét is.

B16|Coupled Dynamics in a Phillips Machine Model of the Macroeconomy|In this paper it is claimed that the Phillips machine, contrary to what is sometimes believed, is a nonlinear mechanism. Phillips (1950) presented his machines, as formally described, with linear differential equations. In doing so, he fell into what Samuelson came later to define as the linearity dogma. It is argued here that the Phillips machines are not linear mechanisms but are coherent with a system of nonlinear difference-differential equations. Here, this system is in turn approximated with a set of nonlinear differential equations, which are isomorphic with the Hicks-Goodwin flexible multiplier accelerator models. Consistent with this conjecture and following a Goodwin-Phillips' suggestion, we have presented a «digital» simulation of two coupled would-be Phillips machines. Whether the data generated with the set of nonlinear difference equations is consistent with the observations emerging from the actual coupled Phillips machines could be verified by comparing the data emerging from the two systems - the digital and the analogue ones.
B16|A critical perspective on heterodox production modeling|Production and distribution needs a proper place in heterodox economics. It has recently been suggested that the construction of production models needs to be empirically grounded. Also it has been stated that empirically grounded production models must be circular production models. This argument then marginalizes the contributions of important economists in heterodox thought. The paper will argue that heterodox production models need not be perfectly circular to make important contributions for heterodox production theory. Furthermore, it will be argued that models which consist of elements of hierarchial structures of production put emphasis on out of equilibrium traverse processes and historical time.
B16|Taxation and political stability|The present study is, in particular, an attempt to test the relationship between tax level and political stability by using some economic control variables and to see the relationship among government effectiveness, corruption, and GDP. For the purpose, we used the Vector Autoregression (VAR) approach in the panel framework, using a country-level panel data from 59 countries for the period 2002 to 2008. The salient features of this model are: (a) simplicity is based on a limited number of variables(five) are categorical or continuous and not dependent on complex interactions or nonlinear effects. (b) accuracy: a low level of errors, the model achieves a high percentage of accuracy in distinguishing countries with inclination to political instability, compared to countries with political stability, (c) generality: the model allows to distinguish types of political instability, both resulting from acts of violence and failure of democracies to show, and (d) novelty: the model incorporates a tool that helps evaluate and exclude many variables used by the conventional literature. This approach is mainly based on the recognition of state structures and the relations between elites and parties.
B16|Ternary bookkeeping by F. V. Ezerski (1836-1916)|The article remembers the 140th anniversary of the first publication of a formal bookkeeping system ‘Accounting by ternary entry’ by the F. V. Ezerski. This system was an innovation of bookkeeping practice then. It permits the complex information of the assets and liabilities changes and of the changes in income and cash flow as well. Past formal bookkeeping systems were striving to simplify the journalizing and posting processes of accounting figures by spreading the potential of information.
B16|Zur Herleitung der Thünen'schen Grabsteinformel|In Abhandlungen von Dorfman und Samuelson 1986 und van Suntum 1988 wird Thünen's berühmte Grabsteinformel unter Berücksichtigung seiner spezifischen Annahmen bestätigt. Allerdings wird Thüenen's Vorgehen zur Erzielung dieses Ergebnisses bis heute kontrovers diskutiert. Mit diesem Papier wird versucht, Thüenen's Vorgehen Schritt für Schritt nachzuvollziehen. Zu diesem Zweck wird Thüenen's Ableitung zunächst graphisch dargestellt. Anschließend wird eine algebraische Rekonstruktion des Problems dem Thünen'schen Vorgehen gegenüber gestellt. Bestätigungen und Kritiken der Lohnformel in den letzten Dekaden werden vor diesem Hintergrund kurz kommentiert.
B16|Retrospectives: Engel Curves|"Engel curves describe how household expenditure on particular goods or services depends on household income. German statistician Ernst Engel (1821-1896) was the first to investigate this relationship systematically in an article published about 150 years ago. The best-known single result from the article is ""Engel's law,"" which states that the poorer a family is, the larger the budget share it spends on nourishment. We revisit Engel's article, including its context and the mechanics of the argument. Because the article was completed a few decades before linear regression techniques were established and income effects were incorporated into standard consumer theory, Engel was forced to develop his own approach to analyzing household expenditure patterns. We find his work contains some interesting features in juxtaposition to both the modern and classical literature. For example, Engel's way of estimating the expenditure-income relationship resembles a data-fitting technique called the ""regressogram"" that is nonparametric -- in that no functional form is specified before the estimation. Moreover, Engel introduced a way of categorizing household expenditures in which expenditures on commodities that served the same purpose by satisfying the same underlying ""want"" were grouped together. This procedure enabled Engel to discuss the welfare implications of his results in terms of the Smithian notion that individual welfare is related to the satisfaction of wants. At the same time, he avoided making a priori assumptions about which specific goods were necessities, assumptions which were made by many classical economists like Adam Smith. Finally, we offer a few thoughts about some modern literature that builds on Engel's research."
B16|How to design institutional frameworks for markets. New institutional economics meet the needs of industrial organization|The key role of institutions for economic performance has recently been acknowledged in the economic policy debate. This paper aims at pointing out the main policy lessons and the recommendations to be drawn from New Institutional Economics (NIE), when considering the organization of markets. We examine, first, the domains – namely the establishment of property rights, the management of externalities and the maintenance of the competitive process – on which NIE identifies the potential impact of institutional tools on market performance. Second, we highlight the tradeoffs identified in the literature regarding the organization of an institutional system. This leads us to consider the respective virtues and drawbacks of hierarchical vs. transactional, public vs. private, centralized vs. decentralized and formal vs. informal ordering. Finally, we conclude by showing how NIE draws attention to the difficulties faced by political or economic decision-makers when they attempt to enhance market efficiency by reforming institutional frameworks.
B16|A.-A. Cournot et les fondements théoriques de l''économie industrielle : un éclairage historique|This paper examines the contribution of Cournot’s Researches into the mathe­matical principles of the theory of wealth (1838) to the foundations of industrial economics. It is argued that this contri­bution shall not be presented as the dis­covery of a set of theoretical results linked to partial equilibrium price theory. We support the opposite idea that the contribution of the Researches, far from being direct and univocal, proceeds from a long and complex phenomenon of reinterpretation by later economists. More precisely, it is argued that Cournot hadn’t conceived this study of market structures (monopoly, duopoly, and « unlimited competition ») as general scheme of price theory. Through an examination of the historical context of Cournot’s mathematical model, we try to restore its origi­nal meaning. We show that this model was originally built in order to solve a specific problem related to measurement of value, in a classical ricardian perspective. It is argued, finally, that Cournot’s contribution to industrial economics was much more methodological than theoretical.
B16|Las instituciones laborales en Colombia Contexto histórico de sus antecedentes y principales desarrollos hasta 1990|La historia de las instituciones laborales colombianas gira alrededor del Código Sustantivo del Trabajo expedido en 1950. Aunque con antecedentes memorables en la legislación indiana, las primeras leyes laborales vieron la luz en las dos décadas de apertura del siglo XX; su florecimiento correspondió al período transcurrido entre las dos guerras mundiales, y la tarea de codificación se adelantó a fines de los cuarenta, de modo que el Código pudo expedirse en 1950 para que entrara en vigencia a partir de 1951. Los cambios que desde entonces se han introducido en las instituciones laborales del país, se han materializado como reformas al Código Sustantivo del Trabajo. La experiencia de un país con sus instituciones laborales no es independiente de su organización económica y política, y de sus relaciones con el resto del mundo. No sólo la economía, la política, y las tradiciones jurídicas, sino un amplio espectro de influencias culturales contribuyen a cimentar sus instituciones laborales. La construcción de dichas instituciones no transcurre en el vacío o limitada a sucesos cuyos alcances no desbordan las fronteras nacionales. La experiencia latinoamericana es ilustrativa de numerosos paralelos, similitudes, y en ocasiones de caminos alternativos que confluyeron en la formación de sus instituciones laborales; diversas iniciativas de legislación laboral en Colombia fueron adoptadas tras la revisión explícita de lo aprendido en otras partes del continente. Numerosas experiencias latinoamericanas revelan que la adopción de sus instituciones laborales no fue un proceso expedito; en Colombia, el Código Laboral vino a plasmarse varias décadas después de haberse planteado las primeras tentativas sistemáticas de organización codificada de la legislación. Además, dichos intentos no llevaron siempre el rótulo exclusivo de una ideología o partido político; con frecuencia el tema laboral sirvió de campo de acercamiento entre quienes parecían enarbolar banderas diferentes. La legislación laboral europea arribó a las costas latinoamericanas a principios del siglo XX con el sello de legislación protectora; dicho énfasis protector se afianzó en la primera posguerra, y conservó su predominio hasta entrados los años setenta, cuando se le achacó la falta de flexibilidad de los mercados laborales en numerosas economías. Las tres primeras grandes secciones de este trabajo se ocupan del surgimiento de la legislación laboral moderna en Europa y en los Estados Unidos. La cuarta está dedicada íntegramente a la formación de las instituciones laborales colombianas.
B16|Technical Change and Polarization of the Labor Market: Evidence for Brazil, Colombia and Mexico|We use occupations descriptions for Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, to build computer-use related tasks intensities, and link then to series of cross sections of data of each country in order to empirically assess to what extent the observed empirical regularities, and the reallocation of workers across occupations that require different tasks intensities, are consistent with the SBTC or polarization models. We find an increase of both wages and workers at the extremes of the wage or skills occupations distribution, the less routinaire/computerizabe, particularly pronounced in the period since personal computers began to be introduced in the region. This finding, along with other empirical regularities, provides support for some of the main implications of the polarization model in the cases of Colombia and Mexico.
B16|Early Neoclassical views on Monopoly: the Cournotian heritage|In spite of Cournot´s unquestionable influence on contemporary theory, his legacy regarding economic policy and, especially, the regulation of monopolies is mostly unknown. In this paper I explore the several forms of Cournot´s analysis of monopolistic market structures, starting with his theoretical model up to his normative and empirical examination. With the help of little known texts of the author I aim at showing the versatility of his ideas and the richness of his analytical legacy. Against this setup I retrace his influence over three of the most important economists of the end of the XIXth century: Walras, Edgeworth and Marshall. I show that there exists a theoretical representation that constitutes the indisputable reference regarding monopolies that is enriched with normative analyses and leads each one of them to their own specific proposals in regulation and economic policy. RESUMENA pesar de la influencia teórica indiscutible de Cournot sobre la teoría contemporánea, su legado en relación con las políticas económicas y en particular con la regulación de los monopolios es mucho menor. Este trabajo explora las formas diversas que tiene el análisis de las estructuras monopólicas de mercado propuesto por Cournot, partiendo de su modelo teórico hasta su análisis más normativo y empírico. Utilizando textos poco conocidos del autor se pone en evidencia la versatilidad de sus ideas y la riqueza de su legado analítico. A partir de estos elementos se intenta reconstruir la influencia que sus ideas tuvieron sobre tres de los principales autores de finales del siglo XIX: Walras, Edgeworth y Marshall. Se muestra que existe una representación teórica que constituye la referencia indiscutible sobre los monopolios pero que se enriquece en los análisis normativos y resulta en propuestas de regulación y de política económica diversas que cada uno de estos autores desarrolla y se apropia de manera diferente.
B16|Two New Zealand pioneer econometricians| Two distinguished New Zealanders pioneered some of the foundations of modern econometrics. Alec Aitken, one of the most famous and well-documented mental arithmeticians of all time, contributed the matrix formulation and projection geometry of linear regression, generalized least squares (GLS) estimation, algorithms for Hodrick Prescott (HP) style data smoothing (six decades before their use in economics), and statistical estimation theory leading to the Cramer Rao bound. Rex Bergstrom constructed and estimated by limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) the largest empirical structural model in the early 1950s, opened up the field of exact distribution theory, developed cyclical growth models in economic theory, and spent nearly 40 years of his life developing the theory of continuous time econometric modeling and its empirical application. We provide an overview of their lives, discuss some of their accomplishments, and develop some new econometric theory that connects with their foundational work.
B16|Structural Macro-Econometric Modelling in a Policy Environment|The paper looks at the development of macroeconometric models over the past sixty years. In particular those that have been used for analysing policy options. We argue that there have been four generations of these. Each generation has evolved new features that have been partly drawn from the developing academic literature and partly from the perceived weaknesses in the previous generation. Overall the evolution has been governed by a desire to answer a set of basic questions and sometimes by what can be achieved using new computational methods. Our account of each generation considers their design, the way in which parameters were quantified and how they were evaluated.
B16|Can statistics do without artefacts?|This companion paper to Chatelain and Ralf (2012), “Spurious regressions with near-multicollinearity” put their results into the contexts of the history of statistics, of the current publication bias in applied sciences and of the substantive versus statistical significance debate. This article presents a particular case of spurious regression, when a dependent variable has a coefficient of simple correlation close to zero with two other variables, which are, on the contrary, highly correlated with each other. In these spurious regressions, the parameters measuring the size of the effect on the dependent variable are very large. They can be “statistically significant”. The tendency of scientific journals to favour the publication of statistically significant results is one reason why spurious regressions are so numerous, especially since it is easy to build them with variables that are lagged, squared or interacting with another variable. Such regressions can enhance the reputation of researchers by stimulating the appearance of strong effects between variables. These often surprising effects are not robust and often depend on a limited number of observations, fuelling scientific controversies. The resulting meta-analyses, based on statistical synthesis of the literature evaluating this effect between two variables, confirm the absence of any effect. This article provides an example of this phenomenon in the empirical literature, with the aim of evaluating the impact of development aid on economic growth.
B16|A Brief History of Production Functions|This paper gives an outline of evolution of the concept and econometrics of production function, which was one of the central apparatus of neoclassical economics. It shows how the famous Cobb-Douglas production function was indeed invented by von Thünen and Wicksell, how the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function was formulated, how the elasticity of substitution was made a variable and finally how Sato’s function incorporated biased technical changes. It covers almost all specifications proposed during 1950 to 1975, as well as the linear-exponential (LINEX) production functions and incorporation of energy as an input. The paper is divided into single product functions, joint product functions, and aggregate production functions. It also discusses the ‘capital controversy’ and its impacts.
B16|The Contributions of Two Eminent Japanese Scholars on the Development of Economic Theories: Michio Morishima and Takashi Negishi|There can be no doubt that Michio Morishima and Takashi Negishi are two of the most important historians of economic thought of the recent past. Both authors contributed numerous papers and books to the subject, dealing with the works of major economists from the very inception of systematic economic thought at the time of the classical economists up until modern times. And both authors combined a vivid interest in modern economic theory with an interest in what past masters had to say. The paper assesses and compares the motivations of the two authors to engage in the history of economic theories, their similar, but different approaches to do historical research, and their achievements in this regard. Given the remarkable amount of work each one of them accomplished, the paper has to focus attention on a subset of the themes the two authors dealt with. The emphasis will be on (i) their treatment of the classical theories of value, distribution and capital accumulation, especially those of Adam Smith and David Ricardo, (ii) their discussion of the contributions of Karl Marx and some Marxists, (iii) their interpretation of some early and mature marginalist economists, especially Léon Walras, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and Knut Wicksell, and (iv) their views about the achievements of John Maynard Keynes. Given the intrinsic complexity of each of these themes, it goes without saying that the paper is bound to proceed largely in terms of synthetic statements.
B16|Economics and Hegemony; Globalization and International Trade Agreements|This paper examines the concept of hegemony and its historical impacts on the Arabic and Islamic countries. It is foreseen that has long path applied by the Western countries as disclosed by trade applications and history of economic thought. Impacts on Arabic and Islamic countries were visible in terms of trade, balances and persistent debts. A strong tool is evident with the called for integration, interdependence and the generated dependency syndrome. The establishment of that mechanism depends on a theory which we present as the Hegemonic Stability. The Arabic and Islamic countries did not succeed to form their effective economic blocks in order to counter such hegemonic effects because of their internal political structure which affect the structure of their international trade and economic benefits.
B16|Can Statistics Do without Artefacts?|"This article presents a particular case of spurious regression, when a dependent variable has a coefficient of simple correlation close to zero with two other variables, which are, on the contrary, highly correlated with each other. In these spurious regressions, the parameters measuring the size of the effect on the dependent variable are very large. They can be ""statistically significant"". The tendency of scientific journals to favour the publication of statistically significant results is one reason why spurious regressions are so numerous, especially since it is easy to build them with variables that are lagged, squared or interacting with another variable. Such regressions can enhance the reputation of researchers by stimulating the appearance of strong effects between variables. These often surprising effects are not robust and often depend on a limited number of observations, fuelling scientific controversies. The resulting meta-analyses, based on statistical synthesis of the literature evaluating this effect between two variables, confirm the absence of any effect. This article provides an example of this phenomenon in the empirical literature, with the aim of evaluating the impact of development aid on economic growth."
B16|Czech Historian and Theorist Hugo Raulich (1866 - 1940)|This profile memorializes the 70th anniversary of the edition of ‘Bookkeeping treatise’, by Luca Pacioli in Czech version by Hugo Raulich. This treatise has been clearly translated by Raulich nearly fifty years and finally edited in 1940 as part of the economic encyclopedia ‘Slovník obchodně technický, účetní a daňový’. Hugo Raulich passes away some months after this edition (October 19, 1940).
B16|Measuring productivity increase by long-run prices: the early analyses of G.R. Porter and R. Giffen| The nineteenth-century economic commentators did not possess a formal measure of the rate at which productivity was increasing during the industrial take-off. Yet they did develop an intuitive method based on the comparative change in long-period prices and wages. This paper reviews the contributions of G.R. Porter and R. Giffen and, in the light of some modern contributions, presents an assessment of their rationality and improvability under current standards. It is argued that a proper measure of industrial productivity increase based on long-run prices is the mathematical dual of a Solovian measure of the industrial total factor productivity growth.
B16|A BRIEF HISTORY OF ECONOMICS:Artful Approaches to the Dismal Science (2nd Edition)|Blending past and present, this brief history of economics is the perfect book for introducing students to the field. A Brief History of Economics illustrates how the ideas of the great economists not only influenced societies but were themselves shaped by their cultural milieu. Understanding the economists' visions ¡ª lucidly and vividly unveiled by Canterbery ¡ª allows readers to place economics within a broader community of ideas. Magically, the author links Adam Smith to Isaac Newton's idea of an orderly universe, F Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby to Thorstein Veblen, John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath to the Great Depression, and Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities to Reaganomics. The second edition is right up-to-date with a lively discussion of the economic crises of 2007¨C2010. Often humorous, Canterbery's easy style will make the student's first foray into economics lively and relevant. Readers will dismiss ¡°dismal¡± from the science.

B16|Wer war Hermann Heinrich Gossen (1810-1858), Namensgeber eines der Preise des Vereins für Socialpolitik?|Some 150 years ago Hermann Heinrich Gossen passed away. Who was this author after whom one of the prizes of the Verein of Socialpolitik is named? The paper provides a critical summary account of Gossen’s work. Gossen was convinced that he had discovered the only faithful interpretation of the Creator’s intention, whereas existing religions and churches misunderstand it. Selfish behaviour is said to bring about a “complete paradise” on earth. Gossen’s main concern was the allocation of scarce time to alternative activities. The time dimension still waits to be integrated into the main body of economics.
B16|Jevons, Jenkin, and Walras on demand-and-supply analysis in the theory of exchange|" In his economic writings Jevons insists on the allegedly fundamental role played by the so-called ""laws of supply and demand"" in his theory of exchange; yet no demand-and-supply analysis is actually employed in deriving such theory, as developed in Chapter 4 of The Theory of Political Economy (TPE). This is all the more puzzling in the light of the following two facts: 1) in his 1868 correspondence with Jevons, Fleeming Jenkin provides a complete geometrical solution of the exchange equilibrium problem based on the use of demand and supply curves, but his suggestion is wholly neglected by Jevons in the first edition of TPE (1871); 2) in his 1874 open letter to Jevons, Walras explicitly criticizes his correspondent for his defective treatment of the ""laws of supply and demand"", suggesting an alternative analytical solution of the exchange problem based on the use of demand and supply functions; yet Jevons entirely disregards Walras's remarks in preparing the second edition of TPE (1879). This paper compares Jevons's, Jenkin's and Walras's approaches to the exchange equilibrium problem, explaining the analytical and epistemological reasons that underlie Jevons's neglect of his correspondents' criticism and advice."
B16|Edgeworth vs. Walras on Equilibrium and Disequilibrium| In a brief review of the second edition of Walras’s Eléments, published in 1889, Edgeworth criticizes Walras’s theory of tâtonnement, viewed as a misplaced and misleading attempt at explaining the equilibration process in a multi-market economy. Edgeworth’s attack sets off a controversy, raging over the 1889-1891 period, and then smouldering over the entire lives of both economists. The chief aim of this paper is to analyze the joint evolution of Edgeworth’s and Walras’s ideas on equilibrium and equilibration from the 1889-1891 controversy onwards. Even if Edgeworth’s original critique concerns Walras’s tâtonnement only, it will be proved that the fundamental divide between the two authors involves not only the dynamic, but also the static part of their respective theoretical systems. The Edgeworth-Walras controversy will be shown to produce major effects on both Walras and Edgeworth: both of them will partially revise their ideas on statics and dynamics; further, either one will take in some hints originating from the other. Yet, in spite of their reciprocal influences, their mutual communication will turn out to be quite limited. For Edgeworth will prove unable to understand the central, and unsolvable, problem of tâtonnement from Walras’s own standpoint: how to preserve a “realistic” and comprehensive picture of an observable disequilibrium process in “real” time, without disrupting the assumption of data invariance during the equilibration process. At the same time Walras will prove unable to grasp the essence of Edgeworth’s critique: that bargaining is more “fundamental” than price-taking behavior, so that the core is a broader solution concept than competitive equilibrium and recontracting a more general equilibration process than tâtonnement.
B16|Evaluación de costo-Eefectividad de la adición de la resonancia magnética a la radiografía convencional en la evaluación de pacientes con pie diabético y signos de infección|En personas con diabetes, una infección en el pie frecuentemente conduce a amputación. La radiografía plana es el método tradicionalmente usado en la evaluación de las infeccionas óseas del pie, pero comparada con ella, la resonancia magnética es más sensible y específica. Se realiza aquí una evaluación de costo efectividad usando un modelo de Markov para comparar la radiografía convencional con la radiografía más resonancia magnética en pacientes con pie diabético y signos de infección. Se encontró un ICER por AVAD de $1.532.778 y de $1.741.311 sin y con descuento respectivamente. La resonancia magnética en la evaluación del pie diabético con signos de infección sería costo-efectiva para Colombia. Los resultados son robustos a pruebas de sensibilidad.
B16|Marx, maths, and MEGA 2|This paper examines two areas where the MEGA 2 project can advance the understanding of Marx’s thought; although the contribution of MEGA 2 to each is very different, the areas are linked by their subject matter — Marx’s engagement with the mathematical sciences — and by other personalities involved. In the first part of the paper we deal with the question of Marx’s mathematical manuscripts, the majority of which are apparently already available and translated into several languages, but awaiting their definitive publication in their place in the MEGA. In the second part we deal with Marx’s contact with nineteenth-century thought in probability and statistics, a story whose full elucidation cannot be undertaken until more volumes of his Notebooks are available, and especially that which is known to contain his notes on Quetelet.
B16|Did Pressler Understand how to Use the Indicator Per Cent|A classical problem in forestry is the determination of the optimal rotation. This problem was solved during the 19th century, by German forest mathematicians. Martin Faustmann deserves some of the fame. However, he did not explicitly derive the conditions for an optimal solution. His contender is Max Robert Pressler. He invented the concept of Indicator Per Cent, which can be used to determine whether a stand is mature for harvesting or not. Did Pressler fully realize this? Having analyzed some of the relevant literature our answer is no.

B16|A Dual-Solovian Measure of Productivity Increase and its Early Antecedents|The duality between a production function and the cost function generated by it implies that a Solovian ‘growth accounting’ measure of productivity increase, as referred to the industry, has an equivalent dual measure, based on what may be called ‘price accounting’. It is argued in this paper that the dual measure provides a coherent framework for considering productivity increase in relation to inflation/deflation, earnings dispersion, long-run variations in domestic relative prices and in external terms of trade. Even though the theoretical interest in measures based on real input prices dates back to the late 1960s, few or no attempts have been made thereafter to adopt it in practice. Curiously enough, the practical adoption of some kind of ‘price accounting’ dates to much earlier. We argue in this paper that, during the 19th century, distinguished statisticians and economic commentators such as G.R. Porter and R. Giffen based their evaluations on the comparative change in prices, wages and profits and in so doing they followed a logic that remarkably resembles that of a dual-Solovian measure.
B16|The National Accounts as a Tool for Analysis and Policy; History, Economic Theory and Data Compilation Issues|Without national accounts statistics, citizens, politicians, entrepreneurs and economists would be blind for the size, composition and development of national economies. This book provides a unique overview of the merits and limitations of the national accounts. Attention is paid to the three centuries old history of the national accounts and the links with economic theory, practical data compilations issues and the many uses and applications.

B16|Ninety Years of Dynamic Balance Theory by Johann Wilhelm Eugen Schmalenbach (1873 - 1955)|This text focuses on the role and meaning of prominent German economist in the first half of 20th century, J. W. E. Schmalenbach. Author explains some aspects of the dynamic balancing theory, created of Schmalenbach in 1919. The aim by Schmalenbach was the new formulation of the basic balancing question: not ‘what’, but ‘in what condition like’. The balance sheet is for him not any count in law framework, but also a count for the proprietary managers, i. e. potential of business entity.
B16|Organic Balance Theory by Fritz Schmidt (1882 - 1950)|The paper remembers the 85th anniversary of the publication: “Bilanzwert, Bilanzgewinn und Bilanzumvertung” [Valuation and revaluation for balance sheet, the profit in financial balance] by professor Fritz Schmidt, printed in Leipzig (Germany) 1924. This book contains the principles of Schmidt’s organic balance theory together with contemporary cardinal theories for balancing, which works in big inflation environment in Germany at first third of 20th century.
B16|The special status of mathematical probability: a historical sketch|The history of the mathematical probability includes two phases: 1) From Pascal and Fermat to Laplace, the theory gained in application fields; 2) In the first half of the 20th Century, two competing axiomatic systems were respectively proposed by von Mises in 1919 and Kolmogorov in 1933. This paper places this historical sketch in the context of the philosophical complexity of the probability concept and explains the resounding success of Kolmogorov’s theory through its ability to avoid direct interpretation. Indeed, unlike experimental sciences, and despite its numerous applications, probability theory cannot be tested per se. Rather it relates to practical matters by means of transition hypotheses or bridging principles that match the structure of practical problems with abstract theory. In this respect probability theory has a very special status among scientific disciplines.
B16|Harry Markowitz:Selected Works|Harry M Markowitz received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990 for his pioneering work in portfolio theory. He also received the von Neumann Prize from the Institute of Management Science and the Operations Research Institute of America in 1989 for his work in portfolio theory, sparse matrices and the SIMSCRIPT computer language. While Dr Markowitz is well-known for his work on portfolio theory, his work on sparse matrices remains an essential part of linear optimization calculations. In addition, he designed and developed SIMSCRIPT — a computer programming language. SIMSCRIPT has been widely used for simulations of systems such as air transportation and communication networks.

B16|Über die Natur und das Wesen des Geldes: Johann Heinrich von Thünens unveröffentlichter Beitrag zur Geldtheorie|The economic works of Johann Heinrich von Thünen include 1,000 unpublished pages of drafts and notes on the basis of which he prepared the second volume of his famous 'Isolated State in Relation to Agriculture and Political Economy'. Thünen wrote his texts in the so-called Deutsche Kanzleischrift, a script which can be read today only by specialised historians, rarely by economists. In a first part of a research project of the Thünen-Gesellschaft e.V. 300 pages were transliterated, from which the first 60 pages were reviewed until October 2009. It becomes obvious that Thünen's work is much more far-reaching than the contributions published by himself or edited by Schumacher in 1863 and 1875 show. Its bulk was not made accessible until today. This can be easily demonstrated by the content of these first 60 pages, especially those treating monetary questions and preparing Thünen's theory of capital and interest. Thünen starts his analysis with a description of the diminishing return of money keeping in an enterprise. He considers both the exchange and the stock function of money. He describes the pros and cons of the creation of paper money as a substitute for coins. Thünen is the first economist who develops an extended quantity theory of money by introducing the velocity of money transactions and formulating the correct algebraic formula. He anticipates the famous Newcomb-Fisher equation but with one difference: in Thünen's opinion the product of velocity and quantity of money primarily determines the value of circulating capital goods and assets, an argument which has to be understood with the contemporary rural economic conditions in mind. He analyses the liquidity effect of positive exogenous money shocks. By describing the adaptation processes in the case of differences between the monetary market interest rate and the real rate of return on capital goods, Thünen presents important mechanisms of Knut Wicksell's 'Interest and Prices', which were published 75 years later and still inspire the monetary economists today. In accordance with Henry Thornton, he adequately describes the consequences of liquidity preference in the case of uncertain economic situations. In our opinion Thünen's 1823 contribution is of the same quality as the contributions of the leading monetary theorists in the early 19th century, David Ricardo and Henry Thornton. With respect to the further theoretic development in the nineteenth and twentieth century and from the perspective of modern monetary theory, Thünen's drafts are an unexpected discovery and of particular interest in the current financial and economic crisis. The paper concludes with a preliminary assessment of Thünen's text in the context of the sec-ond volume of the 'Isolated State', which was published in 1850 and which contains Thünen's 'Theory of Capital and Interest'.
B16|"Retrospectives: Guinnessometrics: The Economic Foundation of ""Student's"" t"|"In economics and other sciences, ""statistical significance"" is by custom, habit, and education a necessary and sufficient condition for proving an empirical result. The canonical routine is to calculate what's called a t-statistic and then to compare its estimated value against a theoretically expected value of it, which is found in ""Student's"" t table. A result yielding a t-value greater than or equal to about 2.0 is said to be ""statistically significant at the 95 percent level."" Alternatively, a regression coefficient is said to be ""statistically significantly different from the null, p ≤ .05."" Canonically speaking, if a coefficient clears the 95 percent hurdle, it warrants additional scientific attention. If not, not. The first presentation of ""Student's"" test of significance came a century ago in 1908, in ""The Probable Error of a Mean,"" published by an anonymous ""Student."" The author's commercial employer required that his identity be shielded from competitors, but we have known for some decades that the article was written by William Sealy Gosset (1876-1937), whose entire career was spent at Guinness's brewery in Dublin, where Gosset was a master brewer and experimental scientist. Perhaps surprisingly, the ingenious ""Student"" did not give a hoot for a single finding of ""statistical"" significance, even at the 95 percent level of significance as established by his own tables. Beginning in 1904, ""Student,"" who was a businessman besides a scientist, took an economic approach to the logic of uncertainty, arguing finally that statistical significance is ""nearly valueless"" in itself."
B16|Knight Y Sus Aportes A La Teoría Del Emprendedor|A finales del siglo XIX la atención de los economistas se centró en el estudio de las capacidades para los negocios y en los factores que determinaban un tipo de beneficio que hasta el momento había sido deficientemente estudiado. De esta manera surge la figura del emprendedor. Knight considera que el emprendedor es el único factor productivo, establece una clara distinción entre riesgo e incertidumbre y por medio de ellos explica el beneficio que éste percibe. Knight asigna algunas características al emprendedor y lo considera como un agente dinámico e innovador en el desarrollo. Aclara que el beneficio del emprendedor proviene de la gestión de la incertidumbre.
B16|Viejas ideas económicas con nuevas tecnologías matemáticas|This paper aims at showing how the use of the Dynamical Systems Theory (DST) has affected the thematic content of the traditional economic analysis either by fostering new theoretical developments or by making translation from economic language to mathematics more complete. To this end, we elaborate a classification on 4344 papers which were published in the four leading economic journals between 1990 and 2004 and present two dynamical interpretations of the Malthusian Model. The main conclusions state that: 1) the application of DST to economics has made the meaning of dynamic equilibriums more complex in subdisciplines that are traditionally characterized by static analysis; and 2) the accurate use of DST techniques allows finding equilibriums which are longstanding disregarded by mainstream theories.
B16|The Mathematization of Macroeconomics. A Recursive Revolution|Frank Ramsey's classic framing of the dynamics of optimal savings, [44] as one to be solved as a problem in the calculus of variations and Ragnar Frisch's imaginative invoking of a felicitous Wicksellian metaphor to provide the impulse-propagation dichotomy, in a stochastic dynamic framework, for the tackling the problem of business cycles [13], have come to be considered the twin fountainheads of the mathematization of macroeconomics in its dynamic modes − at least in one dominant tradition. The intertemporal optimization framework of a rational agent, viewed as a signal processor, facing the impulses that are propagated through the mechanisms of a real economy, provide the underpinnings of the stochastic dynamic general equilibrium (SDGE) model that has become the benchmark and frontier of current macroeconomics. In this paper, on the 80th anniversary of Ramsey's classic and the 75th anniversary of Frisch's Cassel Festschrift contribution, an attempt is made to characterize the mathematization of macroeconomics in terms of the frontier dominance of recursive methods. There are, of course, other - probably more enlightened − ways to tell this fascinating story. However, although my preferred method would have been to tell it as an evolutionary development, since I am not sure that where we are represents progress, from where we were, say 60 years ago, I have chosen refuge in some Whig fantasies.
