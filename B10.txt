B10|A Survey on the Washington Consensus and the Beijing Model: Reconciling Development Perspectives|Reconciling the two dominant development models of the Washington Consensus (WC) and Beijing Model (BM) remains a critical challenge in the literature. The challenge is even more demanding when emerging development paradigms like the Liberal Institutional Pluralism (LIP) and New Structural Economics (NSE) schools have to be integrated. While the latter has recognized both State and market failures but failed to provide a unified theory, the former has left the challenging concern of how institutional diversity matter in the development process. We synthesize perspectives from recently published papers on development and Sino-African relations in order to present the relevance of both the WC and BM in the long-term and short-run, respectively. While the paper postulates for a unified theory by reconciling the WC and the BM to complement the NSE, it at the same time presents a case for economic rights and political rights as short-run and long-run development priorities respectively. By attempting to reconcile the WC with the BM, the study contributes at the same to macroeconomic NSE literature of unifying a development theory and to the LIP literature on institutional preferences with stages of development. Hence, the proposed reconciliation takes into account the structural and institutional realities of nations at different stages of the process of development.

B10|Price Control in Islamic Economics|In economics, we often hear the word price and its scope. In this case, the relation is how the value that becomes the transaction between the seller and the buyer is the replacement of the goods or services exchanged. The economy is one of the teachers in the country's life. The strength and weakness of a country's economic system are determined by pricing so that price stability occurs. But it is not easy to create an economy at a stable price because sometimes the demand level is higher than the supply and vice versa.
B10|The Dress Rehearsal: the creation of a Central Bank in Brazil in 1923|This paper aims to analyze an experiment in the history of the Brazilian economy: the transformation of Banco do Brasil into a Central Bank in 1923, and the debate surrounding this experiment. More strictly, the article proposes to answer the following question: what was the role of a Central Bank for Brazilian policymakers in the mid-1920s? I point out that the Central Banks abroad were associated at the time with the maintenance of the gold standard, while in Brazil, although the discussion echoed the discourse between papelistas and metalistas, the defense of the creation of the Central Bank was appropriated by the agenda of the first group. Therefore, a generational change of policymakers probably was necessary to undo the association between a Central Bank and the excess of paper currency, in the economic thought of the political environment. The work is based on the idea of communities of interpretation, and editions of the Retrospecto Comercial, the Correio Paulistano, and annals of the Federal Senate were analyzed.

B10|Economía, espacio y conflicto|Este trabajo analiza el concepto de espacio en la teoría económica, dado que los sistemas económicos requieren de la apropiación del espacio geográfico para producir. No obstante, los planes y políticas económicas de los gobiernos buscan imponer actividades económicas en los territorios sin previamente consultar con las comunidades locales ni contemplar la complejidad de la figura socio-espacial. Esto se ha dado históricamente hasta hoy debido a la incapacidad y la falta de esfuerzo por parte de la teoría económica por incorporar las variables sociales, fundamentalmente el concepto espacio, que ha contribuido en el origen de conflictos sociales y ambientales en los territorios. ****** This paper analyses the concept of space in economic theory, given that economic systems require the appropriation of geographic space to produce. However, the government’s economic plans and policies seek to impose economic activities in the territories without previously consulting with local communities or contemplating the complexity of the socio-spatial figure. This has occurred historically, due to the inability and the lack of effort of economic theory to incorporate social variables, specifically the concept of space, which has contributed to the origin of social and environmental conflicts in the territories.
B10|The Saint-Simonians and the birth of social justice in France|This paper concerns the birth of the idea of social justice, which in France dates to the 19th century. It argues that the idea of social justice was able to emerge in France due to particular conditions, which were met for the first time by the Saint-Simonians. We first shed light on the transition in France from a commercial system to one marked by increasing industrialization, which raised new questions regarding economic justice and the composition of ownership. The Saint-Simonians were among the first to criticize this new composition, and to seek a means to organize society on a fair basis. We then explain how the Saint-Simonians came to theorize this new organization: according to them, the value of things lies in work. The difference from the classical framework, which is also utilitarian, is that they posit an opposition between workers and idlers: each and every individual must be useful to society. Finally, we analyse how the Saint-Simonians identify this opposition as existing throughout history, on which basis they not only justify their innovative views on social justice, but legitimize their project as a whole.
B10|The capacity to confuse: rescuing the Saint-Simonian notion of ability from modern capability theories of social justice|"""To each according to his ability, to each ability according to his works"" constitutes the founding slogan of the Saint-Simonian doctrine (1825-1832). A century and a half would pass before Sen and Nussbaum developed their capability approaches, designed to consider issues of human development and quality of life. Given the prominence of capability approaches in the context of modern theories of justice, and perhaps also due to the natural analogy between the words 'capacité', 'ability', and 'capability', there is a clear tendency in the literature to analyse the Saint-Simonians' contributions to justice based on the assumption that there is a conceptual link between the terms capability and ability. This paper claims, however, that the elision of these terms is unjustified, and is a source more of confusion than of enlightenment. A capability is an evaluative space for justice, while an ability is a property of individuals. The former is defined essentially in the domain of consumption and individual accomplishment, while the latter is clearly seen as a contribution to the theory of efficient production. Finally, these differences reveal a contrast in the focus values: the ability approach insists on efficiency, while the capability approach focuses on agency."
B10|On commercial gluts, or when the Saint-Simonians adopted Jean-Baptiste Say’s view|A standard reading in the history of economic thought sets the classical stream of economists drawing upon the influence of Adam Smith (Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo, etc.) in opposition to a “black box” of social thinkers (Louis Blanc, Fourierism, Saint-Simonianism, Sismondi, Robert Owen). This article, however, argues that, in the first quarter of the 19th century, the Saint-Simonians and the liberal economist Jean-Baptiste Say can be seen to adopt convergent views during the famous controversy about commercial gluts. First, we show that the Saint-Simonians and Say both see undersupply and lack of industry as causes of gluts. Next, we assert that their intellectual affinities are also visible in their belief that increasing production remains an appropriate solution for gluts. Finally, this convergence is explained by their common belief in industrialism: Saint-Simonianism is embedded in a French industrialist tradition for which Say can be taken as representative. We argue that their common belief in industry explains their convergence.
B10|Turgot, Smith and Steuart on Stadial Histories|The theory of the stages of society appeared in the mid-18th century. Following a successful reception over the course of the second half of the century, the four-stage theory was finally adopted by Classical Economics, holding that the exchange economy is the final outcome of a long period of economic development. This paper carries out a comparative analysis of the stadial histories of Turgot, Smith and Steuart. We found theories which were similar, but which were identical in the pre-eminence of the productive forces and economic organisation. Firstly, a number of dynamic principles are noted?i.e., a natural tendency to improve their conditions, a series of shocks that change the historical stage and the innovative capacity of some individuals. Secondly, the necessary conditions for the movement from the agricultural stage to commercial society do not coincide. Turgot requires an accumulation of capital, Smith uses the market and Steuart points to the artificial institutions created by merchants. This is the central point in order to understand the differences between their economic theories.

B10|Functional Finance: A Comparison of the Evolution of the Positions of Hyman Minsky and Abba Lerner|"This paper examines the views of Hyman Minsky and Abba Lerner on the functional finance approach to fiscal policy. It argues that the main principles of functional finance were relatively widely held in the immediate postwar period. However, with the rise of the Phillips curve, the return of the Quantity Theory, the development of the notion of a government budget constraint, and accelerating inflation at the end of the 1960s, functional finance fell out of favor. The paper compares and contrasts the evolution of the views of Minsky and Lerner over the postwar period, arguing that Lerner's transition went further, as he embraced a version of Monetarism that emphasized the use of monetary policy over fiscal policy. Minsky's views of functional finance became more nuanced, in line with his Institutionalist approach to the economy. However, Minsky never rejected his early beliefs that countercyclical government budgets must play a significant role in stabilizing the economy. Thus, in spite of some claims that Minsky should not be counted as one of the ""forefathers"" of Modern Money Theory (MMT), this paper argues that it is Minsky, not Lerner, whose work remains essential for the further development of MMT."
B10|Public choice and political science: a view from Europe|Abstract What is the status of rational choice theory in contemporary European political science? Compared with a quarter-century ago, the rational choice approach is still far from being the paradigm of work in the discipline, but looking at both anecdotal evidence and information derived from journal citations and textbook contents, it seems that the number of political scientists working wholly or partly within the approach has grown markedly, and that its contribution to the mainstream of the field is strong.
B10|The Composition of Capital and Technological Unemployment: Marx's (and Ricardo's) Intellectual Debt to John Barton and George Ramsay|This brief note contends that Marx's (and Ricardo's) views on fixed (constant) and circulating (variable) capital,the impact of machinery on the working class,and their conception of how the accumulation of capital gives rise to a relative diminution in the demand for labor were strongly influenced by the works of English economists John Barton and George Ramsay. With a few notable exceptions, Marx's (and Ricardo's)intellectual debt to these classical economists has been practically neglected in the extant literature. Second, the note delves into Marx's theory of technological unemployment (surplus labor) and its main components. Again, the textual evidence strongly suggests that Marx was influenced by the writings of Barton, Ricardo, and Ramsay. The latter seems to have also influenced Marx's conception of one of the three major components of the surplus population, viz. the latent component.
B10|Aspectos Distributivos do Crescimento Econômico: Uma Breve Síntese Teórica|This paper seeks to explore and present, through a synthesis of economic theory, some of the major approaches to the study of income distribution in the context of macroeconomic growth. The starting point is a survey of the classical economic school of thought, classified between the Ricardian and Marxian schools, which predicts a causality from income distribution towards economic growth. The role of a profit squeezing trend upon long term stagnation theorized by the classics is highlighted. Next, the characteristics of the Harrod-Domar model are studied, as well as its main concern, the problem of Harrodian instability. This problem refers to a discrepancy between the equilibrium rate of growth and the rates effectively determined by the factors of production. The importance of this topic lies in the fact that it is approached differently by subsequent authors discussed. Following, some of the elements of neoclassical income distribution and economic growth are discussed, in light of the Harrodian problem. In this sense, distribution is related to the neoclassical pricing system, meanwhile growth is explained by the accumulation of factors of production, according to a production function defined by full factor substitutability. This encumbers the use of the neoclassical structure to support any hypothesis of a relationship between distribution and growth, since these variables are determined in different models and are, therefore, exogenous to one another. On the other hand, post-Keynesian approaches are emphasized, once they predict a relationship between distribution and growth by endogeneizing the equilibrium rate of growth originally introduced by the Harrod-Domar model. These schools of economic thought, cathegorized as Kaldorian-Robinsonian and Kaleckian-Steindlian, being this last one also sorted among the Rowthorn-Dutt and Bhaduri-Marglin models, are finally presented.
B10|Bilder in der Geschichte der Ökonomie: Das Beispiel der Metapher von der Wirtschaft als Maschine|"In der ökonomischen Theorie haben Metaphern (als Formen eines bildhaften Sprachgebrauchs) immer eine besondere Rolle gespielt. Nach einem historischen Überblick über das Konzept von Metaphern wird die Geschichte des dominanten Stranges in der ökonomischen Theorie als Geschichte einer Metapher von der Maschine skiziiert In der Geschichte der ökonomischen Theorie finden sich immer Metaphern, diese können als Formen eines bildhaften Sprachgebrauchs verstanden werden. Eine besondere Rolle hat im Hauptrang der Theorieentwicklung die Metapher von der Maschine gespielt. Nach einem historischen Überblick über das Konzept von Metaphern (Kap. 1) und der Kulturgeschichte der Metapher von der Maschine (Kap. 3) wird die Geschichte der ökonomischen Theorie als achtstufige Geschichte einer Metapher von der Maschine skizziert: Bei Quesnay als einer machine économique mit Bezug auf die Philosophie von Descartes, bei Smith eine natural order mit Bezug auf die Mechanik bei Newton, bei Malthus und Ricardo als Konzept von ökonomischen Gesetzen in Analogie zu Naturgesetzen in einer Neuinterpretation von Newton - ähnlich auch bei John Stuart Mill, bei Jevons und Walras als explizit ausformulierte ""mechanistische Nationalökonomie"", bei Autoren wie Gérald Debreu als Neuformulierung des Ansatzes von Walras als einer Informationsmechanik, sowie bei Friedrich August von Hayek als Konzept von ""dem Markt"" als einem Informationsnetzwerk in Analogie zu einem Telekommunikationssystem."

B10|Los orígenes del neoestructuralismo latinoamericano|La Región Centro de México se constituyó en el espacio demográfico y económico protagónicEste ensayo propone dar cuenta de la ambigüedad del concepto ´neostructuralismo´ cuando se le analiza a partir de la óptica de la obra de Osvaldo Sunkel; no obstante, ello no excluye una posible reconstrucción del término a partir de una reflexión en torno a sus autores “primigenios” y los respectivos vocabularios sobre el ´estructuralismo´. Sin embargo, el concepto ´neostructuralismo´ no armoniza necesariamente con la obra de Sunkel y, paradójicamente, tampoco con la obra de Raúl Prebisch antes del primer lustro de la década de 1970, sino hasta la publicación de la obra “Capitalismo perife´ rico, crisis y transformacio´ n”. Por lo tanto, la excursión conceptual que hacemos sobre el ´estructuralismo´ y el ´neostructuralismo´ da a entender que este último es fruto del progreso teórico dentro del pensamiento latinoamericano, bajo la singularidad con que Sunkel se integró al mismo.
B10|De los rendimientos crecientes a la teoría de los sectores líderes: una relación entre los trabajos del profesor L. Currie y A. Young|Este artículo presenta una revisión comparativa de la teoría del crecimiento propuesta por Allyn Young en la que se destacan los rendimientos crecientes y la teoría del crecimiento sobre los sectores líderes propuesta por Lauchlin Currie. El artículo busca encontrar la relación entre ambos planteamientos teóricos para mostrar cómo uno depende del otro. Adicionalmente, se presenta una aplicación de la teoría del sector líder a Colombia y se concluye elucidando la fuerte relación teórica entre los autores. Se recalca la importancia histórica que tuvo la aplicación de las teorías del profesor Currie en Colombia.
B10|Capitalism and Socialism: Review of Kornai's Dynamism, Rivalry, and the Surplus Economy|Understanding the nature of capitalism has been a central theme of economics. The collapse of the East Bloc and the global financial crisis spurred the reemergence of the political economy as a new frontier and the revival of interest in the nature of capitalism. Kornai's book fills an important intellectual gap in understanding the dynamic nature of capitalism by comparing it with its mirror image, socialism. To further develop the themes contained in the book, serious challenges are posted theoretically and empirically, as well as in subjects, such as hybrid capitalism.
B10|Money Illusion - Reconsidered in the Light of Cognitive Science|A basic principle of economics is that people always prefer a larger set of opportunities. Money illusion can be considered as the phenomenon that people may not perceive correctly their budget constraints, and may act in ways that run counter to this preference. In this view money illusion is a cognitive bias, worthwhile to overcome. Herein I argue that taking a view of human decision-making based on certain strands of cognitive psychology one can reinterpret the evidence for money illusion in two ways. First, I claim that money illusion is inescapable to some extent, and saying that we suffer from it is similar to alleging that we experience optical illusions, only because we are unable to see, say, individual atoms. Second, taking a view on “preferences” different from the traditional one, I contend that it may bring little benefit to get rid of money illusion even in the cases where it is possible to do so. To follow up the visual analogy, even if we can improve our eyesight it is not obviously desirable. These arguments seem to lead to a Candidean disposition: there is no possible improvement on the state of affairs as far as “money illusion” is concerned. Nonetheless, I will make some positive proposals concerning economic policy and economics research.
B10|Il contributo di Marx a una critica del determinismo tecnologico. Premesse per una ontologia critica dell’innovazione|Despite the criticism of being a technological determinist, Marx provides deep ontological foundations for a critique of technological determinism. The essay elaborates on this thesis with three interrelated arguments. The first one refers to the three elements of Marx's analysis that can contribute to a critical ontology, which allows us to think of social reality as constructed by human activity as such: the notion of work as social praxis; the meaning of fetishism of commodities and its implications; the relationship between quantity, quality and transformation processes. The second argument aims at showing how changes in the characteristics and functions of the division of labour, and the transition itself to the capitalist mode of production, are not reducible, in Marx, to an adaptation to new technological conditions. The third argument draws attention to the need for a critical ontology of innovation as emerging from human activity as such. Grounded on Marx's analysis, the paper concludes on how the notion of work as social praxis, the relationship between quantity and quality and the critical perspective of the fetishism of commodities refer to a complex, and ontologically endogenous, theory of the processes of change.
B10|The Rural Economics of René de Girardin: Landscapes at the Service of l’Idéologie Nobiliaire|René-Louis de Girardin is remembered for having invited Rousseau at Ermenonville estate. Girardin believed it was necessary to further the debate on gardens on the basis of a principle of continuity that rejects any idea of enclosure. This made it possible to establish an agricultural model that increased production, and finally allowed the monopoly in grain sales to be broken. At the service of l’idéologie nobiliaire, his analysis shows the existence of a form of economic thinking in the second half of the 18th century that, giving primacy to agriculture, nevertheless cannot fall within the paths of physiocrats and agronomes.
B10|The cultural context of contemporary understanding of socio-economic development|Research background: The way of understanding of development concept in economics has been changing since the beginning of the discipline: from economic growth, through economic development to socio-economic development. The author of the paper believes that identification of features of cultural context that shape understanding of this phenomenon will allow to understand appropriately contemporary definitions of this process. Purpose of the article: The purpose of the paper is to reconstruct features of socio-cultural context in which it has changed the way of understanding of development concept in economics. The specific objectives are as follows: identification of period in which it was recognised that development is something more than economic growth, identification of reasons and circumstances of evolution of development definition: from economic growth to socio-economic development. Methodology/methods: A basis for conclusions formulation will be a research of literature (mostly publications in English). Analysis will have interdisciplinary character as it relates sociological and economic dimensions of analysis of development. Findings & Value added: Division of economic development and economic growth took place in 1960s. Change of understanding of development concept was caused by the following factors: (1) influence of new sociological and philosophical ideas, (2) historical events, (3) growing meaning of formalism and scientism in economic considerations, (4) international cooperation for development.
B10|Lessons learned from the global recession - redesigned framework of key macroeconomic policies| This research provides a critical analysis of the available relevant theoretical and empirical literature regarding the key lessons about fiscal and monetary policy during the latest global crisis. The main contribution of this paper lies in offering a new redesigned framework for the key macroeconomic policies which can serve as a general guide to policymakers for designing these policies to respond to future financial and economic crises. Our critical analysis points out 14 lessons for monetary policy which the monetary authorities should take into account in the process of designing their future policies. The analysis also includes 14 lessons as a guide for governments to design their fiscal policy during future global imbalances, addressing the efficiency of fiscal policies during large-scale economic crises, the role and significance of fiscal space, the effectiveness of austerity programs, the coordination of fiscal policies on a global level, the coordination and mutual interactions with monetary policy, etc.
B10|Capital as a Social Process: A Marxian Perspective|This paper analyzes the very important notion of capital from a Marxian perspective as opposed to a neoclassical one. It is argued that when capital is viewed as a historically determined social process (relation), rather than as a thing or a collection of things, it tends to assume certain specific forms more often than others depending on the particular stage of economic history. Capital thus refers simultaneously to social relations and to things. Given this frame of reference, notions such as money and property capital are more easily accommodated and consequently are not written off as financial or fictitious capital—not real capital—because they “produce nothing.” The paper also focuses on Marx’s important analysis of the time of production and the turnover of capital in terms of the production of surplus-value (profit). It then examines Marx’s equally important and prescient analysis of how the turnover speed of capital is affected by the time of circulation of commodities (the realization of surplus-value) and the growing use of credit (in its various forms) in the capitalist system. Finally, the paper turns its attention to the economic role of time as it relates to interest-bearing (loan) capital and Adam Smith’s important distinction between productive and unproductive labor—one whose clear comprehension rests on viewing capital as a social construct.
B10|Marx and Ricardo on machinery: a critical note| This article critically discusses the important and relevant—not to mention controversial— views of Ricardo and Marx on the impact of machinery on labor productivity, the organization of production and the wages and employment prospects of the working class during the capitalism of their day. First, the article turns to Ricardo’s assessment of the introduction of machinery and its likely effects on the laborer and the rate of profit and accumulation—one which went through a substantial revision (and reversal) between the first and third editions of his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. Then, we discuss Marx’s own critical analysis of the historical development of machinery and its impact on the labor process, the so-called “compensation principle,” and how the rising organic composition of capital ostensibly generates a “redundant or surplus-population” during the course of capitalist development. We highlight Marx’s intellectual debt to Ricardo, John Barton (and George Ramsay) insofar as his theory of technological unemployment is concerned. Lastly, the article summarizes the views of Ricardo and Marx and offers some concluding remarks.
B10|Complexity and Economic Policy: A Paradigm Shift or a Change in Perspective? A Review Essay on David Colander and Roland Kupers's Complexity and the Art of Public Policy|"In their recent book, Colander and Kupers (2014) argue that viewing the economy as a complex adaptive system should change the way in which we make economic policy. This would necessitate a paradigm shift. Economics has, over time, tried to produce a coherent model to underpin the dominant laissez-faire liberal approach. But we have never proved, in that model, that left to their own devices, the participants in an economy will self-organize into a satisfactory state. This is an assumption. Complex interactive systems with direct interaction between heterogeneous agents may show no tendency to self-equilibrate and will undergo endogenous crises. Economists should concentrate on the emergence of certain patterns. Colander and Kupers suggest that we may be able to nudge the system into ""good"" basins of attraction. A more radical view is that there are no fixed basins of attraction; these change with the evolution of the system and it is illusory to believe that we can choose good basins. We may be able to recognize and influence the emergence of certain states of the economy, but we are far from Leon Walras's dream of economics as a science like astrophysics."
B10|Behavioural finance perspectives on Malaysian stock market efficiency|This paper provides historical, theoretical, and empirical syntheses in understanding the rationality of investors, stock prices, and stock market efficiency behaviour in the theoretical lenses of behavioural finance paradigm. The inquiry is guided by multidisciplinary behavioural-related theories. The analyses employed a long span of Bursa Malaysia stock market data from 1977 to 2014 along the different phases of economic development and market states. The tests confirmed the presence of asymmetric dynamic behaviour of prices predictability as well as risk and return relationships across different market states, risk states and quantiles data segments. The efficiency tests show trends of an adaptive pattern of weak market efficiency across various economic phases and market states. Collectively, these evidences lend support to bounded-adaptive rational of investors' behaviour, dynamic stock price behaviour, and accordingly forming bounded-adaptive market efficiency.
B10|Joseph A. Schumpeter: Ein Pionier der Makrofinanz|Since the outbreak of the Great Financial Crisis in 2007, „Macrofinance“ has evolved as an exciting field for economists. The idea of marrying macroeconomics and financial economics has a long tradition, however, which should not remain buried in almost forgotten books. A couple of seemingly new ideas can be traced back to the work of the eminent economist Joseph A. Schumpeter. His dynamic model of the business cycle is built upon a close interaction between entrepreneurs and banks. Fire-sales of assets, liquidity spirals and feedback loops can turn a mild recession into a devastating depression. Schumpeter’s analysis of the role of monetary policy bears a striking resemblance to contemporary discussions.
B10|Démographie, économie, culture|Relations between demography and economics are complex. Studied from the beginning by economists (Petty, Malthus), demography has not evolved as a branch of economics. During the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century demography has been deeply influenced by biology and culture. Nevertheless by the mid-20th century, demography returned to the social sciences thereby facilitating the analysis of its links with economics (Sauvy, Fourasti?, Becker). Today, demographic studies lean on cultural anthropology and economics as shown in this article through several cases. Finally these two disciplines appear to be complementary, the first one being focused on the long term and the other one on the short term, in particular as regards financial aspects.

B10|Aleatoric Democracy|Democracy usually is identified by the right to vote. However, in recent times voting procedures have been criticized, as they seemingly do not guarantee that all parts of the population have an adequate voice in the established political process. We suggest invigorating an old but nearly forgotten procedure to overcome this deficit: Aleatoric Democracy based on a combination of voting and random decisions. By using random mechanisms the interests of the whole population are considered. Persons and ideas, being so far disregarded, are taken into account. Democracy becomes vivid and creative, and does not run the danger of being entrenched.
B10|Entertaining Malthus: Bread, Circuses, And Economic Growth|Motivated by the basic adage that man does not live by bread alone, we offer a theory of historical economic growth and population dynamics where human beings need food to survive, but enjoy other things, too. Our model imposes a Malthusian constraint on food, but introduces a second good to the analysis that affects living standards without affecting population growth. We show that technological change does a good job explaining historical consumption patterns and population dynamics, including the Neolithic Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and the Great Divergence. Our theory stands in contrast to models that assume a single composite good and a Malthusian constraint. These models generate negligible growth prior to the Industrial Revolution. However, recent revisions to historical data show that historical living standards—though obviously much lower than today's—varied over time and space much more than previously thought. These revisions include updates to Maddison's dataset, which served as the basis for many papers taking long‐run stagnation as a point of departure. This new evidence suggests that the assumption of long‐run stagnation is problematic. Our model shows that when we give theoretical accounting of these new observations the Industrial Revolution is much less puzzling. (JEL B10, I31, J1, N1, O30)
B10|The Impact of Motivation Enhancing Practices and Mediating Role of Talent Engagement on Turnover Intentions: Evidence from Malaysia|Employees are the backbone of any organization. Engaged and motivated employees enable the organization to gain the competitive advantage. Retention of employees is the main concern of organization now a days. The purpose of this study was to examine the direct relationship of motivation enhancing practices on turnover intentions and through talent engagement (job engagement and organization engagement) among the managers in hotel industry in Kuala Lumpur. This study investigated engagement in two dimensions. A total of 560 questionnaires were distributed to managers, who were working in three star, four star and five star hotels located in Kuala Lumpur. Structural equation modeling was applied to test the hypotheses. The study found that motivation enhancing practices (employee recognition, salary and perks, performance feedback, opportunities for advancement and development job security and workload) have significant negative relationship with employees’ turnover intentions. The interesting finding is that job engagement does not mediate between the motivation enhancing and turnover intentions while organization engagement statistically significant mediates the relationship. The findings of this study is important for hotels management to implement these motivation enhancing practices.

These data are closely examined and found to be in clear contradiction of this theory. Demographic Transition Theory is also contradicted by the best available data for England. Other examples of contradicting evidence are also discussed.
B10|Robert Dirks, Food in the Gilded Age; What Ordinary Americans Ate|Robert Dirks offers an important contribution to food and nutrition history in his book Food in the Gilded Age: What Ordinary Americans Ate. The book spans a broad swath of late 19th century US nutrition history using available dietaries from diverse sources and multiple ethnic groups. Early Mexican-Americans represent one of the earliest ethnic groups in the US. During the Gilded Age, the children of Native-Mexicans with early white European explorers –Mestizos-reflectthe most pre-developed diets in the West. Dirks summarizes their diets using Mexican-American households in Las Cruces, New Mexico and the Rio Grande Valley, Texas that were transitioning into Southwestern economies.
B10|Unified Growth Theory Contradicted by the Absence of Takeoffs in the Gross Domestic Product|Data describing historical economic growth are analysed. They demonstrate convincingly that the take offs from stagnation to growth, claimed in the Unified Growth Theory, never happened. This theory is again contradicted by the same data which were used, but never properly analysed, during its formulation. The absence of the claimed takeoffs demonstrates that the postulate of the differential takeoffs is also contradicted by data. Furthermore, this analysis demonstrates that the mathematically-analysable data contradict the concept of the prolonged Malthusian stagnation, its effects on the economic growth as well as the concept of a dramatic escape from the Malthusian trap.
B10|Race, Capitalism, and Power: The Economic Thought of the Young Jesse Jackson|Fifty years ago, Jesse Jackson joined the S.C.L.C. and rose rapidly to become one of this country’s major advocates of black capitalism. Far less well known is his interest in finance and credit for African Americans that suggests his prescience about the decline of industrial capitalism. Focusing on Jackson’s early civil rights activity in Chicago, this paper charts the initial stages through which Martin Luther King’s young pupil rapidly became a staunch supporter of black economic power, strongly committed to a wealth-transfer agenda, while most of the other civil rights and labor leaders showed more interest in a just distribution of income. Abandoning the stereotypical image of Jackson in his early years, an image limiting him to an ambitious activist interested in bargains and with little inclination for analysis of the economic reality of his times, this paper addresses Jackson’s forward way of thinking. His growing expertise in money and finance made him one of the few civil rights leaders who genuinely grasped the functioning of the post-industrial economy and constituted the true wellspring of his later pan-Africanism and economic policies.
B10|Nature and Significance of Islamic Economics|Islamic economics has of late landed in confusion and neglect and much concern is being voiced on this state of affairs. The divergence of views on various aspects of the subject tends to grow, cohesive efforts are missing. It is in this context that the present paper takes a look at the nature and significance of Islamic economics and examines the issues of its definition, nature and scope, the questions of methods and methodology, system approach, the problems that seems to hinder its growth, the challenges Islamic economics faces today and how the same can be faced. Since the differences between the Islamicand mainstream economic disciplines stem from the divergent worldviews that condition them, the discussion opens on the topic as background material. This paper is a part of draft Chapter of a book under preparation on Islamic economics and finance. Comments and suggestions are welcome but the paper or its parts cannot be put to any commercial or unfair use.
B10|Islamic finance for SMES|Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) make up the bulk of the economic tissue of the economy. In developing countries, they represent the majority of employment, including female employment. Investing in SMEs is a long-term and smart strategy, with sustainable returns that multiply across regions, countries and societies. SMEs constitute the overwhelming majority of firms. Globally, SMEs make up over 95% of all firms, account for approximately 50% of GDP and 60%–70% of total employment, when both formal and informal SMEs are taken into account. This amounts to between 420 million and 510 million SMEs, 310 million of which are in emerging markets. Promoting access to finance for SMEs has been on the global reform agenda since the global financial crisis. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the opportunities of development and growth as well as the main challenges to Islamic finance for SMEs. This paper will help to deepen understanding of the concepts of Islamic finance as well as SMEs. In addition to evaluate how Islamic financial institutions can support SMEs.
B10|Seyed Kazem Sadr, The Economic System of the Early Islamic Period: Institutions and Policies|The book is a major contribution to Islamic economic history and to Islamic economics in the English language. It presents a comprehensive yet concise economic hermeneutic of policies implemented by the Messenger (saas) in Medinah. It is an authoritative presentation based on the Qur’an, the Traditions of the Messenger, earliest writings of Muslim historians and jurists. Within the context of contemporary economic universe of discourse, the book discusses implications of policies of the Messenger with regards to allocation of resources, production, exchange, growth, development, environment, efficiency and justice. For those who think that zakat, prohibition against interest, waqf and the like are the only elements that distinguish an Islamic economy from other systems, the depth and the breadth of the book would provide a transformative experience. This Review argues that the appearance of the book is particularly timely given the distorted, dis-embedded, and fictitious model of an Islamic economy manufactured by Orientalists. The book will go a long way in correcting these distortions.
B10|The measurement of inflation in Austria: a historical overview|Calculation of the first price indices at the international level began as early as the start of the 18th century. In Austria, consumer price indices (CPIs) have been consistently available since 1800. Though simple, the indices followed today’s basic structure, and chaining the various generations of indices allows for conclusions to be drawn on inflation rate trends, adjustments for inflation and indexation for a period now spanning more than 200 years. This article covers a historical period extending from the first calculations of inflation to the complex criteria that determine inflation measurement in Austria today. A historical analysis of the trend in Austrian household expenditures as a key determinant of the basket-of-goods structure of price indices illustrates the long-term shift in spending from basic necessities to upscale goods and services. In 2016, Austrian households are spending only around 25 % of their total expenditure on basic necessities. Over the past 100 years, the number of items in the basket of goods and services has increased 40-fold (from 20 to approximately 800 items), and the number of price reports that are included in the monthly inflation calculations has risen from fewer than 100 to more than 40,000 in 2016. Another point of focus is the causes of measurement inaccuracies – which have always existed in the calculation of inflation – and the methods for correcting them. Austria’s accession to the EU and, subsequently, Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) with its supranational monetary policy instigated a process of restructuring and, more importantly, harmonizing inflation measurement. The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), which has been computed since 1996 to supplement the national indices, is now the primary indicator of inflation under the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy. Finally, this article concludes with a discussion of the measurement factors required to be used in the calculation of the Austrian CPI and HICP under EU law as well as the conceptual differences still existing between these two inflation parameters.
B10|Das Turgot Problem. The method of Economics|This paper examines A.R.J. Turgot’s explanation of the scope and method of economic science. We begin by highlighting two contradictory economic methodologies in Turgot’s writings according to the literature: one in his text on progress and another in his papers on concrete economic matters. An initial hypothesis in this paper holds that this ‘contradiction’ does not exist. To do so, we shall use his texts on scientific methodology, history of science and epistemology, mainly written during the decade of the fifties. The argument is that his taxonomy of sciences explains that the different methodologies observed by the literature, depending on the discipline, are the forms that the unit of science can take in each stage of the progress of the human spirit. A corollary to this hypothesis is that Turgot’s multi-disciplinary works describe a scene of the birth of economic science that is very removed from the political arena. Both debates on types of knowledge, the independence of disciplines, the specialized language and the association of authors are better explained from the sociology of science than from the history of political thought.
B10|Greek Sovereign Defaults in Retrospect and Prospect|This article focuses on and critically reviews the four Greek sovereign defaults (1827, 1843, 1893 and 1932) and puts them into historical perspective. The argument is that each and every one of the defaults was not an isolated episode in the turbulent economic history of capitalism, but, rather, a manifestation of the internal weaknesses of the Greek economy magnified during the downturn phases of the 1815-1848, 1873-1896, and 1921-1940 long waves. Crucial for understanding the conditions that triggered these defaults were the short-sighted and often opportunistic policies adopted by the Greek governments of the time, which were eager to increase public spending based on borrowed money, thus contributing to a mounting public debt. As a consequence, Greek sovereign defaults of the past are worth studying in an effort to derive useful lessons and draw economic policy conclusions.
B10|Economics Is a Science of Time Saving: The First Tentative Model (2016)|Time might be the scarcest resource for every individual. Time saving could be one of a few specific starting points of Economics. According to the new attribute theory that is based on Lancaster’s attribute theory, the paper constructs a linear programming model with an objective function of time saving that is independent of any utility function. Then the demand function of the time saving good can be derived with a programming method, which is different from the parametric and typically non-parametric methods. Because some data was unavailable, the empirical research of this paper cannot directly derive the demand function from the programming model. Thus another method is used to derive the demand function and the predictive power of this function is at least as good as that of the most common econometric models. Further, as a basic human behavior, time saving could be generalized to other fundamental theories of Economics, especially the long-run growth theory. Therefore, in the ultimate meaning, the conclusion is that Economics is a science of how to save time and time saving might be a milestone that will shift Economics towards a modern science.
B10|Forming the Modern Labour Market Economics: On the Role of Institutionalist Theories|The growing role of institutions and their influence on the labour market outcomes, i.e., wage rates and labour allocation, has been among the most significant characteristic features of labour markets in recent decades. The labour market economics built its paradigm on the principles of marginalism, which brought suitable instruments for the analysis of market agents’ individual decisions capable of achieving effective solutions. Smith’s “invisible hand” has gradually been limited by institutional interventions - by governments, corporations and trade unions with government legislation, corporate personnel policies and collective bargaining. The expanding regulatory interventions in the labour market and the effort to explain the reality leads inevitably to the fact that the modern labour market economics incorporates more and more institutional theories. The contribution outlines the gradual invasion of neoinstitutional topics and theories into the neoclassical labour market paradigm and it analyses the differences between the neoclassical and institutional interpretation of labour market functioning. It presents the recent discussion on the consequences for the labour market economic theory and formulates a conclusion about the modified labour market economic paradigm.
B10|Islamic conscious capitalism: a ‘Third Way’ in light of classical scripture|"The economic paradigm and framework advocated for in Islam is one that entails a unique combination of various socio–economic philosophies. This article advances the notion that Islam promotes a capitalistic economic model wrapped in its own garment of understanding—fashioned with threads of equity and stitched in patterns of benevolence and justice. This article examines the Islamic theological framework relating to the profit incentive and its spiritually–conscious methodology of capital procurement. The Qur’an contains around 370 references in regard to commerce, from which much of Islamic law relating to lending, banking and trading originates (Heck in Muhammad and the Arab roots of capitalism (Studien zur Geschichte und Kultur des Islamichen Orients)—Band 18. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, p 5, 85, 2006 ). This article intends to explore the potential that these teachings have for an Islamic ‘Third Way’ (i.e. an Islamic contribution to economic philosophy and discourse that is in-between of, or an alternative to, both the purely individualistic primary concerns on prices, profits, and private property inherent in ""pure"" capitalism, and the purely communal command economics of communism, which often negates or discourages the promotion of self-interests). Part I of this paper intends to introduce the reader to the various sources of Islamic ‘law’ and its scope. In doing so, the philosophical nature and objectives of the Shariah will become evident, through the exploration of specific theological economic teachings. Part II intends to study Islam’s theological attitude toward entrepreneurship and the profit incentive, as well as the concept of the potential for salvation through ethical profits. Part III explores, in light of classical Islamic scripture, the various prohibitions within the Islamic concept of the economy. In doing so, the paper shall explore how values and theories found in classical Islamic scripture have found contemporary application within the growing modern Islamic finance industry, for example, through Shariah ‘screens’ applied on market indicies, such as the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index. Part III shall also explore Islamic edicts with regards to business practices, as well as environmental ethics. In doing so, Part IV concludes that there can indeed be such an Islamic ‘Third Way’, drawn along similar shared values found amongst other world religions.

B10|Business cycles in the economy and in economics: an econometric analysis|Abstract It is sometimes pointed out that economic research is prone to move in cycles and react to particular events such as crises and recessions. The present paper analyses this issue through a quantitative analysis by answering the research question of whether or not the economic literature on business cycles is correlated with movements and changes in actual economic activity. To tackle this question, a bibliometric analysis of key terms related to business cycle and crises theory is performed. In a second step, these results are confronted with data on actual economic developments in order to investigate the question of whether or not the theoretical literature follows trends and developments in economic data. To determine the connection between economic activity and developments in the academic literature, a descriptive analysis is scrutinized by econometric tests. In the short run, the VARs with cyclical fluctuations point out multiple cases where economic variables Granger-cause bibliometric ones. In the long run, the fractionally cointegrated VARs suggest that many bibliometric variables respond to economic shocks. In the multivariate framework, the Diebold–Mariano test shows that economic variables significantly improve the quality of the forecast of bibliometric indices. The paper also includes impulse-response function analysis for a quantitative assessment of the effects from economic to bibliometric variables. The results point towards a qualified confirmation of the hypothesis of an effect of business cycles and crises in economic variables on discussions in the literature.

B10|Population and economic growth: Ancient and modern| This paper focuses on the evolution of the relationship between population and economic growth from Hume to New Growth Theory. In this paper, we show that there were two main views on the subject. There were those who assumed that the relationship between fertility rate and income was positive. On the other hand, there were those who raised the possibility that this linkage did not occur, and they emphasised that an increase in income did not necessarily lead to having more children. Following from Hicks’ methodological precept, the paper will show that their position on the issue was related to a socio-economic fact: the sibship size effect . We show that those who took the view that an increase in income leads to the desire to have more children did not take into consideration the sibship size effect, while those maintaining that there existed a negative relationship introduced into their utility function a sibship size effect.
B10|Thomas Piketty's Capital in the 21st Century|"Thomas Piketty's ""Capital in the 21st century"" has been the most important book economy in recent times. Its aim integrates the debate theories of growth, income distribution, inequality and differences between the extremes income and income of the majority. The work predicts a slow increase in the share of capital income and inequality. His proposal for a global tax on capital is a way to evaluate such tendencies."
B10|Ideas económicas en torno al servicio de abastecimiento urbano de agua en la Gran Bretaña del siglo XIX|By the mid-nineteenth century, along with other network infrastructures typical of the second industrial revolution, began to take shape the modern system of water supply. The purpose of this paper is to examine the major economic ideas surrounding the beginnings of this new urban service in Britain during the second half of the nineteenth century, which marked a starting point for future analytical developments. First, the socioeconomic importance of improvement of public health through an intensive use of running water. Second, the emergence of the concept of natural monopoly. And finally, the debate about the organization of service management. This interesting case gives us the opportunity to observe the interaction, in both directions, between facts and economic ideas.

B10|The issue of value in economic thought — Part 1: the evolution of views from the 5th century BC to the mid-19th century|This paper is devoted to the evolution of views on the category of value, which for more than two thousand years has been recognized as one of the most important economic concepts. It appeared in the literature thanks to Herodotus in the 5th century BC. Aristotle distinguished use value and exchange value, and demanded the exchange of goods of equal value. St. Thomas Aquinas argued that prices of traded commodities should be of equal value, and that this value is determined by the amount of labour, production costs, needs and income of buyers, as well as the amount of goods offered for sale. W. Petty found that the amount of labour determines the value of goods. The views of the aforementioned thinkers were developed by J. Locke, J. Steuart Denham and R. Cantillon, the last of whom pointed out that market prices oscillate around the proper value of affected goods. For A.R.J. de Turgot, the purchasing power and needs determine the value set by contractors. However, G.F. Le Trosne acknowledged that proper value is determined by use value, production costs and the abundance of things. These views on the objectively existing value of exchanged products were taken over and developed by A. Smith and D. Ricardo, who made value the foundation of the scientific system of economics. This role of the theory of value in economics was not undermined even by the critics of the classical school, including K. Marx, A.H. Müller, and H.Ch. Carey, although for K. Marx, as for D. Ricardo, the theory of value was an element that integrates the whole theoretical system. In turn, the precursors of the subjective-marginal movement, among others, F. Galiani, E.B. de Condillac, A.A. Cournot, and J.M. Hoene-Wronski made the value of goods dependent on the subjective feelings of individuals satisfying their needs or performing work.
B10|Die Macht der Wissenschaftsstatistik und die Entwicklung der Ökonomie|Citation metrics has become an important tool in the assessment of scientific research. Journal rankings and productivity indices are thereby understood as signifying reputation and impact within a scientific community, which is interpreted as a proxy for the quality of research. In this respect, the introduction of citation metrics for research assessment is part of a larger social trend to simplify complex issues by means of numerical expressions. Against this backdrop, this paper takes a look at the effects of the introduction of evaluative scientometrics within the field of economics. It is shown that the “power of citation metrics” has manifold consequences: the instruments of citation metrics not only reinforce conventional patterns of academic reproduction and attention in scientific discourse, but also influence the behavior of single agents as well as the paradigmatic developments of academic disciplines. / Zitationsmessungen und darauf basierende Indices und Ranglisten spielen eine immer wesentlichere Rolle im Wissenschaftsbetrieb, insbesondere im Rahmen der Bewertung und Evaluierung von Forschungsleistungen. Die Etablierung quantitativer Evaluationsroutinen im Wissenschaftsbetrieb steht dabei symptomatisch für einen umfassenderen sozialen Trend, komplexe Sachverhalte durch ihre numerische Fassung scheinbar oder tatsächlich zu vereinfachen. In diesem Kontext versucht dieser Beitrag, die Auswirkungen wissenschaftsstatistischer Evaluationsverfahren auf die weitere Wissenschaftsentwicklung zu analysieren und dabei insbesondere das Beispiel der ökonomischen Disziplin in den Blick zu nehmen. Dabei zeigt sich, dass die Macht der (evaluativen) Wissenschaftsstatistik vielfältige Auswirkungen hervorbringt: So werden akademische Reproduktionslogiken, das Verhalten einzelner AkteurInnen im Wissenschaftsbetrieb sowie die paradigmatische Entwicklung von Disziplinen durch wissenschaftsstatistische Verfahren beeinflusst.
B10|Wissenschaftlicher Fortschritt in den Wirtschaftswissenschaften: Einige Bemerkungen|First, points of view of economists regarding falsificationism, scientific revolutions and scientific research programmes are discussed. Next, hardly debatable scientific progress regarding empirical economic research in recent decades is described. Then it is asked whether there have been scientific revolutions with respect to economic theory or the basic methodology of the economic approach. Taking this term seriously, there have been at best two revolutions since the time of Adam Smith. Today, economists share a common paradigm, which also builds the hard core of their scientific research programme. But while this hard core is hardly questioned, the safety belt is discussed the more. Nevertheless, most today’s economic research can be considered as being ‘normal science’. Even if this kind of research is not without problems, there is no reason to assess it as being of secondary value. / Zuerst wird auf die Positionen verschiedener Ökonomen zu Falsifikationismus, wissenschaftliche Revolutionen und wissenschaftliche Forschungsprogramme eingegangen. Danach wird der kaum bestreitbare Fortschritt dargestellt, der sich in den letzten Jahrzehnten im methodisch-empirischen Bereich vollzogen hat. Im Anschluss daran wird gefragt, ob es neben diesem Fortschritt, der sich vergleichsweise kontinuierlich vollzieht, auch Revolutionen gegeben hat, die sich insbesondere im Bereich der Theorie (bzw. der grundlegenden Methodologie) vollzogen haben. Anschliessend beschäftigen wir uns mit dem Paradigma, welches hinter dem ökonomischen Ansatz steht, sowie mit dem entsprechenden Forschungsprogramm und der Kritik daran. Schliesslich werden Probleme der Normalwissenschaft in den Wirtschaftswissenschaften diskutiert, die heute ohne Zweifel den grössten Raum im Rahmen der wirtschaftswissenschaftlichen Forschung einnimmt. Auch wenn damit einige Probleme verbunden sind, besteht kein Anlass, diese Forschung in irgendeiner Weise abzuwerten.
B10|After Ricardo â€“ after Marx â€“ after Keynes: comparative advantage, mutual advantage and implications for global governance|This paper submits that one of the most fallacious paradigms in economic thought and policy, stemming from Ricardo, has been that of comparative advantage, as it has assumed no capital mobility whereas it has been mainly foreign direct investment that has driven global trade since World War II and has confirmed Marx's claims for uneven development. The paper outlines that this has meant asymmetric outcomes compromising the post-war Bretton Woods system and suggests that this needs both a post-Ricardian and a post-Keynesian conceptual framework for global governance.
B10|İktisadi Düşüncenin İzleğinde Piketty’i Değerlendirmek|Bu çalışmada, iktisadi düşünce tarihinde önemli bir yer edinmiş olan iktisatçıların görüşlerinden hareketle Piketty’nin kapitalist sisteme dair düşünceleri ve bu iktisadi düşünce okulları ile ilişkisi değerlendirilecektir. Piketty kitabında pek çok iktisatçıdan bahsetmekte ve çalışmasını geçmişin kuramsal yapısı üzerine temellendirmektedir. Ancak, bu kuramlarla ilişkisi irdelendiğinde Piketty’nin bu kuramları derinlemesine analiz etmediği açıkça görülmektedir. İdeolojik yönelimi, metodolojik seçimi ve kuramsal kafa karışıklığı Piketty’nin bütüncül bir kapitalizm teorisine ulaşmasını engellemiştir. Kuramsal tartışmaların kapsamı ve derinliği açısından Piketty’nin analizini ne klasik iktisatçıların, Marx’ın ve kurumsal iktisatçıların ne de kendisi gibi kapitalizmi kurtarma derdine düşmüş Keynes’in analizi ile karşılaştırabilmek mümkün görünmemektedir. Piketty, neoklasik iktisada eleştiriler yöneltmiş olsa da sermaye kavramı başta olmak üzere pek çok neokasik kavram ve aracı kullanmış ve dolayısıyla neoklasik analizin analitik sınırlarının dışına çok fazla çıkamamıştır. Dolayısıyla, Piketty neoklasik ortodoksinin sınırları içinde kalarak kapitalizmi kurtaracak bir takım reform önerilerini tartışmıştır. Piketty’nin kitabının bu kadar ilgi görmesinin nedeni hem iktisat teorisi alanında hem de iktisat politikası alanında bir paradigma değişikliğine duyulan ihtiyaçtır. Bu anlamda, Piketty’nin 2008 krizi sonrası süreçte ihtiyaç duyulan söz konusu paradigma değişiminin bir aracısı olacağı umulmuştur. Bu yazıda, Piketty’nin hem teorik anlamda hem de politik anlamda ihtiyaç duyulan paradigma değişimine öncülük edebilmesinin güç olduğu ileri sürülmektedir.
B10|Classical Economists, Marx and Marshall on Dominant Technique|The focal point of this paper is the notion of the dominant technique and its treatment in the theories of value and distribution. Our argument is that neither the average nor the minimum cost production are necessarily identified with the dominant technique in an industry. The dominant technique is in fact approximated with the types of capital, where expansion or contraction of accumulation actually takes place, and in this sense, the dominant is perceived as marginal technique used by firms entering (or leaving), and, therefore, expanding (or contracting) industry’s supply. Such a concept is absolutely consistent with the classical theory of value and is at odds with the neoclassical (not necessarily Marshall’s) theory despite of the adoption of marginal analysis.
B10|L'apport de Pellegrino Rossi à la théorie de l'offre et de la demande : une tentative d'interprétation|Cet article réexamine l'apport de Pellegrino Rossi à la loi de l'offre et de la demande par rapport aux contributions de Say, Ricardo ou Smith. Il montre que Rossi développe une théorie de la valeur originale qui emprunte à la fois à la pensée classique anglaise et à la pensée continentale française et fonde sa conception de l'offre et de la demande. L'article met en évidence les mécanismes novateurs que Rossi retient pour expliquer la loi de l'offre et de la demande pour diverses formes de concurrence par rapport à ceux que Say ou Ricardo envisagent pour la seule libre concurrence. On montre que Rossi peut être considéré comme un précurseur du concept de prix de réservation développé par Jules Dupuit et de plusieurs formes de raisonnements à la marge qui l'amènent à proposer une analyse de la loi de l'offre et de la demande originale.
B10|The economic thought of the first Colombian economists|This paper offers an approximation to the economic thought of the Colombian economists of the middle of the 19th century. It takes some of the most influential economists as a reference: Florentino González, Salvador Camacho Roldán, Aníbal Galindo and Miguel Samper. The way in which the free trade doctrine was incorporated in the thought of the Colombian statesmen is analyzed, mainly with regard to the conception of State. The methodology used is a study of the texts and the rhetoric therein. The conclusion is that the political prescriptions of the economic liberalism, which include the promotion of free trade, the theory of comparative advantage in international trade, the rejection of monopolies and the suspicion on the action of government, exerted a partial influence in the foundation of the liberal nineteenth-century project.
B10|History of Economic Thought, Quo vadis?|"The paper demonstrates that economists lose interest in the study of the history of economic thought (HET). The roots that have affected the move of the HET to the periphery of the mainstream research preferences are analyzed. Based on a review of the current situation in the field of HET studies, the author shows that the field is gradually moving from the realm of the ""pure"" economics to converge with other humanities. The results of the survey of undergraduate and graduate students of the leading Russian universities confirm this trend. Saving HET in the economics curriculum requires deepening its integration with other social sciences."
B10|Political Economy and Neoclassical Theory – Facing the Trial of Time|The object of this paper is the unity and diversity between political economy and the neo classical theory. In the opinion of the author, these are two branches of economic knowledge. The author declares on objection against the view that the neo-classical theory is universal and irreproachable. Life has proved for more complicated than we have imagined it. The paper discuss questions such as „What economic theory do we need?“, issues concerning the interference of the state; theoretical and empirical knowledge; neo-liberal ideology and the economic crisis; pluralism in teaching economic theory.

In addition, the paper advances the catallactic competition model as a possible alternative theoretical framework to be used in enforcing ECP. The research is divided into three main parts.
B10|Karl Polanyi and the Still Surprising Transformation [Karl Polanyi şi transformarea care încă surprinde]|The main work of one of the most important representatives of a brilliant generation of Viennese intellectuals from interwar Austria, The Great Transformation by Karl Polanyi remains even today a fascinating and instructive reading, although its once prophetic character has worn-out. Both as a work of analysis and as social criticism, it has profoundly put a mark on historical sociology and economic history.
B10|Una stagnazione secolare? Italia, Giappone, Stati Uniti, 1950-2015<BR>[Towards a secular stagnation? Italy, Japan, United States, 1950-2015]|This paper discusses the hypothesis of secular stagnation. Firstly, the debate on stagnation, from Alvin Hansen (1938) to Marxists and more recent interpretations is illustrated. Then, the demographic and macroeconomic trends of Italy, Japan and the United States are examined in relationship with the secular stagnation hypothesis.
B10|Is Neoclassical Economics Scientific Knowledge Detached from Ethics? A Kantian Answer, an Institutionalist Alternative|This paper aims to criticize the common idea which sustains that current neoclassical economics is detached from ethics, and therefore is scientific knowledge. Using Kantian critical philosophy, we argue, on the contrary, that neoclassical economics is based on certain ethical postulates, and thus it cannot obtain the status of science. Although ethics is but one of the many institutions that affect economics, it plays a major role in setting the basis on which to build its entire theoretical structure. Approaching the analysis from institutionalism places ethical issues at the forefront of economic debate, thus opening the door to future dialogue between disciplines and analytical approaches.
B10|On the Cambridge, England, Critique of the Marginal Productivity Theory of Distribution|The Cambridge critique of the marginal productivity theory of distribution is entwined with the criticsâ€™ theories of value, price, distribution, capital, growth, and methodology that occurred alongside it. The article first discusses these dimensions, then the inescapable need to explain the origin and size and rate of profits in any approach to the theory of distribution. The need in the neoclassical approach to have a unit in which to measure capital that is independent of distribution and prices is examined. The alternative classical/Marxian alternative and the relationship of pricing and market structures to systemic relationships in Post-Keynesian theory are analysed. Unresolved debates among the critics of the mainstream are outlined including those between Garegnani and Hahn. Ways forward are suggested in the concluding section.
B10|Embracing European Social Sciences in Early Modern Asia|This paper analyzes why and how European social sciences were introduced in East Asian countries, especially China, Japan and Korea, during the early modern period. In the second half of the nineteenth century, East Asian intellectuals were eager to introduce Western social sciences to help overcome a national crisis they faced. To the extent that the crisis originated from internal deteriorations and external threats, they needed to find ways to transform their traditional political, economic and social systems into modern ones. Based on a perspective of evolutionism quite prevalent among East Asian intellectuals at that time, they believed that the competition among the nation-states could be determined by the consequences of modernization efforts. Although the slogans they adopted were heterogeneous, like zhongtixiyong in China, wakonyousai in Japan, and tongdosoki in Korea, they commonly implemented various measures to modernize their systems with the belief that the success of European states could be attributed to the modern institutions and techniques. One very effective way of modernizing the traditional systems in East Asia was to learn from the historical experiences of European countries and to introduce Western social sciences. East Asian intellectuals regarded European social sciences as the black box in which they could find the key secrete of European success. In this sense, they tried to make their nations strong and wealthy by studying European politics and economics as presented in various social science textbooks. Modern state formations and capitalist economy were the two key concepts they maintained in the attempts to modernize their countries. For instance, just as Japanese economics were dominated by liberalist economics and neo-historicism, respectively imported from Britain and Germany, these two trends ended up strongly influencing Chinese and Korean intellectuals. European economics taught East Asian intellectuals various ways to transform their economic structure: the implementation of national census, the construction of social infrastructures, the establishment of business firms, and the promotion of foreign trades. All these measures encouraged the introduction of modern capitalist economy in this area.
B10|The beat of the economic heart|The paper discusses the silimar, but in some respects different explanations of business cycles by Schumpeter and Arthur Spiethoff, his elderly friend and colleague. Spiethoff brought Schumpeter back into academics after the latter’s not very successful careers as a politician and a banker. Both insisted that cycles are endogenous and cannot possibly be eliminated without eliminating the dynamismof the capitalist economy. They thought that theoretical and historical studies were not mutually exclusive, but complementary. The gulf separating pure theory and historical studies since the so-called Methodenstreit was detrimental to the development of economics. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
B10|The Rhetorical Structure of Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations (and the importance of acknowledging it)|"Analyzing the rhetorical structure of The Wealth of Nations (Smith WN) and its context, we make the case for the central importance of its Book V, ""Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth”, which tends to be neglected in most accounts of Smith’s oeuvre (even, most recently, in the outstanding Phillipson 2010) but which in our reading is, rather than a general treatise on optimal taxation and spending, a book focused on the future of an empire being threatened by a Mercantilist system. The Empire in question was, of course, the British one. Book V follows Book IV, in which Smith -- after having documented the slow and unnatural progress of opulence in, among others, England and Scotland in Book III – had undertaken a “very violent attack” (Smith EPS p. 208; Smith Corr. p. 251) on those responsible for the low growth rates (“opulence”) in Scotland and, even more, England: manufacturers and merchants and those politicians who propagated Mercantilist philosophies and practices of the commercial class. Aware that those he targeted would not take kindly to the attack, Smith made his case against the Mercantilist system as well as its colonial policy by marshaling his earlier insights into rhetorical theory and practice. We explain why and how he organized his attack."
B10|Schumpeter’s Assessment of Adam Smith and The Wealth of Nations: Why He Got It Wrong|In his History of Economic Analysis, Joseph Schumpeter (Schumpeter 1954a) dismissed Adam Smith’s Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (Smith 1976) in a blunt and ad hominem manner. We argue that Schumpeter’s assessment resulted from his failure to appreciate the rhetorical structure of Smith’s masterpiece, a failure largely due to Schumpeter not having access to student notes of Smith’s lectures on rhetoric that surfaced only after Schumpeter’s death.
B10|Innovative Enterprise or Sweatshop Economics? In Search of Foundations of Economic Analysis|In Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, Joseph Schumpeter asserts: â€œperfect competition is not only impossible but inferior, and has no title to being set up as a model of ideal efficiency.â€ For neoclassical economists, the large corporation is a â€œmarket imperfectionâ€ that, compared with â€œperfect competition,â€ should result in higher product prices and lower industry output. Yet business history reveals the capability of the most productive enterprises to generate massive quantities of output at low costs to attain large market shares with buyers benefiting from low prices even as employees receive higher pay and shareholders ample dividends. By integrating the history of industrial development in Britain and the United States with the ideas of leading economic thinkers, this essay demonstrates the absurdity of perfect competition as the ideal of economic efficiency. Indeed, I show that, in their desire to make the market rather than the firm the main arbiter of resource allocation, neoclassical economists have enshrined the sweatshop as the foundation of their analysis, with profoundly negative consequences for understanding how a modern economy actually operates and performs. In doing so, neoclassical economists ignore not only the economic history of capitalism but also the intellectual history of their own discipline. I conduct a journey through two hundred years of economic thought â€“ from Adam Smithâ€™s The Wealth of Nations (1776) to Alfred Chandlerâ€™s The Visible Hand (1977) â€“ to derive analytical foundations for a theory of innovative enterprise that can explain and explore firm-level sources of productivity growth in the economy. What then do more sophisticated theories of the firm rooted in the neoclassical tradition have to offer? In a section of this essay that I call (borrowing a phrase from Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means) â€œEconomic Theory for â€˜an Era of Corporate Plunderingâ€™,â€ I outline the shortcomings of Williamsonian transaction-cost theory and Jensenian agency theory for analyzing the role of the business corporation in the operation and performance of the economy. From the perspective of the theory of innovative enterprise, I demonstrate how the methodology of constrained optimization trivializes the business enterprise while the ideology that companies should be run to maximize shareholder value legitimizes financial predators, many senior corporate executives among them, in the looting of the industrial corporation. The â€œera of corporate plunderingâ€ since the mid-1980s has contributed to extreme concentration of income among the richest households and the erosion of middle-class employment opportunities. Finally, I call for a transformation of economic thinking so that the innovative enterprise is at the center of economic analysis. The theory of innovative enterprise exposes as costly intellectual failures â€œperfect competitionâ€ as the ideal of economic efficiency, â€œconstrained-optimizationâ€ as the prime tool of economic analysis, and â€œmaximizing shareholder valueâ€ as the ideology of superior corporate governance. The theory of innovative enterprise provides, moreover, a clear and compelling rationale for sharing the gains of business enterprise among stakeholders in the broader community, in conjunction with government policies that seek to support sustainable prosperity, characterized by stable and equitable economic growth.
B10|Credit, Indebtedness, and Speculation in the Marxian Paradigm: A Critical Analysis|This paper contends that, in Chapters XVII, XXIX, XXX, and XXXI of Volume III of Capital, Marx develops an incisive conceptual framework in which excessive credit creation, indebtedness, and speculation play a critical and growing role in the reproduction of social capital on an extended basis; however, given the decentralized and anarchic nature of capitalist production, the credit system does so in a highly erratic and contradictory manner which only postpones the inevitable day of reckoning. The paper also highlights Marx’s relatively neglected but highly important analysis of the separation of ownership from management in the advanced capitalism of his day, England, and its modern-day implications for excessive risk-taking and debt-fueled speculation up until the eve of the crash. More importantly, the paper argues that in Vols. II and III Marx implicitly connected the expanding role of credit [which he associated with the development of capitalism] to a significant reduction in the turnover period of capital, thereby boosting the rate of surplus-value, and countering in a highly erratic and contradictory manner, the fall in the rate of profit. The growing role of credit has been relatively ignored in the Marxian literature as an important counteracting factor to the law of the declining rate of profit. It is not mentioned at all by Marx in his famous Chp. XIV, Vol. III of Capital where he discusses other important counteracting forces, nor by Engels [in this particular context] who edited both Vols. II and III.
B10|Political realism and models of the state: Antonio de Viti de Marco and the origins of public choice|Abstract It is well known that one of the features of public choice, political realism, is embedded in a time-honored Italian tradition going back to Machiavelli and perpetuated by G. Mosca and V. Pareto in their political and sociological writings. The scientific spirit, which in their era led to the foundation of various social disciplines, fostered the application of economic analysis to the political sphere. In that context, Antonio de Viti de Marco (1858–1943) formulated an economic model of the state, consisting of two types of constitutional extremes: the absolute state and the democratic state. We ask herein how that model may be reconciled to G. Mosca and Pareto’s theory of the ruling class, with which De Viti de Marco agreed. Finally, we analyze his political writings in order to reconstruct his interpretation of collusion, rent seeking and “clientelism”, i.e., the redistribution of extracted rent, which takes place in the form of discretionary allocations of public jobs, public contracts and other corporative favors. Collusion is the use of democratic institutions by the ruling classes in order to gain monopoly power. While collusion is the basis of rent creation, rent extraction is not the final goal of politicians; rather, it is a means of strengthening electoral support.
B10|Some considerations on the influence of economic liberalism in the May Revolution of 1810 in Buenos Aires, Argentina|The revolutionary process of May 1810 in Buenos Aires, capital of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, occurred within the context of the French Revolution, the United States’ struggle for independence and various changes in the European countries’ economies. Liberal ideas played an essential role, and the opinions of Belgrano, Vieytes and Moreno, among others, are the key to understanding the economic perspectives of the revolutionary men. Late mercantilists, physiocrats and classical economists marked these men’s economic thought. The purpose of this paper is to review these intellectual influences on the leaders of the May Revolution.

Im vorliegenden Text wird die menschliche Sprache als soziale Form, als Prozess der Vergesellschaftung rekonstruiert und das damit verbundene Denken daraus entwickelt als Logos. Das Geld stellt logisch und historisch ein Novum innerhalb dieser Vergesellschaftung dar, das zu einer sich immer weiter einlagernden berechnenden Vernunftform (Ratio) führt. Diese wachsende Dominanz der Ratio über den Logos charakterisiert den Prozess der Modernisierung und erlaubt zugleich ihren inneren Gegensatz aufzudecken. Es zeichnet sich schließlich in der völligen Verdinglichung der Ratio in der Künstlichen Intelligenz eine neue Weise der Vergesellschaftung ab, worin die Herrschaft des Geldes in neuer Form reproduziert wird."
B10|A Development Consensus reconciling the Beijing Model and Washington Consensus: Views and Agenda|Reconciling the two dominant development models of the Washington Consensus (WC) and Beijing Model (BM) remains a critical challenge in the literature. The challenge is even more demanding when emerging development paradigms like the Liberal Institutional Pluralism (LIP) and New Structural Economics (NSE) schools have to be integrated. While the latter has recognized both State and market failures but failed to provide a unified theory, the former has left the challenging concern of how institutional diversity matter in the development process. We synthesize perspectives from over 150 recently published papers on development and Sino-African relations in order to present the relevance of both the WC and BM in the long-term and short-run respectively. While the paper provides a unified theory by reconciling the WC and the BM to complement the NSE, it at the same time presents a case for economic rights and political rights as short-run and long-run development priorities respectively. By reconciling the WC with the BM, the study contributes at the same to macroeconomic NSE literature of unifying a development theory and to the LIP literature on institutional preferences with stages of development. Hence, the proposed reconciliation takes into account the structural and institutional realities of nations at difference stages of the process of development.
B10|"The Return of ""Patrimonial Capitalism"": A Review of Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century"|Capital in the Twenty-First Century by Thomas Piketty — one of the most widely discussed economic books in the last decade — provides a unified theory of the functioning of the capitalist economy by linking theories of economic growth and functional and personal income distributions. It argues, based on the long-run historical data series, that the forces of economic divergence (including rising income inequality) tend to dominate in capitalism. It regards the twentieth century as an exception to this rule and proposes policies that would make capitalism sustainable in the twenty-first century.

B10|Paid Basic Income, Fertility Rates and Economic Growth|The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of paid basic income on fertility rates in a model in which fertility rates are endogenous. I show that when child labor is not a crucial part of the income of the family, then paid basic income will lead to higher fertility rates. However, when child labor is a necessity, then in fact an increase in paid basic income will lead to a reduction in fertility rates.
B10|The Ottoman Empire And The Preservation Of Wallachia'S Fiscal Potential (1730-1774)|In this paper I analyze the way in which the Porte viewed and put into practice the principle of protecting the tax-paying subjects and, therefore, the fiscal potential of Wallachia in the eighteenth century. The Porte was directly involved in protecting and confirming not only its direct resources, like tribute and provisions, but also the ones entrusted to Wallachian princes, like salt mines, customs and taxes paid by neighbors for pasturing their livestock in Wallachia. The principle of protecting the wealth of the state was imposed also as the duty of the appointed princes, who risked losing their position if they disturbed the fiscal system, by oppression and heavy taxation. These aspects reveal the intensification of the actions undertaken by the Porte in 18th century to control the periphery.
B10|A Brief History of International Trade Thought: From Pre-doctrinal Contributions to Contemporary Neoclassical Economics|The present paper outlines the development of international trade thought, from the pre-doctrinal contributions of Greek philosophers and scholastic theologians, through the theories of the first schools of economic thought, and up to modern trade theories. I follow filiations of ideas in a chronological order, and show how theoretical investigation into the causes and effects of international trade - and the necessity of government intervention - has evolved over centuries of economic thought.

B10|The Sustainability Of Organizations From The Perspective Of Socially Responsible Investments|In order to comply with the principles of development set by the European Union (EU) within Europe 2020 Strategy, the European society, as well as the Romanian society must become sustainable. The sustainability should be the guideline of development for countries, regions, corporations, small and medium enterprises, and citizens. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the sustainable development of companies, and the decision making in view to socially responsible and sustainable investments. The aim of the study was achieved by conducting an analysis of the perceptions of 100 companies from Romania regarding sustainable development, corporate social responsibility and socio-responsible investments. The analysis resulted in a ranking of the domains toward which companies have directed the socio-responsible and sustainable investments. The following research methods were used in order to achieve the goal of the paper: quantitative and qualitative methods, including the monographic or descriptive method, the analysis and synthesis method, statistical research methods, including grouping, comparison, and the correlation analysis. Calculation and data processing were carried out by using Microsoft Excel.
B10|El pensamiento económico de los primeros economistas colombianos|RESUMEN: Este trabajo ofrece una aproximación al pensamiento económico de los economistas colombianos de mediados del siglo XIX. Se toman como referencia algunos de los más influyentes: Florentino González, Salvador Camacho Roldán, Aníbal Galindo y Miguel Samper, y se analiza la forma en la que la doctrina del libre cambio se fue incorporando en el pensamiento de los estadistas colombianos, principalmente con respecto a la concepción del Estado. La metodología usada es el estudio de los textos y su retórica. Se concluye que las prescripciones políticas del liberalismo económico, que incluyen la promoción del libre cambio, la teoría de la ventaja comparativa en el comercio internacional, el rechazo de los monopolios y la sospecha sobre la acción del gobierno ejercieron una influencia parcial en la cimentación del proyecto liberal decimonónico.
B10|La influencia de la investigación operativa en la conformación de los precios comerciales y su impacto en las teorías del valor|A partir del estudio técnico, tecnológico e histórico de la evolución de la investigación operativa,como disciplina matemática aplicada al campo de la Economía Política previo desarrollo de la manufactura y la maquinaria, el autor estudia la influencia de dicha disciplina en la conformación de los costes de producción y su influencia en los precios de producción, así como el impacto que ello supone en los precios comerciales de las mercancías en tanto se trata de conectar esta influencia con la relación entre técnica y tecnología y teorías del valor. La forma en que tanto la teoría de la utilidad marginal como la teoría del valor trabajo enfocan esta influencia tecnológica será analizada desde la teoría del cierre categorial, teoría de la ciencia desarrollada por el filósofo español Gustavo Bueno.

B10|Credit, Indebtedness, and Speculation in the Marxian Paradigm: A Reassessment|This paper argues that, in Chapters XXIX and XXX of Volume III of Capital, Marx develops an incisive conceptual framework in which excessive credit creation, indebtedness, and speculation play a critical and growing role in the reproduction of social capital on an extended basis; however, given the decentralized and anarchic nature of capitalist production, it does so in a highly erratic and contradictory manner which only postpones the inevitable day of reckoning. The paper also draws important parallels between Marx's analysis of debt-fuelled crises and the events leading up to the subprime debacle of 2007-08. Finally, the paper contends that had Marx lived to re-write Vols. II and III, he would have explicitly connected the expanding role of credit [which he associated with the development of capitalism] to a significant reduction in the turnover period of capital, thereby boosting the rate of surplus-value, and countering in a highly erratic and contradictory manner, the fall in the rate of profit. The growing role of credit has been ignored in the Marxian literature as an important counteracting factor to the law of the declining rate of profit.

B10|A Schumpeterian analysis of the credit market|Schumpeter shows that bank credit acts as money-capital and, therefore, constitutes the necessary premise for the realization of the innovative processes planned by entrepreneurs. This makes it important to specify the debt contracts between each bank and entrepreneurs during the prosperity phase of Schumpeter's cyclical development. The present paper aims to point out the achievements and the limits of Schumpeter's monetary theory with respect to this point, that is the debt contract design. On the side of the limits, I maintain that Schumpeter's approach, although representing one of the most stimulating contributions in the history of economic analysis, asks for refinements as regard to the objective-function of the individual banks, the determination of the interest rates, and the usableness of the credit demand and supply curves. Schumpeter's posthumous treatise on money provides stimulating insights for the definition of these refinements.
B10|Implications of different understandings of financial crises for divergent conclusions on the connections between finance and sustainability|The reasons and implications of different understandings of the ongoing financial crisis may be thoroughly assessed by starting the investigation from a taxonomy of the competing visions of the capitalist system and of the approach required to understand it. This paper focuses in particular on the nexus between money/credit/finance (from now on “money”) on one side and the real economy on the other side and is articulated in a sequence of sections grouped in three parts. The first part sketches the historical and conceptual path that leads from the early reflections on money to the recent insights on financialisation, stressing only the basic conceptual options and their implications. The analysis starts from the quantitative aspects of money that have been since long a crucial object of political economy, then economics and finally macroeconomics. Section 2 I sketches a bird’s eye view of the mainstream approach from Hume to Woodford; then section 3 outlines the parallel evolution of the heterodox point of view from Marx to Minsky. Section 4 discusses the main views of orthodox and heterodox economists on money as structure. Section 5 investigates why the different paradigms mentioned above lead to different understandings of the meaning and role of financialisation. The second part sketches the conceptual path that leads from the early reflections on economic crises to different understandings of the great crises and to contrasting views on the sustainability of the economic system. Section 6 I discusses the foundations and implications of different views on business-cycle crises while section 7 I considers the main approaches to the understanding and control of great crises. Finally section 8 examines the concepts of sustainability associated to the paradigms analysed above. The third part investigates the interaction between financialisation and sustainability from the synchronic point of view (section 9), and then from the diachronic point of view (section 10), focusing on their broad policy implications. Section 11 concludes.
B10|Financialisation and Sustainability:a Long-run Perspective|This paper argues that there is a secular tendency towards financialisation that is intrinsic in the development of market relations. The driving force of this evolutionary process is rooted in a progressive but discontinuous flow of financial innovations meant to remove the existing constraints to the flexibility of economic transactions. According to received wisdom, the adoption of money as medium of exchange has removed the strictures of double coincidence of wants, while the modern forms of credit have been developed to relax the cash-in-advance constraint to economic transactions. As these examples suggest, financial innovations aim to extend the set of exchange options in time, space and contents for the decision makers who introduce them. Financial innovations are adopted because, ceteris paribus, a larger option set is positively correlated with higher expected returns and pay-off opportunities. Their systemic effects, however, may have negative implications such as financial instability, underinvestment in the real sector, unemployment, stagnation. When the negative consequences accumulate beyond a tolerable threshold, the remedy has been sought in stricter rules of self-regulation, or rather of regulation by law, or even in severe measures of financial repression. The fact that this did not happen so far after the recent deep crisis has further enhanced the unsustainability of the current process of financialisation.
B10|Utilitarianism and anti-utilitarianism|Volume III contains entries on the development of major fields in economics from the inception of systematic analysis until modern times. The reader is provided with succinct summary accounts of the main problems, the methods used to address them and the results obtained across time. The emphasis is on both the continuity and the major changes that have occurred in the economic analysis of problematic issues such as economic growth, income distribution, employment, inflation, business cycles and financial instability. Each Handbook can be read individually and acts as a self-contained volume in its own right. It can be purchased separately or as part of a three-volume set.
B10|Crecimiento económico y pobreza en el mundo de 1960 a 2011 ¿Qué resultados da el capitalismo?|El objetivo de este artículo es mostrar si el capitalismo puede generar pobreza en el largo plazo. Se analizan los siguientes aspectos: 1) las ideas de J. Schumpeter, Friedrich von Hayek y Karl Marx sobre crecimiento económico y pobreza; 2) la evolución del capitalismo en los indicadores de crecimiento económico, pobreza, desempleo durante los últimos 50 años, y, 3) se presentan los resultados de un modelo no-paramétrico relacionando pobreza, pib per cápita, desempleo y desigualdad/ The aim of this paper is to show if capitalism causes poverty in the long run. It discusses the following aspects: 1) J. Schumpeter, Friedrich von Hayek, and Karl Marx’s ideas in growth and poverty; 2) capitalism performance in growth, poverty, and unemployment since 1960 to presenday, and, 3) results in a nonparametric model relating poverty, gdp per capita, unemployment, and inequality
B10|Crises e Ciclos no Pensamento Económico Português na Primeira Metade do Século XX|This research aims to critically assess the references to theories of crises and economic cycles that existed in the main textbooks on political economy of Portuguese universities during the first half of the 20th Century, and, as much as possible, categorise their authors into international trends of economic thought. The conclusions support the position that the various studies that have been made of the panorama of economic thought in Portugal up to the end of the first half of the past century, have essentially shown, namely, a delay in the reception of new economic theories and an absence of autonomous production during that period.
B10|Remembering Jim Buchanan|James Buchanan was an important influence on the Austrian revival and not incidentally on my own career. By taking the work of Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek and Israel Kirzner seriously at a time when Austrian economics was ignored by the economics profession and by making his own contributions to subjectivist economics, Buchanan helped make the Austrian perspective professionally respectable, and inspired a generation of young economists interested in the Austrian school.

B10|The empire strikes back: Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, and the Robust Political Economy of empire|Recent scholarship regarding the idea of a U.S. Empire has raised serious questions as to the feasibility and desirability of imperial ambitions. This paper traces the debate over the net-benefit of empire back to the Classical economists. Adam Smith argued that the British Empire was a net cost while John Stuart Mill concluded the same empire was a net benefit. Contemporary arguments about a U.S. Empire map neatly to the divergent views of Smith and Mill. In addition to engaging in an exercise in history of thought, we use Smith’s political economy as a means of adjudicating between the different claims regarding the feasibility of empire. In doing so, we subject the claims of proponents of American Empire against the standard of robust political economy, which holds that intervention must generate desirable outcomes where less than ideal incentive and epistemic conditions hold. In doing so, we conclude that many of the claims made by proponents are fragile under less than ideal conditions. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
B10|A láthatatlan kéz - szemelvények egy metafora történetéből<BR>[The invisible hand - extracts from the history of a metaphor]|A láthatatlan kéz Adam Smith nyomán a közgazdaságtan legismertebb metaforája lett, de jelentősége és értelmezése máig megosztja a közgazdászokat és eszmetörténészeket. Az interpretációk skálája rendkívül széles: mértékadó közgazdászok szerint ez a közgazdaságtan alapeszméje, míg mások Smith ironikus tréfájának vélik. A tanulmány áttekinti a láthatatlan kéz Smith előtti használatát teológiai, politikai és irodalmi szövegekben és a hozzájuk kapcsolódó interpretációkat. Ezt követően bemutatja, hogyan alkalmazta Smith a nevezetes kifejezést a merkantilista politika ironikus és paradox kritikájaként, és miként került a 19. század végétől e metafora a Smith-olvasatokban központi helyre, majd miként vált kérdésessé ez a felfogás a 2008-as válság nyomán.

B10|La emblemática y el pensamiento económico español de finales del siglo XVI y principios del XVII/The Emblematic and Spanish Economic Thought of the Late Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth|En 1531 el jurista italiano Andrea Alciato (1492-1550) publicó la obra Emblematum liber que tuvo una gran influencia en toda la Europa de la Edad Moderna. El trabajo de Alciato estaba compuesto por una antología de textos poéticos que estaban ilustrados y que a su vez contenían cada uno de ellos un título o lema. Así, por medio de la ilustración y el lema se pretendía facilitar la comprensión o interpretación del texto por parte del lector. Esta obra es considerada el punto de partida de la emblemática que más tarde dio lugar al género literario de la emblemática. La obra de Alciato animó o a muchos autores a seguir el camino de los emblemas. La correspondencia entre el título -inscriptio-, la imagen -pictura-, con un texto explicativo -subscriptio o epigrama- dio lugar a un género consolidado que se extendió por Europa. Pues bien el objetivo de este trabajo es presentar la influencia que la emblemática tuvo en el pensamiento económico español de finales del siglo XVI y principios del XVII, en concreto en las obras de Cristóbal Pérez de Herrera (1556-1620) y Diego Saavedra Fajardo (1584-1648). In 1531 the Italian jurist Andrea Alciato (1492-1550) published Emblematum liber, a work that had a great influence on Europe. Alciato's work consisted of an anthology of poems that were illustrated, each of which had a title or theme. The purpose of the illustration and the title was intended to facilitate the understanding and interpretation of the text by the reader. Emblematum liber is considered the starting point of the emblematic which later gave rise to the emblematic literary genre. Alciato's work encouraged many authors to follow the path of the emblems. The correspondence between the title (inscription), image (pictura), and explanatory text (subscriptio or epigrama) gave rise to a consolidated gender that spread rapidly throughout Europe. The purpose of this paper is to present the influence that emblematic had on Spanish economic thought of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, in particular on the works of Cristóbal Pérez de Herrera (1556-1620) and Diego Saavedra Fajardo (1584-1648).
B10|Robert Torrens e a teoria clássica do lucro [Robert Torrens and the classical theoyr of profits]|This paper reconstructs the evolution of Colonel Robert Torrens' theory of profits based on its critique of the Ricardian theory of value. Initially, it describes the attack conducted by him on the idea of the amount of labor being the sole factor to regulate mercantile exchanges. After that, McCulloch's and Ricardo's arguments in defense of this principle are presented. It continues by examining the origins of Torren's systemic approach to profits, based on the reciprocal interdependence of the productive sectors. Next, the applications of such theory carried out by the Colonel are considered, especially the support for free trade. Finally, it highlights the pioneer character of his approach to profits within the overall setting of classical economics.
B10|The Market – Adivine Angel (with a Nimbus) and Also a Devil (with Horns)|“The great social mechanism of civilization” – the market and its immanent instrument - the money has many thousand-years old history. However, it has achieved its excellence over the last centuries of the new, postmodern and modern time. Namely in that period of many centuries it has shown its controversial social role appearing itself as a divine angel for one part of the society (for part of the middle class and mainly for those who are above it) but for the other part (the ruining part of the middle class and all those who are underneath) it is like a devil with horns or Satan. Its satanic role has two major manifestations – the crisis including the so-called fundamental crisis which leads to a specific agony, chaos and new hell as also the unseen and permanently growing differentiation in social economic inequalities between the people. It is talked about a ratio of 1:99 (one to ninety nine). It is not occasionally that even the World Economic Forum of the elite in Davos denied the market – fundamental model and promoted the motto-appeal saying “New Age, New Capitalism!” which is a desire and expectation of almost all the people except of the oligarchical ruling class and largely the expert managerial elite which serves it.
B10|Credit, The Turnover of Capital, and the Law of the Falling Rate of Profit: A Critical Note|This paper argues that the total turnover period of capital, comprising both its time of production and circulation, has been almost totally ignored in the Marxian literature as an important counteracting factor to the law of the declining rate of profit. It is not mentioned at all by Marx in his famous Chapter XIV, Vol. III of Capital where he discusses other important counteracting forces, nor by Engels (in this particular context), who edited both Vols II and III of Capital. Moreover, this note contends that had Marx lived to re-write Vols II and III, he probably would have explicitly connected the expanding role of credit (associated with the development of capitalism) to a significant reduction in the turnover period of capital, thereby boosting the rate of surplus value, and countering, in an highly erratic, and contradictory manner, the fall in the rate of profit.

Coordinated by Giuseppe Toniolo, president of Unione popolare, the meeting tackled issues related to the world of work in the industrial and agricultural fields. Speechs of Giuseppe Toniolo, first of all, but also those of other speakers as Francesco Fontana and Giulio Bevilacqua, allowed to describe the conditions of the historic Italian underemployment and the need of a non-ideological and nonantagonistic unionism in Italy in the early twentieth century, in order to meet the evolving needs of the contemporary model of national development

Giuseppe Toniolo and the beginning of the 'Settimana sociale dei cattolici italiani')|The article focuses on the double role of Giuseppe Toniolo as economist and promoter of the Catholic movement, dealing with one of his successful initiatives: ‘La Settimana sociale dei cattolici italiani’. The essay describes the project that aimed to popularize the Catholic social doctrine and that during its first years (1907-1908) resulted in three great meetings held in Pistoia, Brescia and Palermo. These events, that required a lot of work to Toniolo as scholar and leader of Catholic associations, met a great number of obstacles of political nature and, also of intellectual, doctrinal and regional origin.
B10|The Classical-Keynesian Paradigm: Policy Debate in Contemporary Era|For almost a century, the famous C-K paradigm (formally known as Classics – Keynesian Paradigm) has been the apex of economic debate and research. The paradigm represents two schools of thoughts which, somehow, have prevailed till now. Economists who believe in either of the two schools have been at loggerheads, and they still are, to prove one theory better than the other. Numerous economic scholars of present era believe that with the changes that have occurred in the economic system, the world is turning back to classical model. But, there are others who believe that Keynes theory is still alive and valid. In this paper, we have tried to draw a brief comparison that highlights the major differences between the two theories with specific reference to the economic, political and social environment prevailing at time when these theories were generated. Paper also discusses the relevance of unending policy debate about these theories in the current era with special emphasis on policy implications with a view to draw pertinent lessons for the present and future.
B10|Why didn't economists predict the Great Depression?|Economists failed to forecast the Great Depression, perhaps because they had lacked reason to theorize enough about business cycles. Since theory is a public good, the market produces too little of it. The prospect of ex post fame may induce theory; but fame comes from explaining famous events, not from averting adverse events. Also, learning-by-doing induces theory by cutting its cost, favoring the first theories to be developed. These dealt with markets – not business cycles – in the decades before the Depression.
B10|Economía política de la modernidad<BR>[Political economics of modernity]|This article consists of three parts. The first response to the idea of ​​keeping TOCQUEVILLE own arguments in Old Regime and the Revolution, without reproducing copiously text line by line. This component is the main concerns and conflicting judgments about the revolution, the decisive role that the author gives to religion and how Europe was in ruins. Tocqueville is particularly interested in showing the exacting nature of feudal rights especially in France. Administrative centralization is an institution par excellence of the Old Regime and the same process. In the second part devoted several sessions to understand the reasons TOCQUEVILLE claims to show the history of property rights and land tenure. In the third session we show the influence of the Revolution and encyclopedic deviations could have brought the author. The reformist spirit of the French during the period from the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries. Tocqueville scholars encounter numerous observations annotations that can supplement your readings.
B10|A Development Consensus reconciling the Beijing Model and Washington Consensus: Views and Agenda|Reconciling the two dominant development models of the Washington Consensus (WC) and Beijing Model (BM) remains a critical challenge in the literature. The challenge is even more demanding when emerging development paradigms like the Liberal Institutional Pluralism (LIP) and New Structural Economics (NSE) schools have to be integrated. While the latter has recognized both State and market failures but failed to provide a unified theory, the former has left the challenging concern of how institutional diversity matter in the development process. We synthesize perspectives from over 150 recently published papers on development and Sino-African relations in order to present the relevance of both the WC and BM in the long-term and short-run respectively. While the paper provides a unified theory by reconciling the WC and the BM to complement the NSE, it at the same time presents a case for economic rights and political rights as short-run and long-run development priorities respectively. By reconciling the WC with the BM, the study contributes at the same to macroeconomic NSE literature of unifying a development theory and to the LIP literature on institutional preferences with stages of development. Hence, the proposed reconciliation takes into account the structural and institutional realities of nations at difference stages of the process of development.
B10|Commento di Modigliani alla teoria della disoccupazione di Sylos Labini (attraverso la corrispondenza del 1956)|"This note discusses Modigliani's and Sylos Labini's unemployment theory starting from a long letter Modigliani wrote to his friend and colleague, commenting the provisional edition of ""Oligopolio e Progresso Tecnico"" (1956). While in his influential article review (1958) Modigliani especially analysed and developed along original lines Sylos Labini's microeconomic theory, in the letter he deeply discussed Sylos Labini macroeconomics. Modigliani criticized Sylos Labini's classical definition of investment and the ensuing confusion between monetary and real causes of unemployment. From their correspondence their different theoretical perspective clearly stands out: Modigliani was interested in explaining the emergence of unemployment equilibrium in a static context, Sylos Labini its persistence as the result of structural changes."

B10|Formation et phylogénie des concepts de « marché » dans l’économie politique au xviiie siècle|Comment les économistes du xviiie siècle ont-ils intégré le mot « marché » dans leurs énoncés ? Alors qu’il ne relève que des pratiques courantes jusqu’au début du xviiie siècle, le marché devient par la suite un concept économique dans les énoncés de plusieurs auteurs. Pour comprendre ce changement, une phylogénie des concepts du marché est nécessaire, car les études limitées à un ou deux auteurs ne sont pas en mesure d’en suivre le processus de formation, nécessairement polygénique. À travers les dictionnaires, les usages courants du marché laissent apparaître deux conceptions (sérielle et centrée), qui peuvent être reliées à deux formes savantes du marché : une forme simple (Cantillon, Turgot et Morellet) et une forme développée (Smith et Condillac). Ces liens doivent être combinés avec les conceptions de la valeur antérieures, afin de proposer un maillage phylogénique non linéaire. Il permet de conclure que les concepts métaphysiques relatifs à la providence n’ont pas participé au processus de formation des concepts savants du marché.
B10|La moral hobbesiana como equilibrio de mercado|Este escrito constituye una lectura económica de la obra de Thomas Hobbes, dirigida a entender conductas morales como resultado de equilibrios de mercado. Partiendo de una economía de intercambio donde el precio de los bienes obedece a su costo de oportunidad, se muestra usando Teoría de Juegos el surgimiento de conductas morales en un escenario anterior a la formación del Estado. Cuando el Estado ha sido consolidado dejan de ser posibles los comportamientos estratégicos y surge la posibilidad de competencia perfecta. La Teoría del Equilibrio General adquiere entonces valor para entender la presencia de conductas morales en el estado civil hobbesiano. El resultado es que independientemente de la presencia o ausencia del Estado, las conductas morales en Hobbes constituyen equilibrios de mercado motivados por el deseo individual de comerciar. KEY Classification-JEL: B10. B13.
B10|The missing link: From Kautilya’s The Arthashastra to modern economics|The aim of this paper is twofold: first, to provide evidence supporting the thesis that Kautilya was the first political economist; second, to verify that a systematic study of political economy has begun long before the ideas and works of Adam Smith. It was in the works of Kautilya (around 375 B.C.). In order to validate the aims of our study, we look for evidence in his Arthashatra of rational behaviour, self-interest motivation, and market elements of a traditional commercial society. Providing a sound interpretation of Kautilya’s main arguments, we demonstrate that his is no less a systematic study in political economy than Smith’s The Wealth of Nations. Economics is a science that tries to offer policies and practices for creating and enriching a nation’s wealth, and in that sense, the Arthashastra (literal translation being The Science of Wealth) represents the first systematic manual of political economy. The development of economics as a science must take cognition of the economic principles and ideas presented in The Arthashastra so as to reveal the true origins of economic thought and its evolution. It is only by understanding methodological problems in a historical perspective we can understand the modern methodological and conceptual issues.
B10|Evolución histórica del Banco de la República en Colombia: una aproximación|Este documento hace un breve recorrido histórico de la evolución de la Banca Central en el país, empezando por el periodo de la historia de Colombia conocido como la Regeneración, pasando a la misión Kemmerer, el fin de patrón oro, la creación de la Junta Monetaria, hasta llegar a la independencia del Banco de la República en 1991.******This document is a brief history of the evolution of Central Banking in Colombia, beginning with the period of history known as the Regeneration Colombia, passing Kemmerer mission, the end of the gold standard, the creation of the Monetary Board, up to the independence of the Bank of the Republic in 1991.
B10|Protection of competition in the contemporary global economy as a challenge for the competition theory|Although the phenomenon of competition is fundamental of the economic theory and policy, the scientists have not yet achieved the consensus concerning the kind of competition which should be protected. Contemporary researchers striving to find the answer to this question rely on their predecessors achievements and the recognition that all elements of the classical structure-conduct-performance paradigm are influencing each other. Thus, the current research on competition is conducted within the confines of the theory of economy and management and the protection of competition in the contemporary global economy constitutes a challenge for the competition theory in all three areas mentioned in the paradigm. Given the above, there are several issues of vital importance. Firstly, the development of MNs in the direction of diversified networks which are interconnected with different contractual and ownership multidimensional ties, secondly, the need to take into account the relations between the competitors on other geographical and product markets in the analysis of competition on the local market, and thirdly, the need to widen the traditional perception of the protection of competition to other areas, which have not been covered by antitrust policy so far.
B10|Marshall and Walras, disequilibrium trades and the dynamics of equilibration in the continuous double auction market|Prices and quantities converge to the theoretical competitive equilibria in continuous, double auction markets. The double auction is not a tatonnement mechanism. Disequilibrium trades take place. The absence of any influence of disequilibrium trades, which have the capacity to change the theoretical equilibrium, appears to be due to a property found in the Marshallian model of single market adjustments. The Marshallian model incorporates a principle of self-organizing, coordination that mysteriously determines the sequence in which specific pairs of agents trade in an environment in which market identities and agent preferences are not public. Disequilibrium trades along the Marshallian path of trades do not change the theoretical equilibrium. The substance of this paper is to demonstrate that the Marshallian principle captures a natural tendency of the adjustment in single, continuous, double auction markets and to suggest how it takes place. The Marshallian model of quantity adjustment and the Walrasian model of market price adjustment can be seen as companion theories that explain the allocation and price processes of a market. The Marshallian model explains the evolution of the allocation, who will meet and trade, and the Walrasian excess demand explains the evolution of prices when they do.
B10|French economists and the purchasing power of money| When French economists read The Purchasing Power of Money , they were primarily interested in the equation of exchange and the reformulation that Fisher proposed regarding the quantity theory of money. This reading led them to ponder the meaning that should be given to this theory and to study its empirical significance. Some of them, namely Rueff and Divisia, went further still and considered Fisher's work as a starting point for their own analyses, which were related in particular to the monetary index, the integration of money into general equilibrium theory and the analysis of monetary phenomena in an open economy.

B10|Facts, Theories, and Policies in the History of Economics. An Introductory Note|Facts, theories, and policies can be considered as the vertices of a triangle. While many contributions explore along the edges of such triangle, between couples of poles, we claim that the history of economics thought is fundamentally interested in looking within the whole area of the triangle. The relationship among theories, public choices, and events is complex, often twodirectional, with some unforeseeable short circuits. In order to tackle such complexity, it is necessary to use an interpretative model that assumes a high degree of interdependence between such variables and focuses on the evolution of their mutual interactions over time. The paper aims to show that this is the approach that the works presented in this issue of the journal try to address and illustrates some of their key features, in particular country-specificity and ideological bias.

B10|Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1): Chapter One, Background and Historical Setting|"This paper puts John Maynard Keynes’ ""The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money"" into its historical context, both in terms of economic history and in terms of the history of economics. It discusses the post-World War I period as background to the General Theory, looks at the influence of other economists of the period on the evolution of Keynes’ thought and considers the parallels between the post-World War period and the post-Napoleonic War period, when Ricardo and Malthus were debating issues very similar to the ones with which Keynes was wrestling."
B10|Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (2): Chapter 2, “The Postulates of the Classical Economics”|Chapter 2 is one of the most important chapters in the General Theory. Not only does it set out Keynes’ disagreements with key elements of the classical model, it lays out his own model of the working of the labour market, which underlies the analysis in the remainder of the General Theory. The issue of how labour’s response to a change in its real wage differs depending on whether the change is driven by a change in the nominal wage or in the price of consumer goods plays a key part in the way Keynes’ theoretical model is developed here. This chapter introduces Keynes’ concept of involuntary unemployment and sets out his argument about the causal relation between the real wage and the level of unemployment, and about the consequent cyclicality of the real wage. Chapter 2 also includes Keynes’ discussion of Say’s Law.
B10|Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (3): Chapter 3, “The Principle of Effective Demand”|In Chapter 3 of the General Theory, Keynes sketches out what he calls the essence of the General Theory of Employment. He introduces the Keynesian expenditure-based model, his aggregate demand function and also his aggregate supply function, a concept which spawned much debate among Post-Keynesian economists but which was, for a long time, virtually ignored in mainstream macroeconomics. He sets out the Savings = Investment version of Say’s Law and outlines how an economy can settle into an equilibrium at less than full employment.
B10|"Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (4): Chapter 4, ""The Choice of Units""; Chapter 5, ""Expectations as Determining Output and Employment"""|In Chapter 4 of the General Theory, Keynes discusses the units of measurement he will be using in the remainder of the book, in particular his reason for measuring in nominal rather than real terms, objection to aggregate measures of real output and physical capital stock, and his concept of wage units, which is a source of difficulty in following bits of the later exposition. Chapter 5 introduces expectations and discusses the role of short run expectations in determining the behavior of firms and of economic aggregates.
B10|Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (5): Chapter 6, The Definition of Income, Saving and Investment; Appendix to Chapter 6, Appendix on User Cost; Chapter 7, The Meaning of Saving and Investment Further Considered|Chapter Six and its Appendix deal in some detail with the way Keynes is defining income, savings and investment in the General Theory while the appendix to Chapter 6 goes into detail on user cost. His concept of user cost at one point sparked a certain amount of controversy among Keynesians but has since virtually been forgotten. It is of interest to us because user cost is the place where Keynes sees firms taking account of the future consequences of their current production decisions. The General Theory is a theory of the short run, but firms’ cost curves, which are key to many short run decisions, contain a forward looking element. Chapter 7 returns to the concepts of saving and investment, relates Keynes’ definitions to those used by others (including his own from the Treatise) and relates aggregate investment, which refers to additions to physical capital stock, to the way the term is often used at the micro level, in the sense of investment in financial assets.
B10|Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (6): Chapters 8, 9 and 10: Keynes’ Theory of Consumer Behaviour|Chapters 8, 9 and 10 set out Keynes’ theory of consumer behavior. Chapter 8 is entitled The Propensity to Consume: I. The Objective Factors, Chapter 9 is The Propensity to Consume: II. The Subjective Factors, and Chapter 10 is The Marginal Propensity to Consume and the Multiplier. Contrary to the widely held belief, Keynes saw the consumer as an intertemporally optimizing agent, in a manner which is quite consistent with Frank Ramsey’s model of intertemporal saving behavior and with modern theories of the behavior of the optimizing consumer. While he did conclude that in the short run income would be the dominant factor underlying consumer behavior, this was an empirical judgement, not simply an assumption about fundamental psychological propensities. Chapter 10 formally introduces the marginal propensity to consume and the multiplier.
B10|Innovation concepts and typology – an evolutionary discussion|This paper is devoted to the analysis of evolution of innovation concepts, aspects and types. First emergence and evolution of different aspects and concepts of innovation are analyzed, and then the development of innovation concepts from a historical perspective and finally an overview of the types of innovation classifications developed in the literature are given. Complementary the different definitions of innovation are described and analyzed in detail. The main goal of the article is to identify, describe and visualize the development trend of innovation conceptualization and understanding over time
B10|The principal problem in political economy: income distribution in the history of economic thought|The paper considers the history of theories of income distribution, from the time of Adam Smith until the 1970s. It is divided into two main parts. Part I considers the positive theory of income distribution, beginning with the classical economists’ analysis of the functional distribution of income between wages, profits and rent. It goes on to present the new theories that emerged with the marginalist revolution and which were based on maximizing behaviour and market equilibrium. The main focus during the early stages of the new developments was on the markets for consumer goods and the role of marginal utility in price determination. The later neoclassical economists, including Alfred Marshall and Knut Wicksell, paid more attention to the special features that characterized the labour market and the role of marginal productivity in wage formation. In the 20th century the neoclassical theory was extended to include analysis of the role of imperfect competition, human capital and risk-taking. Also included in this part of the paper is a discussion of statistical and institutional approaches. Part II covers normative theories of income distribution and their implications for redistributive policy. It begins with a consideration of the value judgements implicit in the policy recommendations of the classical economists and continues with the attempts to establish an analytical foundation for welfare economics. The rise of Paretian welfare theory with its emphasis on the impossibility of interpersonal comparisons of utility made it difficult to draw conclusions regarding income redistribution, but the older utilitarian approach, including equal sacrifice theories, continued to live on in the modern analysis of optimal redistribution. A short Part III contains some concluding reflections on the position of income distribution theory within economics as a whole.
B10|Economics at the Faculty of Law in Oslo - The First Hundred Years|In this article I take up the relationship between economics and law in the hundred-year period preceding the establishing of economics as a separate discipline. Rather than providing a review of historical milestones, I concentrate on some observations that illustrate the relationship between law and economics. I conclude with some reflections on what the law may have missed out on by not having participated in a similar revolution as economics experienced.
B10|Innovation Concepts and Typology – An Evolutionary Discussion|This paper is devoted to the analysis of evolution of innovation concepts, aspect and types. First emergence and evolution of different aspects and concepts of innovation are analysed, then the development of innovation concepts from a historical perspective and finally an overview given of types of innovation classifications developed in the literature. Surrounding this different definitions of innovation are described and analyzed in detail. The main goal of the article is to define the trend of development of innovation conceptualization and understanding over time.
B10|Economic Patriotism, the Clash of Capitalisms, and State Aid in the European Union|This article analyses the political economy of state aid in the European Union (EU) using the concepts of economic patriotism and models of capitalism. State aid is analysed as a form of economic patriotism, which is conceived here as economic interventions which seek, by a number of means, to advance the perceived economic self-interest of particular groups and actors (firms, workforces, or sectors) defined according to their territorial status. The article argues that the paradox of neo-liberal democracy generated by liberal international markets, overlapping economic governance regimes (such as the EU and the World Trade Organisation), and nationally delimited political mandates presents new problems for policy-makers attempting economic interventions like state aid. Forms of economic patriotism are partly shaped by national institutional and social configurations and state traditions. Within EU economic governance, this generates a ‘clash of capitalisms’ whereby liberal EU anti-trust and competition policy norms proscribe certain state aid and industrial policy measures favoured by some European states. As traditional industrial policy becomes decreasingly viable, new modes of economic patriotic interventionism are enacted within contemporary processes of market-making, and the re-regulatory activity framing European markets. The paper focuses on French state aid responses to the global economic crisis, noting how the retreat of neo-liberal ebullience within the EU provides a conducive environment for resurgent French dirigiste approaches to state aid, indicating that the politics of economic patriotism and state aid will continue to be important features of the European political economic landscape in the years ahead.

B10|Transformation in the Nature of American Economics and Establishing Neoclassical Economic Technology|The study briefly focuses on the processes of gradual, though not linear, establishment of the dominance of Neoclassical view after interwar period, following the history of American economics. It is shown that by that (interwar) period there have already been present historically developed components, needed for the turn in the character of the economic theory and its application. This change is associated with converting effects of external determinants in the development of economics – and general aspects, or instruments, of the method of economics as a whole, into intrinsic features and specific tools of the advancing Neoclassical economics. Basically exploited is Mary Morgan’s (2001) conception of the natural interdependences in the processes of functioning of both sides of economics – the theoretical and the applied one – in the form of Economic technology. In this direction It is suggested, development of American, - and world, - economics from around 1930s-1940s through 2000s to be interpr ted through the prism of the formation and functioning (applying) of grand neoclassical economic technology, component (dominated) part of which appears to be the Keynesian economic technology.
B10|Weber and Mises: Views on Bureaucracy|Bureaucracy is not a recent phenomenon. Its beginnings go a long way back in history. Looking into the issue of bureaucracy is a good starting point for the study of two social systems – capitalism and socialism. Such an analysis must be built onto the comparison between profit based management and bureaucratic management. Weber and Mises are two important names to mention when talking about bureaucracy. They both authored studies on bureaucracy, (Weber – Economy and Society in 1922, and Mises – Bureaucracy in 1944 and 1962). However, they each approached the topic from completely different angles and reached completely different conclusions regarding the nature and consequences of bureaucracy.
B10|How reflexive have economists been in the wake of the crisis: 'The times they are a -changin'?|The current global economic crisis provides a window of opportunity for both reflection and change within economics. This paper examines the response of the discipline to questions surrounding the need for change by surveying commentaries provided by economists (and to some extent economic commentators) within the media and literature of professional economics associations. The paper seeks to address two questions. Firstly, is there recognition that the economic crisis poses serious questions for the discipline of economics – and if so what is the scale and nature of this self-awareness? Secondly, the paper seeks to identify the type of diagnoses being provided by the economics profession in terms of whether the clamor for change relates to focus, theoretical framework, or methodological foundations of the disciplines (or all three). Empirical findings suggest that future effort might be better directed towards economic theory and its assumptions rather than towards method and methodology.
B10|A Review of C.L.R. James and Marxism in the United States|The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence on the theoretical dimension of Marxism, advanced by Cyril Lionel Robert James, on the struggles in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s and to explore the influence that this intellectual had in the development of an understanding of Marxism in the U.S. during this period. In order to do so, it is important to chronologically follow James’s life. For the purpose of this paper, I will discuss some of the aspects of James’s Marxism which will allow us to see how he shaped his thoughts as a Marxist and the extent to which he was able to put his theories into practice. A fragment of James’s autobiography serves as a useful illustration: I had been reading…But the people who had passion, human energy, anger, violence and generosity were the common people whom I saw around me. They shaped my political outlook and from that day to this day those are the people with who I am concerned the most. That’s why I was able to understand Marx very easily, and particularly Lenin. When I went into Marxism I was already well prepared…Even in my days of fiction I had the instinct which enable me to grasp the fundamentals of Marxism so easily and then to work at Marxism having the basic elements of a Marxist view – my concern with the common people. James’s method was more or less empirical and his observations formed the basis for his exploration of ideas.
B10|Ibn Jaldún: Pensamiento Económico En El S. XIV<BR>[Ibn Khaldun: Economic Thought in the XIV Century]|Ibn Khadun, un historiador musulmán que decidió revisar de manera analítica los fundamentos de la historia, acaba describiendo ciertos componentes del proceso económico que deben ser tenidos en cuenta como parte de la historia del pensamiento económico. En esta disertación doy un exhaustivo repaso a las teorías derivadas de su análisis económico, que van desde los fundamentos de la división del trabajo a las causas del ciclo económico. Ibn Khadun, a Muslim historian who decided to review analytically the basics of the history, culminate his work describing certain components of the economic process that must be taken into account as part of the history of economic thought. In this dissertation I give a comprehensive review of the theories derived from his economic analysis, from the basics of the division of labour to the causes of the economic cycle.
B10|Comparative Perspectives in Employment Relations Research|This article discusses the historical trajectories of employment research in the U.S. and Germany. Both countries exemplify very different research traditions, which have their origins in the 19th and early 20th century and are shaped not only by the field of inquiry (different national employment institutions and practices), but also by different social scientific traditions and political philosophies, for example the different inter-pretation of what constitutes industrial democracy or employees’ rights at work. I con-clude that current research still differs across countries and that we would do well to endorse this plurality rather than assuming an inevitable convergence to US research styles.
B10|Entwicklungen in den industriellen Beziehungen: Ein ueberblick (Developments in Industrial Relations. An Overview)|Entwicklungen in den industriellen Beziehungen: Ein ueberblick (Developments in Industrial Relations. An Overview) Tief greifende gesellschaftliche Strukturwandlungen haben die Erscheinungs- und Wirkungsweise der Arbeitsbeziehungen nachhaltig veraendert und differenziert. Nach einer uebersicht arbeitsrelevanter Problembereiche im gesellschaftlichen Kontext werden ausgehend von den Grundinteressen arbeitender Menschen die Strukturwandlungen der Interessenorganisationen eroertert. Im Anschluss erfolgt eine ausfuehrlichere Analyse der herausfordernden Entwicklungen in Handlungsfeldern, die neben ihrer ueblichen Regulierung durch Vertrag oder Gesetz auch ausserhalb bestehender institutioneller Regelungen Gegenstand von Arbeitsbeziehungen sind: Arbeitsmarktstrukturierung, Arbeitsorganisation, Beschaeftigungssicherung, Arbeits- und Berufsqualifikation sowie Arbeits- und Gesundheitsschutz. Ein ueberblick ueber Strukturwandlungen im Bereich der betrieblichen Mitbestimmung fuehrt abschliessend zur Frage nach der Weiterentwicklung des deutschen Leitmodells kooperativer Arbeitsbeziehungen auf betrieblicher und ueberbetrieblicher Ebene. (Fundamental structural societal change has deeply modified the form and procedures of industrial relations. The paper commences by providing an overview of social problem areas related to work. After characterizing the basic interests of the working population, structural changes which employer associations and trade unions have undergone are considered. More explicitly, developments in major areas of consensual and conflictual structuring and regulating of working conditions are discussed: Labor market structure, work organization, employment security, occupational training and health and safety at work. After providing an overview of changes in co-determination at enterprise level, the concluding section considers possible future developments in the German model of co-operative industrial relations.)
B10|Betriebliche Mitbestimmung im Spiegel der juengeren Forschung (Plant-level Co-determination as Reflected in Recent Research)|Die Institution Betriebsrat zeichnet sich angesichts des starken oekonomischen und technisch-organisatorischen Wandels in den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten durch eine relativ hohe Kontinuitaet aus. Die Betriebsratsforschung hat in dieser Zeit einen Aufschwung erfahren. Neue Fragestellungen wurden erschlossen und alte Ansaetze auf neue Anwendungsfelder ausgeweitet. Der Beitrag gibt einen komprimierten ueberblick ueber den Stand und Entwicklung der Forschung zur betrieblichen Mitbestimmung in der juengeren Phase seit ca. 2000. (In view of the economic, technical and organizational changes of the last two decades the institution of the German works council has demonstrated a relatively high degree of continuity. Research on works councils has boomed during this time. New topics were found and old approaches were expanded to new areas. This article presents on outlook on the state of the art in the period since about 2000.)
B10|Zwanzig Jahre Industrielle Beziehungen – Rueckblick und Bilanz (Twenty years Industrielle Beziehungen – Looking Back and Taking Stock)|Der Beitrag praesentiert in drei Teilen eine Bilanz von zwanzig Jahren. Zunaechst werden Zielsetzung und Inhalte der Zeitschrift „Industrielle Beziehungen“ resuemiert, danach die Entwicklungen in der wissenschaftlichen Profession des Objektbereichs Industrielle Beziehungen aufgezeigt und schliesslich die Veraenderungen in der realen Welt von Wirtschaft und Arbeitsbeziehungen analysiert. Das Resultat fuer die beiden Dekaden ist ein zwiespaeltiges. Neben der Konsolidierung und Differenzierung der Industriellen Beziehungen als Lehr- und Forschungsgebiet ist das deutsche System der industriellen Beziehungen schwaecher und variantenreicher, vornehmlich aber flexibler, durchlaessiger und dezentraler geworden, ohne seine charakteristischen Strukturmerkmale einzubuessen. (The article presents a review of the last twenty years of German industrial relations in three parts. First the aims and contents of the journal “Industrielle Beziehungen” are discussed, followed by a description of the professional developments in the academic field of industrial relations. Finally changes in the real world of industry and employment relations are analyzed. The results for the two decades are ambivalent. While there has been a consolidation and differentiation of the academic field of industrial relations, the German industrial relations system has become weaker and more varied, and particularly more flexible and decentralized, but without losing its characteristic structural properties.)
B10|Human Resource Management – Eine Annaeherung in kritischer Absicht (Human Resource Management – Towards a Critical Perspective)|Human Resource Management (HRM) ist trotz umfangreicher Diskussion in der amerikanischen, britischen und deutschsprachigen Literatur ein schillernder Begriff geblieben, mit dem unterschiedliche Phaenomene und Konzepte verbunden werden. Auch Versuche, den oekonomischen Erfolg des HRM messbar zu machen, haben zu keinen schluessigen Ergebnissen gefuehrt. Die Kritik ist aus diesem Grund und aus grundsaetzlichen konzeptionellen Erwaegungen betraechtlich. Die HRM-Literatur koennte durch staerkere Einbeziehung der Industrial-Relations-Literatur an Realitaetsgehalt gewinnen. Dies gilt besonders fuer die deutschsprachige Literatur. (Despite the extensive discussion of Human Resource Management (HRM) in the American, British and German literature, this concept has remained a “floating signifier” (Keenoy). A wide variety of phenomena and concepts are associated with HRM. Moreover, attempts to measure the economic effects of HRM have yet to produce any conclusive results. For this reason and due to conceptual ambiguities, criticism of HRM has been substantial. If more attention were paid to the literature on industrial relations, the HRM literature could acquire a greater sense of realism. This is especially true for the literature in German-speaking countries.)
B10|Die Entwicklung der Arbeitsbeziehungen aus arbeitsrechtlicher Sicht Developments in German Industrial Relations from a Labor Law Perspective)|Der Beitrag skizziert die Entwicklung der Arbeitsbeziehungen in Deutschland seit dem erstmaligen Erscheinen der Zeitschrift „Industrielle Beziehungen“ aus arbeitsrechtlichem Blickwinkel. Dabei zeigt sich, dass es im Koalitionsrecht, im Tarifvertragsrecht, im Arbeitskampfrecht und im Betriebsverfassungsrecht Veraenderungen gegeben hat. Dabei beschraenken sich gesetzliche Novellierungen auf Anpassungen an neue Entwicklungen im Tarifvertrags- und im Betriebsverfassungsrecht. Der Gesetzgeber scheut sich nach wie vor, bei Grosskonflikten zwischen Gewerkschaften und Arbeitgebern zu intervenieren. Weit groessere Bedeutung kommt deshalb den Korrekturen durch die Rechtsprechung zu. Insgesamt handelt es sich jedoch nur um inkrementale Veraenderungen, die das institutionelle Gefuege der Arbeitsbeziehungen unangetastet lassen. Eine Reihe von Reformdebatten blieb bislang ohne Ergebnis. Die Europaeisierung des Rechts der Arbeitnehmermitwirkung verstaerkt das auf Kooperation angelegte deutsche Modell, erweist sich im Hinblick auf die Europaeische Aktiengesellschaft (SE) jedoch als ambivalent. (The contribution sketches the development of industrial relations in Germany since the first edition of the Journal “Industrielle Beziehungen” from the perspective of labor law. It shows that legislation on freedom of association, collective bargaining, industrial action and employee representation through works councils has undergone modification . However, legislative amendments are limited to new developments in the law of collective bargaining and of employee representation through works councils. The legislator still hesitates to intervene in serious conflicts between trade unions and employers. Therefore, much more important are the innovations by judge made law. On the whole, the modifications are incremental rather than changing the institutional pattern of industrial relations. Several debates on reforms were as yet unsuccessful. The Europeanization of the law on employee representation strengthened the German model based on cooperation. However, in reference to the European Company (SE) it remains ambiguous.)
B10|Developing A Sustainable Future By Identifying And Understanding The Limitations Of The Past. A Review Of “Debunking Economics: The Naked Emperor Of The Social Sciences” By Steve Keen|The book constitutes a scholarly critique to mainstream economic thinking represented broadly under the neoclassical term. Fundamental to the note and style in which the paper is constructed is the fact that the author considers his reaction to orthodox economics as a constructive discussion which, in effect, can help generate future solutions. Certainly, the point is made that various existing schools of thought that currently stand at the side-line of policymaking and economic reforms already provide tentative sources for improving the theory. Steve Keen’s work stands out due to the fact that the critique brought to mainstream economic thinking and models precedes the latest economic crisis, which undeniably has led numerous scholars on the lonely and unsecure path of finding new solutions and explanations for increasingly dynamic phenomena
B10|Pareto’s Principle - Between Practical Validation and Scientific Deception -|"We believe that in any situation where the contribution to the effort is uneven, the higher contribution is given by the ratio of those who participate in the contribution. Most of the times, in most human actions, the contribution of those who bring their contribution to the achievement of a common effort is uneven. Therefore, in an unequal world, over 50% of effort shall be obtained by the intake of less than 50% of those who take part in it, and more than 50% of those who participate in such an effort contributes less than 50% of the mass of that contribution. It argues that managers favor complexity, which is responsible for the increased costs, and indirect principle of Pareto constitutes the fingertips therapy are obvious managerial philosophy of syllogisms. Any sequential analysis of firms with the best economic results may show that only about 20% of the products ensures that 80% of turnover. Considering the dimensions of the current economic activity, we are entitled to believe that such tips were followed scrupulously by policymakers who have taken over the leadership of the Romanian society immediately after the revolutionary year 1989. Since I was taught that businesses are prone to squandering and wastefulness is conditional upon the complexity and each other, it was not hard to be convinced of it decision-makers a simple affair will always be better than one. As such, he became an enthusiastic return to the property system had in the late ' 40s, he actively supported the idea of ""resitutio in integrum"", major State-owned firms were divided into dozens of smaller firms (see the national power system, unfortunately, Fls, etc.), what is each other, and particularly agriculture cooperative property and the State was divided into millions of private plots. What was the economy became complex in two decades very simple but painfully unsatisfying. We have but one consolation: everything is according to the Pareto principle For those who support the principle of Pareto as the only valid argument is enough to enact: wastefulness is favored by complexity; effectiveness would be different in terms of acceptance of simplicity; most of the activities are already useless, poorly designed, poorly co-ordinated, imperfectly executed and here are irrelevant, since 80% of them are interested in 20% of the products; the smallest part of the activities is appreciated by customers, and the greater part of the activities is uninteresting; the true productive force is already choked by vast productive reality; poor grades, a lot, which already covers 80% of the total, are saved by a small number of excellent results, etc. The wise man's advice: to lay at three-fourths of productive activities in order to focus on that which is now the most advanced."
B10|Leading Dragon Phenomenon: New Opportunities for Catch-up in Low-Income Countries| Modern economic development is accompanied by the structural transformation from an agrarian to an industrial economy. Since the 18th century, all countries that industrialized successfully have followed their comparative advantages and leveraged the latecomer advantage, including emerging market economies such as the People's Republic of China (PRC), India, and Indonesia. The current view is that Chinese dominance in manufacturing hinders poor countries from developing similar industries. We argue that rising labor cost is causing the PRC to graduate from labor-intensive to more capital-intensive and technology-intensive industries. This will result in the relocation of low-skill manufacturing jobs to other low-wage countries. This process, which we call the “leading dragon phenomenon,” offers an unprecedented opportunity to low-income countries. Such economies can seize this opportunity by attracting the rising outward foreign direct investment flowing from Brazil, the PRC, India, and Indonesia into the manufacturing sectors. All low-income countries can compete for the jobs spillover from the PRC and other emerging economies, but the winner must implement credible economic development strategies that are consistent with its comparative advantage. © 2013 Asian Development Bank and Asian Development Bank Institute.
B10|Economic ideas regarding the urban water supply service in The nineteenth century britain<BR>[Ideas económicas en torno al servicio de abastecimiento urbano de agua en la Gran Bretaña del siglo XIX]|By the mid-nineteenth century, along with other network infrastructurestypical of the Second Industrial Revolution, began to take shape the modern system of water supply. The purpose of this paper is to examine the major economic ideas surrounding the beginnings of this new urban service in Britain during the second half of the nineteenth century, which marked a starting point for future analytical developments. First, the socioeconomic importance of improvement of public health through an intensive use of running water. Second, the emergence of the concept of natural monopoly. And finally, the debate about the organization of service management. This interesting case gives us the opportunity to observe the interaction, in both directions, between facts and economic ideas.
B10| The economic image of the seventeenth century Spain: The foreign look versus the viwof the Arbitristas<BR>[La imagen económica de la España del siglo XVII: La mirada extranjera frente a la visión de los arbitristas]|" This paper compares the economic image of the seventeenth century Spain we received from the foreign travelers with that offered by the arbitristas, examining the main similarities and differences. Specifically, it analyses the following issues: the consideration of natural resources base, the vision of national character and its relation to productive activities, and the perception of economic situation and the causes of backwardness. The aim is to contrast the view of those who were thinking ""from the inside"" about the causes of the striking decline of the country, with the free and uncensored look of foreign visitors, which –despite its constraints and limitations– tended to focus on the most striking and different aspects compared to the reality of their own countries."
B10|Economic History or History of Economics? Grand Pursuit: The Story of Economic Genius : Review Essay|In this essay, I review Sylvia Nasar's long awaited new history of economics, Grand Pursuit: The Story of Economic Genius . I describe how the book is an economic history of the period 1850-1950, with distinguished economists' stories inserted in appropriate places. Nasar's goal is to show how economists work, but also to show that they are people too—with more than enough warts and foibles to show they are human! I contrast the general view of the role of economics in Grand Pursuit with Robert Heilbroner's remarkably different conception in The Worldly Philosophers: The Lives, Times, and Ideas of the Great Economic Thinkers . I also discuss more generally the question of why economists might be interested in their history at all. (JEL B10, B20, B30, N00)
B10|Blanco White y las cuestiones econo?micas|Between the end of the Enlightenment and the incipient liberalism, Blanco White was one of the most important Spanish intellectuals of the first half of the nineteenth century. His exile in England (1810)1841) and his mastery of the English language enabled him to relate to some of the great British economists and thinkers of the era, such as Malthus, Bentham, Whately, Senior or J.S. Mill. Despite this and his initial training in the business world, Blanco White never paid particular attention to socioeconomic issues. In fact, he has been primarily studied as political writer, journalist, man of letters or religious polemicist. However, he also addressed some issues of undoubted economic interest, as the slave trade, the situation of Spain in the early nineteenth century, the problem of the poor, or the colonial question and the overseas trade. This paper aims to examine how Blanco White approached these issues within the context of the ideas of his Spanish contemporaries. It also aims to show that Blanco’s ideas were largely rooted in a Spanish tradition of thought (full text in Spanish)
B10|A world between crises|One of the most often committed mistakes in economic reasoning is the supposition about the continuity of economic processes. However, what dominates in reality is a process of permanent changes, which sometimes proceed in a cascading manner rather than linearly. It must be acknowledged that the capitalist market economy by its very nature is involved in periodical crises. They must occur from time to time, yet the magnitude of the recent crisis is a result of inappropriate institutions and wrong macroeconomic policies based on neoliberalism. While the underlying causes of the crisis and the ways out of it at the era of interdependent global economy is discussed vividly in countless books and papers, yet it ought to be clear that the world is moving from one crisis to another. Thus, one must consider not only the economics of crisis, but also a kind of crisis of economics. There is a need for a New Pragmatism, based on the better understanding of economics as science, describing the economy as a system of forces and flows which contantly give feedback and influence each other.
B10|Karl Marx: Herakles oder Sisyphos?Eine philosophische und ökonomische Untersuchung|Die Diskussion um Karl Marx ist lange Zeit nur ideologisch positionell geführt worden. Wer sich nicht als Gegner oder Befürworter der Marxschen Lehre erklärte, hatte es schwer, in dieser Diskussion Gehör zu finden. Im letzten Viertel des vorigen Jahrhunderts hat jedoch sowohl in philosophischer als auch wirtschaftswissenschaftlicher Hinsicht eine neue Art der Auseinandersetzung mit den Werken von Karl Marx begonnen. Dabei haben die Kontrahenten sowohl auf marxistischer als auch auf nichtmarxistischer Seite viel ideologischen Ballast beiseite geräumt, und in manchen Positionen hat man sich auch in inhaltlicher Hinsicht angenähert. Trotzdem ist die Diskussion in einem wichtigen Aspekt fragmentarisch geblieben. Auch wenn marxistische und nichtmarxistische Ökonomen nun eine gemeinsame Sprache gefunden haben, so gilt das weit weniger für Philosophen und Ökonomen. Charakteristischerweise zeigt sich das an der Rolle Hegels. Während viele Philosophen dazu neigen, Marx von Hegel her zu verstehen, tendieren Ökonomen und auch der Ökonomik nahestehende Philosophen dazu, Hegel zu vernachlässigen oder ihm allenfalls eine verwirrende oder störende Rolle im Marxschen Denken zuzugestehen. In unserem Essay wollen wir daher herausarbeiten, dass der Bezug zu Hegel und zu der Tradition der Philosophie überhaupt ein konstitutiver Bestandteil der Marxschen Theorie und gerade auch ihres ökonomischen Teils ist. Dabei versuchen wir nichts weniger als eine Gesamteinschätzung der Marxschen Lehre und ihrer oft verwirrenden Vielschichtigkeit zu geben. Im Einzelnen werden wir auf Marx’ Hegelbezug und den historischen Materialismus mit seinen Grundbegriffen, den Produktivkräften und Produktionsverhältnissen eingehen. Von daher werden wir eine Einschätzung von Marx’ Analyse der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise geben und dabei versuchen, ihre qualitativen und quantitativen Aspekte gesondert herauszuarbeiten. Zentrale Aussagen der Marxschen Ökonomik wie die Arbeitswertlehre und das Gesetz vom tendenziellen Fall der Profitrate werden wir im Licht der modernen Wirtschaftswissenschaften diskutieren. Dabei werden auch wichtige Einsichten von Marx hinsichtlich der Umwelt- und Rohstoffprobleme, vor denen wir heute stehen, zur Sprache kommen. Nicht zuletzt gehen wir auf die Konsequenzen ein, die sich aus Marx’ Ansatz für das Problem der Gerechtigkeit und der Einkommensverteilung ergeben. Und schließlich wollen wir erklären, woher bei Marx das notorische Defizit einer politischen Theorie rührt.
B10|From One To Many Islands: The Emergence Of Search And Matching Models|The notion of frictional unemployment first arose in the writings of Beveridge, Pigou and Hicks. Why did it fail at the time to grow into a fully fledged theory ? Our answer is simple. This failure was due to the fact these economists were unwilling and/or unable to go beyond the then-prevailing Marshallian approach, in particular to depart from its trade organization assumptions. They did not realize that these assumptions excluded any rationing outcome in general, and any unemployment result in particular. We make our claim in three steps. First, we make explicit the trade-organization assumptions underpinning Marshall’s equilibrium theory. Our second step is a study of the attempts at introducing unemployment in a Marshallian framework. We start with an examination of Beveridge’s, Pigou’s and Hicks’s early works on wages and unemployment. We also briefly discuss how and why Keynes was able to shift attention from frictional to involuntary unemployment. Newt, for a reason that will become clear as the paper evolves, we ponder Friedman’s celebrated Presidential Address inaugurating the notion of a natural rate of unemployment. In our third and last step we look at the papers by McCall, Lucas and Prescott, Mortensen and Pissarides that paved the way for the present thriving research literature. We show that their success in providing an equilibrium unemployment result stems from the fact that they have indeed departed from the Marshallian trade-organization assumptions<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B10|Islamic finance revisited: conceptual and analytical issues from the perspective of conventional economics|After a brief recent empirical sketch of Islamic finance, the paper turns to its main theoretical and conceptual purpose. It seeks to relate the concepts of Islamic and conventional finance, and to examine certain important questions which arise from the interaction between these systems. The paper is written from the perspective of conventional modern economics, as the authors are students of the latter. The paper discusses the main tenets of Islamic finance, as well as those of modern economics, including the implications of zero interest rates and those of Modigliani and Miller theorems. The most notable finding of this paper is that John Maynard Keynes’ analysis of employment, interest and money provides, inadvertently, the best rationale for some of the basic precepts of Islamic finance. The paper concludes that there is no inevitable conflict between the two systems and cooperation between them is eminently desirable and feasible.

B10|Revisiting Adam Smith's theory of the falling rate of profit|Purpose - This paper aims to present the salient features of Smith's argument of the falling rate of profit. This theory has usually been interpreted as a result of the intensification of competition in the markets of goods and services of the factors of production. This aspect of Adam Smith had been initially posed by Ricardo and subsequently was widely adopted by the major economists of the past as well as from the majority of the modern historians of economic thought. Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews the major interpretation of the argument from Ricardo and Marx as well as from major historians of economic thought, and then attempts to reconstruct Smith's argument, which is scattered throughout the Findings - In the author's view, Smith's analysis of the falling tendency in the rate of profit is by far more complex than usually presented and that the intensification of competition is the result of the falling rate of profit rather than its cause which is the capitalization of the production process. Originality/value - This paper presents a review of existing literature and an interpretation of Adam Smith's original model of the falling rate of profit.
B10|Adolphe Landry: Monetary Stability and the Financing of Industrial Development|"It is not so much known that before being a famous demographer Landry first contributed to political economy. Several scholars such as Edmund Malinvaud emphasized that it is not in doubt that Landry ""revealed himself as a gifted theoretician"". Supporting this view, the objective of this paper is to explain what were the initial monetary views developed by Landry and how he was influenced by different (and also non-orthodox) theoretical approaches. The gradual but also clear change we can observe in his monetary view was not only due to his theoretical lectures: as a public man, politically engaged, he was deeply influenced by his need to solve pragmatic issues. His efforts to reconcile his theoretical knowledge with his pragmatism led him to develop stimulating views on the then contemporary monetary theoretical questions."
B10|The Theory of Multiple Public Budget Determination from the Perspective of History of Economic Analysis|From an analitycal historical perspective, this paper deals with the important public finance issue of decentralizing the government’s economic activities and functions into distinct branches, respectively devoted to collecting taxes and to allocating a given budget to different public goods. We start with the so-called Italian tradition in public finance and go on to the crucial contributions from James Pigou, Paul Samuelson and Richard Musgrave, up till the modern second best and optimal taxation approaches. Starting from the Italian tradition is meaningful as this stream of literature has given important pioneristic contributions to this topic, namely by Maffeo Pantaleoni and Enrico Barone. However, it is in developing the relationships of these contributions with the modern second best optimal taxation approach that we may find rigorous solutions to the main emerging problems of the issue.
B10|Mirror neuron research and Adam Smith’s concept of sympathy: Three points of correspondence|In The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Adam Smith asserts that humans have an innate interest in the fortunes of other people and desire for sympathy with others. In Smith’s theory, sympathy is an imperfectly reflected combination of emotion and judgment when one observes someone (the agent) in a particular situation, and imagines being that person in that situation. That imagination produces a degree of interconnectedness among individuals. Recent neuroscience research on mirror neurons provides evidence consistent with Smith’s assertion, suggesting that humans have an innate capability to understand the mental states of others at a neural level. A mirror neuron fires both when an agent acts and when an agent observes that action being performed by another; the name derives from the “mirroring” of the action in the brain of the observer. This neural network and the capabilities arising from it have three points of correspondence with important aspects of the Smithian sympathetic process: an agent’s situation as a stimulus or connection between two similar but separate agents, an external perspective on the actions of others, and an innate imaginative capacity that enables an observer to imagine herself as the agent, in the agent’s situation. Both this sympathetic process and the mirror neuron system predispose individuals toward coordination of the expression of their emotions and of their actions. In Smith’s model this decentralized coordination leads to the emergence of social order, bolstered and reinforced by the emergence and evolution of informal and formal institutions grounded in the sympathetic process. Social order grounded in this sympathetic process relies on a sense of interconnectedness and on shared meanings of actions, and the mirror neuron system predisposes humans toward such interconnection.

B10|From Marxian School Of Economic Thought To System Paradigm In Economic Studies: The Institutional Matrices Theory|The paper discusses some theoretical-methodological basis for the institutional change analysis in transitional countries. First, the paper shows the specific approach of the Marxian school of economic thought to the analysis of social and economic institutions. Second, the most general features of the system paradigm in economic theory (Kornai, 1998) are presented. Third, the institutional matrices theory, or IMT (Kirdina, 2001; Kirdina, 2001, 2010, etc.), developing Marxian approach and systemic ideas, is presented. An explanatory power of IMT is shown by the analysis of post-soviet reforms in Russia and East-European countries.

""Paper moneyists"": theoretical origins and what preceded the debate between monetarists and developmentalists]"|"The paper analyzes the debate between metallism and ""paper moneyism"" which took place in Brazil in the second half of the 19th century and advocates that the latter was one of the currents that contributed to the genesis of developmentalism. In order to do so, it reviews the monetary controversies in England since the beginning of that century. Based on them, it identifies the theoretical origins of the Brazilian debate, highlighting the issue that refers to the neutrality or non-neutrality of money. Next, it shows how this question was adapted to the peculiarities of the Brazilian economy, emphasizing the ""paper moneyists'""option for growth, departing from the orthodoxy of that time. The influence upon the fledgling developmentalism is empirically studied based on the speeches of Getulio Vargas, since he was the central character of the developmentalist State that was central to the Brazilian post-1930 historical experience."
B10|Is the Falling Rate of Profit the Driving Force Behind Globalization?|This paper examines critically the role of the law of the tendency of the falling rate of profit in the geographic expansion (globalization) of competitive capitalism. It contends that Marx did not believe there was an iron-clad connection between the falling rate of profit and globalization; in addition, it argues that Marx believed that the capitalists’ insatiable search for colonial markets was driven by their desire to overcome recurrent (and growing) realization problems in the home market arising from deficient aggregate demand on the part of both workers and capitalists.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

B10|The Contribution of „Ruda 12 Apostoli” Mining Association in Brad to the Development of Transylvanian Gold Mining Between 1884 – 1921|One of the major gold mining regions in Romania is part of the gold rectangle in the Apuseni Mountains and lies around the town of Brad. It is here that the ”Ruda 12 Apostoli” Mining Association of cuxas was established at the end of the XVIIIth century. This association was to become the most important unit for the mining of precious metals in the entire Austrian – Hungarian Empire after 1884, when it was taken over by the German company ”Harkortschen Bergwerke und Chemische Fabriken zu Schwelm und Harkorten A.G. zu Gotha”, preserving its status in the interwar Romanian as a component of the ”Mica” Mining company. This mining complex had a production of 27,919.520 kg of gold between 1884 – July 1, 1911.
B10|Crisis and methodology: some heterodox misunderstandings|Whether justified by the concrete circumstances or not, an economic crisis is, by simple association, taken as an implicit refutation of the invisible hand vision and the underlying theory. The fundamental heterodox critique locates the source of apparent theoretical difficulties at the level of methodology. Although acceptable in principle, this belief involves some actual misunderstandings with regard to the respective roles of deterministic laws and deductive reasoning. In order to clarify these, the present paper revisits some key episodes in the history of economic methodology.
B10|The rhetoric of failure: a hyper-dialog about method in economics and how to get things going|All are agreed that orthodox economics is unsatisfactory but there is wide disagreement, especially among heterodox critics, whether the problems lie at the level of substantive theory or at the level of methodology. This paper gives first an overview of the methodological questions at issue. The frame of reference includes J. S. Mill, Jevons, Popper, Keynes, and Lawson. Drawing on the conclusions, the domain of economics is subsequently refocused. Human behavior is moved from the center to the periphery. From elementary systemic properties the relation of income and profit is then consistently derived. This solves the profit conundrum.
B10|Economic ideas of a nineteenth century Tunisian statesman: Khayr al-Din al-Tunisi|Khayr al-Din al-Tunisi, a nineteenth century Tunisian scholar and statesman, thought and worked for her politico-economic strengthening and uplift of Tunisia. He was much impressed by the political system of the West and endeavored to create similar political institutions in his own country. In his work Aqwam al-Masalik fi Ma`rifat Ahwal al-Mamalik (The Surest Path to Knowledge Concerning the Condition of Countries) discussed the economic superiority of the West and offered an agenda for Tunisia to improve its economic and political system. Al-Tunisi’s economic ideas appear quite close to the classical European political economy.

Above all, the process of freeing these behaviours from external determinators which create hegemony on human will, is taken consideration. Especially, developments, in this respect, brought by European Enlightment are examined. Also by mentioning, as a result of being taken the controll of will by reason and the scientific developments that creates, the consequences of technical improvements upon the value system of people, it is pointed out that these consequences change from person to person and society to society, since almost all societies have quite different understanding of “economic sphere” as a result of influences of their own religion, politics, culture and history. Furthermore, it is mentioned that under the conditions brought by globalization, economic spheres are opened to transition. In this respect, the importance of the “information” created in this process are emphasized and thus how the information restructures econimic sphares is attempted to be explained.

B10|Ideengeschichtliche Aspekte von unabhängigen Institutionen|In der Ökonomik tritt der zirkuläre “unechte” Fortschritt auf, der sich z.B. vom kumulativen, besonders für die Naturwissenschaften charakteristischen Fortschritt abgrenzt. Die Ideen- bzw. Dogmengeschichte kann somit eine wertvolle Erkenntnisquelle sein. In diesem Papier wird das Konzept der „unabhängigen öffentlichen Institution“ auf seine ideengeschichtlichen Grundlagen hin beleuchtet. Die Betrachtung erfolgt im wesentlichen chronologisch entlang der Entwicklungsstufen der ökonomischen bzw. polit-ökonomischen Theorie. Es wird mit der frühen, noch stark normativ bzw. metaphysisch ausgerichteten und unsystematischen ökonomischen Theorie der Antike und frühen Neuzeit begonnen, deren Erfahrungsgegenstand nicht notwendigerweise dem entspricht, was heute als „Ökonomie“ verstanden wird. Sodann werden die ersten Systeme mit Schwergewicht auf positiven Aussagen untersucht. Der inhaltliche Schwerpunkt liegt dann auf der modernen ökonomischen Theorie, die methodisch präzise zwischen positiven und normativen Aussagen trennt.

Henri Fayol was the one of the earliest and influential thinkers in modern management theory. He defined management as a body of knowledge and defined his 14 administrative principles.

B10|Rust Belt Politics: The national NAFTA debate during recent US presidential election cycles|The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) once again became a newsworthy topic in the US media, this time during the contested Spring 2008 Democratic primary for the US presidency, particularly from campaign talking-points originating within Midwestern Rust-Belt states. Although the merits of NAFTA were central to the dialogue during this campaign season, similar debate did not warrant deliberation during the time of the general election in the Fall of 2008. An examination of media coverage dedicated to NAFTA in the lead-up to the past three American general elections confirmed these tendencies. Even though the Rust Belt, which is considered the key political toss-up region in the for the US presidency, has the most at stake concerning NAFTA’s effects, it remains to be seen if the trade pact will elicit debate from the presidential candidates during the Fall election in 2012.

B10|Schumpeter’s new combinations|The paper focuses attention on Schumpeter’s achievements in his classic contribution and how these relate to the contributions of other major authors. While deeply indebted to Marx’s vision of capitalism as a system incessantly in travail, Schumpeter was no ‘Marxist’. He shared Böhm’s view that profits are not due to ‘exploitation’, but thought that the latter’s attack on Marx was a failure. There are remarkable differences, but also similarities between the analyses of Schumpeter and Keynes. Marx, Schumpeter and Keynes rejected Say’s law and other basic ideas constituting the marginalist doctrine. They saw capitalism as a restless, crisis-prone system.

B10|How the Gold Standard functioned in Portugal: an analysis of some macroeconomic aspects| Portugal was the first country in Europe to join Great Britain in the Gold Standard, in 1854, having abandoned the principle of free gold convertibility in 1891. By elucidating the historical choice of the Gold Standard by the Portuguese authorities, and analysing its macroeconomic behaviour, we prove that it is a mistake to compare different monetary systems with the same indicators. Our examination of demand, supply and monetary shocks in the context of a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model confirm the idea of appropriate application of the principles of classical economics to the Gold Standard in Portugal. We also prove that the principles of demand management were not compatible with the functioning of the Gold Standard.

B10|Is Globalization Inevitable in the Marxian Paradigm?|This paper examines Marx's views on globalization and its supposed inevitability, and contends that they underwent a substantial evolution and revision after the publication of the Communist Manifesto. In the case of China, a prime example of the Asiatic mode of production, Marx even doubted whether globalization (capitalism) would ever be able to accomplish its historical mission of developing the forces of production and creating the material conditions for a higher mode of production, viz., Communism. While in the Russian case, he seriously entertained the notion that it could bypass the hardships and vicissitudes of capitalism and forge its own unique path to socialism. If accepted, this interpretation represents a serious challenge to the universality and validity of Marx's materialist conception of history.

We look at what the IDs have represented in the past, their current situation, and the challenges and opportunities these face in a socio-economic context that is spurring greater interaction between global and local forces. The paper first outlines a few basic concepts and some of the key findings to emerge from the more recent debate on industrial districts. Through a critical review of selected empirical and theoretical contributions from a growing body of worldwide literature, we identify themes that seem to coincide with the critical nodes of industrial districts, especially at a time when these face challenges as well as opportunities. The paper is presented as a contemporary reflection on such themes in a critical, albeit probably less than objective, way.

B10|1848: A Primeira Crise da Teoria Económica|This paper aims at clarifying a specific period in the history of the economic ideas: 1848. It was an year of economic, financial, political crisis, which inevitably led also to a crisis in the field of economic ideas. The classical economy at large, as the mainstream economic school, was questioned leaving ground to a recomposition in the field of the economic ideas, especially concerning its theoretical nature. The basic features and mechanisms of that recomposition are examined to understand the determinant conditions for the classical school to remain as the mainstream school, even if it took a new configuration.
B10|Administering Systemic Risk vs. Administering Justice: What Can We Do Now that We Have Agreed to Pay Differences?|Professor Stout's brilliant concept of disagreement-based speculation calls for further developments and studies concerning implications for stability and resilience of the financial system over time. Moreover, it also suggests rediscovering and situating the socio-economic function of finance (and financing) in the economy and society. To complement this approach, we recall the European acceptance of paying differences since late nineteenth century. Derivative assets were traded in Europe, but the underlying assets (stocks and bonds) on which derivatives are built were authorized beforehand. Marteau and Morand (2010) recently appealed for reintroducing an a priori authorization procedure before new derivative assets can be marketed: this view thus inherits a century-long tradition. Eventually, it seems that a priori authorization allows for administration of systemic risk while common law-inherited rejection of disagreement-based speculation is a strong foundation for both supervisory and legal (a posteriori) decisions.

B10|Cross-LoC trade in Kashmir: From line of control to line of commerce|The initiation of Cross-Line of Control (LoC) trade across Jammu and Kashmir in October 2008 signaled the beginning of a new era. It was 61 years ago in 1947 that trade across line of control had stopped. The initiative has received support from business community since its start despite numerous impediments including barter exchange of goods, lack of communication, no banking channels, deficient legal contract enforcement, limit on tradable goods, structural difficulties in free movement and other barriers. This study examines how business entities and individuals in Jammu and Kashmir view trade transactions with the other side and perceptions about the economic viability of Cross-LoC trade. More specifically the paper presents primary data obtained from various stakeholders mainly the businessmen who trade on Uri-Muzaffarabad and Poonch-Rawalakote routes (The two transitory points from where the present Cross-Loc trade takes place). The study reveals that trade has increased significantly and trade in agriculture commodities has shown a robust growth, while handicrafts sector that constitutes backbone of the region's economy has not performed up to expectations.
B10|El debate sobre el socorro a los pobres en España durante el siglo XVI|Con el paso de la Edad Media al Renacimiento se producen notables cambios sociales caracterizados por el crecimiento del poder económico de la burguesía, la concentración de la población en núcleos urbanos y la aparición de la pobreza también concentrada en las grandes ciudades. Ante este fenómeno, propio del capitalismo moderno, surgen escritores preocupados por este hecho que provocó alarma social. Principalmente fueron filósofos, religiosos y arbitristas que propusieron medidas para remediar esta lacra social. La presente investigación detecta asuntos que no han sido estudiados, propone una taxonomía de las diversas tendencias para solucionar el problema de la pobreza, analiza las ideas de los tratadistas más importantes y reflexiona sobre aspectos similares en el mundo actual./ From the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, there were dramatic social changes characterized by growing economic power of the bourgeoisie, a concentration of population in urban areas and the emergence of poverty also concentrated in large cities. Faced with this phenomenon, typical of modern capitalism, emerging writers were concerned about this fact that caused alarm. These were mainly philosophers, religious and arbitrageurs who proposed to remedy this social scourge. This investigation detects issues that have not been studied, proposing taxonomy of the various tendencies to solve the problem of poverty, and examines the ideas of major writers and reflects on similarities in the world today.
B10|Un Marco para el Análisis de los Procesos Macroeconómicos en la obra de Prebisch|"En el presente trabajo retomamos la obra de Raúl Prebisch con el objetivo de estudiar temas relevantes en la determinación de la política económica en Argentina en la actualidad. Nuestro análisis se centra en tres aspectos esenciales de su obra: a) la fuerte relevancia de los impactos de origen externo en los ciclos en la periferia; b) las diferencias en los procesos que determinan la evolución del sistema económico entre las economías del centro y las economías de la periferia; y c) la identificación de mecanismos que generan fluctuaciones ""excesivas"", y que deben ser enfrentadas por la política económica. Para el análisis de tales temas, presentamos de manera formal un marco de restricciones de presupuesto. Finalizamos mostrando cómo el análisis de inestabilidades que dificultan la definición de tendencias es un fenómeno de gran relevancia empírica, y postulamos que el anáilisis prebischiano es de relevancia actual para el diseño de políticas económicas que ayuden a estabilizar tendencias."

B10|Scarcity, self-interest and maximization from Islamic angle|This paper clarifies some misinterpretations of three foundational concepts in mainstream economics from Islamic viewpoint. These are scarcity of resources, pursuit of self-interest and maximizing behavior of economic agents. It argues that stocks of resources that God has provided are inexhaustible. But important is the availability of resources out of stocks to mankind. Availability is a function of human effort and the state of knowledge about resources over time and space. In that sense resources are scarce in relation to multiplicity of human wants for Islamic economics as well. Self-interest must be distinguished from selfishness. The motive operates on both ends of human existence: mundane and spiritual. Its pursuit does not preclude altruism from human life. Counter interests keep balance in society and promote civility. Islam recognizes the motive as valid. Maximization relates to quantifiable ex ante variables. Uncertainty of future outcomes of actions makes maximization a heuristic but useful analytical tool. The concept is value neutral. What is maximized, how and to what end alone give rise to moral issues. Modified in the light of Shari’ah requirements the three concepts can provide a firmer definition for Islamic economics centered on the notion of falah.
