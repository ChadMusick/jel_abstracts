Z18|Economic impacts of the vale-cultura (culture voucher): a computable general equilibrium model|Restricted access to consumption of cultural goods and services is one of the major problems faced by this sector in Brazil. To address this issue, the federal government created the Vale-Cultura, a voucher in which individuals receive an income transfer to be used exclusively for purchasing cultural goods and services. The aim of this study is to analyze the impacts of the Vale-Cultura in the cultural sector and in the economy in general. The methodology applied is the Brazilian Recursive Dynamic General Equilibrium model (BRIDGE). Our simulations found that GDP growth is driven mainly by the increase in household consumption. There is a positive variation in welfare, assessed by the equivalent and compensating variations in income for beneficiaries of the vouchers. Finally, a positive growth is projected at the level of activity of cultural sectors and negative growth in others, showing a reallocation of productive factors.
Z18|Publicly funded cultural institutions – a comparative economic valuation study|Cultural institutions are the main creators of cultural goods and services and are responsible for their accessibility; cultural institutions are also the main beneficiaries of public funds for culture. The aim of this study is to evaluate the division of public resources into different branches of culture that are rooted in political ‘adhocism’ and historical dependencies. Based on the observed visitations and their costs, a two-stage budgeting model is employed to investigate the change in consumer surplus related to the loss of access to the markets of cinemas, museums, and theatres in Warsaw, the capital city of Poland. The institutions vary in terms of public good characteristics and importance as public bodies, expressed in terms of subsidies. The inclusion of the entire markets of institutions helps to overcome the embedding effect, which affects many single-site valuations. It also enables a comparison between cultural sectors, which is rare in cultural economics. We find that people assign a positive value to the accessibility of all institutions and groups of institutions. However, the estimated value generated by each type of cultural institution is not aligned with the division of subsidies between these markets. For theatres, the total benefits exceed public support. Museums are found to deliver a lower level of benefits to society; the value they generate is outweighed by the subsidies they receive. Cinemas receive little direct support; however, they are valued twice as much as museums. The problem of cultural policy lies in the division of resources, which is much more equal relative to benefits attributed to groups of museums and theatres. At the same time the division between single institutions within all three branches of culture is unequal, with the significant exclusion of non-public institutions.
Z18|The Violent Legacy of Victimization: Post-Conflict Evidence on Asylum Seekers, Crimes and Public Policy in Switzerland|We study empirically how past exposure to conflict in origin countries makes migrants more violent prone in their host country, focusing on asylum seekers in Switzerland. We exploit a novel and unique dataset on all crimes reported in Switzerland by nationalities of perpetrators and victims over the period 2009-2012. Causal analysis relies on the fact that asylum seekers are exogenously allocated across the Swiss territory by the federal administration. Our baseline result is that cohorts exposed to civil conflicts/mass killings during childhood are on average 40 percent more prone to violent crimes than their co-nationals born after the conflict. The effect is stable through the lifecycle and is attenuated for women, for property crimes and for low-intensity conflicts. Further, a bilateral crime regression shows that conflict exposed cohorts have a higher propensity to target victims from their own nationality --a piece of evidence that we interpret as persistence in intra-national grievances. Last, we exploit cross-region heterogeneity in public policies within Switzerland to document which integration policies are able to mitigate the detrimental effect of past conflict exposure on violent criminality. In particular, we find that offering labor market access to asylum seekers eliminates all the effect.
Z18|A multi-sensory tutoring program for students at-risk of reading difficultiesa. Evidence from a randomized field experiment|Although reading is a fundamental skill, many students leave school without being proficient readers. We examine a literacy program targeting students most at-risk of reading difficulties in kindergarten and first grade. The program includes multi-sensory learning methods, which focus on phonological awareness and phonics and are delivered in a one-to-one or one-to-two tutoring setting. Using a randomized field experiment with 161 students in 12 Swedish schools, we find large positive effects on our two primary outcomes measures: a standardized test of decoding and a standardized test of letter knowledge. We also find positive effects on measures of phonological awareness and self-efficacy and small and statistically insignificant effects on measures of enjoyment and motivation. The program compares favorably to similar programs in terms of cost-effectiveness.
Z18|Roots of Tolerance among Second-generation Immigrants|Tolerance – respecting individual choice and differences among people – is a prominent feature of modern European culture. That immigrants embrace this kind of liberal value is arguably important for integration, a central policy goal. We provide a rigorous study of what factors in the ancestral countries of second-generation immigrants – including formal and informal institutions – that predict their level of tolerance towards gay people. Using the epidemiological method allows us to rule out reverse causality. Out of the 46 factors examined, one emerges as very robust: a Muslim background. Tolerance is lower the larger the share of Muslims in the country from which the parents emigrated. An instrumental-variable analysis shows that the main mechanism is not through the individual being a Muslim but through the individual being highly religious. Two additional attitudes among people in the ancestral country (valuing children being tolerant and respectful, and valuing children taking responsibility), as well as impartial institutions in the ancestral country, predict higher individual tolerance. Our findings thus point to an important role for both formal- and informal-institutional background factors in shaping tolerance.
Z18|Försörjningsstöd, institutioner och strukturcykeln|Ur ett strukturcykliskt perspektiv sker en omvandling av ekonomi, institutioner och politik under omvandlingsperioderna. Då välfärd kan betraktas som en funktion av dessa borde det vara möjligt att analysera välfärd och de institutionella arrangemang som är nödvändiga för en välfärdsproduktion med hjälp av en strukturcyklisk ansats. Lennart Schön har i ett flertal studier diskuterat detta samband, men på en hög teoretiskt abstraktionsnivå. Denna uppsats syftar till att diskutera i vilken utsträckning ett strukturanalytiskt resonemang är tillämpligt vid analyser av tillkomst och förändring av olika välfärdsarrangemang och social reformarbete. Socialtjänst och försörjningsstöd, samt deras föregångare, används som exempel. Resultaten indikerar att 1871 års fattigvårdsförordning, 1918 års fattigvårdslag, 1956 års socialhjälpslag och 1997 års socialtjänstlag styrts eller i stor utsträckning påverkats av sociala utvecklingsblock, medan 1980 års socialtjänstlag snarare tillkommit enligt ett kris-/skördetidsmönster.
Z18|Exchange rate, remittances and expenditure of foreign-born households: evidence from Australia|We examined the impact of the depreciation of the Australian dollar (AU$) during 2013-2015 on the expenditure of households with foreign-born members (HFBMs) in Australia. Employing the difference-in-differences method and 2013-2015 Nielson Homescan Panel Survey data, we found that HFBMs spent around 2.4 percent more on their food expenditure in 2014 and 4.0 percent more in 2015 compared to their native counterparts. Further investigation indicated that neither incomes nor food prices nor the expenditures on imported food items changed differently for any group in that period, while an analysis with HILDA survey data indicates a similar pattern for total expenditures. With reduced outward aggregate remittances from Australia over the same time, we argue that falling AU$ induces HFBMs to substitute for consumption in the home country with that in the host nation. Our empirical results provide fresh insights on how changes in the exchange rate may affect immigrants differently than natives.
Z18|Inter-municipal cooperation as a solution for public services delivery? The case of Unioni di Comuni in Emilia-Romagna Region|Inter municipal cooperation (IMC) represents a solution adopted all around the world in order to jointly provide services considering the complexity of contemporary socio-economic contexts. However, empirical evidence on IMC solutions is still week. The purpose of this paper is to analyse associations of municipalities (Unioni di Comuni, UC), the prevalent kind of IMC established in Italy, as a possible solution for sustainable public services delivery. Our research questions refer to the main features of Unioni di Comuni as an IMC for public services delivery in Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy), to the explanation of those characteristics, and to the evaluation of UCs and their features in terms of autonomy, resilience and sustainability. In order to meet our objectives, we accomplished a cluster analysis, considering administrative and socio-economic data; in addition, we examined specific characteristics within each cluster to proceed with a comparison between clusters in terms of revenues from transfers from other governments layers, own revenues, current expenses and financial autonomy index in the last years. Our results suggest a general tendency: to provide services through UC in E-R; and to enhance their development in terms of public service special-ization. But at the same time, UCs generally decreased their own financial autonomy, relying on transfers from other public institutions. In line with Resource-Dependence Theory (RDT), our empirical analysis finds different clusters of UCs which act as new centres for public service delivery in Emilia-Romagna Region in order to reduce uncertainty over resources through the creation of new inter-institutional balances. However, the statement that strong UCs com-pensate weak starting territorial features of municipalities is not self-evident.
Z18|Predicting High-Risk Opioid Prescriptions Before they are Given|Misuse of prescription opioids is a leading cause of premature death in the United States. We use new state government administrative data and machine learning methods to examine whether the risk of future opioid dependence, abuse, or poisoning can be predicted in advance of an initial opioid prescription. Our models accurately predict these outcomes and identify particular prior non-opioid prescriptions, medical history, incarceration, and demographics as strong predictors. Using our model estimates, we simulate a hypothetical policy which restricts new opioid prescriptions to only those with low predicted risk. The policy’s potential benefits likely outweigh costs across demographic subgroups, even for lenient definitions of “high risk.” Our findings suggest new avenues for prevention using state administrative data, which could aid providers in making better, data-informed decisions when weighing the medical benefits of opioid therapy against the risks.
Z18|Learning from Results-Based Management evaluations and reviews|What have we learned from implementing results-based management in development co-operation organisations? What progress and benefits can be seen? What are the main challenges and unintended consequences? Are there good practices to address these challenges?To respond to these questions this paper reviews and analyses the findings from various evaluations and reviews of results-based management systems conducted by members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), the OECD/DAC Results Community Secretariat and other bodies in the past four years (2015-2018). It also draws on emerging lessons from new methods for managing development co-operation results.This analytical work aims to: identify recent trends in results-based management, explore challenges faced by providers when developing their results approaches and systems, select good practices in responding to these challenges that can be useful for the OECD/DACResults Community, considering new approaches, new technologies and evolving contexts. This body of evidence will inform the development of a core set of generic guiding principles for results-based management in development co-operation.
Z18|Enabling Civil Society: Select survey findings|Civil society and civil society organisations (CSOs) are important to development co-operation, both as implementing partners for members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), and as development actors in their own right. Agenda 2030 is clear on the necessity of mobilising CSOs to implement, and uphold accountability for, the Sustainable Development Goals. The Global Partnership for Effective Development Co operation has committed to ensuring effectiveness in relation to CSOs in development co-operation, inclusive of the provision of CSO enabling environments.Recognising that how DAC members work with CSOs is part of CSO enabling environments, in 2017 the OECD Development Co-operation Directorate (DCD) established a work stream on civil society to provide guidance on DAC member support for civil society and a strategy for engaging with civil society. Under the work stream, a study on how DAC members work with CSOs was launched to identify areas of DAC member support to and engagement with CSOs for which guidance is needed. This paper introduces a selection of key findings and recommendations from two 2018-2019 surveys complemented with DAC statistical data.The paper points to evidence of member effort to work with CSOs in ways that enable CSOs to maximise their contribution to development. However, evidence also shows that members need to continuously examine their practices to ensure coherence between objectives and the many advantages that CSOs are seen to bring to development, and the members’ means of support to and engagement with CSOs.
Z18|Do sustainability policies finance local economies?|We evaluate whether adopting a well-known transition management instrument in the tourism industry can support a combined goal of sustainability and economic growth. We create a detailed dataset at the municipality level and use a recently developed policy evaluation technique to investigate the causal impact of the Blue Flag program on the local economies of coastal destinations. Estimates show that this eco-label is not effective at enhancing the local economy; findings are homogeneous across destinations. This empirical result is in line with the recent theoretical literature arguing that the transition towards growing a sustainable economy is particularly complex and a single policy does not suffice.
Z18|Female teachers’ relative wage level in the 1930s and its long-term effects on current views on female labor participation: A case study from Japan|This study analyzes how the historical work status of women contributed to subjective views about female labor participation in Japan. We matched historical and individual-level data. Based on a sample size of almost 10,000, we examined the long-term effect of female teachers’ wage level relative to that of male teachers in the 1930s. We find higher female teachers’ wages in the 1930s leads to positive views about women’s labor participation in 2016; this effect is only observed in the male sample (and not the female sample). By contrast, female teachers’ wages in 2013 did not influence the views in 2016.
Z18|Culture and authenticity: regulating shadow economy to foster market growth|Competition in the cultural and creative industries is much dependent upon product and service differentiation. Differentiation is about the unique features that are embedded in the cultural products themselves. These unique features relate to and determine, the value that consumers ascribe to cultural products. Authenticity is commonly used to underlie the uniqueness of a cultural product and is thus a sign of a thing worthy of admiration. Within this context the current study undertakes a comparison of practices related to the way in which authenticity in the paintings’ market is handled. The aim is to sketch policy interventions for effectively regulating the shadow economy in this market. It is argued that good regulations are necessary and if enforced, positive outcomes in terms of the paintings’ market turnover and employment levels might be generated. In particular, we discuss interventions that would transform the threat of an illegal fake market into an opportunity for market growth through the development of a ‘parallel authentic copy market’. Under certain conditions such a policy intervention could have direct and indirect positive effects via: a) the incorporation of an important part of the activities of the shadow economy in the official market, b) the use of a parallel market to protect consumers and their welfare and c) the use of the parallel market to strategically foster growth in the cultural industry at large. Given the economic significance of the cultural industries at both the national and the EU level and the commitment of the later to support the industry’s growth insights, as to how we might best regulate the market in line with such directions, are critical.
Z18|Crime and Economic Growth: A Case Study of Manaus, Brazil|Due to economic and social advances since the 1990s, Brazil became the 7th largest economy in the world in 2012. However, crime rates have not stopped rising since the beginning of the last decade, with Brazil having the 11th largest homicide rate on the planet in that year (UN). In this paper we estimate how much crime harms economic activity from a case study of the city of Manaus, where in 2007 the organized crime group known as â€œFamÃ­lia do Norteâ€ was created. We analyzed the effects on Manausâ€™ GDP per capita using the synthetic control method. The comparison between Manaus and its synthetic control in the period after the creation of the criminal group showed that the presence of the criminal faction diminished the cityâ€™s GDP by 3% per year. Robustness checks confirmed this result, showing how organized crime can disrupt the countryâ€™s economic advances.
Z18|Limited impact of UPPs over criminality|The effects of the implementation of UPPs have not yet been evaluated for its entire period. This paper aims to evaluate the impact on crime rates in the city of Rio de Janeiro using as control group districts of the city of SÃ£o Paulo. Then, a difference-in-difference model is combined with a propensity score analysis. The results indicate that the UPPs were successful only in the initial years. The cost-effectiveness analysis of the program indicates an economic benefit of R$460 million, but net benefits are expected to vanish due to the limited effects of the policy.
Z18|‘Quality food’ for cultural policies. Quality attributes in the non-market stated-preference based valuation of cultural goods|Evidence-based policies require well-established research and reliable data. One of the major difficulties in delivering ‘good quality food’ for cultural policies lies in measuring culture. Stated preference based non-market valuation is one of the privileged tools to reveal the benefits cultural goods deliver to the society for cost-benefit analysis. The prevalent problem in this kind of research are poorly defined, ambiguous goods. The challenge lies in describing their quality attributes. The article’s goal is to review the hitherto uses of quality measurements of arts and culture in stated preference based non-market valuation research, mostly dedicated to performing arts and cultural heritage.
Z18|A Social Cure for Social Comparisons|Social comparisons have severe negative consequences for happiness, health, and economic decisions. Is there a remedy? Some research suggests that social comparisons are intrinsic human characteristics rooted in the biology of the brain. We offer a different view based on approximately half a million interviews from nationally representative surveys. Specifically, we assess whether people with thriving social lives suffer less from social comparisons than others. Controlling for demographic factors, we find that isolated people are more likely to be concerned about whether they earn more or less than others. Conversely, the well-being of individuals with rich social lives does not depend on keeping up with the Joneses. This result is reflected at the country level: in countries that are socially flourishing, the differences in well-being between income groups are small, which is a consequence of the relatively small impact of income comparisons on well-being. This evidence suggests that social relations can be a cure for social comparisons. We discuss a few policies to promote social relations, relating to education reform, urban planning, and advertising regulation.
Z18|Practice insights – Experimentation and design thinking in Public policy-making processes|Policy-making is a complex iterative process that requires engagement with a multiplicity of actors facing different incentives and constraints underpinned by differing structural and institutional variables. Design-thinking as a human-centered approach to problem solutioning offers valuable lessons that policy makers would find useful. This article, presented as a policy practice insight note, posits that the focus of policy design shouldn’t be so much on what makes a technically superior alternative, but what makes an institutionally sound approach and crowds in policy implementers and recipients from the design stage. It presents an understanding that policy design is more about creating processes that elicit information and feedback on government interventions than about getting the objectives right at the beginning thus allowing for an experimentation approach to policy design. The paper concludes that for policy design to be effective, finding a contextual best fit is more desirable than blanket adoption of “global best practices”

Z18|Testing for Peer Effects Using Genetic Data|Estimating peer effects is notoriously difficult because of the reflection problem and the endogeneity of peer group formation. This paper tests for peer effects in obesity in a novel way that addresses these challenges. It addresses the reflection problem by using the alter’s genetic risk score for obesity, which is a significant predictor of obesity, is determined prior to birth, and cannot be affected by the behavior of others. It addresses the endogeneity of peer group formation by examining peers who are not self-selected: full siblings. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health, we find evidence of positive peer effects in weight and obesity; having a sibling with a high genetic predisposition raises one’s risk of obesity, even controlling for one’s own genetic predisposition to obesity. Implications of the findings include that peer effects may be an explanation for continued worldwide increases in weight, and that, because of social multipliers, the cost-effectiveness of obesity treatment and prevention programs may have been underestimated.
Z18|Islamic constitutions and religious minorities|This study examines the effect of formal institutions, specifically constitutional provi-sions, on minority discrimination in Muslim societies. We hypothesize that those Muslim countries in which (political) Islam constitutes an important constraint in the legislative process experience more discrimination against minorities than other (Muslim) coun-tries. In other words, as Islam becomes a constitutionally prescribed source of legisla-tion in Muslim societies, it is expected that subsequent laws will be more likely in viola-tion of basic rights of minorities. In our empirical analysis, we find that where the su-premacy of Islam and Shari’a is constitutionally entrenched, religious minorities are in-deed likely to face more discrimination. Instrumental variable regressions support our interpretation that this result reflects a causal effect of constitutional rules on social out-comes. We find no evidence that Islam encourages minority discrimination if it is not constitutionalized. Our results confirm the grave dangers entailed in the institutionaliza-tion of supreme values.
Z18|Biased policy professionals|"A large literature focuses on the biases of individuals and consumers, as well as""nudges""and other policies that can address those biases. Although policy decisions are often more consequential than those of individual consumers, there is a dearth of studies on the biases of policy professionals: those who prepare and implement policy on behalf of elected politicians. Experiments conducted on a novel subject pool of development policy professionals (public servants of the World Bank and the Department for International Development in the United Kingdom) show that policy professionals are indeed subject to decision making traps, including sunk cost bias, the framing of losses and gains, frame-dependent risk-aversion, and, most strikingly, confirmation bias correlated with ideological priors, despite having an explicit mission to promote evidence-informed and impartial decision making. These findings should worry policy professionals and their principals in governments and large organizations, as well as citizens themselves. A further experiment, in which policy professionals engage in discussion, shows that deliberation may be able to mitigate the effects of some of these biases."
Z18|Opening Hours of Polling Stations and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Natural Experiment|Voter turnout has declined in many industrialized countries, raising the question of whether electoral institutions increase voter turnout. We exploit an electoral reform in the Austrian state of Burgenland as a natural experiment to identify the causal effect of opening hours of polling stations on voter turnout. The results show that a 10 percent increase in opening hours increased voter turnout by some 0.5 to 0.9 percentage points. The effect is substantial because voter turnout was already around 80 percent before the reform in question. The results also show that the vote share of the conservative party decreased in the course of the reform, while the vote shares of the social democratic party and of the populist rightwing party (both parties attract blue-collar workers) increased. Enhancing participation in elections by extending the opening hours of polling stations remains a question to what extent politicians and voters believe that the benefits of higher voter turnout overcompensate for additional costs of longer opening hours.
Z18|A banana republic? The effects of inconsistencies in the counting of votes on voting behavior|Abstract We examine whether local inconsistencies in the counting of votes influence voting behavior. We exploit the case of the second ballot of the 2016 presidential election in Austria. The ballot needed to be repeated because postal votes were counted carelessly in individual electoral districts (“scandal districts”). We use a difference-in-differences approach comparing election outcomes from the regular and the repeated round. The results do not show that voter turnout and postal voting declined significantly in scandal districts. Quite the contrary, voter turnout and postal voting increased slightly by about 1 percentage point in scandal districts compared to non-scandal districts. Postal votes in scandal districts also were counted with some greater care in the repeated ballot. We employ micro-level survey data indicating that voters in scandal districts blamed the federal constitutional court for ordering a second election, but did not seem to blame local authorities.

Específicamente se estudia como las estrategias de desmantelamiento de laboratorios realizadas por la Fuerza Pública, afectan una etapa de la cadena de producción de la cocaína, e impactan la fuente de financiación más importante de los grupos armados, generando así dinámicas de violencia en los municipios colombianos. Por medio de una estimación de efectos fijos y variable instrumental, se encuentra que la destrucción de laboratorios conllevó a un aumento en el número de combates entre las guerrillas y los paramilitares.
Z18|Frames of Governance: Comparing Institutional Arrangements over the Policy Space|In this article, we develop a framework to analyze the relationship between evidence and policy. Postulating a normative criterion based on cost-benefit analysis and the value of a piece of information, as well as a topology of the policy space defined by three characteristics (epistemic uncertainty, interests, and the degree of value conflicts), we identify the (Nash) equilibria of an interaction between experts and citizens in providing information to a decision maker. In this setup, we study three institutional arrangements (evidence-based policy, deliberative governance, and negotiated conflict) that differ in terms of reliance on experts and citizens for providing information. We show that different degrees of uncertainty, interests, and values-relevance surrounding issue at stake result in vastly different arrangement performances; hence, to foster efficiency, rules should be contingent. ****** En este ensayo, se desarrolla un marco de análisis para la relación entre evidencia y política pública. A partir de un criterio normativo basado en el análisis costo beneficio y en el valor de una información, y de una topología de las políticas públicas definida por tres características (incertidumbre epistémica, intereses, y el grado del conflicto de valores), identificamos los equilibrios de Nash de una interacción entre expertos y ciudadanos en proveer información a un hacedor de política. En este contexto, estudiamos tres arreglos institucionales (políticas basadas en evidencia, democracia deliberativa, conflicto negociado) que difieren en qué tanto confiamos en los expertos y en los ciudadanos en proveer información. Mostramos que diferentes intensidades de incertidumbre, intereses y conflictos de valores generan resultados muy varios en el desempeño de estos arreglos: en conclusión, para mayor eficiencia, las reglas tienen que ser contingentes.
Z18|The Economics of Language|The paper brings together methodological, theoretical, and empirical analysis into the single framework of linguistic diversity. It reflects both historical and contemporary research by economists and other social scientists on the impact of language on economic outcomes and public policies. We examine whether and how language influences human thinking (including emotions) and behavior, analyze the effects of linguistic distances on trade, migrations, financial markets, language learning and its returns. The quantitative foundations of linguistic diversity, which rely on group identification, linguistic distances as well as fractionalization, polarization and disenfranchisement indices are discussed in terms of their empirical challenges and uses. We conclude with an analysis of linguistic policies and shifts of languages and examine their welfare effects and the trade-offs between the development of labor markets and the social costs that they generate in various countries.
Z18|Diversity and Growth|The diversity of social interaction within economic communities affects productivity and growth, and is itself shaped by economic conditions. These reciprocal effects raise the possibility of multiple equilibria, of setting a socially polarized economy stagnating in poverty on a new path of social integration and economic growth through external intervention or an internal political initiative. This paper describes a simple analytical model that captures these reciprocal effects, and sheds light on the role of government capacity, community leadership, federation and external credit or aid, in achieving economic growth through social integration.

Z18|On the Necessary and Sufficient Condition for Increasing Direct Participation Rights in Democracies: Comment on “Proposals for a Democracy of the Future” by Bruno S. Frey|Abstract This article explores several issues related to whether and how direct participation of citizens could be further developed in democratic systems. The analysis starts with an overview of Frey’s proposals for a democracy of the future. The article then addresses three main issues related to direct citizen involvement in public decision-making: (1) the link between extensive direct participation rights and Pareto optimality; (2) the question whether political parties do matter in representative democracies; and (3) the role of program evaluation in our modern democracies. The main conclusion of the analysis is that, given the current state of the literature, the search for Pareto-optimal policies does not appear as either a necessary condition (representative democracies have merits on their own) or a sufficient condition (referendums can yield inefficient outcomes) for extended democratic participation rights.
Z18|Standard Budgets in Spanish Economic History: a User’s Guide to Sources and Methods|In this paper the author documents a near absence of household budget microdata in the sources for nineteenth century Spain, both published and archival. The sources do however contain a rich set of standard budgets, which can contribute to a better understanding of the history of Spanish living standards. The paper is divided in three parts: first, the author describes standard budgets and their usefulness for cliometricians; secondly, he traces their history in the Spanish sources; finally, he sketches a few applications to issues in the period 1850-1905. The latter analysis suggests: a) a substantial variation in cost of living and expenditure patterns across provinces, sectors, and socioeconomic status; b) a sensible impact of alternative CPI weights on national price indices; c) poverty lines ranging between 1,110 and 1,300 euros per year – in 2016 prices – for the years 1850 and 1856.
Z18|Universal preschool programs and long-term child outcomes: A systematic review|What are the long-term effects of universal preschool programs on child outcomes? We review 26 studies using natural experiments to estimate the effects of universal preschool programs for children aged 0-6 years on child outcomes measured from third grade to adulthood. Studies comparing preschool with parental, family, or other informal modes of care show mixed effects on test scores, and on measures related to health, well-being, and behavior. However, all estimates for outcomes related to adequate primary and secondary school progression, years of schooling, highest degree completed, employment, and earnings indicate beneficial average effects of universal preschool programs. Three of the included studies calculate benefits-to-costs ratios and find ratios clearly above one. Universal preschool tends to be more beneficial for children with low socioeconomic status, and there are not consistently different effects for boys or girls. Only three studies compare two alternative types of universal preschool programs in terms of long-term outcomes.
Z18|Do voters dislike liberalizing reforms? New evidence using data on satisfaction with democracy|Since the early 1980s a wave of liberalizing reforms has swept over the world. While the stated motivation for these reforms has usually been to increase economic efficiency, some critics have instead inferred ulterior motives and a desire to enrich certain (already rich) people at the expense of others. This critique, coupled with the claim that many of the reforms have been undertaken during different crises so as to bypass potential opponents, suggests that people will dislike the reforms and even be less satisfied with democracy as such. We test this hypothesis empirically, using panel data from 30 European countries in the period 1993–2015. The dependent variable is the average satisfaction with democracy, while the reform measures are constructed as distinct changes in four policy areas: government size, the rule of law, openness and regulation. Our results indicate that while reforms of government size are not robustly related to satisfaction with democracy, reforms of the other three kinds are – and in a way that runs counter to the anti-liberalization claims. Reforms that reduce economic freedom are generally related to satisfaction with democracy in a negative way, while reforms that increase economic freedom are positively associated with satisfaction with democracy. Voters also react more negatively to left-wing governments introducing reforms that de-liberalize. It thus seems as if the hypothesis of a general negative reaction towards liberalizing reforms taking the form of reduced satisfaction with democracy does not stand up to empirical scrutiny, at least not in our European sample.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

With the ratification the signatory countries commit significant parts of their budget to the European Commission and the European Court of Justice, which indicates a shift of power from legislative to executive authorities and the judiciary. In the aftermath of the economic crisis there can be observed a strong tendency to interpret the financial and economic crisis mainly as a sovereign debt crisis without any connection to the preceding crisis. This is reflected in several recommendations, which limit the scope of political decision-making in order to ""calm financial markets"". Applying an analysis of the public discourse about FC in three leading Austrian newspapers from December 2011 (the initial debate at an EU Summit) to July 2012 (the ratification in the Austrian parliament), the dominant rationale as well as legitimization and argumentation patterns will be examined. The methodology adopted in the article is based on a combination of critical discourse analysis and conceptual metaphor theory in order to illustrate the effectiveness of marketradical thinking of specific economic elites in public discourse. It can be shown that the public discourse about economic policies yet in a time of a potential ""crisis of economics"" is still dominated by economic ideas or ""economic imaginaries"" (implicitly) preferring austerity measures to active fiscal policies."

Z18|Diversity and Growth|The diversity of social interaction within economic communities affects productivity and growth, and is itself shaped by economic conditions. These reciprocal effects raise the possibility of multiple equilibria, of setting a socially polarized economy stagnating in poverty on a new path of social integration and economic growth through external intervention or an internal political initiative. This paper describes a simple analytical model that captures these reciprocal effects, and sheds light on the role of government capacity, community leadership, federation and external credit or aid, in achieving economic growth through social integration.
Z18|Do 'All-Age' Bicycle Helmet Laws Work? Evidence from Canada|Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia require youths to wear helmets when riding a bicycle, and there has been a push to extend such laws to adults. We provide new evidence on helmet laws by studying Canada using difference-in-differences models and restricted area-identified public health survey data with information on cycling and helmet use for nearly 800,000 individuals from 1994-2014. We first confirm prior patterns from the US that laws requiring youths to wear helmets significantly increased youth helmet use. We then provide the literature’s first comprehensive evidence that ‘all-age’ bicycle helmet laws significantly increased both adult and youth helmet use by 50 to 190 percent relative to pre-reform levels, with larger effects for younger adults, and less-educated adults. All-age helmet laws had modest effects at reducing cycling and increasing in-home exercise during winter months among adults but did not meaningfully affect weight. Finally, we find larger effects of helmet laws at increasing helmet use for adults with children in the household, consistent with role-modeling behavior. Overall our findings confirm that all-age helmet laws can be effective at increasing population helmet use without significant unintended adverse health consequences.
Z18|The Lure of Incredible Certitude|"Forthright characterization of scientific uncertainty is important in principle and serves important practical purposes. Nevertheless, economists and other researchers commonly report findings with incredible certitude, reporting point predictions and estimates. To motivate expression of incredible certitude, economists often suggest that researchers respond to incentives that make the practice tempting. This temptation is the ""lure"" of incredible certitude. I flesh out and appraise some of the rationales that observers may have in mind when they state that incredible certitude responds to incentives. I conclude that scientific expression of incredible certitude at most has appeal in certain limited contexts. It should not be a general practice."
Z18|Altruistic and selfish motivations of charitable giving: The case of the hometown tax donation system (Furusato nozei) in Japan|This study analyzes the altruistic and selfish motivations of charitable giving in the context of Japan’s hometown tax donation system, whereby people can donate to municipalities where they do not live and receive reciprocal gifts, using local government-level panel data for 2008–2015. We find that the Great East Japan earthquake led to an increase in donations through the system for municipalities with disaster victims, reflecting altruistic motivation. Furthermore, a 1% increase in gift expenditure for donors leads to 0.61% increase in donations, suggesting selfish motivation. Gift provision reduces altruistic donation by nearly 300%, compared with no such provision.
Z18|Voting in the Goods and Service Tax Council of India|In 2017, India enacted a new taxation law called the Goods and Services Tax (GST). This law created a GST Council with representatives of the Union government and the Provincial governments. The decision making procedure in the GST Council is specified to be by weighted voting. This work performs a detailed study of such a mechanism using the framework of formal voting games. On a theoretical note, we introduce several new notions regarding blocking dynamics of voting games. These are then applied to the study of voting in the GST context. We identify a set of basic desiderata and propose some modifications to the voting rule in the GST Act.

With the used of Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) latent construct variable of police image were identified as follows; professionalism, obedience, morality and justice and fairness. Further, ordinal regression indicates statistical characteristics the older the police is the better perception of his self-image. Further study, to determine the congruence or resonance of the findings of this study utilizing the perception of the community on police image.
Z18|Does education affect economic liberty? The role of information and the media|We explore whether education plays a key role in determining economic liberty. Baseline estimates suggest that the educational level of a country, as measured by the average years of total schooling, is a significant contributor to economic freedom. To isolate exogenous variation, we use historical information on primary school enrollment rates and also rely on genetic information. We show that the exogenous component of education is strongly correlated with economic liberty after controlling for the influence of a number of other relevant factors. We identify access to information and media freedom as two channels through which higher education is translated into less interventional government policy. We offer non parametric evidence and demonstrate that the impact of schooling is non linear. At low levels of education its influence is negative implying that economic policies in favor of government intervention are more likely to prevail when the educational level of a country is low. When moving to higher levels of schooling, this effect switches to positive.

Soil processing is intended to create better physical, chemical, and biological conditions of the soil to a certain depth to be suitable for plant growth. The study was conducted in the cimencrang paddy field with field observations and farmers' methods. The land preparation activity is divided into two stages, namely the first land preparation and the second land preparation. First processing, cut the soil and turn it over. Processing the second land, destroying the lumps produced from the first treatment. There are two things that can be analyzed from observations including economic analysis and tractor efficiency. Economic analysis includes costs incurred to process land taking into account the operational time required. The tractor efficiency is assessed from the use of the tractor in processing the land and the type of tractor used.

Z18|Building Less Flawed Metrics|Metrics are useful for measuring systems and motivating behaviors. Unfortunately, naive application of metrics to a system can distort the system in ways that undermine the original goal. The problem was noted independently by Campbell and Goodhart, and in some forms it is not only common, but unavoidable due to the nature of metrics. There are two distinct but interrelated problems that must be overcome in building better metrics; first, specifying metrics more closely related to the true goals, and second, preventing the recipients from gaming the difference between the reward system and the true goal. This paper describes several approaches to designing metrics, beginning with design considerations and processes, then discussing specific strategies including secrecy, randomization, diversification, and post-hoc specification. Finally, it will discuss important desiderata and the trade-offs involved in each approach.

However, the role of the government in carrying out development depends on public finance which in fact has problems in terms of management and implementation. In the perspective of Islamic economics, public finance is a top priority managed from the side of the sources of income and expenditure used in implementing pro-poor development so as to create prosperity for the community.
Z18|Mental Health Policy in India: Seven Sets of Questions and Some Answers|The context of the paper's analysis is the arguably poor state of mental health care in India, as well as an unprecedented level of policy attention to the issue. The questions posed pertain to (1) the provision of such care in hospitals, (2) non-hospital provision, including by non-medical providers, (3) issues of education and social acceptance, (4) affordability, (5) within-country variation of care and possibilities for benchmarking, (6) aggregate resource impacts of a concerted effort to change policies and improve care, and (7) the shape of a more effective “continuum of care for mental health issues. The paper argues that, while new laws and policies being introduced in India propose ideas and changes that are groundbreaking for that country, leading to cautious optimism, there still are many gaps in the understanding of the challenges of the provision of increased access to, as well as better quality, mental health care throughout the country. These challenges can be understood on two fronts: one is the psychiatric and medical aspect of the issues, and the other is the management and administration of the system. A priority in achieving the goals of greater access and better quality is to increase the number of trained personnel at all levels of specialization and skilling that are relevant. Further, while the new legal framework and policy identify the importance of information technology in rapid expansion of access to mental healthcare, more context-specific research and trials are needed. With respect to the administration and management needs of the public system, important challenges will be the need for significant organizational innovations in the education system, and cultural changes that allow specialized medical professionals to accept the use of software and less-qualified, more dispersed, frontline providers. A final area is the interface between the public and private sectors, including the role of non-profit organizations: challenges include information sharing, division of responsibilities, and resource allocation.
Z18|Los procesos de reforma y modernización administrativa del Estado uruguayo desde la Oficina de Planeamiento y Presupuesto de la Presidencia de la República|"This is a descriptive and analytical study of the processes of modernization and State reform (RDE in Spanish) in Uruguay during the last five decades, which the Planning and Budgeting Office (OPP in Spanish) has either led or played an important role in its design and implementation. Firstly, a three-level conceptual precision about RDE is proposed. Next, the antecedents prior to the creation of the OPP are explored. Particularly, the proposals and advances during devised the period of the Commission of Investments and Economic Development (CIDE) work are focused on. Subsequently, the actions of the OPP in the matter during the successive governments since the democratic restoration are addressed: the guidelines in the first administration of President Sanguinetti (1985-1989); the drive towards ""de-bureaucratization"" during the presidency of Dr. Lacalle (1990-1994); the administrative reform during the second government of Dr. Sanguinetti (1995-1999) as well as its limits during the administration of Dr. Batlle (2000-2004); and the advances and difficulties in terms of institutional strengthening of the State (""the mother of all reforms""), during the presidencies of Dr. Vázquez (2005-2009) and José Mujica (2010-2014). Finally, some reflections on the contemporary challenges around this policy arena are discussed."
Z18|Politics, Not Economics, Ultimately Drives Inequality| Depicting economic inequality as a product of natural economic forces is the ideology that itself has led to greater inequality, argues the author. Ideology has had a part in rising inequality for centuries. Now it takes the form of a supposed “objective” science of economics. This is the challenge, writes the author, that those who seek more equal incomes now face.
Z18|East Versus West on the European Populism Scale|We study a sample of individuals in 20 European countries that includes eight East European countries in order to identify whether these eight countries differ from the Western countries in the popularity of right-wing populist parties once we have controlled for personal attributes. The results show variation among the East European countries so that they are not distinct from Western Europe. In particular, in Hungary and Poland populist right-wing parties enjoy greater support once account is taken of the variables above. Moreover, we find that a right-wing identity, a negative view of immigrants, not being satisfied with democracy, being negative on homosexuality, and mistrust in both the national and the European parliament seem to be the factors heavily correlated with voting for a right-wing populist party in Europe. Also, men are more likely to vote for a right-wing populist party as are the old and the less educated. Having experienced unemployed also increased the probability of voting for these parties.

Z18|Cálculo de un WACC diferenciado por región para proyectos de generación de electricidad con fuentes renovables en Colombia|Resumen: En este trabajo estamos interesados en proponer una metodología para estimar la tasa de descuento para proyectos de generación de electricidad divididos en renovables y norenovables (convencionales) y diferenciado por región. Esto requiere estimar adicionalmente un parámetro riesgo para cada región, en este caso para cada departamento del país, que tendría el efecto inmediato de regionalizar directamente la tasa de descuento o el WACC para ambos tipos de tecnologías. En la medición del riesgo-región se consideraron variables asociadas al riesgo de corrupción y a la violencia en cada departamento. Nuestros resultados sugieren que los departamentos de Antioquia y Valle del Cauca son las regiones con más riesgo de violencia y en consecuencia donde debe exigirse una rentabilidad mínima mayor. / Abstract : In this paper we are interested in proposing a methodology to estimate the discount rate for electricity generation projects divided into renewable and non-renewable (conventional) and differentiated by region. This requires estimating a risk parameter for each region, in this case for each department of the country, which would have the immediate effect of directly regionalizing the discount rate or the WACC for both types of technologies. In the region risk measurement, variables associated with the risk of corruption and violence in each department were considered. Our results suggest that departments of Antioquia and Valle del Cauca are the regions with the highest risk of violence and consequently where a higher minimum profitability should be demanded.
Z18|Ranking languages in the European Union: Before and after Brexit|This paper presents a framework for evaluating the impact of languages in multilingual societies. We consider several ranking methods based on various principles, including Minimal Disenfranchisement, Communicative Benefits, Utilitarianism, and the game-theoretical concept of the Shapley Value. We use data from a Special Barometer survey to apply these methods to languages within the European Union and conclude that they generate quite consistent results. Finally, we analyze the impact of Brexit on the rankings, especially in the case where English forfeits its status as an official language of the Union.
Z18|Has cultural heritage monetary value an impact on visits? An assessment using Italian official data|In this paper we try to investigate which factors affect the visits to Cultural Heritage (CH), using Italy as a case study. We adopt a broad definition of CH including archaeological and historical sites, historical buildings and, also, museums, focusing our attention on State CH. In our empirical analysis we use a rather innovative indicator of CH value, i.e. the monetary value of State CH, officially provided by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Using these data, this paper aims at evaluating if such monetary value has a significant role in stimulating visits to cultural sites for the years 1996-2010. We also control for other factors potentially affecting the number of visits to cultural sites, such as alternative tourist attractors and the regional performance in the tourism sector. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to investigate the effect of CH monetary value on cultural participation.
Z18|Disentangle inefficiency in the production activities of Italian national libraries: A network DEA approach|n Italy, public state libraries are multi-product organizations providing divisible services to the public and preserving ancient books of great historical relevance for future generations. So they may undertake different production activities for conservation and use, which together construct a network. This paper shows the importance of considering multi-process interactions in evaluating the overall performance of public state libraries and focuses on library operations and its sub-processes. It uses a network two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach to examine the relationship between the librariesâ€™ basic inputs, intermediate measures and final outputs. The main result is that Italian public state libraries generally perform better in the first stage of conservation, but score poorly in the second stage of use. Therefore, policy advices to improve the decision-making process are derived.
Z18|Efficiency of Slovenian General Public Libraries: A Data Envelopment Analysis Approach|In the article, we study financing and efficiency of Slovenian GeneralPublicLibraries. We employ a rich dataset of CEZAR â€“Centre for Development of Libraries for the years 2008-2014 for 58 libraries and use data envelopment analysis, cluster analysis and regression methods to study the efficiency of libraries over the years. Our main results show that the problems for the libraries in this period did not lie in the lowered efficiency but more likely in other system requirements. Wealso provide a grouping of libraries following clusteranalysis with spatial constraints and show thecluster membership had significant effects on theperformance of the libraries.
Z18|Prevalence of Diseases and Health Care Utilization ofthe Self-Employed Artists and TheirEmpirical Determinants: Evidence From a Slovenian Survey|Empirical studies on precarious work are still at their beginnings, even more so when the health of precarious workers is under concern. Commonly, precarious workers are assumed to have the inferior health to the employees and even to the population in general, although some recent studiesfound counter evidence to this claim. In particular, studies on the labor market of artists have so far almost completely neglected the question of the health of the artists,and this study tries to fill in this large and important void. In the study, we employ a survey of Slovenian self-employed artists, undertaken in 2015, to study the determinants of the prevalence of diseases and health utilization of self-employed artists in Slovenia using econometric modelling and network analysis. We study and find the determinants, influencing the prevalence of each type of the most common disease among the self-employed artists, determine the most common groupings/multiple diseases among this population, and, finally, study the determinants of health care utilization of self-employed artists and model the heterogeneity in the observed sample. Aninteresting result lies in determining two differentgroups according to their health care utilization and providingtheir interpretation which fits into the existing literature on artist labor markets.
Z18|Policy Goals in the Eyes of the Public: Preservation of the Liberal Democratic Order Remains Most Important|More than just a few politicians and scientists see an imbalance in policy’s primary orientation toward economic goals, especially the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In view of scientific and public discourses on prosperity, this report analyzes how voting-eligible Germans, the electorate, rated the significance of different policy areas in 2013 and again at the beginning of 2017. It is based on two representative surveys conducted together with Kantar Public (formerly TNS Infratest), in which respondents were asked to rate the relevance of various policy areas. The areas included were based on the ten social indicators favored by the study commission, “Growth, Prosperity and Quality of Life,” and 20 out of the 46 indicators the German government uses in its “Living Well in Germany” Report to describe quality of life. This report shows that the majority of German citizens do indeed view the areas which are described by the indicators as important policy dimensions. In both 2013 and 2017, “preserving democracy” had the highest relevance. In 2017, “improved care for old people” was number two, and a “more effective battle against crime” took (by a very small margin) third place, followed by “full employment.” While there is a high consensus on the importance of these four goals, the assessment of the importance of further policy goals varies greatly across people, and there are also clear systematic differences in the relevance of policy areas among different social groups. The issue of refugees does not appear as a policy goal in the classifications of the commission and the government, which iswhy it was not included in the survey.
Z18|Politikziele im Spiegel der Bevölkerung: Erhalt der freiheitlich-demokratischen Ordnung weiterhin am wichtigsten|Nicht wenige PolitikerInnen und WissenschaftlerInnen sehen in einer primären Ausrichtung der Politik an ökonomischen Wohlstandsindikatoren eine Schieflage. Angesichts wissenschaftlicher und öffentlicher Diskurse zum Thema Wohlstand analysiert dieser Bericht, wie die Wahlberechtigten in Deutschland die Bedeutung verschiedener Politikziele 2013 und zu Beginn des Jahres 2017 einschätzten. Grundlage sind zwei mit Kantar Public (vormals TNS Infratest) durchgeführte repräsentative Befragungen, in denen die Relevanz verschiedener Politikziele direkt ermittelt wurde. Die Auswahl der Ziele orientierte sich dabei an den von der Enquete- Kommission „Wachstum, Wohlstand, Lebensqualität“ ausgewählten zehn Wohlstandsindikatoren, die die Ergebnisse von Politik quantifizieren, sowie an 20 der 46 von der Bundesregierung ausgewählten Indikatoren, welche die Lebensqualität („Gut leben in Deutschland“) beschreiben sollen. Dieser Bericht zeigt, dass diese Indikatoren tatsächlich von den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern überwiegend als wichtige Politikziele angesehen werden. An der Spitze der Relevanz lag 2013 wie 2017 der Erhalt der Demokratie. Auf Platz zwei landet 2017 die Verbesserung der Pflege alter Menschen und den dritten Rang nimmt eine wirksamere Bekämpfung der Kriminalität ein, der ein etwas höheres Gewicht als Vollbeschäftigung zugemessen wird. Gleichzeitig zeigt sich, dass die Menschen verschiedene Politikbereiche erkennbar unterschiedlich gewichten. Zusätzlich wird deutlich, dass es auch systematische Unterschiede in der Relevanz von Politikbereichen bei verschiedenen sozialen Gruppen gibt. Nach dem Themenbereich „Geflüchtete“ wurde nicht gefragt, da die Zahl der Geflüchteten in beiden Indikatorensystemen nicht als Politikbereich enthalten ist.
Z18|Mind the Gap: Analyzing the Impact of Data Gap in Millennium Development Goals’ (MDGs) Indicators on the Progress toward MDGs|This paper analyzes the impact of data gap in Millennium Development Goals’ (MDGs) performance indicators on actual performance success of MDGs. Performance success, within the MDG framework, is quantified using six different ways proposed in the existing literature, including both absolute and relative performance and deviation from historical transition paths of MDG indicators. The empirical analysis clearly shows that the data gap in performance measurement is a significant predictor of poor MDG performance in terms of any of the six progress measures. Larger the data gap or weaker the performance measurement system, lesser is the probability of MDG performance success. The empirical methodology used in the paper combines a Heckman correction and instrumental variable estimation strategies to simultaneously account for potential endogeneity of the key data gap variable and bias due to sample selection. This result holds true even after controlling for overall national statistical capacity and a variety of socioeconomic factors. The paper underlines the need to strengthen the performance measurement system attached to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper is the first attempt at empirically evaluating the value of data in the context of international development goals and gives empirical evidence for the need to harness the “data revolution” for sustainable development.
Z18|Does Institutional Quality Matter for Trade? Institutional Conditions in a Sectoral Trade Framework|This article examines the extent to which national institutional quality affects bilateral sectoral trade flows, as well as whether the conditioning role of institutions for trade has been waxing or waning with time. Based on a new trade theory framework, we derive a sectoral gravity equation, including novel variables corresponding to the exporter’s labor competitiveness levels, along with importer’s price indices and sectoral incomes, and analyze industry-specific bilateral trade flows of 186 countries for the period 1996–2012. We address potential endogeneity and econometric drawbacks by means of the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood estimation methods. The results indicate that both the institutional conditions at destination and the institutional distance between exporting and importing countries are relevant factors for bilateral trade. Moreover, the effect associated with institutional conditions at destination moderately increases over time. This is a robust outcome across economic sectors, with higher values for agriculture and raw materials than for manufacturing and services.
Z18|Can Community Development Improve Health? Emerging Opportunities for Collaboration between the Health and Community Development Sectors|The two sectors of community development and health have long worked in the same neighborhoods, but they have not always worked together. This is starting to change, due in part to a growing recognition among health experts of the social, economic, and environmental factors that drive health outcomes. These social determinants of health have become the basis for new collaborations between community development and health professionals. This paper introduces professionals in both sectors to this emerging area of practice through a series of case studies of innovators in the southeastern United States. Case studies look at ways to bring housing and health professionals together, opportunities to leverage community development finance tools, and efforts to use Pay for Success to improve Medicaid spending. This discussion paper reviews early lessons on how to build a successful health and community development partnership, including an examination of the incentives for community developers, health professionals, state and local governments, and philanthropy to participate in these collaborations.
Z18|Pathways from agriculture-to-nutrition in India: implications for sustainable development goals|Abstract Using a disaggregated dashboard approach with agriculture, food consumption, and demographic and health survey data, this study examines the progress of Indian states towards the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 on hunger and nutrition across different years. There is evidence of both disconnects and linkages among food security indicators along the agriculture-to-nutrition pathways across states. This heterogeneity implies that a food security policy with a single focus is not appropriate, given that there are more disconnects prevailing than linkages. The southern states performed better than the rest on almost all indicators, which was primarily attributed to better governance in ensuring food security. We also provide a mapping of the SDG 2 sub-goals, corresponding indicators, and to what extent their attainment is addressed in existing policies. Through a broadened and comprehensive approach under one coordinating body with a good set of improved interventions and governance, Indian states could attain food and nutrition security by 2030.
Z18|Relation between Civic Attitudes, Generalized and Institutional Trust in Six Regions of the Russian Federation|"""Objective – The article presents an analysis of the relationship between generalized and institutional trust indicators and manifestation of civic representations, attitudes and behaviour in six Russian regions: Altai, Jewish Autonomous region, Trans-Baikal, Kemerovo, Omsk and Orenburg regions. Methodology/Technique – The data collected in 2015 from multistage stratified sample 2400 respondents and their age from 18 to 70 years. Findings – Among the studied regions, the highest levels of both interpersonal trust and confidence in social institutions were founded in the Jewish Autonomous Region, the lowest trust levels for many government entities and non-profit organizations are in the Trans-Baikal Territory, the Kemerovo Region and the Omsk region. The levels of civic participation are higher in regions with higher levels of trust. Novelty – The study suggests that trust, both interpersonal and institutional, are a factor in the development of civil society."""
Z18|One Global Map but Different Worlds: Worldwide Survey of Human Access to Basic Utilities|The paper aims to reveal one integrated global map which points out the major geographical inequalities in providing basic utilities across the countries using multivariate analysis and thematic cartography. Sixteen indicators with global coverage were selected taking into account the waste collection services, sanitation facilities, drinking water sources, energy, electricity, habitat and demographic conditions. Several data are broken down for the total, urban and rural population in order to outline the rural-urban disparities between and within countries. A special focus is given to waste collection coverage, in order to compute a comprehensive global assessment of this key indicator of public health, which is one of the poorest monitored basic utility. The world countries were divided into 10 classes according to the hierarchical cluster analysis. Each class has particular features outlining the gaps between high, middle and low-income countries with direct impact on quality of life, public health, and environment.
Z18|Do Equal Rights for a Minority Affect General Life Satisfaction?|Abstract While previous research examines how institutions matter for general life satisfaction and how specific institutions embodying equal rights for gay people matter for the life satisfaction of gays, we combine these two issues to analyze how the latter type of institutions relates to general life satisfaction. The question is how people in general are affected by laws treating everyone equally irrespective of sexual orientation. We find that legal recognition of partnership, marriage and adoption rights, as well as an equal age of consent, relate positively to general life satisfaction. Consequently, same-sex marriage and similar reforms come at no “welfare” cost to society at large—if anything, the opposite appears to hold. We further build on previous research showing positive effects of economic freedom on happiness and on tolerance towards gay people and interact our rights measure with economic freedom. This reveals that the positive effect on general happiness of equal rights mainly appears in countries with low economic freedom. This likely follows because minority rights are perceived to indicate openness to much-desired reforms in other areas.
Z18|Can a common currency foster a shared social identity across different nations? The case of the euro|Fostering the emergence of a “European identity” was one of the declared goals of the euro adoption. Now, years after the physical introduction of the common currency, we investigate whether there has been an effect on a shared European identity. We use two different datasets in order to assess the impact of the euro adoption on the fostering of a self-declared “European Identity”. We find that the effect of the euro is statistically insignificant. We interpret this result as suggesting that the euro did not have the desired positive effect on feelings of European identity. This result holds important implications for European policy makers. It also sheds new light on the formation of social identities.

Z18|Decolonization, Property Rights and Language Conflicts|We model political contestation over school language policy, within linguistic communities where weak property rights protection leads to high decentralized expropriation. We show that improvements in governance institutions that facilitate property rights protection might exacerbate such language conflicts, even as they reduce the chances of persisting with educational indigenization, while, paradoxically, increasing the net social benefit from doing so. Our findings offer explanations of why languages and cultures of the colonizers continue to play a dominant role in the educational systems of most post-colonial developing societies, and why early post-independence attempts at cultural-linguistic indigenization were either reversed or slowed down subsequently. The main policy implication of our analysis relates to the connection it establishes between property rights protection and the welfare consequences of educational indigenization: such indigenization may improve social welfare when weak institutions lead to weak property rights protection, but reduce it otherwise.
Z18|Cross-national differences in entrepreneurial activity: role of culture and institutional factors|Abstract A review of literature in entrepreneurship and public policy suggests that the level of political freedom, corruption, and education are important antecedents to the rate of entrepreneurial activity in nations. However, empirical analysis of the effect these factors have on entrepreneurial activity across nations remains ambiguous. This study proposes that the cultural context of nations moderates the effect of these factors. Consistent with this argument, it investigates the role of individualism-collectivism in moderating the effect of political freedom, corruption, and education on entrepreneurial activity across nations. Macro-level data on 84 nations is obtained from multiple reliable sources and used to test the hypotheses. Results support the theorized arguments and suggest that individualism positively moderates the effect of political freedom, negatively moderates the effect of corruption, and positively moderates the effect of education, on the rate of entrepreneurial activity across nations.
Z18|Trump's Bait and Switch: Job Creation in the Midst of Welfare State Sabotage|"President Trump's faux populism may deliver some immediate short-term benefits to the economy, masking the devastating long-term effects from his overall policy strategy. The latter can be termed ""welfare state sabotage"" and is a wholesale assault on essential public sector institutions and macroeconomic stabilization features that were built during the New Deal era and ushered in the ""golden age"" of the American economy. Starting in the late '70s, many of these institutions were significantly eroded by Republicans and Democrats alike, paving the way for the rise of Trump but paling in comparison with what is to come."
Z18|Identity, Incentives, and Their Dynamics in the Production of Publicly Provided Goods|This paper aims to clarify the role of government provision of valuable goods and services when (i) workers may be intrinsically motivated to exert effort and (ii) there are constraints on how production occurs. We analyze the optimal organization of production in a model where agents' preferences have a behavioral component and where some decisions are made by a central authority and others are made at a lower, decentralized level. In this framework we show that it may be optimal for the central authority to choose a relatively inefficient monitoring technology and to reduce monetary incentives. The mechanism driving this result is related to a general-equilibrium effect as mediated by the public-administration budget constraint and the firm's own composition of workers.
Z18|Economic Development and the Regulation of Morally Contentious Activities|"The regulation of many activities depends on whether societies consider them morally controversial or ""repugnant."" Not only have regulation and related ethical concerns changed over time, but there is also heterogeneity across countries at a given time. We provide evidence of this heterogeneity for three morally contentious activities, abortion, prostitution, and gestational surrogacy, and explore the relationship between a country's economic conditions and how these activities are regulated. We propose a conceptual framework to identify mechanisms that can explain our findings (including the role of non-economic factors), and indicate directions for future research."
Z18|Choosing the optimal public choice scenario through a democratic educational procedure: A history from ancient Athens|In the present essay we argue that the Athenians were well aware that for a smooth functioning of democracy the citizens, who voted in the Assembly under direct democracy procedures, had to be educated. We argue that they had to find good solutions in the decision process of the Assembly. We analyse a public choice issue: the case of shipbuilding of the Athenian fleet that played a crucial defeat of the Persians in 480 BCE. The Athenians actually had to decide on a public choice set issue: sacrifice personal consumption in favour of the public good defence. We argue that the Athenians finally reached to the optimal choice, after having received at first undergone a process of democratic education.
Z18|Political economy of trade protection and liberalization: in search of agency-based and holistic framework of policy change|The paper provides comprehensive review of alternative explanations of the trade policy formation, associated rise of trade protectionism, and difficulties of trade liberalisation. Normative economic, systemic, public interest, political, institutional and constitutional economic theories of trade policy, together with political science models of trade cooperation are considered. The paper shows that current research in the area tends to accentuate the factors that entrench trade protectionism, while paying insufficient attention to the role of agency, policy dynamics and informal institutions that may bring in trade liberalisation. Requirements for holistic and dynamic analysis of trade policy are outlined.
Z18|Does Bible and Quran Represent the True Word of God, The Economist case against Addictive substances|Policy prescription regarding addictive substances is one of the critical issues facing humanity since time immemorial. It is a universal truth that drug adductors are always trouble makers in terms of creating violence, corruption, incest and numerous other immoral and corrupt activities across the globe. In order to formulate the best and universal policy approach, the present study analyzed the policy prescription of economists and different religions. Christian church like the Jews not only permits but encourage the use of addictive substances in their various religious festivals. Mainstream economists case about addictive substances is based on confusion and contradiction. In sharp contrast Islam consider addictive substances as the mother of all evils and ills. Muslim jurists on one side strictly restrict the production and consumption of addictive substances, while on the other side through moral education its use is discouraged.
Z18|One Global Map but Different Worlds: Worldwide Survey of Human Access to Basic Utilities|The paper aims to reveal one integrated global map which points out the major geographical inequalities in providing basic utilities across the countries using multivariate analysis and thematic cartography. Sixteen indicators with global coverage were selected taking into account the waste collection services, sanitation facilities, drinking water sources, energy, electricity, habitat and demographic conditions. Several data are broken down for the total, urban and rural population in order to outline the rural-urban disparities between and within countries. A special focus is given to waste collection coverage, in order to compute a comprehensive global assessment of this key indicator of public health, which is one of the poorest monitored basic utility. The world countries were divided into 10 classes according to the hierarchical cluster analysis. Each class has particular features outlining the gaps between high, middle and low-income countries with direct impact on quality of life, public health, and environment.
Z18|¿Qué Funciona, Para Quién, En Qué Aspectos, Hasta Qué Punto, En Qué Contexto Y Cómo? Una Introducción A La Evaluación Realista Y Sus Métodos<BR>[What Works, For Whom, In What Respects, To What Extent, In What Contexts, And How? An Introduction To Realist Evaluation And Its Methods]|Este artículo introduce la Evaluación Realista (ER) para el análisis de políticos públicas. La ER encuentra justificación en las limitaciones de prácticas dominantes, como las técnicas de evaluación de impacto, para ofrecer explicaciones sobre el porqué una intervención o programa tuvo (o no) resultado. La noción de cambio o transformación de la ER se centra en el estudio contextual de la agencia humana, o la forma en que individuos y colectividades actúan frente a iniciativas públicas o privadas orientadas a resolver problemáticas sociales. El texto se adentra en propuestas metodológicos para el despliegue de una ER en la práctica, tarea que implicará un trabajo interdisciplinario para refinar diferentes teorías sobre qué funciona, para quién, en qué aspectos, hasta qué punto, en qué contexto y cómo. Su adherencia al realismo científico hace de la ER una alternativa democrática, pero rigurosa, para contribuir en la generación de diseños más pertinentes de políticas públicas.
Z18|Politics case study: Bad news in good times of General Musharraf Presidency: Economics versus politics|General Musharraf ruled the country as a self proclaimed enlightened dictator. His politics is as repressive as has been the case of any dictatorial regime. However the paper suggests that he did make a genuine effort to uphold Pakistani economy that witnessed recessionary trends in 1990s. This paper is a critical analysis of Musharraf’s politics in contrast to his economic policies.
Z18|Trends and Features of Research on Foreign Aid: A Literature Review|This paper reviews the economics literature on foreign aid. Aid supporters tend to emphasize results, while its detractors tend to highlight the incentives it provides (although they may still acknowledge some of aid’s positive results, particularly on public health). Like the modes to deliver it, research on foreign aid has evolved over the years. From the traditional aid-growth regressions research has refocused towards micro issues, including institutional inefficiencies or sector-specific bottlenecks. This tendency is positive, in so far as it can lead to useful policy advice that improves the way aid is given. Great gaps in knowledge remain, though. Notably, the aid market is poorly understood in aspects such as donors’ interaction with the recipient government or donors’ coordination. In terms of political economy, recipient countries’ decision making with regards to aid fungibility or the incentives provided by new types of aid (notably China’s) have been largely unexplored. Moreover, the types of public goods that improve households’ living standards are little understood. The scarcity of research on these questions is greatly due to lack of data – or even data opacity; if aid is to be better understood and improved, far greater efforts must be made in terms of collecting and sharing data.

Z18|Hegemoni Pemerintah Terhadap Pedagang Pasar: (Analisis Dominasi Pemerintah Pasca Revitalisasi Pasar Kite Sungailiat Menurut Antonio Gramsci)<BR>[Government Hegemony Against Market Traders: (Analysis of Government Domination After Revitalization of Sungailiat Kite Market According to Antonio Gramsci)]|Hegemony is the dominance of one class against another class due to ideological and political reasons. Hegemony is done through a consensus mechanism not by suppression of other social classes. There is a government hegemony towards market traders at Sungailiat Kite Market. The intellectual power used by the government is able to influence traders' awareness to follow government policies. Traders who feel disadvantaged by policies are unable to fight. The resistance of traders can be overcome by the government by forming a consensus between the government and traders. Consensus was carried out to influence traders' thinking to follow the rules made by the government.
Z18|Creative economy policy in developing countries: The case of Indonesia|This paper investigates how the creative economy discourse is interpreted and implemented in the context of Indonesia as a developing country. Our main conclusion is that the discourse is interpreted differently across localities. Bandung appears to be the only locality whose interpretation aligns with the general understanding of a creative economy that emphasises knowledge creation and innovation. This was made possible by the strong support from academia and communities who wanted to experiment with this policy idea. Our study also provides an insight into a creative economy developing not only as a discourse, but also as a workable framework for development policies, in this city. Conversely, other cities seem to pragmatically use the policy idea without considering the local context in a rebranding exercise in order to drive economic development, whereby traditional cultural industries are relabelled as creative despite performing hardly any innovation activities. Despite this, Bandung illustrates that there are possibilities for a developing country such as Indonesia to adopt the vision of a creative economy by reshaping local institutions to support successful experimentation with this new idea.
Z18|The Construction of Gender in Saudi Arabia|Gender equality is a controversial issue and has been a constant subject of debate across the world in varied domains and disciplines, particularly in the field of Higher Education (HE). Several scholars distinguish between the terms gender and sex. They believe that gender is a social construct and learnt behaviour, while sex is perceived as a biological category (McHugh 2007). Such differences in gender can be viewed as a cultural phenomenon, generating from the dominant concepts of a specific culture or era (Weiner 2010).It is argued that Muslim women are enslaved through oppression and inequality (Aquil 2012). Such inequality can be recognised in varied forms, for instance, their underrepresentation in several areas of achievement and progress particularly in acceding to senior management positions in academia. It seems that there is no exception for women in Saudi Arabia either, who might encounter such issues. Certain factors can be attributed to why women, particularly in Saudi Arabia, are not accorded career progression like their male counterparts, the primary one being the fact that 60% of Saudi women are homemakers (Alharbi 2014). Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the intersection and influence of wider social discourses, religion, culture, and traditions on the role of Saudi women at work and exploring the nature and root causes of discrimination. My research methodology utilised a qualitative approach in the form of multiple case studies. This research was performed from a feminist standpoint. Feminist research brings gender to the foreground and endeavours to understand social phenomena from the perspective of women (Cohen et al. 2013). Similarly, as stated by Lather (1998) a leading scholar in feminist research, the purpose of such ideological study is to ?correct both the invisibility and distortion of female experience in ways relevant to ending women?s unequal social position?. The research sample comprised 25 participants, all female academics from five state universities, selected intentionally for this research, who had either been promoted to leadership positions or not. Additionally, there were five male participants who were considered key informants, closely connected with the formulation and implementation of policies in HE institutions in Saudi Arabia. This paper addresses the following question: To what extent are the obstacles that Saudi female academics face within the university, a reflection of the influence of wider social discourses, religion, cultures, and traditions on the role of Saudi working women?
Z18|Evaluation of National Policy toward Providing Low Cost Housing in Malaysia|Providing housing for the low income group (LIG) is one of the current challenges of most developing worlds and it is supposing to be, permanent problem in some of these countries. This research evaluates the Malaysian housing policies and programs on its particular implementation and how the practicality feature of such policies develop considerably the housing affordability and convenience to the widely held of the LIG in the Malaysia . The study will be conducted through the review prior research. Its goal is review housing policy in Malaysia for low income group because plans and policies of housing adoption of practical and all comprehensive role of the government, afford institutional support for an efficient housing delivery to the low income group.
Z18|Self-defense Policy, Justified Homicides, and Race|I use police records to explore whether changing self defense policies, known as Stand Your Ground, have differential effects across race. I find that implementing these policies leads to an additional 1.611 monthly killings of black Alleged Perpetrators of Crimes, 70.8 percent of whom are killed by black citizens, while only causing an additional 0.345 monthly killings of white Alleged Perpetrators, 97.7 percent of whom are killed by white citizens. Tests indicate that these racial disparities are significant in all cases, while falsification and robustness tests address concerns of endogenous policy creation. Results provide evidence that Stand Your Ground policies cause unequal outcomes between races.
Z18|Think Tank networks of German neoliberalism. Power structures in economics and economic policies in post-war Germany|"Even after the financial crisis, economists still exert influence on politics and society in general on several levels and thus can be still interpreted as a discipline of power. Particularly in Germany there is a long tradition of institutionalized economic policy advice, which offers economists a channel of direct and indirect impact on politics. During the European crisis policies many scholar stressed a ""comeback"", ""revival"" or ""return"" of ordoliberalism, the German variety of neoliberalism. In this paper I show how economists connected in the ""German neoliberal thought collective"" since the end of WW II have built up a strong institutional powerstructure, which had a continuous impact on German economic politics over many decades. It can be shown that in several turning points of German economic history, German neoliberalism and its core politico-economic concept of ""Social market economy"" served as guiding principle of economic policy. Furthermore I will show that up to now there is an uneven power balance among economists with high political and societal influence, i.e. economists connected in Keynesian or union-linked networks are in a minority position compared to the dense network of economists in the ""German neoliberale thought collective"". Hence, what was observed during the European crisis policies as a ""comeback of ordoliberalism"" should rather be interpreted as the consequence of a persistant influence of German neoliberal networks on German economic politics over many decades."
Z18|Biased policy professionals|"A large literature focuses on the biases of individuals and consumers, as well as ""nudges"" and other policies that can address those biases. Although policy decisions are often more consequential than those of individual consumers, there is a dearth of studies on the biases of policy professionals: those who prepare and implement policy on behalf of elected politicians. Experiments conducted on a novel subject pool of development policy professionals (public servants of the World Bank and the Department for International Development in the UK) show that policy professionals are indeed subject to decision making traps, including sunk cost bias, the framing of losses and gains, frame-dependent risk-aversion, and, most strikingly, confirmation bias correlated with ideological priors, despite having an explicit mission to promote evidence- informed and impartial decision making. These findings should worry policy professionals and their principals in governments and large organizations, as well as citizens themselves. A further experiment, in which policy professionals engage in discussion, shows that deliberation may be able to mitigate the effects of some of these biases."
Z18|Undocumented youth in limbo: the impact of America’s immigration enforcement policy on juvenile deportations|Abstract The surge in unaccompanied minor crossings between 2011 and 2014 led to an overwhelming increase in the number of juvenile deportation proceedings, which coincided with a peak in intensified immigration enforcement at the state and local levels. Using data on juvenile deportation proceedings, we examine how tougher immigration enforcement might have influenced judicial rulings on these cases and, ultimately, these youths’ ability to stay in the country. We find that the average increase in immigration enforcement over that period is associated with a 15% reduction in the share of juvenile cases ending with permission to stay. The result underscores the importance of the immigration policy context in which courts operate on their rulings, even if immigration law is within the jurisdiction of the Federal government. Given the gravity of the circumstances these children are escaping, further attention to how the piecemeal approach to immigration enforcement might impact the protection of their humanitarian rights is warranted.
Z18|Neoliberalism and Right-wing Populism: Conceptual Analogies| The paper compares neoliberal market-fundamentalism and right-wing populism on the basis of its core patterns of thinking and reasoning. Hence we offer an analysis of the work of important founders of market-fundamental economic thinking (particularly von Mises) and an established definition of populism (demonstrated by the example of arguments brought forward by leading populists, like Trump). In doing so, we highlight conceptual resemblances of these two approaches: Both assume a dually divided world that is split into only two countervailing parts. Right-wing populism shows a society split into two groups, fighting against each other. In a similar vein, neoliberal market-fundamentalists argue that there are only two possible countervailing economic and societal orders. We argue that the categorical analogies between neoliberal market-fundamentalism and right-wing populism could provide the basis for a new form of authoritarian neoliberalism.
Z18|Civic capital and support for the welfare state|Abstract We model how the interplay between tax surveillance institutions and civic capital shapes taxpayers’ support for the welfare state. We show that, when tax surveillance is tight, rational civic-minded individuals express greater support for welfare spending than uncivic ones. We provide empirical evidence of these preferences using data from Italy, a country that has long posed a puzzle for public economists for its limited civic capital and large welfare state.
Z18|A Constitutional Economics Perspective on Soft Paternalism|Using a framework that distinguishes short-term consumer preferences, individual reflective preferences and political preferences, we discuss from a constitutional economics perspective whether individuals find it in their common constitutional interest to endow representatives and bureaucrats with the competence to impose soft paternalist policies. The focus is specifically on soft paternalist policies, because these often work with non-transparent 'nudges' that are considered as manipulative in some contributions to the literature. We show that those soft paternalist policies that are manipulative indeed collide with three criteria of consumer sovereignty, reflective sovereignty and citizen sovereignty that can be argued to represent common constitutional interest of citizens. On the other hand, we argue that the set of paternalist policies that is deemed acceptable on the constitutional level is restricted to non-manipulative instruments, and their application as government policies is limited to cases with stable and very homogenous preferences. However, we also argue that competitive markets are capable of supplying many mechanisms that allow individuals to cope with problems in their decision-making processes on a private level.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Z18|Natural disasters and social capital formation: The impact of the Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake|The Great Hanshin-Awaji (Kobe) earthquake hit Japan in 1995, causing devastating damage to the economic landscape of southern-central Japan. However, the earthquake also caused people to realize the importance of social capital in Japan. Based on a large, individual-level database comprising 488,223 observations, this study investigates how and the extent to which the earthquake enhanced the investment in social capital through participation in community activity. The differences-in-differences method was used, and the following key findings were obtained: (1) In Japan, people were more likely to invest in social capital in 1996 than in 1991, (2) the effects of the earthquake decreased as the distance of one’s place of residence increased from Kobe, and (3) he earthquake significantly increased the social capital investment rate of Kobe residents, whereas it had no significant influence on the investment rate of residents of large cities close to Kobe.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Z18|Reading Between the Lines: Prediction of Political Violence Using Newspaper Text|This article provides a new methodology to predict armed conflict by using newspaper text. Through machine learning, vast quantities of newspaper text are reduced to interpretable topics. We propose the use of the within-country variation of these topics to predict the timing of conflict. This allows us to avoid the tendency of predicting conflict only in countries where it occurred before. We show that the within-country variation of topics is an extremely robust predictor of conflict and becomes particularly useful when new conflict risks arise. Two aspects seem to be responsible for these features. Topics provide depth because they consist of changing, long lists of terms which makes them able to capture the changing context of conflict. At the same time topics provide width because they summarize all text, including coverage of stabilizing factors.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Z18|A Banana Republic? Trust in Electoral Institutions in Western Democracies - Evidence from a Presidential Election in Austria|We examine the extent to which political scandals influence trust in electoral institutions in established Western democracies. The second ballot of the 2016 Presidential election in Austria needed to be repeated because of inconsistencies in individual electoral districts (scandal districts). In particular, postal votes were counted carelessly. We use a difference-indifferences approach comparing the regular and the repeated round of the second ballot, and examine whether voter turnout, postal voting, invalid voting and the vote shares of the candidates changed in scandal districts. Postal voting declined, but the results do not show that districts with inconsistencies differ regarding voter turnout, postal voting, invalid voting, and vote shares of the candidates. Voters’ trust in electoral institutions does not seem to depend on individual failing local administrations.
Z18|Squared Segmentation: How the Insider/Outsider divide across Public/Private Employment shapes attitudes towards markets|This paper addresses an important gap in the literature by exploring the interaction of twin insider-outsider and public private/employment dualities on shaping attitudes towards markets. We show how, in countries highly segmented in both dimensions, the insider-outsider cleavage and the public-private employment division combines into a squared segmentation with public and private insiders, and public and private outsiders. Our assumption is that this squared segmentation is accompanied by negative attitudes towards market mechanisms that hinder reforms required to diminish the gap between insiders and outsiders. To flesh out this dynamic, we use France as our main case study, because it is an economy where these dualities are sharply drawn. We explore our assumption based on the Wave 5 of the World Values Survey, limiting our analysis to French and German respondents. Germany offers a suitable comparison group to France, as it has also a highly dual economy but structured through production sectors rather than through the public/private divide. The results are broadly in line with our assumptions. Unlike in Germany, French respondents’ attitudes towards markets depend heavily on whether they are employed in the public or private sector
Z18|Faut-il parler la même langue pour commercer?|Le commerce est a priori plus facile entre deux pays qui partagent la même langue, d’autant plus que les produits échangés sont des biens différenciés et complexes sur lesquels il faut disposer d’un ensemble d’informations. En Europe, une série de sondages réalisés auprès des firmes exportatrices a confirmé cette intuition. Mais au-delà de cette confirmation, comment mesurer l’impact d’une langue commune sur le commerce ? Le recours à un modèle de gravité et, surtout, à une définition large de la langue commune offre un nouvel ordre de grandeur : posséder une langue commune permet d’augmenter le commerce bilatéral de plus de 200 %. L’impact varie selon la langue parlée et conjugue des effets bilatéraux et multilatéraux. Qu’en déduire en matière de francophonie ? Pour accroître son commerce, la France ne gagnerait-elle pas davantage à favoriser l’apprentissage des langues de ses partenaires plutôt qu’à promouvoir la francophonie ?
Z18|The Dispute Between Political Theology And The Politics Of Theology In The Twenty-First Century On The Meanings Of The Postmodern Globalizing And Individualistic Society And The Christian Personalist Globality|Upon the dawn of postmodernity, in the twenty-first century, we witness the emergence of a new way of thinking and of new forms of culture and life, under the ideology of globalism, whose dominance is given by the practicality and utility related to civilization, and under globality, which is the cultural aspect of globalization, pertaining to the field of culture. The two dimensions of globalization and globality, civilizational and cultural, will (re)question the principle relationship between Christianity and the new postmodern globalizing utopia, requiring to (re)consider the sense and presence of Christianity within the world, and the appropriate sociological figure of the Church, within the new reality of global and globalized humanity, in the postmodern public space. This paper deals with this ideology - globalism and the cultural manifestation of globality, and with the Orthodox answer to the new challenge of individualism and postmodern globalizing (neo)collectivism.

Z18|Análisis de la política de vivienda en Bogotá: un enfoque desde la oferta y la demanda|En este artículo se realiza una revisión de los antecedentes asociados a la política de vivienda y el sector de la construcción en Colombia, desde la década de 1970 hasta los años recientes. Con base en un análisis de oferta y demanda, el texto ofrece una explicación teórica de la problemática actual en el mercado de la vivienda en Bogotá. Así, a partir de la revisión documental y el examen de variables como producción, precios, créditos hipotecarios y área construida, se sugiere que el enfoque basado en promover la demanda de vivienda ha generado efectos nocivos sobre los precios y el desarrollo urbanístico de la ciudad. Como resultado, el artículo sintetiza los principales obstáculos de la consolidación de una política de vivienda sostenible, a la vez que destaca la importancia de considerar políticas alternativas basadas en el mejoramiento y la construcción en sitio propio, con criterios de eficiencia económica y dignidad social.******This article reviews the background to Colombian housing and construction sector policy from the 1970s to recent times. Based on a supply and demand analysis the text offers a theoretical explanation of the current problems of the housing market in Bogotá. Based on a literature review andan examination of such variables as production, prices, mortgage credits and constructed area, it is suggested that a focus on promoting demand for housing has produced negative effects on prices and on urban development in the city. Consequently, the article synthesizes the principal obstacles to consolidating a sustainable housing policy, while at the same time highlighting the importance of considering alternative policies based on improving existing stock and building in appropriate places, using to criteria designed to guarantee economic efficiency and social dignity.
Z18|Visitor Attitudes to Deaccessioning in Italian Public Museums: An Econometric Analysis|Deaccessioning is a largely controversial practice involving the sale or disposal of objects from a museumâ€™s collection. Although it has received increasing attention in the past few decades as a solution to museumsâ€™ financial concerns, its implications have rarely been researched in academia which is mainly due to the â€˜barely legalâ€™ status of deaccessioning as a management practice. Previous research suggests that visitorsâ€™ responses may vary depending on some factors, such as the destination of income generated by deaccessioning operations and the publicâ€™s perception of the museum collection as a public good. We address this question by analysing visitorsâ€™ responses in Italian public museums. Specifically, we hypothesize that stronger public cultural identity of the collection and the purpose of the income generated by deaccessioning strongly affect the attitudes to deaccessioning. Using structural equation modelling, we estimate several important determinants of visitorsâ€™ responses. We also show that attitudes to deaccessioning do not influence the decision to visit a museum. The findings of the article have implications for museum governance and particularly for the knowledge about deaccessioning in cultural economics and museum management.
Z18|Researching song titles, product cycles and copyright in published music: problems, results and data sources|The purpose of this Working Paper is to pass on our experience of research on song titles and product cycles in UK music publishing which was intended to provide evidence of the impact of copyright in a market. The Working Paper relates to the article â€˜Economics of Music Publishing: Copyright and the Marketâ€™, published in the Journal of Cultural Economics, 2016. The context of the research was a project on copyright and business models in music publishing that was part of the AHRC funded project: the â€˜Economic Survival in a Long Established Creative Industry: Strategies, Business Models and Copyright in Music Publishingâ€™. By collecting data on the product cycles of a sample of long-lasting song titles and trying to establish changes in the product cycle as the copyright regime changed we had hoped to produce empirical evidence on the effect changes in the copyright regime, such as term extension, or to those in copyright management organisations. For a variety of reasons, this proved impossible to do (at least in the UK) and the Working Paper explains what we think were the reasons. It may also serve as a possible warning to others attempting the same thing. The paper also suggests that previous research that did not consider the ambiguities of â€˜a song titleâ€™ may be flawed.
Z18|Does early bird catch the worm or a lower GPA? Evidence from a liberal arts college| Research in psychology has shown that early morning classes are not conducive to learning because of the peculiar sleep cycles of adolescents and young adults that cause them to be especially groggy in the morning. Our study examines the relationship between the times that classes are offered and the grades that students in these classes earn at a highly selective liberal arts college. Our main findings are that morning classes are harmful for student achievement. Grades are especially lower for classes that were scheduled at 8 am and 9 am. Moreover, while students of both genders are adversely affected by early morning courses, the effects are particularly pronounced for male students. This institution assigns students randomly to different sections of the same course, thus creating a quasi-natural experiment and enabling us to control for unobserved characteristics of students. In addition, we include student and faculty fixed effects.
Z18|Longer Classes Versus More Frequent Classes: Which Wins? Evidence from a Liberal Arts College|Colleges and universities have to stagger their classes across different times and days to make the best use of their existing buildings. Some of these class meetings are for different lengths of time and meet a different number of days per week. In addition, students and faculty have increased demand for courses that meet fewer days per week. There is some concern that classes that meet more often are better suited for student learning than others. However, this paper finds that, after controlling for the class time and course fixed effects as well as faculty and student fixed effects, there is no statistical difference between student learning in two days and three days classes. Thus, for colleges similar to the one in this study there does not appear to be a trade-off between the frequency of course meetings and student achievement as measured by grades.
Z18|Assessment of State Services Quality and Availability in the Socio-cultural Sphere|The relevance of the presented research is caused by distribution of independent tools to assess public administration of the socio-cultural sphere by public nongovernmental organizations and scientific institutes. The objective of the paper is to develop a technique to assess quality and availability of state services in the socio-cultural sphere as components of public administration. An institutional approach has become a leading one; it allows to consider state services quality and availability assessment in the socio-cultural sphere as a complex indicator of the content quality of a resulting effect and quality of services obtained; it is also connected with the comfort of service rendering and their availability for consumers. The elaborated technique of state services quality and availability assessment in the socio-cultural sphere includes the following criteria: The level of state services quality; the level of state services availability; the level of trust that consumers have in service providers. The technique is directed to identify effective measures to provide consumers with available and high-quality state services in the socio-cultural sphere rendered by state bodies and their departments according to the results of a calendar year.
Z18|The Model of Self-realization Readiness Formation of Research Universities Students in the Process of Civic Education|The relevance of the study is reasoned by the demand for professionals who are not only competitive in the labor market, but also possess civil position, ready for self-realization and construction of their own life in the flow of social transformation. The purpose of the article is to develop a knowledgeactivities-model of readiness formation to self-realization of research universities students in the process of civic education. The leading method is the method of modeling, allowing consider the problem of research as a purposeful process of students’ focus formation to choose the social role and civic position in the social and economic relations on the basis of understanding of their goals in life. The structure of the developed model includes a target (goal, objectives), methodological (the principles of integration, a participatory, continuity, multiculturalism), content (cognitive-oriented, project-case, civil-activities methods), organizational and procedural (including in educational content of educational material on the theory and practice of civil society; formation of information-event-learning environment; the development of teachers’ methodological culture) and result (search activity, commitment and perseverance in achieving objectives, industriousness, readiness for independent decisions in a situation of choice, the responsibility for the choice of means to achieve the goal, awareness of their rights and obligations, duty and civic reliability) components. The model suggests the development of students’ moral, legal and political focus based on personal-significant actions and it is also of practical value for teachers of research universities.
Z18|Does legality matter? The case of tax avoidance and evasion|Previous research argues that the law expresses social values and could, therefore, influence individual behavior independently of enforcement and penalization. Using three laboratory experiments on tax avoidance and evasion, we study how legality affects individuals’ decisions. We find that, without any risk of negative financial consequences, the qualification of tax minimization as illegal versus legal reduces tax minimization considerably. Legislators can thus, in principle, affect subjects’ decisions by defining the line between legality and illegality. However, once we introduce potential negative financial consequences, we observe no difference between legal and illegal tax minimization behavior. Only if we use moral priming to increase subjects’ moral cost do we again find a legality effect on tax minimization. Overall, this demonstrates the limitations of the expressive function of the law. Legality might be an important determinant of behavior only if we consider activities with little or no risk of negative financial consequences or if subjects are morally primed.
Z18|Research assessment in the UK and Italy: Costly and difficult, but probably worth it (at least for a while)|This paper provides a comparative analysis of the development of the UK and Italian university research funding systems with a special focus on Peer Review-Based Research Assessment (PRBRA) and its cost. Much of the debate surrounding the value of performance-based allocation systems hinges on the disadvantages versus the benefits of their implementation, and there is very little evidence on either their absolute cost or their cost relative to other allocation systems. Our objective is to fill this gap, collating the best possible estimates of the costs of alternative research funding methods to inform the ongoing policy debate. First, we compare funding in the UK and Italy during the period 2005–2012 and analyze the development of performance-based allocation in the two systems. Second, based on public reports and documents collected from universities, we discuss the public agency and university costs of RAE2008 and REF2014 and provide some estimates for VQR2012. We find that RAE2008 costs accounted for less than 1% of the total performance allocation in the related period while the VQR2012 efficiency ratio is estimated at around 2.5%. Finally, we compare the costs and efficiency ratios of PRBRA with metrics-based assessment and Research Council allocations and show that costs increase going from metrics to PRBRA to Research Council allocation.
Z18|Smokers’ Preference for Divorce and Extramarital Sex|It is known that smokers are more impatient than nonsmokers and tend to prefer current benefits. However, smokers’ behavior in the marriage market has not as yet been well investigated. In this paper, individual-level data, which consist of over 10,000 observations from Japan, are used to examine how preferences for divorce and extramarital sex are different between smokers and nonsmokers. After controlling for various individual characteristics, the major findings are as follows: (1) smokers are more likely to have a positive view about divorce than nonsmokers; (2) smokers are more likely to have a positive view about extramarital sex than nonsmokers. These results were observed regardless of the individual’s marital status. The findings here about smoker’s preferences are consistent with the characteristics of smokers suggested in the literature. The findings suggest that whether one is a smoker presents important information in the marriage market, where information asymmetry can cause problems.

Z18|Scoperta imprenditoriale e strategie di specializzazione intelligente: dalla teoria alla pratica|Nell’ambito della politica di coesione dell’ue per il periodo 2014-2020, lo sviluppo di una strategia di Ricerca e Innovazione per la Specializzazione Intelligente (ris3) da parte delle regioni e dei paesi europei costituisce un requisito essenziale per accedere ai fondi europei. L’obiettivo del presente contributo è quello di fare il punto sulla costruzione delle ris3 delle Regioni Italiane e in particolare sul processo di ‘scoperta imprenditoriale’ che ne è alla base. Si è quindi cercato di comprendere come le Regioni italiane hanno interpretato e attuato la ‘scoperta imprenditoriale’ e quali criticità, sia concettuali che operative, sono emerse lungo il percorso. Parole chiave: specializzazione intelligente; scoperta imprenditoriale; regioni italiane.
Z18|Nudging museums attendance: a field experiment with high school teens|Abstract This paper reports results from a field experiment conducted to study the effect of incentives offered to high school teens to motivate them to visit art museums. A vast literature exists on the design of incentives to modify the behavior of firms and consumers, but not much is known about incentives offered to adolescents and young adults to affect their cultural consumption behavior. Students in the first treatment receive a flier with basic information and opening hours of a main museum in Florence, Italy—Palazzo Vecchio. Students in the second treatment receive the flier and a short presentation conducted by an art expert about the exhibit; students in the third treatment, in addition to the flier and the presentation, receive also a non-financial reward in the form of extra-credit points toward their school grade. The analysis yields two main findings. First, non-financial reward is more effective at inducing the students to undertake the encouraged visit than either the simple presentation or the basic information with the flier. Second, over a longer time horizon the non-financial reward does not induce a significant change in behavior with respect to the simple presentation.

Z18|Improving territorial cohesion: the role of stakeholders in OMC and cohesion policy|Since the 1990s the political agenda of the European Union has been increasingly characterized by efforts to strengthen its democratic legitimacy, while at the same time, criticism regarding its democratic deficit have intensified. This has taken place in particular through the promotion of different programmes and tools aimed at involving civil society in the decision making process, both at European and local level, and in different policy sectors. This literature review deals with a large body of articles, books and reports that have been produced over the last decade on the involvement of stakeholders and citizens in decision making processes, especially in Programmes concerning socio-economic dialogue, poverty and social exclusion at European Level, and social and territorial cohesion and – more recently – social innovation at regional and urban level. It is structured as follows. The first section deals with the different theories and approaches related to stakeholders’ and citizens’ involvement in the decision making process. The second section focuses on how this concept has been developed in the European Agenda over the last two decades, especially in the framework of the most important programmes dealing with socio-economic dialogue, social policy, social exclusion and poverty. The third section analyses these changes focusing on EU programmes affecting the local level of decision making, the role of social innovation in defining new scenarios for citizens’ involvement in policy making on programmes, and initiatives addressing social cohesion, poverty and social inclusion. Finally some conclusive remarks on the main challenges of Stakeholders’ Involvement in European participatory practices based on the academic literature developed on the issue are presented.

On the basis of previous work and a roundtable taking place in the context of the Improve project, it a) identifies some main challenges for upscaling and consolidating place-based social innovation throughout the European multi-level governance system; b) analyses whether social innovation dovetails with the broader European policy goals of territorial cohesion and public participation, and c) proposes some cautious policy recommendations with regard to how EU resources can be used to better support socially innovative practices. Three main conclusions can be drawn from our analysis. Firstly, the EU supports social innovation both directly (by providing different kinds of resources for local socially innovative projects, not limited to financial resources) and indirectly, by supporting European umbrella organisations operating in the field of poverty and social inclusion. Yet, the degree of innovativeness of EU supported projects differs. Secondly, although EU support for place-based social innovation is significant, it is not consistent throughout the whole life cycle of social innovation. EU support is particularly effective in the early stages of socially innovative projects (conception and start-up). Institutionalisation of those projects depends on domestic circumstances (including welfare regimes’ peculiarities) and, what is more surprising given the emphasis at the EU level, EU resources are no used for up-scaling local socially innovative practices. Thirdly, an important challenge is to adapt the increasingly top-down approach in the support of socially innovative projects, with scarce attention being paid to the involvement and empowerment of socially excluded groups.
Z18|How Policy Legitimacy Affects Policy Support Throughout the Policy Cycle|We analyze the importance of legitimacy and compare how drivers of public policy attitudes evolve across the policy process consisting of the input (i.e. the processes forgoing acquisition of power and the procedures permeating political decision-making), throughput (i.e. the inclusion of and interactions between actors in a governance-system) and output (i.e. the substantive consequences of those decisions) stages. Using unique panel data through the three phases of the congestion tax in the Swedish city of Gothenburg, we find that legitimacy is indeed important in explaining policy support. Moreover, we find a lingering effect where support in one phase depends on legitimacy both in the present and in previous phases. Hence, our study takes us one step further on the road to understand the complicated dynamic mechanisms behind the interactions between policy making, policy support and the legitimacy and approval of politicians and political processes.
Z18|Knowing the game: motivation and skills among policy professionals|This paper focuses on “policy professionals”, i.e. people who are employed to affect politics and policy, and analyzes their particular motivations and skills. The paper focuses on the occupational practices of policy professionals: what are their main motivations and driving forces, and what are the key resources they deploy in their work? The main motivation for policy professionals is a desire to wield power and influence the course of affairs, while their working-life satisfaction comes from getting their message into the media without becoming personally exposed. The key resource of policy professionals is context-dependent politically useful knowledge, in three main forms: “Problem formulation” involves highlighting and framing social problems and their possible solutions. “Process expertise” consists of understanding the “where, how and why” of the political and policy-making processes. “Information access” is the skill to be very fast in finding reliable and relevant information. These motivations and skills underpin a particular professionalism based in an “entrepreneurial ethos”, which differs from both the ethos of elected politicians, and that of civil servants, and which has some potentially problematic implications for democratic governance.
Z18|"""Most MPs are not all that sharp"""" Political employees and representative democracy"|This paper analyses the orientations of political employees In Sweden. Why do they prefer to pursue politics in this particular form and not as elected politicians? What are their views more broadly about representative democracy, and what do they think about the elected politicians? What do these orientations imply for their role in democratic governance? The paper finds that their roles are diffuse: there is no agreement among political employees about whether they are politicians or not, and their mandate is fleeting and unclear. They hold the(average politician’s intellectual abilities in low regard, and sometimes take on clearly paternalistic views towards elected representatives. They see little attraction in pursuing a career as elected politicians, because of intrusive media scrutiny and since they hold a view of elected politics as slow, boring, and shallow. The professional route to politics is seen as more efficient, fast and fun.
Z18|Of urban commons|Last summer visitors to the Oslo opera house were met with the following announcement: “Here comes the “Opera Commons” explaining: “Operaallmenningen”, the Opera Commons, “will be a multi-functional meeting place for cultural events, recreational activities and people passing through.” The choice of “allmenning” (commons) to designate a place that is available to citizens of Oslo and their visitors as a “meeting place for cultural events” and “recreational activities” may be part of an international trend idolizing “the commons”. This trend one may observe both in academia and in some political circles. The trend deserves some reflection in its own right. Why is there currently a need for this term? The established theory of the commons does not have much to say about urban reality in its own right. However, the theory is well developed to understand some problems of collective action as these appear in urban development. The link between land tenure and structure of land use decisions is well known. We shall use the theory of the commons to comment on the link between tenure and form of commons that may appear and the problems of governing urban commons in various forms.
Z18|Pardon Does not Forgive Democracy: Econometrical Analysis of Pardons in Spain|The pardon is a legal, although controversial, instrument with a long history that persists in many different judicial systems across the world. The juridical literature often considers it to be a perversion in the separation of powers within the State, and the motivations behind it are always under scrutiny. In this paper we seek to establish whether there are specific factors that affect and determine pardons. Using a database of all pardons granted in Spain between 1995 and 2013, including our own elaborated individual data, the econometrical estimations produce the following conclusions: firstly, Spain’s right-wing political party processes pardons faster than that of the left; secondly, and due to public concern, pardons are less frequent near elections; and thirdly, the higher the fine, the faster the pardon. These results show that the pardon is used in a discretionary way and in most cases greatly distorts the separation of powers that should provide the basis of any healthy democratic system.

Z18|Ethnic networks and location choice of immigrants|Immigrants can initially face significant difficulties integrating into the economy of the host country, due to information gaps about the local labor market, limited language proficiency, and unfamiliarity with the local culture. Settlement in a region where economic and social networks based on familiar cultural or language factors (“ethnic capital”) exist provides an effective strategy for economic integration. As international migration into culturally diverse countries increases, ethnic networks will be important considerations in managing immigration selection, language proficiency requirements, and regional economic policies.
Z18|An analysis of Puerto Rican interest to migrate to the United States using Google trends|This study analyses the interest of Puerto Ricans in migrating to the United States as measured by Google search terms. It is publicly acknowledged that the majority of migrants from the Island in the last decade are highly skilled individuals, which means that the Island stands to lose human capital if the current migration trend continues. Therefore, it is important to investigate factors that may influence the interest of Puerto Ricans in moving before actual migration occurs. The statistical analysis was realized using an autoregressive integrated moving average model and data from Google trends. This study investigates factors influencing the interest to move (migrate) of Puerto Ricans to the five states with the highest population of Puerto Ricans (Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) and to the United States (U.S.) as a destination itself. The study will also make a comparison between the interest to move to the rest of the U.S. versus the interest to move to one of the specific five mentioned states. The explanatory variables affecting Puerto Ricans’ interest to move were classified using a cross-disciplinary approach. The results tend to divide the five states into two broad, yet related, interest groups. First, the states of interest for job related reasons (macro level factors) are Florida and New York. Second, the states of interests for family (meso level factors) and political party (micro level factors) related reasons are New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. Puerto Ricans moving to Florida and New York showed similar interests compared with New Jersey, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, and the United States as a whole. It is found that micro-level factors positively affect Puerto Ricans’ interest to move, while macro-level factors negatively affect Puerto Ricans’ interest to move. The results provide policy makers with a direction through which they can identify areas where policies are needed depending on their desired goals, whether it is increasing political participation or the retention of youth through redesigning the education system or the attraction of skilled workers through the creation of jobs and increased return to human capital investment, or budgeting, social benefits and social programs. The novelty of the analysis lies in its attempt to identify factors that influence the intention to migrate before actual migration occurs.
Z18|Luck and Effort: Learning about Income from Friends and Neighbors|Can social segregation explain differences in beliefs regarding the role of effort in determining high incomes? I develop a model of lineages of agents learning about the effect of effort on the probability of receiving a high income based on their own experience (effort chosen and income received) and the experiences of agents in their networks. Simulating economies of these agents, only two conditions are needed for the existence of long-run differences in beliefs: (i) agents assume their networks are representative of the whole economy, and (ii) they are more likely to meet others with similar life experiencesâas under social segregation. For my analysis, I also consider (iii) imperfect intergenerational transmission of beliefs, in the form of partial confidence about parentâs beliefs, to account for sizable changes in beliefs due to single mobility experiences. I find a positive relationship between the degree of social segregation and the level of long-run differences in beliefs. Moreover, high levels of social segregation can lead agents to make inefficient effort choices while average beliefs drift away from real parameters. High levels of social segregation generate groups of agents who persistently exert (no) effort coexisting with agents choosing depending on their cost of effort. And, mobility experiences resulting from luck decrease the belief about the role of effort.
Z18|Local government allocation of cultural services|Abstract In the present paper, we analyse the allocation process for cultural services in Norwegian municipalities. The cultural sector at this administrative level is decomposed into the following eight subcategories: children’s and youth activities, libraries, cinemas, museums, arts dissemination, cultural heritage, cultural schools, and other cultural services. By means of budget shares for these eight cultural services and a residual sector consisting of all other municipal services, we estimate a system of demand relations which are interdependently linked to each other by a budget restriction. Our analyses are based on data from 409 out of 429 Norwegian municipalities during the period 2002–2010. In the empirical analyses, we mainly focus on the effects of income variation for the cultural services. We estimate effects of free income, matching grants to each sector, and user fees and other sector-specific income for each sector. We also estimate crowding-out effects for the cultural sectors of demographic variables indicating higher demand for services such as education, childcare, and health services. Our results confirm previous results. There are interesting differences within the group of cultural services, and these are partly related to different levels of national standardisation and regulation among the cultural services.
Z18|City competition for the creative class|Abstract This paper explores the conditions under which decentralization and fiscal competition lead to a policy of providing public amenities in order to attract highly productive labor. It provides a theoretical analysis which shows that the incentive to provide such amenities is particularly strong, if institutional restrictions prevent local governments from adjusting their tax structure. The empirical analysis considers the case of Germany, where public subsidies to local theaters are shown to exert a compensating earnings differential for highly educated labor. Taking account of the institutional setting, our empirical results suggest that local jurisdictions in Germany are subject to a substantial fiscal incentive to subsidize cultural activities.
Z18|Network and perceptual determinants of satisfaction among science and engineering faculty in US research universities|Abstract This study examines how personal research collaboration and advice networks of academic faculty in six fields of science and engineering affect three kinds of satisfaction: satisfaction with rewards; satisfaction with reputation of department and institution; and satisfaction with professional recognition and visibility of research. The study includes determinants found in the literature such as perceived influence on departmental decisions, departmental provision of resources, and perceptions of time spent on service and other controls. Using data collected from a national survey of academic faculty in six fields of science and engineering in Carnegie designated Research I universities, regression models test literature derived hypotheses. Findings show that the effects of network structure and resources on satisfaction depend on the kind of satisfaction studied. Non-network variables demonstrate associations with satisfaction that are generally expected from the literature. The paper provides evidence of the critical role that personal research collaboration and advice networks play for scientists’ satisfaction. It also raises important questions about the complex relationships between network structures and resources, and satisfaction. Conclusions present implications for university and departmental administrators.
Z18|Community Voices: Insights on Social and Human services from People with Lived Experiences of Homelessness|Community Voices is a participatory action research study conducted in collaboration with people with lived experiences of homelessness in Calgary, Alberta to gather insights into service provision. Following convenience and snowball recruitment strategies, seven focus groups with members of the homeless community were conducted by trained facilitators. Participants and other community members were invited as co-researchers to analyze focus group transcripts, highlight key issues, develop themes and recommendations, and share key findings with stakeholders. Study findings suggest that people who are homeless experience oppression at the personal, cultural and structural levels which make it less likely for them to exit homelessness. Our findings suggests that a housing first approach coupled with intensive personalized case management embedded within a human rights framework has the capacity to reduce homelessness and overcome the barriers that prevent individuals from exiting homelessness. Such interventions, however, require substantial investment to increase the stock of affordable housing units, improve current shelter facilities, and educate personnel in anti-oppressive practices and a political commitment to recognize housing as a human right.

Z18|Survey on New Zealanders’ Attitudes Towards and Knowledge of Macroeconomic Policy Issues: Documentation of Survey Methodology and Descriptive Results|This paper provides background information and basic descriptive statistics for a representative survey of the New Zealand population conducted on our behalf by Research New Zealand in May 2016. The survey addresses important fiscal and monetary policy issues, including: (1) public preferences for public debt and fiscal consolidation; (2) awareness of the government’s Fiscal Strategy Report; (3) citizens’ monitoring of and reaction to inflation and their inflation expectation formation; (4) knowledge and support for the Policy Target Agreement between the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the government; (5) trust in economic institutions; and (6) indicators for (macro)economic literacy, that is, objective and subjective knowledge about variables and institutions relevant for macroeconomic policy.
Z18|Measuring economic value of cultural institutions: Cultural sector efficiency in public policy|Today, many cultural institutions like museums, theaters or libraries, are considered as major economic agents who can have a profound economic impact. This paper reviews different approaches to analyze economic value and efficiency of cultural institutions in public policy; it also discusses the major arguments that explain the evolving roles of those institutions in society. The shortcomings of the evaluation approaches are also discussed.
Z18|External Influence as an Indicator of Scholarly Importance|Although the external influence of scholars has usually been approximated by publication and citation count, the array of scholarly activities is far more extensive. Today, new technologies, in particular Internet search engines, allow more accurate measurement of scholars' influence on societal discourse. Hence, in this article, we analyse the relation between the internal and external influence of 723 top economists using the number of pages indexed by Google and Bing as a measure of external influence. We not only identify a small association between these scholars’ internal and external influence but also a correlation between internal influence, as captured by receipt of such major academic awards as the Nobel Prize and John Bates Clark Medal, and the external prominence of the top 100 researchers.
Z18|Innovation capabilities in the private sector: evaluating subsidies for hiring S&T workers in Spain|This article evaluates the effectiveness of a public programme intended to improve innovation capabilities in the private sector by subsidizing the hiring of research and development (R&D) personnel. Using information from the programme management database, we study factors associated with the duration of contracts and their transformation into open-ended contracts, a basic aim of the programme. We explore the characteristics of subsidies, individuals, entities, and projects related to the eventual stabilization of the new R&D employees, when the subsidies had ended. The programme was found to strengthen R&D capacity in recipient firms—above all in technology centres—yet, only about half of the subsidized short-term contracts had been converted into permanent contracts by the end of their second year.
Z18|The Role Of The Cooperation And Verification Mechanism In Consolidating The European Values In The Romanian Territorial Collectivities|Understood as forms of democratic organization of the State in social, cultural, administrative and financial fields, the administrative decentralization and local autonomy should promote and articulate the relationship between state, society and economy. In this space of networking and concerted action among different stakeholders, citizen engagement, transparency, subsidiarity and other European values must converge. In light of these structural changes produced in the state that must meet new social demands, territorial collectivities face a series of new skills, roles and responsibilities. The aim of this article is to analyze the role of the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) and the European values promoted by the state and reflected at the local public administration level. Some of these values could be identified as the following in the Romanian territorial collectivities: legality of administration, the principle of reliability, the guarantee of fundamental rights and freedoms and equality before the Law. The CVM is a tool to maintain the reform momentum in Romania and Bulgaria and prevent reversal of the rule of law reforms enacted during the EU accession negotiations. Every six months, the Council issues a CVM report for Bulgaria and Romania, evaluating progress on the established benchmarks and flagging the most pressing issues that should be addressed before the next report.
Z18|Shrieking Sirens. Schemata, Scripts, and Social Norms: How Change Occurs|This paper investigates the causal relationships among scripts, schemata, and social norms. The authors examine how social norms are triggered by particular schemata and are grounded in scripts. Just as schemata are embedded in a network, so too are social norms, and they can be primed through spreading activation. Moreover, the expectations that allow a social norm’s existence are inherently grounded in particular scripts and schemata. Using interventions that have targeted gender norms, open defecation, female genital cutting, and other collective issues as examples, the authors argue that ignoring the cognitive underpinnings of a social norm doom interventions to failure.
Z18|Alexis Tsipras und der rhetorische Diskurs als Politik<BR>[Alexis Tsipras and the rhetorical discourse as Policy]|"Es existiert wohl keinerlei «Präzedenzfall», der in irgendeiner Weise vergleichbar wäre mit der vollkommenen Verwandlung des derzeitigen griechischen Ministerpräsidenten Alexis Tsipras und dessen Anpassung an die Anforderungen der griechischen Realität. Wahrhaft, all zu rasch übersetzte sich sein radikaler, unkonventioneller und extremer Diskurs gegen die in Griechenland seit 2010 implementierte harte Sparpolitik, in einen taktischen Rückzug. Die SYRIZA Partei, eine heterogene Mischung linker Strömungen, nutzte den Unmut der Bevölkerung gegenüber den schmerzhaft anmutenden Sparmaβnahmen des sogenannten griechischen Memorandums, um den eigenen machtpolitischen Senkrechtsstart voranzutreiben und sich ziemlich rasch von einer kleinen Protestpartei zu einer Machtpartei zu verwandeln. Dementsprechend transferierte diese Partei, ohne die geringste moralische Umschweife, die Verzweiflung der Bürger in einen extremen rhetorischen Diskurs der scheinbaren „Verteidigung sozialer Rechte“ hinein, jedoch mit dem Ziel des eigenen Wahlsieges und anschließend die Übernahme der Macht. Abstract English There is probably no ""precedent"", which would be comparable in any way with the perfect transformation of the current Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras and its adaptation to the requirements of the Greek reality. Truly, all too quickly his radical, unconventional and extreme discourse against the implemented in Greece since 2010 tough austerity policy, is transformed into a tactical retreat.. The SYRIZA party, a heterogeneous mixture of left Groups , used the displeasure of the population to the painful-looking Austerity measures of the so-called Greek memorandum to advance their own political take off to power and rather rapidly to transform from a small protest party to a ruling party. Accordingly, this party transferred, without the slightest moral ado, the despair of the citizens in an extreme rhetorical discourse of apparent ""defense of social rights"" into it, however, with the aim of the own electoral victory and then the acquisition of power."
Z18|Agent-Based Model for River-Side Land-living: Portrait of Bandung Indonesian Cikapundung Park Case Study|A city park has been built from the organic urban settlement in the Cikapundung River, Bandung, Indonesia. While the aim for the development is the revitalization of the river for being unhealthy from the waste coming from the settlement. A study on how Indonesian people, in general, treating water source, like river, lake, and ocean is revisited. Throwing waste into the river has actually become paradox with the collective mental understanding about water among Indonesians. Two scenarios of agent-based simulation is presented, to see the dynamics of organic settlement and life of the city park after being opened for public. The simulation is delivered upon the imagery of landscape taken from the satellite and drone. While experience for presented problems gives insights, the computational social laboratory also awaits for further theoretical explorations and endeavors to sharpen good policymaking.

Z18|The Islamic Political System: A Basic Value Approach|Any economic system will certainly be influenced in institutions and rules by the underlying political system. While the political processes are not carried out in the market, it can influence economic decisions related to consumption, saving, investment and exchange in no small way. Through the political processes, the shape of markets is formed, the taxation system is setup and government budget is determined. In addition, the political processes directly influence economic policies, including fiscal, monetary, trade and development policies, especially in the ways are formed and implemented. The analysis of the Islamic political system through the use of economic methodology is rare. It is common to provide historical analysis based on the experience of “Saqifah(t) Bani Saad” with the selection of the first Caliph Abu Bakr, as well as the method used to select the three following Caliph. This would involve a great deal of textual evidence and their interpretation. This paper presents an alternative approach to draw the main features of the Islamic political system from the basic Islamic values as well as contemporary human experiences. We start with identifying the most important Islamic values related to the field of politics, and set the salient features of a configuration of a contemporary political system that would fulfill such values. The first section deals with Islamic political values and in particular, those related to Tawheed, which we define it to be something more than just monotheism. In addition, we draw from contemporary Muslem literature the Islamic constitutional values. The second section discusses how Maqassed (ultimate objectives) of Shari'ah are related to the political system. The third section discusses economic theory of social choice. The fourth section discusses the sources of political failure and how they can be confronted. The fifth section discusses the choice between types of government. The sixth section discusses the lessons to be learnt from the government of Madinah. Finally, in the last section, a blueprint for an Islamic economic system is presented.
Z18|Interpreting sociopolitical change by using Chaos Theory: A lesson from Sparta and Athens|In the present paper we introduce the concept of optimal rate of political and social change as a benchmark to explain the successful or unsuccessful development of societies facing both internal change and external shocks. Societies face two extremes: volatility, e.g. rapid changes that lead to instability and possibly to collapse, or rigidity, which does not permit necessary adaptation and change and thus may again lead to collapse. Optimal is thus a rate of change between the two extremes. We develop a model to illustrate this and then analyse two cases from ancient Greece: Sparta, as a society and state with too many institutional and balances, that led to rigidity and collapse, and Athens that in the 5th century BCE had an institutional setting with almost no checks and balances (the citizens’ body, the Assembly, which was all powerful and dominant), which again led to near collapse, but then, during the 4th century BCE, introduced new institutions that enabled the state to survive in a world of changing circumstances and balances of power.

Z18|Role of Non-Governmental Organizations in Healthcare Sector of India|This is the first-ever study to estimate role of the non-governmental sector in health sector of India. It is a background study to support the National Health Account of India (2016) by Government of India. It found that the current health expenditure of non-governmental sector is INR 10,091 crore, which constitute about 2% of total health expenditure and around 0.09% of GDP with reference period 2013-14
Z18|Un Marco General para la Ciencia de la Sociedad Humana<BR>[A General Framework for the Science of Human Society]|This essay is meant as a contribution towards the integration of ‘the social sciences’ into a ‘science of human society’. For this it uses concepts and methods that economics has developed, but also questions the adequacy of mainstream economic theory in two aspects: a) the absence of a hierarchical class structure and consequent inter-class conflicts of interest, and b) the ‘benevolent government' or ‘social planner' approach to policy decisions. I construct three simple models where the first two are basically building blocks for the third. The first is a model of slaves and masters, the second of governed (clans) and governors and the third of capitalism (salaried workers, capitalist entrepreneurs, and governors). In each model, the agent(s) that have a higher rank in the hierarchy have the power to condition the decision rules of those below in a way that is similar to Stackelberg’s modeling of leader and follower firms within an oligopolistic industry. All agents in the model face a consumption/toil tradeoff. They have the same utility function albeit with class-specific parameters. The second model introduces public goods in consumption, which may have a negative impact on utility (public bads) for the governed, generating conflicting interests between the two classes. In each model, the agents deciding on the production of goods exert Planning, Organizing, Commanding and Controlling (POCC) work effort that enhances production but yields disutility. In the last two models the governing class exerts POCC work effort in the production of public goods and in the taxation necessary to finance it as well as its own consumption. The third model extends a basic model of monopolistic competition to include the Government and POCC work effort in the production of private and public goods. The distribution of income in terms of private goods is seen to depend entirely on decisions made by the upper class in the hierarchy. A more sophisticated distribution of ‘welfare’ could show much greater inequality due to possibly high levels of disutility due to public output which are public bads for workers but public goods for the upper classes. The framework is meant as a first approximation to a realistically more complex process where lower level classes have some degree of countervailing power (including elections, strikes, demonstrations, etc.). But that closer approximation could be modeled in different ways and would only modify the basic power structure reflected in the approximate model ‘in the margin’. RESUMEN Este ensayo pretende contribuir a la integración de ‘las ciencias sociales’ en una ‘ciencia de la sociedad humana’. Para ello usa conceptos y métodos que ha desarrollado la economía pero también cuestiona a la economía del mainstream en dos aspectos: a) la ausencia de una estructura jerárquica de clases y de conflictos de intereses inter-clases, y b) el enfoque del ‘gobierno benévolo’ o ‘planificador social’ para las decisiones de política. Construyo tres modelos sencillos de complejidad creciente. El primero es de esclavos y esclavistas, el segundo de (clanes) gobernados y gobernantes, y el tercero de capitalismo (asalariados, empresarios, y gobernantes). En cada modelo los agentes de mayor rango tienen el poder de condicionar las reglas decisorias de quienes están más abajo. Esto tiene similitud con la modelación de Stackelberg de empresas líderes y seguidoras en oligopolio. Todos los agentes confrontan un tradeoff consumo/esfuerzo y tienen la misma función de utilidad aunque con parámetros clase-específicos. El segundo modelo introduce los bienes públicos en el consumo, los que pueden tener impacto negativo sobre la utilidad (males públicos) de los gobernados, generando conflicto de intereses entre clases. En cada modelo los agentes que deciden sobre la producción ejercen trabajo de Planificación, Organización, Comando, y Control (POCC) que aumenta la producción pero brinda desutilidad. En los dos últimos modelos la clase gobernante ejerce trabajo POCC en la producción de bienes públicos y en la recaudación tributaria que lo financia, así como su consumo. El tercer modelo es extensión del modelo de competencia monopolística estándar que incluye el Gobierno y el trabajo POCC en la producción de bienes privados y públicos. Se muestra que la distribución del ingreso en términos de bienes privados depende de las decisiones tomadas por los gobernantes. Una distribución de ‘bienestar’ mostraría mayor desigualdad debido a las posibles desutilidades generadas por productos públicos que son males públicos para trabajadores pero bienes públicos para las clases altas. Se concibe este marco como primera aproximación de un proceso más complejo en que las clases inferiores tienen algún grado de poder contestatario (incluyendo elecciones, huelgas, manifestaciones, etc.) Pero esa mayor aproximación puede ser modelada de diferentes maneras y sólo modificaría la estructura de poder básica del modelo aproximado ‘en el margen’.
Z18|Interrelationships between Social and human Capital, and Economic Growth|This study focuses on economic growth and explains the interaction mechanism of economic agents and their relations. This paper highlights human capital and its social aspects. It also shows some critical aspect in the process of economic growth through interaction of socio- economic factors, which are considered as investment for creation of human capital. This investment includes cost of time and effort, which actually build up social fabric and human knowledge and health capital, which in turn creates economic growth. Root of economic growth actually depends on human capital under social relations.
Z18|Does Foreign Aid Reduce Poverty? Evidence from Niger|This paper analyses empirically whether foreign aid is associated with poverty reduction at household level in Niger. Evidence suggests that aid is correlated with poverty, to be expected when the poor are targeted. However, the study finds increases in poverty in communities that received aid projects. Further exploration reveals that poverty changes among aid-recipient households are not different to those among households receiving no projects at all. However, households benefiting from aid underperformed those who benefited from development projects by other donor types. Knowledge of local conditions seems to be the reason: when projects are funded by foreign aid only, poverty does not change, but when aid co-funds projects with other types of donor, poverty decreases. The implications are important: first, foreign aid requires coordination with other providers of public goods, which is always difficult, especially in a context of poor institutional capacity such as Niger’s. Second, the models estimated allow the prediction of the benefits a specific project would bring to a given household, which would allow Niger’s policymakers to coordinate donors’ initiatives to maximize their effectiveness – although such coordination may involve having to reduce the least efficient donors to mere providers of finance, a role they might not be willing to accept. And finally, poverty can be reduced, but for that, there is a minimum number of home-grown interventions which households should benefit from.
Z18|Spokojenost se životem a zaměstnáním v České republice<BR>[Life and Job Satisfaction in the Czech Republic]|The article deals with life and job satisfaction of the Czech working-age population. First it highlights concepts of happiness and satisfaction within the emerging multidimensional approaches to individual and societal well-being. Then, it resumes the data sources of those measures, with specific attention to the Module on Subjective Well-being of the survey EU-SILC. Using this data, basic characteristics and determinants of life satisfaction are shown first and basic characteristics and determinants of job satisfaction after that. Finally the relationship between these two dimensions of satisfaction is analysed. It appears that determination of life satisfaction by socio-demographic and economic characteristics of individuals and households is much higher than the determination of job satisfaction. The identity of “contradictory” categories where life satisfaction significantly outweighs job satisfaction and vice versa is weak.
Z18|How institutions moderate the effectiveness of regional policy: A framework and research agenda|This paper develops a research agenda toward the systematic inclusion of institutions into the analysis of regional policy effectiveness. Departing from the commonly shared observation that formal rules of regulation and policies not always lead to the intended outcomes, we argue that institutions are crucial mediators of the workings of regulation and regional policies in specific geographical contexts. By defining institutions as stable patterns of interactions based on legitimate mutual expectations (Bathelt and Glückler, 2014), we open analytical scope for analyzing the multiple relations between regulated rules and regular social practice. Hence, we build on Helmke and Levitsky’s (2004) conception of the interdependencies between regulation and institutions, and extend their heuristic into a dynamic framework at the regional scale on how to pursue what we call institutional policy-making.
Z18|The Refugee Crisis On Twitter: A Diversity Of Discourses At A European Crossroads|In the last decade, the European Union has approved and launched measures to promote Intercultural Cities, Diversity Management and the Integration of Immigrants in Europe. Despite this European framework, we are now at a crossroads between solidarity and humanity and an important restriction of refugees’ human rights across Europe. In this paper, we try to compare the international approaches to the refugee crisis in different countries in Europe. Data were extracted from Twitter. We obtained thousands of tweets about “refugees”, using this word in six different languages (English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish) from end November 2015 to 27 February 2016 as search strings. We performed a discourse analysis, focusing on the comparison between countries. A qualitative analysis with the help of both Atlas ti and T-Lab software was performed. The results showed a diversity of current discourses in Europe about refugees and the refugee crisis (from solidary to xenophobic ones), some of them very characteristic of particular countries or of local events experienced in these countries. These results allow us to reinforce the idea that we are at a key moment for the future development of Europe, especially regarding aspects concerning living together in cities and villages.
Z18|Visiting The Hippopotamus: National Integration Issues In Nigeria|National integration is the hallmark of unity and development in any polity. A multiethnic state requires potent integration mechanisms because multi-ethnicity is a potential political ‘time-bomb’ which may explode at any time. There is the need to position integrating mechanisms which will stem the tide of violence, favoritism and nepotism in the polity. Nigeria like many developing countries of the world is a multiethnic state and needs a potent national integrative mechanism. The federal character principle is identified in this paper as a mechanism used in Nigeria. This integrative prowess had caused the country a tempo gusto but to a large extent had been corrupted and rendered less effective by the interplay of the duo of ethnic chauvinism and religious bigotry. This paper concludes by remarking that the notion of political patrimony and corruption must be curbed by the stakeholders for a sustainable development in the policy.
Z18|Identifying the Link Between Food Security and Incarceration|Previous work has found that incarceration (defined as confinement in an adult correctional facility) has a variety of impacts on the incarcerated individual and their families including effects on employment and income, educational outcomes of children, and food insecurity (Wallace and Cox 2012). However, previous literature does not identify a causal impact of incarceration on food insecurity. From a policy perspective, identification of a causal link may aid in understanding why some affected families experience food insecurity, while similarly situated families do not. In this article, we utilize microlevel data from the Fragile Families and Child Well Being Study to provide evidence of a causal impact of incarceration on food insecurity. This is an important dynamic to understand because the prevalence of incarceration in the United States is relatively high, especially among groups where food insecurity is more prevalent (e.g., Blacks), and the associated externalities can have substantial impacts on families that may reach well beyond traditional costs associated with incarceration. The complex relationship between food insecurity and incarceration is estimated within a causal inference approach. We find evidence that incarceration leads to roughly a 4 percentage point increase in the likelihood of food insecurity among households with children that have experienced a parental incarceration.
Z18|Accessing state funded services for children with disabilities: a strategic communication issue?|The quality of the social and academic integration of children with disabilities depends more and more on their parents' ability to ask for and gain access to various services. Confronted with numerous budget cuts, many social agencies are forced to reexamine their role and the array of services they can afford to offer. In this context, parents are faced with increasing paperwork, numerous go-betweens and complex negotiations when requesting services. Empirical studies dealing with utilization of services for persons with disabilities are scarce and focus mainly on socio-demographic variables associated with high or low rates of utilization. Some sholars have suggested that free and universal access to services that are state funded is a myth. In fact, a large number of complex processes could play the role af an ? expectancy cooling down ? process, through which parents who do not have access to services for their child are led to believe that they are responsible for this situation. A threefold research was conducted to shed light on this question: 1) a content analysis of various documents parents have to read and fill out when requesting services; 2) results of a survey conducted with a sample of 133 parents of children with a confirmed medical diagnostic of disability; 3) qualitative analysis of interviews involving 30 parents who had filled out requests for state funded services for their child. Results indicated that the processes involved in asking for services is complex and convoluted. Informations and forms prepared by governmental agencies require high level reading abilities. Parents who were successful in gaining access to appear to have better communication skills than those who were not. Implications of these results for the delivery of services for children with disabilities are discussed.

Im Falle von Fallzahltabellen werden traditionell so genannte prä- und posttabulare Geheimhaltungsstrategien zur bestmöglichen Erfüllung beider gegenläufigen Zielkriterien verfolgt. Bei letzteren wird eine auf den originalen Mikrodaten erzeugte Tabelle vor der Weitergabe durch spezielle Methoden der Sperrung, Rundung oder Überlagerung von Zellwerten modifiziert. Als vielversprechend hat sich die in (Duncan und Roehrig, Database Technologies: concepts, methodologies, tools and applications, pp 1823–1843, 2007) vorgeschlagene Verfahrensgruppe der zyklischen Überlagerung herausgestellt. Basierend auf Zufallszahlen wird hier eine Folge von Überlagerungsmustern, die Basiszyklen genannt werden, sukzessive zu einer Originaltabelle addiert. Im vorliegenden Beitrag werden verschiedene Varianten der zyklischen Überlagerung vorgestellt und anhand des klassischen Zielkonfliktes, der Minimierung des Informationsverlustes bei gleichzeitiger Gewährung einer ausreichenden Datensicherheit, bewertet.

Z18|Effect of consuming imported cultural goods on trading partners’ tolerance toward immigrants: the case of Japanese anime in Korea|Abstract The consumption of imported goods is thought to influence consumers’ views and attitudes toward export countries. It is important to consider this issue, especially when there is political tension and conflict between countries. Because of their historical background, political conflict exists between Korea and Japan. This paper examines the effect of viewing Japanese anime (animation) on the attitudes of Koreans toward Japanese living in Korea. The major findings of the study show that the more frequently adult Koreans view Japanese anime, the more likely they are to accept Japanese as workplace colleagues and neighbors after controlling for endogeneity bias using instrumental variables. The findings of this paper imply that via the consumption of imported cultural goods, people are exposed to positive traits of the trading partner, and thus consumers have a stronger affinity with the export country. From this, we derive the policy implication that promoting the trade of modern cultural goods is effective in increasing mutual understanding between trading partners, thereby reducing political tension between them.
