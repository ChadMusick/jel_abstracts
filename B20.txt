B20|Taxation,foreign aid and political governance in Africa|This study examines the hypothesis that foreign aid dilutes the positive role of taxation on political governance. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments and 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. For more policy options, the dataset is disaggregated into fundamental characteristics of African development based on income levels, legal origins, natural resources and landlockedness. While the hypothesis is invalid in baseline Africa, low income and English common law countries of the continent, the research cannot conclude on its validity for other fundamental characteristics of development. Policy implications, caveats and directions for future research are discussed.
B20|Foreign Aid Complementarities and Inclusive Human Development in Africa|This study complements existing literature by assessing how various types of foreign aid complement each other in boosting inclusive human development in Africa. (a) When â€˜aid to social infrastructureâ€™ is moderated with other aid types, â€˜action on debtsâ€™ is substitutive whereas â€˜aid to the production sectorâ€™, â€˜aid for program assistanceâ€™ and humanitarian assistance are complementary. (b) â€˜Aid to the production sectorâ€™ (â€˜action on debtâ€™) is complementary (substitutive) to â€˜aid for economic infrastructureâ€™. (c) Whereas â€˜action on debtâ€™ is a substitute to â€˜aid to the production sectorâ€™, â€˜aid for social infrastructureâ€™ and â€˜aid for economic infrastructureâ€™ are complementary. (d) â€˜Action on debtâ€™ is a substitute for â€˜aid to the multi-sectorâ€™. (e) While â€˜aid for social infrastructureâ€™ and â€˜action on debtâ€™ are substitutive to â€˜aid for program assistanceâ€™; humanitarian assistance is complementary. (f) The following are substitutes to â€˜action on debtâ€™: â€˜aid for economic infrastructureâ€™, â€˜aid to the production sectorâ€™, â€˜aid to the multi-sectorâ€™ and â€˜programme assistanceâ€™. (g) â€˜Aid for social infrastructureâ€™ and â€˜programme assistanceâ€™ are complementary to humanitarian assistance. The findings reveal various patterns that inform policy makers on the relevance of sequencing aid types to enhance inclusive development. Future research should focus on country-specific studies.
B20|Del Modelo de Industrialización por Sustitución de Importaciones (ISI) al Modelo Aperturista, adoptado en Colombia en 1991|Este documento busca responder por qué se vio rezagada la industria colombiana al momento de la apertura económica y cuáles fueron las causas de la caída del modelo de Industrialización por Sustitución de Importaciones (ISI). Para este fin, se presentan y contrastan los dos modelos económicos en la búsqueda de la industrialización en Colombia; acto seguido, se examina la incidencia del modelo de apertura económica después del año de 1991 a través de varios indicadores, lo cual permite evidenciar las causas de la debacle del modelo ISI. El documento se apoya principalmente en las publicaciones de Misas Arango, Bértola y Ocampo. *** This document seeks to answer why the Colombian industry was left behind at the time of economic opening and what were the causes for the fall of the Import ubstitution Industrialization model (ISI). To this end, the two economic models are presented and contrasted in the pursuit of industrialization in Colombia; then, the incidence of the model of economic opening after 1991 is examined through several indicators, which allows the causes of the debacle of the ISI model to be evidenced. The document relies mainly on the publications of Misas Arango, Bértola and Ocampo.
B20|A General Panorama of the Import Substitution Industrialisation (ISI) Model for Colombia – A Comparative Case Study with Singapore|The document compares the Import Substitution Industrialisation (ISI) model for Colombia with the success of Singapore, to determine if there were failures in the implantation of the model in Colombia and if so, to identify them. It should be noted that an analysis of this type may present problems since the conditions of both territories differ considerably. To correct that problem the possible deficiencies found for the South American country are evaluated under the possibilities granted by its context and not by the conditions that could have been established in Singapore. The analysis of this work is limited only to the following three perspectives: historical, governmental and cultural, inasmuch as these dimensions, in the author's opinion, yield interesting results of the ISI phase of the Colombian economy and provide sufficient information for the reader to become familiar with the import substitution process in Colombia, its strengths, weaknesses and economic consequences. *** El documento compara el modelo de Industrialización por Sustitución de Importaciones (ISI) para Colombia con el éxito asiático de Singapur, con el propósito de determinar si existieron falencias en la implantación del modelo en Colombia y en caso afirmativo, determinarlas. Cabe resaltar que realizar un análisis de este tipo puede presentar problemas en tanto las condiciones de ambos territorios difieren de manera considerable. Con el fin de subsanar este problema, las posibles deficiencias encontradas para el país suramericano se evalúan bajo las posibilidades otorgadas por su propio contexto y no por las condiciones que pudieron ser establecidas en Singapur. El análisis de este trabajo se limita únicamente a las siguientes tres perspectivas: histórica, gubernamental y cultural, en tanto estas dimensiones, a juicio del autor, arrojan por sí mismas resultados interesantes de la fase ISI de la economía colombiana y proveen información suficiente para que el lector se familiarice con el proceso de sustitución de importaciones en Colombia, sus fortalezas, desaciertos y consecuencias en materia económica.
B20|Recovering Tinbergen|From the long viewpoint of history of economics, the two most important contributions that Jan Tinbergen made to economics are surely the development of the first macro-econometric model and a general theory of economic policy-making. This paper explores these two innovations to recover why they deserve such recognition, analyses their technical and conceptual depths, and shows how they relate to the economic history of the period and his personal history. In the process, it becomes clear that they are not separate innovations, but, as Tinbergen recognised, involved the same logic; and as we can recognise, were driven by the same ambition to make economics usable in the world.

B20|Growth Fatigue|This paper uncovers a new economic growth phenomenon whereby an economy becomes increasingly unresponsive to economic growth policies. This new phenomenon is referred to as growth fatigue. In this short paper, I document the growth fatigue phenomenon for the economy of Japan. My observations on Japan suggest that growth fatigue typically occurs in matured economies and that its causes are largely unknown.

B20|Manufacturing pluralism in brazilian economics: the role of ANPEC as institutional mediator and stabilizer|Brazilian academic economics has been traditionally characterized by its openness to different strands of economic theory. In contrast to the standards prevailing in most of Europe and North America, economics in Brazil can be justly described as pluralistic, with competing schools of thought enjoying relatively secure institutional positions. One of the reasons frequently ascribed for this outcome is the role played by ANPEC, the Brazilian economics association, in mediating conflicts among graduate programs affiliated to different research traditions. A crucial episode in this respect took place in the early 1970s, when the recently born association chose to adopt an inclusive stance towards its membership, welcoming the filiation of the strongly heterodox program at the University of Campinas (Unicamp) even against threats of withdrawal from one of its most prestigious members, the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV). Using a host of primary sources related to the early years of Brazilian academic economics, the paper uncovers the processthat led ANPEC, with strong support from the Ford Foundation, to adopt an inclusive and ‘pluralistic’ attitude, and how it related to the political context prevailing in Brazil during the 1970s.
B20|Of time, uncertainty, and policy-making : Lionel Robbins’ lost philosophy of political economy|In the second edition of his methodological Essay, Lionel Robbins attributes a significant role to uncertainty, dynamics and the time element. Understanding the motives that led to these revisions may offer important clues to assess what happened to political economy ever since, and how far economics has diverged from Robbins’ agenda. Our main claim is that these topics appeared on the second edition of the Essay because Robbins saw them as fundamental if economics (as a science) were to achieve its goal of being a useful tool for political economy, following the English Classical economists’ distinction between science and art. His conception of science was thus tailored to his interests in political economy, rejecting attempts to mimic the methods of the natural sciences by preserving the human element that makes economics a social science.
B20|Economía, espacio y conflicto|Este trabajo analiza el concepto de espacio en la teoría económica, dado que los sistemas económicos requieren de la apropiación del espacio geográfico para producir. No obstante, los planes y políticas económicas de los gobiernos buscan imponer actividades económicas en los territorios sin previamente consultar con las comunidades locales ni contemplar la complejidad de la figura socio-espacial. Esto se ha dado históricamente hasta hoy debido a la incapacidad y la falta de esfuerzo por parte de la teoría económica por incorporar las variables sociales, fundamentalmente el concepto espacio, que ha contribuido en el origen de conflictos sociales y ambientales en los territorios. ****** This paper analyses the concept of space in economic theory, given that economic systems require the appropriation of geographic space to produce. However, the government’s economic plans and policies seek to impose economic activities in the territories without previously consulting with local communities or contemplating the complexity of the socio-spatial figure. This has occurred historically, due to the inability and the lack of effort of economic theory to incorporate social variables, specifically the concept of space, which has contributed to the origin of social and environmental conflicts in the territories.
B20|LES ORIGINES DE LA DISTINCTION ENTRE POSITIF ET NORMATIF EN ECONOMIE (The Origin of the Positive-normative Distinction in Economics)|Economists are accustomed to distinguishing between a positive and a normative component of their work, a distinction that is peculiar to their field, having no exact counterpart in the other social sciences. The distinction has substantially changed over time, and the different ways of understanding it today are reflective of its history. Our objective is to trace the origins and initial forms of the distinction, from the English classical political economy of the first half of the 19th century to the emergence of welfare economics in the first half of the 20th century. This sequential account will also serve to identify the main representative positions along with the arguments used to support them, and it thus prepares the ground for a discussion that will be less historical and more strictly conceptual.
B20|LES ORIGINES DE LA DISTINCTION ENTRE POSITIF ET NORMATIF EN ECONOMIE (The Origin of the Positive-normative Distinction in Economics)|French Abstract: Les économistes ont coutume de distinguer entre une composante positive et une composante normative de leurs travaux, ce qui est une singularité de leur discipline, car cette distinction n'a pas de répondant exact dans les autres sciences sociales. Elle a fortement évolué au cours du temps et les différentes manières de la concevoir aujourd'hui en reflètent l'histoire. On se propose ici d'en retracer les origines et les premières formes, de l'économie politique classique anglaise de la première moitié du XIXe siècle jusqu'à l'apparition de l'économie du bien-être dans la première moitié du XXe siècle. Ce parcours séquentiel vise aussi à identifier les positions les plus représentatives et les arguments invoqués pour les soutenir, en préparant ainsi une discussion qui serait moins historique et plus strictement conceptuelle.

B20|Die Rolle der Computerisierung und Digitalisierung für Beschäftigung und Einkommen|Die Entwicklung der Computer und die darauf aufbauende Digitalisierung haben technologische Veränderungen ausgelöst, die die Anforderungen an und die Nachfrage nach Arbeit, aber auch das Arbeitsangebot in den letzten Dekaden stetig verändert haben. Wie groß die kausalen Effekte dieser Entwicklung auf die Einkommens- und Vermögensverteilung sind, ist in der ökonomischen Literatur bisher weder eindeutig, noch abschließend geklärt. Schwierigkeiten in der Bestimmung dieser Effekte haben sich zunächst aus dem unvollständigen Verständnis ergeben, wie die Computerisierung und die Digitalisierung die Wertschöpfung beeinflusst haben bzw. welchen Beitrag sie leisten. Dies hat zugleich zu der grundsätzlichen Frage geführt, inwiefern der technologische Wandel durch die Computerisierung und Digitalisierung mit traditionellen ökonomischen Modellen, die Arbeit, Kapital und technischen Fortschritt in der Regel als trennbare Faktoren unterscheiden und hierbei feste Relationen bzw. proportionale Effekte unterstellen, erfasst werden kann. Das Verständnis der Bedeutung und Begründung technischen Fortschritts in seinen Wirkungen für Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft ist dabei bereits Gegenstand des wirtschaftswissenschaftlichen Denkens in Wealth of Nations von Adam Smith (1776). Die Formulierung des Produktionsprozesses ausgehend von den zu tätigenden Aufgaben, unabhängig ob diese durch menschliche oder maschinelle Arbeit, durch Handel zugekauft oder an einem beliebigen Ort durchgeführt werden, ist dabei grundlegend im ökonomischen Verständnis verankert. Trotz dieser bereits recht alten Überlegungen haben die Computerisierung und die Digitalisierung dazu geführt, dass der durch sie ausgelöste technische Fortschritt sowie insbesondere die implizierten Folgen für Beschäftigung und Löhne in der aktuellen wirtschaftswissenschaftlichen Literatur nun differenzierter analysiert werden und in den vergangenen zwei Dekaden entsprechende formale Modelle entwickelt worden sind. Mit dem vorliegenden Aufsatz möchte ich eine Einordnung des technischen Fortschritts durch die Computerisierung und Digitalisierung geben. Hierzu will ich kurz auf die Entwicklungsgeschichte des Computerzeitalters eingehen, um Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschiede zu anderen Entwicklungen zu identifizieren. Im Anschluss gebe ich einen Überblick über den Erkenntnisstand zu den Effekten auf Einkommen und Beschäftigung auf Grundlage der verfügbaren Literatur, um die Erklärungen und Begründungen zu diskutieren.
B20|Clower’s Dual-Decision Hypothesis is economics|Though Wu (2017) has shown Clower’s Dual Decision Hypothesis leading to Keynes’ change in saving (and disequilibrium) conclusion, it is important to compare Clower’s budget constraint approach with other models, including those found in Hall’s consumption theorem and similar approach. In Clower, by assuming that, consumers may not satisfy the budget constraint, one cannot automatically assume Hall’s consumption theorem to hold. And, by showing how households need to optimize contingent on the satisfaction of their budget constraint, Clower was, in effect, creating a feedback mechanism.

B20|"Schumpeter vs. Keynes Redux: ""Still Not Dead"""|Diamond (2009) compares the citation time series for Schumpeter and Keynes from 1956 to 2006. Citations to Schumpeter steadily increase throughout the period, whereas citations to Keynes begin to level off and then trend slightly downward beginning in the 1990s. As a result, citations to Schumpeter begin to outstrip those to Keynes. This paper replicates Diamond (2009) and extends the analysis to 2017, which incorporates citations since the onset of the Great Recession. The replication confirms the results in Diamond (2009). The analysis beyond 2006 shows citations to Schumpeter remain larger than to Keynes, but citations to Keynes undergo a resurgence. The paper argues the Great Recession helped renew interest in Keynes. Google Trends data for Schumpeter and Keynes are compared and provide evidence showing the heightened interest in Keynes during the Great Recession. For example, in the United States, the peak of Keynes's search interest occurs in February 2009, five months after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy.

The remaining 5 belong to 3 separate trees. There are 350 men in the graph, and 4 women. Karl Knies is the central-most professor, followed by Wassily Leontief. Harvard is the central-most university, followed by Chicago and Berlin. Most candidates for the Nobel prize belong to the main family tree, but new trees may arise for the students of Terence Gorman and Denis Sargan.
B20|70 years after the German currency and economic reform: The monetary, economic and political order in Europe is disturbed|The currency reform on 20 June 1948, together with a comprehensive liberalisation of prices and the implementation of monopoly control, formed the basis for the West German economic miracle. From then on, the market principles formulated by Walter Eucken und implemented by Ludwig Erhard became the economic backbone of the European integration process. 70 years later, little remains of the basic principles of the German social market economy. An increasingly expansive monetary policy of the European Central Bank undermines market principles, growth and social cohesion in Europe, thereby eroding political stability. To ensure Europe's economic, political and social stability, a return to a stable currency and a marketoriented order is needed.
B20|Increasing Foreign Aid for Inclusive Human Development in Africa|Abstract In the light of evidence that poverty has been decreasing in all regions of the world with the exception of Africa, where about 45% of countries in sub-Saharan Africa did not achieve the Millennium development goal extreme poverty target, this study assesses whether increasing foreign aid improves inclusive human development. The investigation is on 53 African countries for the period 2005–2012. The empirical analysis is based on (1) the generalised method of moments (GMM) to control for persistence in inclusive human development, simultaneity and time-invariant omitted variables and (2) Instrumental Variable Tobit Regressions to control for simultaneity and the limited range in the dependent variable. The adopted foreign aid variables are: ‘humanitarian assistance’, ‘action on debt’ ‘aid for social infrastructure’, ‘aid to the productive sector’, ‘aid to the multi sector’, ‘aid for economic infrastructure’ and ‘programme assistance’. The following findings are established. From the GMM specifications, there are (1) synergy effects from ‘aid to the productive sector’ and a positive net effect from ‘programme assistance’ and (2) negative net impacts from ‘aid to social infrastructure’ and human assistance, albeit with positive marginal effects. From Instrumental Variable Tobit regressions (1) there is a synergy effect from ‘aid for economic infrastructure’ and (2) there are negative net impacts from ‘aid for social infrastructure’, ‘aid to the productive sector’ and human assistance, albeit with positive marginal effects. Policy implications are discussed.
B20|Classifications of innovations: Survey and future directions|The purpose of this paper is to focus on similarity and/or heterogeneity of taxonomies of innovation present in the economic fields to show as the economic literature uses different names to indicate the same type of technical change and innovation, and the same name for different types of innovation. This ambiguity of classification makes it impossible to compare the various studies; moreover the numerous typologies existing in the economics of innovation, technometrics, economics of technical change, management of technology, etc., have hindered the development of knowledge in these fields. The research presents also new directions on the classification of innovation that try to overcome these problems.
B20|Economists, social scientists, and the reconstruction of the world order in interwar britain|The early decades of the 20th century in Europe witnessed a wealth of discussion on the epistemology of the social sciences. Not only were the boundaries between different disciplinary fields being redrawn, but also the nature of scientific knowledge about human and social affairs came under careful scrutiny. One prominent issue in debate was the separation between positive and normative analysis, and the legitimacy of the prescriptive claims often advanced by social scientists. The paper attempts to investigate this process through the lenses of contemporary debates on international politics. During the interwar years, the reconstruction of the world order provided a topic over which social analysts of different backgrounds and persuasions could debate and interact, thus exploring the limits of the knowledge they produced. In England, authors as diverse as Bertrand Russell, Graham Wallas, Harold Laski, Karl Mannheim, John Hobson, and Lionel Robbins were all part of this conversation, which transgressed most disciplinary boundaries. As a pressing issue in the European agenda at the time, however, international politics also made it more difficult to sustain a clear distinction between positive analysis and policy prescription. In the works of Robbins, one can see the topic treated as part of the applied domain of political economy.
B20|Monetary Policy Crisis Management as a Threat to Economic Order|The paper analyses the effects of the monetary policy crisis management of the European Central Bank on the economic order of Germany. It is argued that in post-war Europe the German social market economy as designed by Eucken (1952) and Müller-Armack (1966) has been a core element of growth, welfare, social cohesion and political stability in Germany and Europe as a whole. It is shown that the monetary policy rescue measures of the European Central Bank have undermined the constitutive principles of the German social market economy, which has considerably contributed to the erosion of (productivity) growth and welfare in Germany and Europe. As the outcome is crumbling social cohesion and growing political instability, a timely exit from ultra-expansionary monetary policy is postulated.
B20|The Contestable Marketplace of Ideas: Paul Samuelson’s Defense of Mainstream Economics through Textbook Making, 1967-1976| Historians of economics rarely consider textbooks as more than passive receptacles of previously validated knowledge. Therefore, their active role in shaping the discipline and its image is seldom addressed. In this paper, I study the making of Paul Samuelson’s successive editions of Economics from 1967 to 1976 as an instance of how textbooks stand at the crossroads between disciplinary knowledge, pedagogy and larger political and societal concerns. In the mid-1960s, Economics, now at its sixth edition, was at the height of its success. Considered one cornerstone of modern economics, it was also the center of a number of criticisms dealing with the current state of the economic discipline and its teaching in the universities. While the profession expressed its concern over the lack of relevance of economics to address the pressing issues of the day and pleaded for a new “problem-solving” approach to economic education, the late 1960s witnessed the emergence of a new generation of “radical” economists criticizing the economics orthodoxy. Their contention that mainstream theory had neglected the issues of class struggle and capitalist exploitation, found a favorable echo among an increasingly politicized population. Using archival materials, I show how Samuelson, helped by his editorial team at McGraw-Hill, attempted to take into account these changes in order to ensure the continuing success of subsequent editions of his text in an increasingly competitive market. While this study emphasizes Samuelson’s ambiguous attitude toward his contenders, revealing on the one hand his belief in a free marketplace of ideas and, on the other hand, his attachment to mildly liberal politics and aversion to Marxism, unchanged through revisions, it also shows that the textbook is a collective endeavor, embodying different stakeholders’ views and market forces. Therefore, those who are interested in studying textbooks as a way to retrace the development of economic knowledge should not necessarily postulate authorial intent.
B20|Estimating Rationality in Economics: A History of Statistical Methods in Experimental Economics|"Experimental economists increasingly apply econometric techniques to interpret their data, as suggested the emergence of ""experimetrics"" in the 2000's (Camerer, 2003; Houser, 2008; Moffatt, 2015). Yet statistics remains a minor topic in experimental economics' (EE) methodology. This article aims to study the historical roots of this present paradox. To do so, we analyze the use of statistical tools in EE from early economics experiments of the 1940's-1950's to the present days. Our narrative is based on qualitative analysis of published papers for the earliest periods and on bibliometric and quantitative approaches for the more recent time period. Our results reveal a significant change in EE' statistical methods, from purely descriptive methods to more sophisticated and standardized techniques. Statistics now plays a decisive role in the way EE estimates rationality, particularly in structural modeling approaches, but it is still considered as a non-methodological, because purely technical, matter. Our historical analysis shows that this technical conception was the result of a long-run evolution of research tactics in EE, that notably allowed experimental economists to escape from psychologist's more re exive culture toward statistics."
B20|Replication in Experimental Economics: A Historical and Quantitative Approach Focused on Public Good Game Experiments|"We propose a historical perspective on replication in experimental economics focused on public good games. Our intended contribution is twofold: in terms of method and in terms of object. Methodologically, we blend traditional qualitative history of economics with a less traditional quantitative approach using basic econometric tools to detect unnoticed historical patterns of replication. In terms of our object, we highlight a type of replication that we call ""baseline replication"", which is not present in explicit methodological discussions, yet central in the specificity of experimental economics regarding replication in economics."
B20|Edmond Malinvaud and the Problem of Statistical Induction|"In this article we follow, over his long career, the evolution of the reflections of Edmond Malinvaud on economic ?science? and its relationship with the ?problem? of statistical induction. To do so we largely rely on his own words by quoting his many articles addressing these issues. We consider in turn his views on statistical methods and structural econometrics, on apriorism versus empiricism, the Koopmans-Vining controversy on measurement with or without theory, econometric methods and the challenge of modelling, the Popperian temptation of a falsifiable economic science, the uneasy alliance between induction and expertise, understanding and advising. We conclude with Malinvaud's views on eclecticism, which he deems to be the only position able to meet, despite its rapid progress, the ""advisory imperative"" characterizing economics."
B20|The Role of Agents’ Propensity toward Conformity and Independence in the Process of Institutional Change|This paper analyses institutional change and Veblen’s work (1907, 1914, 1919) under the perspective of cognitive economics. Particularly it focuses on two interesting issues of Veblen’s theory of economic change: 1. in Veblen’s view habits are both mental habits and behavioral habits and they play a twofold role in economic change because they are particularly relevant both as elements of propensity, and as forces resisting to change. 2 Veblen gives an exhaustive definition of instincts and habits but he does not completely explain the cognitive processes that bring changes and evolution in social habits. He develops an economic theory at the base of which there is an evolutionary view of reality and a deep awareness of the role of the human mind within the decision-making processes of choice. This paper is aimed at analyzing both issues using the interpretive tools offered by psychology and discussing the role of agents psychological propensity toward conformity and independence in explaining institutional change. The central idea is that if we better encompass the theory of conformity and independence developed in psychology (starting from Asch, 1952) in the analysis of economic institutions, we can better explain institutional change. Conformity is the effect of the pressure of social group on agents’ behavior. That concept contributes to explain resistance to change. On the other hand, psychology shows that agents are also subject to mechanisms of independence. These are key elements in explaining behavioral change. The analysis of Veblen’s instinct-habit concept under conformity-independence perspective shows interesting connections between Veblen and Hayek’s ideas of economic change. Hayek’s concept of evolution based on psychological and neurobiological aspect, in fact, is a contribution of great significance both in explaining the dual role of habits in institutional change and in understanding individual mechanisms that bring changes in social habits.
B20|Understanding Social Market Economy, Francesco Forte and His Interpretation|Abstract The social thought which emerges from Francesco Forte’s economic writings proves to be mainly inspired by methodological individualism, though interpreted through a peculiar “personalistic” key. We will analyze the peculiar traits of his thought and the specific contribution that Forte gave to the understanding of a specific economic theory based on the doctrine of “Ordoliberalism” or the “Freiburg School.” In our work, we will show how Forte proposes an interpretation of that doctrine, according to two of his main points of reference in economic and philosophical thought: Luigi Einaudi and Antonio Rosmini Serbati. Finally, we will present an important aspect of Forte’s work: his institutional analysis in the light of the particular civil philosophy expressed by Christian social teaching.
B20|The Neoclassicals' Conundrum: If Adam Smith Is the Father of Economics, It Is a Bastard Child|Neoclassical economists of the current era frequently pay lip service to Adam Smith's theories to certify the validity of natural-laws-based, laissez-faire policies. However, neoclassical theories are fundamentally disconnected from Adam Smith's notion of value, his understanding of the economic individual and their interactions in society, his methodology, and the field of study he afforded to political economy. Instead, early neoclassical economists parted ways with the theories of Adam Smith in an effort to construct economic laws that would validate the existing capitalist order as universal, natural, and harmonious.
B20|Financial Supervision in Hungary between the Two World Wars|This paper examines the practice of financial supervision in Hungary between the two World Wars, focusing on the period of the Great Depression and the supervisory practice that was employed prior to the crisis and that was transformed as a result. The author would like to establish how the role of the Pénzintézeti Központ as a supervisory body changed after its establishment on 1 June 1916, whether there were other institutions with functions related to the supervisory tasks, and which supervisory tools were used in Hungary during the Great Depression. The paper endeavours to present the contemporary economic conditions and the situation of the financial architecture primarily in line with contemporary thinking, on the basis of the relevant opinions of the experts from the given era.
B20|Against Samuelson’s Whig Interpretation of History of Economic Analysis and its Current Legitimation|The paper presents a negative view with respect to Paul Samuelson’s whig interpretation of history of economic analysis – to what he reduces historiography of economics, and actually against its current legitimation, seen in Medema and Waterman (2010) and Medema and Waterman, eds. (2014). The analysis is focused on the unity of Samuelson’s whig historical and theoretical approaches. The attention is drawn to a series of original methodological and theoretical views in his influential publications, identifying his position, which (views) as a matter of fact disprove his claim for ‘better’ whig interpretation of history of economic science. It is pointed out that it is not a mere idiosyncrasy of Samuelson’s contribution amongst the figures of post-World War II economics; it is an expression of the general tendency in mainstream economics to embody in its theory the whig historical approach.
B20|Agent-based modelling. History, essence, future|The currently fashionable modelling tool agent-based simulation is characterized. The first part concerns the past. It presents a selection of the major intellectual roots from which this new tool emerged. It is important for social scientists, in particular for economists, to see that two relevant impacts came from neighbouring disciplines: biology and network theory. The second part concerns the present of ABM. It aims at highlighting the essential features which are characteristic for an agent-based model. Since there are currently several different opinions on this topic, the one presented here also includes some more epistemologically oriented ideas to support its plausibility. In particular the notion of emergence is scrutinized and extended. This part ends with a short recipe stating how to build an agent-based model. In the last part some ideas on the future of agent based modelling are presented. This part follows the sequence of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. The syntactic challenges, like operators for pattern recognition, will be meat by a continuing variety of software packages and programming languages tailored to support ABM. The semantic aspect of future agent-based modelling hinges on the close relationship between the tool ABM and its object of investigation, e.g. evolutionary political economy. The need to model institutional change or communication processes will imply adaptive evolution of ABM. The pragmatics of future agent-based modelling are finally characterized as the most demanding – but also as the most influential – element that the new tool will bring about.
B20|Bringing Institutions into Economics when Teaching Economics as a Minor Subject|Developments in economic policy since the 1980s have shown a general trend towards a single type of institutional arrangement, following short-term, immediately applicable efficiency criteria. This was supported through the teaching by putting particular weight on the corresponding analytical instruments. The thesis presented here observes a systematic bias in this. It does so by evaluating institutional trends in the various sectors of the economy, and by discussing institutional arrangements of selected areas in detail. Furthermore, it reviews contributions by representatives of New Institutional Economics for a more comprehensive approach. Based on this, institutions themselves are conceptualised as public or club goods. As such they are applied to the policy areas selected. It can thereby be shown that microeconomic theory can find an appropriate place in this extended economic approach, along with concepts like common-pool resource management. In conclusion, this thesis proposes giving considerably more space to institutions in economics curricula, to their evolution and implications for economic outcomes. Particularly for economics as a minor subject, more emphasis should be placed on institutional arrangements.
B20|Three decades of publishing research in population economics|Abstract The Journal of Population Economics is celebrating its 30th birthday. When the first issue was published, population economics was non-existent as a field. Hence, the aim has been to provide a high-quality outlet to publishing excellent theoretical and applied research in all areas of population economics. The article summarizes key developments in the Journal’s editorial process, thematic orientation, international reach, and successes. Furthermore, we discuss the benefits of working papers in economics and investigate the impacts of the current working paper culture on journal citations. Finally, we try to identify the citation impacts in the Journal itself. The Journal of Population Economics has established itself as the leader in its field. Publishing in working papers and in the Journal seem to be complementary activities.
B20|Complexity and Economic Policy: A Paradigm Shift or a Change in Perspective? A Review Essay on David Colander and Roland Kupers's Complexity and the Art of Public Policy|"In their recent book, Colander and Kupers (2014) argue that viewing the economy as a complex adaptive system should change the way in which we make economic policy. This would necessitate a paradigm shift. Economics has, over time, tried to produce a coherent model to underpin the dominant laissez-faire liberal approach. But we have never proved, in that model, that left to their own devices, the participants in an economy will self-organize into a satisfactory state. This is an assumption. Complex interactive systems with direct interaction between heterogeneous agents may show no tendency to self-equilibrate and will undergo endogenous crises. Economists should concentrate on the emergence of certain patterns. Colander and Kupers suggest that we may be able to nudge the system into ""good"" basins of attraction. A more radical view is that there are no fixed basins of attraction; these change with the evolution of the system and it is illusory to believe that we can choose good basins. We may be able to recognize and influence the emergence of certain states of the economy, but we are far from Leon Walras's dream of economics as a science like astrophysics."
B20|Unjust Enrichment from Official Corruption in Africa: Theory and Model on how Lenders have benefited|A 2015 World Bank report on the achievement of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) revealed that since the 1990s, extreme poverty has been decreasing in all regions of the world with the exception of Africa where about 50 percent of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa did not achieve the MDG extreme poverty target despite the sub-region enjoying more than two decades of GDP growth resurgence. The purpose of this chapter is twofold. First to understand the interconnections between the large pool of capital transferred to the OECD countries and the corrupt deposits of stolen public funds. Second, to illustrate how such diversion of funds overseas are related to the spread of poverty in the African economies. We enunciate a ‘poverty multiplier theory’ and propose a model for its application within an African context. The ‘poverty multiplier theory’ postulates that: (i) one unit of currency deposited abroad represents a loss in financial development at home (ii) a fraction of the unit currency placed in foreign bank accounts is redirected to the domestic economy in the form of external debt. This external debt is further siphoned overseas through interest and loan principal repayment. Policy implications of these processes are discussed.
B20|Rational Asymmetric Development, Piketty and Poverty in Africa|An April 2015 World Bank report on the Millennium Development Goal poverty target has revealed that extreme poverty has been decreasing in all regions of the world with the exception of Africa. This study extends the implications of Thomas Piketty’s celebrated literature from developed countries to the nexus between developed nations and African countries by building on responses from Rogoff (2014) and Stiglitz (2014), post Washington Consensus paradigms and underpinnings from SolowSwan and Boyce-Fofack-Ndikumana. The central argument presented is that the inequality problem is at the heart of rational asymmetric development between rich and poor countries. Piketty has shown that inequality increases when the return on capital is higher than the growth rate, because the poor cannot catch-up with the rich. We argue that when the return on political economy (or capitalismfuelled illicit capital flight) is higher than the growth rate in African countries, inequality in development increases and Africa may not catch-up with the developed world. As an ideal solution, Piketty has proposed progressive income taxation based on automatic exchange of bank information. The ideal analogy proposed in tackling the spirit of African poverty is a comprehensive commitment to fighting illicit capital flight based on this. Hence, contrary to theoretical underpinnings of exogenous growth models, catch-up may not be so apparent. Implications for the corresponding upward bias in endogenous development and catch-up literature are discussed.
B20|Creating academic economics in Brazil: the Ford Foundation and the beginnings of ANPEC|The 1960s saw the beginning of an effort to improve professional standards in Brazilian academia through cooperation with a few North American institutions, in the context of an important and controversial set of agreements between the Brazilian Ministry of Education (MEC) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In the case of economics, the Ford Foundation was especially relevant, providing substantial funding for the creation of the first graduate programs in the field in Brazil. An important moment in this process took place in 1973 with the creation of ANPEC, an association of graduate programs in economics whose purpose was to organize and stimulate institutional interaction among its members. ANPEC is still today the most important association for academic economics in Brazil, exercising leadership through both its annual meetings and a national unified exam for admission in graduate programs in the field. The paper explores archival material from the period 1964-74 held at the Ford Foundation, which illuminates both the interaction between representatives of the Foundation and of different Brazilian academic institutions, and the strategy pursued by the former in order to develop the economics profession in the country. We thus seek to contribute to a better understanding of the conflicting motivations that lay behind the creation of ANPEC, and of the effects that the association would have on the emerging graduate programs in Brazil.
B20|Funding Policy Research Under “Distasteful Regimes”: the Ford Foundation and the Social Sciences at the University of Brasília|The Ford Foundation’s initial effort to assist in the development of the social sciences in Brazil coincided with the early years of the military regime that ruled the country between 1964 and 1985. Given the Foundation’s expressed goal of fostering research that was of potential relevance for public policy, the Brazilian political context posed a difficult dilemma. The issue came to the forefront amid discussions over a proposal for the creation of a Master’s Program in Economics at the University of Brasília (UnB). Although UnB’s modern institutional structure was ideally suited for the Foundation’s purposes, the university had been subject to repeated military interventions in late 1960’s. Moreover, its geographical closeness to the seat of Brazilian political power arose concerns that it could become an instrument in the hands of the military government. Using evidence from the Ford Foundation archives, the paper attempts to illuminate the institutional context surrounding the development of academic economics in Brazil in the late 1960s and early 1970s, in its relations to the deeper social and political currents in effect at the time.
B20|Reinventing Foreign Aid For Inclusive And Sustainable Development: Kuznets, Piketty And The Great Policy Reversal|This survey essay reviews over 200 papers in arguing that in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive development, foreign aid should not orient developing countries towards industrialisation in the perspective of Kuznets but in the view of Piketty. Abandoning the former’s view that inequality will fall with progress in industrialisation and placing more emphasis on inequality in foreign aid policy will lead to more sustainable development outcomes. Inter alia: mitigate short-term poverty; address concerns of burgeoning population growth; train recipient governments on inclusive development; fight corruption and mismanagement and; avoid the shortfalls of celebrated Kuznets’ conjectures. We discuss how the essay addresses post-2015 development challenges and provide foreign aid policy instruments with which discussed objectives can be achieved. In summary, the essay provides useful policy measures to avoid past pitfalls. ‘Output may be growing, and yet the mass of the people may be becoming poorer’ (Lewis, 1955). ‘Lewis led all developing countries to water, proverbially speaking, some African countries have so far chosen not to drink’ (Amavilah, 2014). Piketty (2014) has led all developing countries to the stream again and a challenging policy syndrome of our time is how foreign aid can help them to drink.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B20|Joseph A. Schumpeter: Ein Pionier der Makrofinanz|Since the outbreak of the Great Financial Crisis in 2007, „Macrofinance“ has evolved as an exciting field for economists. The idea of marrying macroeconomics and financial economics has a long tradition, however, which should not remain buried in almost forgotten books. A couple of seemingly new ideas can be traced back to the work of the eminent economist Joseph A. Schumpeter. His dynamic model of the business cycle is built upon a close interaction between entrepreneurs and banks. Fire-sales of assets, liquidity spirals and feedback loops can turn a mild recession into a devastating depression. Schumpeter’s analysis of the role of monetary policy bears a striking resemblance to contemporary discussions.
B20|The economist quae political economist: Lionel Robbins and the economic adivisory council|This paper assesses Robbins's participation in the Economic Advisory Council in 1930, drawing mostly on The Lionel Robbins Papers held atthe LSE. The divergences between him and Keynes are highlighted and an attempt is made to shed some light on Robbins' overarching interest on the interplay of economics as a science and political economy as a broader field that includes normative considerations. This renders invalid criticisms related to the absence of ethical considerations in Robbins' approach to economics. Specifically, some elements that would resurface in Robbins' later works are identified, and it is argued that the Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science should be situated within his larger purpose of illuminating the extent to which the science of economics could serve as an important tool – necessary, though not sufficient –to orient the formulation of public policies.
B20|Lionel Robbins’ first-step individualism and the prehistory of microfoundations|Robbins belongs to the prehistory of microfoundations, for his definition of economics helped to buttress the centrality that individual choice acquired after the Second World War. This, however, was an unintended effect of his seminal Essay. Our claim is that, underlying his definition of economics, a novel approach to methodological individualism is advanced, in which the isolated individual plays the role of a temporary device. The economic man is but a first step in order to analyze more complex social phenomena. More specifically, three types of methodological individualism are outlined and it is argued that Robbins’ approach cannot be classified as any of them; we thus propose a different category, that of ‘first-step individualism’. Robbins’ rationale for focusing on the isolated individual is not that social phenomena can be reduced to individual behaviour, but rather that this is the best starting point for economics, if it is to progress and be able to deal with more complex phenomena in the future.
B20|The issue of economic crises and cyclical fluctuations in Polish economic thought in the interwar period|This paper presents the considerations of Polish economists about the economic crises and the business cycle in the interwar period. According to E. Taylor, the causes of the then crisis of overproduction, accompanied by the phenomenon of price scissors, included varied elasticity of demand for agricultural products and industrial products, as well as monetary inflation and new technical inventions. E. Lipinski believed that the crisis was a result of overinvestment. State interventionism in the economies did not ease, but aggravated the crisis on a global scale. W.M. Zawadzki pointed to the nature of the crisis in Poland as being due to economic underdevelopment, low consumption, and a huge shortage of capital. J.W. Libicki took the view that an analysis of the crisis in agriculture should be combined with an analysis of profitability of agricultural production. A. Krzyzanowski linked production fluctuations with changes in investment demand, and the latter with the assessment of profitability, which depends on the interest rate. A. Heydel explained the business cycle with an incorrect interest rate policy. At the same time, he postulated that the state should refrain from interference in economic life. On the other hand, M. Kalecki pointed to the excessive optimism of businesses, causing an increase in investment, which leads to changes in global demand, as a cause of fluctuations. He advocated the inflationary financing of public works by the state.
B20|The Rise of a Mainstream in Economics|Our paper contends that the existence of mainstream economics ought to be understood as a particular case of the now widespread certification phenomenon, which defines good practices on the grounds of a compliance with well-defined standards. Basing our analysis on Leijonhufvud’s vision of the construction of economic theory, we document the fragmentation process which economics has undergone from the marginalist revolution to the present. Studying the evolution of five sub-branches of economics, we show how at the end of the 1970s loose standards for good research practices were replaced by narrower ones in each of them. We claim that this change and the emergence of a mainstream were two faces of the same process.
B20|Structural liquidity: The money-industry nexus|This paper addresses the relationship between liquidity and production activity. It argues that this relationship becomes fully evident only if one considers intermediate levels of aggregation, and in particular stages of production within each industrial sector and their interdependence across sectors. To illustrate this, the paper introduces the concept of structural liquidity, which denotes material funds that are endogenously formed within the productive system before one considers the provision of liquidity by means of money. Structural liquidity is analyzed by combining (i) the representation of the productive system as an arrangement of fabrication stages sequentially related in time; and (ii) the representation of the productive system as a set of interdependent industrial sectors. The analysis identifies the structural liquidity problem as the need to satisfy both a viability condition (deriving from sectoral interdependencies) and a full employment condition (deriving from the sequencing of fabrication stages). The analysis highlights previously unexplored trade-offs, which have wide-ranging implications for monetary and liquidity policy.
B20|Policies to overcome stagnation: the crisis, and the possible futures, of all things euro|This article argues that the Europe's continuing economic underperformance, particularly in the eurozone, is neither a function of insufficient information (policymakers do not know the right policies) nor ideology (policymakers are unable to recognize the right policies due to ideological priors). Rather, this article places the continuation of policies that cause stagnation in a longer historical context. Building upon the insights of Kalecki (1943) regarding the political limits of full employment policies, it is argued that the shift from a regime that generated inflation, low profitability, and a high degree of equality to one that generates deflation, high profitability, and inequality has hamstrung the ability of policymakers to respond positively to the situation at hand. This has generated structural pressures for political realignment across cases that compound the economic problems of stagnation while exacerbating tensions between different European â€˜Varieties of Capitalism.â€™ The result is a set of â€˜second-bestâ€™ strategies that lead to second-best outcomes in both politics and economics that further stress the already stressed economies and polities of Europe.

B20|Business cycles and growth|Volume III contains entries on the development of major fields in economics from the inception of systematic analysis until modern times. The reader is provided with succinct summary accounts of the main problems, the methods used to address them and the results obtained across time. The emphasis is on both the continuity and the major changes that have occurred in the economic analysis of problematic issues such as economic growth, income distribution, employment, inflation, business cycles and financial instability. Each Handbook can be read individually and acts as a self-contained volume in its own right. It can be purchased separately or as part of a three-volume set.
B20|Keynesian Spiritus Animales Approach and the Transformation of the Capitalist System|Economic crises have radical consequences. They are major challenges for national and international social policy. The crises are also the cause of reform and of re-definition of theories. The Keynesian approach also emerged from an economic crisis and it has reformed the capitalist system. However, the Keynesian theory itself now needs to be reformed. This paper aims to bring light into the Keynesian theory and the transformation process of capital system. Finally, as lessons for the future two conclusions arise: Firstly, policy makers shall continue to have the assumption that economic crises do not have a simple and permanent solution, which is valid at any time. Secondly, it needs not only traditional economic policies, but especially institutional reforms and new innovative perspectives. In this respect, the Keynesian definition “animal spirit of capitalism” can be useful in predicting the next policy of the liberal economy in the age of globalism.
B20|Race, Capitalism, and Power: The Economic Thought of the Young Jesse Jackson|Fifty years ago, Jesse Jackson joined the S.C.L.C. and rose rapidly to become one of this country’s major advocates of black capitalism. Far less well known is his interest in finance and credit for African Americans that suggests his prescience about the decline of industrial capitalism. Focusing on Jackson’s early civil rights activity in Chicago, this paper charts the initial stages through which Martin Luther King’s young pupil rapidly became a staunch supporter of black economic power, strongly committed to a wealth-transfer agenda, while most of the other civil rights and labor leaders showed more interest in a just distribution of income. Abandoning the stereotypical image of Jackson in his early years, an image limiting him to an ambitious activist interested in bargains and with little inclination for analysis of the economic reality of his times, this paper addresses Jackson’s forward way of thinking. His growing expertise in money and finance made him one of the few civil rights leaders who genuinely grasped the functioning of the post-industrial economy and constituted the true wellspring of his later pan-Africanism and economic policies.
B20|Measurement without theory and theory without measurement. A personal account|The purpose of this paper is to show that theory and practice are mutually supportive to reach meaningful, balanced and successful results. More often than not theory workers and practice worker are in stiff competition for resources and recognition. This very common human process is from a higher perspective unfruitful and creates bitterness among employees, business people and the like. This phenomenon also exists very prominently in academic circles. My own work and academic experience will serve as a “proof” that the fruitful interplay with theory and practice leads to very good results.
B20|Economic theory in IMEMO|(The Soviet period) The article deals with the history of economic research at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This history is analyzed in the context of the Soviet and world economic science. The specific nature of Soviet economic theory is characterized as well as a special position of IMEMO, in its function of the leading think-tank in the field of world economy and international relations. Two main directions of theoretical work of IMEMO economists are identified: transition from the facts and statistical data towards a revision of dogmatic Marxism, and from Western theories to original ideas and practical recommendations. The connection of the theory and applied expertise is given a special attention.
B20|State-owned enterprises in the Russian market: Ownership structure and their role in the economy|This article analyzes the ownership structure of state-owned companies and their role in the Russian economy. Using a sample of 114 of the largest Russian companies, we estimated direct and indirect state participation as a percentage of shareholdings for direct and indirect federal property during the time period of 2006–2014. We used two methods to estimate the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which allowed us to compare our results with OECD and Rosstat statistics for a broader sample of Russian companies owned by the public sector. This study revealed a decline in SOEs’ share in the capitalization of the Russian stock market and a slight increase in their share of total revenues and employment. The results indicated that public SOEs demonstrated significantly higher productivity compared to non-public SOEs and private companies had a distinct advantage in productivity compared with public SOEs. Despite the significant advantages in productivity of private companies over the SOEs, over a 9-year period, we observed that this gap narrowed. This may be due to conditions of high financial volatility and stagnation of the economy that result in certain advantages for SOEs in terms of access to sources of long-term funding and other forms of state support. However, SOEs with indirect state control experienced a rapid growth in revenue and productivity compared to other firms. This may indicate the presence of a specific stock selection mechanism for transferring more effective SOEs from direct state ownership to indirect control as an alternative to privatization.
B20|State-owned enterprises in the Russian market: Ownership structure and their role in the economy|This article analyzes the ownership structure of companies with state participation and their role in the Russian economy. Using a sample of 114 largest companies we have estimated direct and indirect state participation as percentage of shareholdings which are in direct and indirect federal property in 2006—2014. We have used two methods for estimating the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which allowed us to compare our results with those of OECD and Rosstat statistics for the broader sample of Russian companies in the public sector. This article reveals the decline of SOEs’ share in the capitalization of the Russian stock market as well as a slight increase of their share in total revenue and employment. The results show that public SOEs, demonstrate significantly higher productivity compared to non-public SOEs and private companies have a distinct advantage in productivity compared with public SOEs. Despite the significant advantages in productivity of private companies over the SOEs, over 9-year period we observed a reduction of this gap. This may be due to the fact that in conditions of high financial volatility and stagnation of the economy SOEs had certain advantages in terms of access to sources of long-term funding and other forms of state support. However, SOEs with indirect state control had a rapid growth in revenue and productivity in comparison with the rest of them. This may indicate the presence of a specific stock selection mechanism for transferring more effective SOEs from direct state ownership to indirect control as an alternative to privatization.
B20|Foreign Aid Fiscal Policy: Theory and Evidence|The paper provides theoretical and empirical justifications for the instrumentality of foreign aid in stimulating private investment and fixed capital formation through fiscal policy mechanisms. We propose an endogenous growth theory based on an extension of Barro (1990) by postulating that the positive effect of aid mitigates the burden of the taxation system on the private sector of recipient countries. The empirical validity is based on data from 53 African countries for the period 1996–2010. While the findings on the tax effort channel are overwhelmingly consistent with theory across specifications and fundamental characteristics, those of the ‘government expenditure’ channel are a little heterogeneous but broadly in line with the theoretical postulations. Justification for the slight heterogeneity and policy implications are discussed.
B20|From realism to instrumentalism - and back? Methodological implications of changes in the epistemology of economics|We identify epistemological shifts in economics throughout the 20th century and discuss their methodological implications. After the realist research program of the Cowles commission and Lucas' rational expectations approach, several economists became dissatisfied with economic theory and initiated a shift towards instrumentalism. Recently, this movement has come under critique and a return to a realist epistemology focusing on identifying economic mechanisms is suggested. Such epistemological changes have important practical implications: they affect the discrimination among competing explanations and determine which research methods are accepted. We illustrate this by studying epistemological and methodological changes in development economics throughout the last century.
B20|Beyond the distinction between necessaries and luxuries|The distinction made by the classical economists between necessaries and luxuries is weakened by two problems: how to draw the line between necessaries and luxuries in advanced modern economies; how to evaluate luxuries, whether positively for individual’s freedom and for the economy, or negatively because they appear unethical. This paper examines a possible way out of these problems that emerges both from Scitovsky’s approach to “human welfare” and from some overlooked insights of Marshall, Hawtrey, and Keynes, the Cambridge economists who inspired Scitovsky. The proposal is to split luxuries into two components, and to redefine them, together with necessaries, on the basis of people’s motivations and goals, as well as of the effects on well-being and on the economy.
B20|Unjust Enrichment from Official Corruption in Africa: Theory and Model on how Lenders have benefited|A 2015 World Bank report on the achievement of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) revealed that since the 1990s, extreme poverty has been decreasing in all regions of the world with the exception of Africa where about 50 percent of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa did not achieve the MDG extreme poverty target despite the sub-region enjoying more than two decades of GDP growth resurgence. The purpose of this chapter is twofold. First to understand the interconnections between the large pool of capital transferred to the OECD countries and the corrupt deposits of stolen public funds. Second, to illustrate how such diversion of funds overseas are related to the spread of poverty in the African economies. We enunciate a ‘poverty multiplier theory’ and propose a model for its application within an African context. The ‘poverty multiplier theory’ postulates that: (i) one unit of currency deposited abroad represents a loss in financial development at home (ii) a fraction of the unit currency placed in foreign bank accounts is redirected to the domestic economy in the form of external debt. This external debt is further siphoned overseas through interest and loan principal repayment. Policy implications of these processes are discussed.
B20|Aid and Human Development: Is There A Role for Good Policy Environment?|This paper examines the role that official development assistance (ODA) plays in achieving human development outcomes in the presence of good policy environments. Using data from 96 low and middle-income countries for the period 1996-2014, the paper develops and tests static and dynamic panel data models controlling for potential endogeneity of aid and human development. In exploring the impacts of aid, indicators of economic, political and institutional governance were taken into account. With moderate differences across countries, results suggest that foreign aid is positively and significantly linked with, and hence facilitates, human development indicators. Also, the governance indicators influence human development. So, providing more aid is justified if better economic, political and institutional governance in the recipient countries can be ensured.
B20|Some Challenges for Regional Science Research|Regional scientists have long faced challenges in developing the interdisciplinary field where their focus is on the spatial context of social, economic and environmental phenomena, and dealing with spatial data presents considerable methodological challenges. This article discusses the evolution of Regional Science, the critiques it has received and the challenges it has confronted. It addresses specifically some contemporary challenges that relate to methodological issues, such as: how to measure and model endogenous regional growth performance; the limitations of using de jure regions rather than functional regions as the spatial framework in regional analysis; the need to making greater use of unit record data and integrating those data into generalised spatial frameworks; and making use of the opportunities offered by «big data» in urban and regional analysis.
B20|Paul Samuelson on His 90th Birthday|Editorâ€™s Introduction Originally published in Volume 51, Number 2, Fall 2007, page 39 . John Kenneth Galbraith (1908-2006) was one of the leading voices of American liberalism during the latter half of the twentieth century. Even though Professor Galbraith served on the economics faculty of Harvard University for fifty years, he is remembered today more for his role as a public intellectual and policy advisor to presidents than for his academic contributions to economic theory. Intensely interested in public policy, Professor Galbraith served several presidential administrations, including time as Ambassador to India under John F. Kennedy. During his lengthy career, he authored numerous bestselling books, including the influential The Affluent Society in 1958 and, The New Industrial State in 1967. In this short paper published posthumously, Professor Galbraith celebrates the 90 th birthday of another prominent economist of his generation, Paul Samuelson. Professor Galbraith outlines his views on Samuelsonâ€™s impact on the profession and posterity.
B20|Is neoliberalism consistent with individual liberty? Friedman, Hayek and Rand on education employment and equality|In their writings, Milton Friedman, Friedrich August von Hayek and Ayn Rand have been instrumental in shaping and influencing neoliberalism through their academic and literary abilities. Their opinions on education, employment and inequality have stirred up considerable controversy and have been the focus of many debates. This paper adds to the debate by suggesting that there is an internal inconsistency in the views of neoliberalism as reflected by Friedman, Hayek and Rand. The paper contends that whereas their neoliberal theories promote liberty, the manner in which they conceptualize this term promotes policies that would actually deny the individual freedom of the majority while securing liberty and financial success for the privileged few. The paper focuses on the consequences of neoliberalism on education, and also discusses how it affects employment, inequality and democracy.
B20|Industrial policy and exchange rate skepticism|The aim of the present paper is to put in historical perspective the development thinking on the relationship between industrial and exchange rate policies. The first section focuses on the thought of the so-called pioneers of development economics, specifically their preference for protectionism and their belated recognition that an exchange-rate policy could act as a substitute to it. In the second one, we analyze the exchange rate skepticism that arises out of the theories that identify a foreign constraint to growth, in addition to the one revealed by the pioneers. The third section briefly complements the previous discussion with reference to macroeconomic formulations that allow for short-run contractionary effects of a devaluation, reinforcing the skepticism in question. In the fourth section, we discuss the revival of development thinking in the 1980s and its discussion about East Asian trajectories, a literature that placed great emphasis on industrial policy. Finally, in the fifth section we discuss the new historical facts and the new development macroeconomics’ models that are putting an end to exchange rate skepticism.
B20|Foreign aid and governance in Africa| This paper investigates the effect of foreign aid on governance in order to extend the debate on foreign aid and to verify common positions from Moyo’s ‘Dead Aid’, Collier’s ‘Bottom Billion’ and Eubank’s ‘Somaliland’. The empirical evidence is based on updated data from 52 African countries for the period 1996--2010. An endogeneity robust instrumental variable Two-Stage-Least Squares empirical strategy is employed. The findings reveal that development assistance deteriorates economic (regulation quality and government effectiveness) and institutional (corruption-control and rule of law) governance, but has an insignificant effect on political (political stability, voice and accountability) governance. While, these findings are broadly in accordance with Moyo and Collier on weak governance, they neither confirm the Eubank position on political governance nor the Asongu stance on the aid-corruption nexus in a debate with Okada and Samreth. The use of foreign aid as an instrument to influence the election and replacement of political leaders in Africa may have insignificant results. It is time to solve the second tragedy of foreign aid and that economists and policy makers start rethinking the models and theories on which foreign aid is used to influence economic, institutional and political governance in recipient countries.

B20|Development of heterodox economics at public German universities since the 1970s|This article discusses the development of 'heterodox' economics at universities in Germany since the 1970s. Based on Lakatos' concept of scientific research programmes (SRP), the article introduces a classification of economics in order to clarify the understanding of variety within economics, especially in the case of Germany. Based on this classification and taking into account the different kinds of capital (economic, social and symbolic) available to heterodox economists, this article aims to show how heterodox economics in Germany has developed from the early 1970s until the present day. It will be shown that the heterodox schools expanded in the 1970s, but marginalisation took hold again by the 1980s and ultimately left German heterodox economics in a state of near-extinction today. From this, it follows that the history of heterodoxy in Germany is an unequal 'battle of the paradigms', and can only be told as the story of a failure.
B20|Revisiting Samuelson's Foundations of Economic Analysis|Paul Samuelson's Foundations of Economic Analysis played a major role in defining how economic theory was undertaken for many years after the Second World War. This paper fills out Samuelson's account of the book's origins and corrects some details, making clear his debt to E. B. Wilson and establishes that turning the thesis into a book was a long process. The contents of the book and its reception are then reviewed. (JEL A22, B20, B31)
B20|Rational Asymmetric Development, Piketty and the Spirit of Poverty in Africa|The study extends the implications of Piketty’s celebrated literature from developed countries to the nexus between developed nations and African countries by building on responses from Rogoff (2014) & Stiglitz (2014), post Washington Consensus paradigms and underpinnings from Solow-Swan & Boyce-Fofack-Ndikumana. The central argument presented is that the inequality problem is at the heart of rational asymmetric development between rich and poor countries. Piketty has shown that inequality increases when the return of capital is higher than the growth rate, because the poor cannot catch-up with the rich. We argue that, when the return of political economy (or capitalism-fuelled illicit capital flight) is higher than the growth rate in African countries, inequality in development increases and African may not catch-up with the developed world. As an ideal solution, Piketty has proposed progressive income taxation based on automatic exchange of bank information. The ideal analogy proposed in tackling the spirit of African poverty is a holistic commitment to fighting illicit capital flight based on automatic exchange of bank information. Hence, contrary to theoretical underpinnings of exogenous growth models, catch-up may not be so apparent. Implications for the corresponding upward bias in endogenous development and catch-up literature are discussed.
B20|On the dynamic effects of foreign aid on corruption|We assemble more pieces on the puzzle of the aid-corruption nexus. In essence, we extend the debate on the effect of foreign aid on corruption by providing evidence on dynamic effects of wealth, legal origin, religious-domination, regional proximity, openness to sea, natural resources and politico-economic stability. The empirical evidence from dynamic panel GMM estimation is based on 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. The findings show that the positive effect of foreign aid on corruption is most significant in: Middle-income, French civil-law, Christian-dominated, non-oil exporting and landlocked countries. Moreover, there is also some scanty evidence of foreign aid increasing corruption-control in Lower Middle income and Not-landlocked countries. Justifications for the dynamics are discussed.
B20|Foreign Aid and Inclusive Development: Updated Evidence from Africa, 2005–2012|Motivated by the April 2015 World Bank Publication on MDGs which reveals that poverty has been declining in all regions of the world with the exception of African countries, this study investigates the effects of a plethora of foreign aid dynamics on inequality adjusted human development. Contemporary and non-contemporary OLS, Fixed-effects and a system GMM technique with forward orthogonal deviations are employed. The empirical evidence is based on an updated sample of 53 African countries for the period 2005-2012.The following findings are established. First, the impacts of aid dynamics with high degrees of substitution are positive. These include aid for: social infrastructure, economic infrastructure, the productive sector and multi-sectors. Second, the effect of humanitarian assistance is consistently negative across specifications and models. Third, the effects of programme assistance and action on debt are ambiguous because they become positive with the GMM technique. Justifications for these changes and clarifications with respect to existing literature are provided. Policy implications are discussed in the light of the post-2015 development agenda. We also provide some recommendations for a rethinking of theories and models on which development assistance is based.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B20|Does New Zealand Economics Have a Useful Past? The Example of Trade Policy and Economic Development|We examine the history of economic thought on trade policy in New Zealand from the 1920s to the early 1980s. The focus is upon the different doctrinal perspectives taken by academic economists in New Zealand. Throughout the period under review policymakers supported an inward-looking trade and development regime buttressed by extensive interventionist trade policy. Appeals to the employment argument for industrialization through import substitution lent their policies a veneer of economic respectability. Most economists were not persuaded; they railed against quantitative import controls, discriminatory tariffs and cumbersome export incentive schemes and they offered, in vain, some constructive alternatives relying on price signals rather than administrative rules. One of our main findings is that most of the early work exposited here anticipated the rent seeking explanation for the configuration of trade policy.
B20|On Taxation, Political Accountability and Foreign Aid: Empirics to a Celebrated Literature| The Eubank findings on taxation, political accountability and foreign aid have had an important influence on academic and policymaking debates. Eubank has warned that his findings should not be generalised across Africa until they are backed by robust empirical evidence. This paper puts some empirical structure to the celebrated literature. The empirical evidence which is based on data from 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010 broadly confirms the Somaliland-based Eubank hypothesis that in the absence of foreign aid, the dependence of government on local tax revenues provides the leverage for better political governance.
B20|Income Inequality In Macedonia: Mechanisms And Solutions|The rising income inequalities are one of the most important structural reasons of the global economic crisis. We focus on the income inequality in the country with highest Gini coefficient in Europe â€“ Republic of Macedonia. We argue that there are two main drivers of income inequality in the country: installed neo-liberalism and political patronage system. Neo-liberalism is used as a tool to remove the legislative protection of the workers, to maintain the wages on the miserable low level and to block the redistribution of income from the elites towards the others in the society. The completely opposite system of political patronage and populism is used as a tool of governance. It is based on state related benefits targeted to different groups of citizens and designed to be distributed in small portions and in turns in order to gradually increase the serfdom of the majority of the population from the elites. As a result, the country currently has the highest income inequality in Europe, accompanied by increase of poverty. The article concludes with suggestion of five directions for policy reforms.
B20|¿Se pueden aplicar las ideas Keynesianas al largo plazo? Unas reflexiones teóricas y un modelo ilustrativo|El modelo que se construye en este artículo quiere mostrar que la más importante idea Keynesiana, el principio de la demanda efectiva, no se aplica solamente a un corto plazo en el que unos precios son fijos o rígidos. También se aplica a un largo plazo en el que los precios son perfectamente flexibles y vacían el mercado, las firmas maximizan sus ganancias y la distribución funcional del ingreso depende de las productividades marginales. También se muestra que la naturaleza Keynesiana de un modelo no depende de sus resultados – en unos casos bajar los salarios es una buena idea y en otros no lo es; en unos casos la paradoja del ahorro vale en el largo plazo y en otros no vale – sino del hecho de incorporar (o no incorporar) la noción de demanda autónoma. Para terminar, se le da un sustento a la idea de que la forma en la que se trata el asunto de los salarios monetarios (y su flexibilidad) en la Teoría General no se puede aplicar al mundo “financiarizado” en el que estamos. ****** This paper presents a model intended to show that the most important Keynesian idea, the principle of effective demand, cannot be only applied to short terms, in which some prices are fixed or sticky; but also to long terms where prices are perfectly flexible and empty the market, firms increase their profits, and where the functional income distribution depends on marginal productivities. Moreover, we will show that the Keynesian nature of a model does not depend on its results, in some cases lowering wages is a good policy and in others it is not. In some cases, the paradox of thrift stands out in the long run and in some others it does not; instead, this nature depends on incorporating (or not) the notion of autonomous demand. To conclude, we will support the idea stating that the way in which monetary wages (and flexibility) are addressed in the General Theory is not applicable to the financialized world, where we live.
B20|The issue of value in economic thought — Part 2: the evolution of views from 1871 until the second half of the 20th century|This paper is devoted to the evolution of views on value propounded in the period from 1871 until the second half of the 20th century. The creators of the scientific revolution in economics called the marginal revolution rejected the classical interpretation of value understood objectively, and developed a subjective theory of value. According to W.S. Jevons, economists should focus only on exchange value, which expresses the ratio of exchangeability of some goods for others. A. Marshall combined the issues of value and price with the theories of supply and demand. J.B. Clark made the value of goods dependent on their effective utility, which constitutes the significance that an individual attaches to satisfying a given need. For C. Menger value represents the importance that individuals attribute to particular goods, serving to satisfy those individuals’ needs. Expanding C. Menger’s views, E. von Böhm-Bawerk and F. von Wieser claimed that the value of goods is determined by their border use (marginal utility). L.M.E. Walras maintained that the exchange value of goods is determined by their rarity. In the 20th century, J.R. Hicks and K.E. Boulding, who based the theory of value on choice theory, and finally, P.A. Samuelson, according to whom the value of a commodity is determined by the point of market equilibrium, dealt with the modification of the neoclassical theory of value. Proposals by V. Pareto, G.K. Cassel and W.M. Zawadzki to remove the category of value from economics confront contemporary economists with the task of searching for, and possibly determining a new source and measure of value of goods and services.
B20|An effort to enhance hydrogen energy share in a compression ignition engine under dual-fuel mode using low temperature combustion strategies|A limited hydrogen (H2) energy share due to knocking is the major hurdle for effective utilization of H2 in compression ignition (CI) engines under dual-fuel operation. The present study aims at improvement of H2 energy share in a 7.4kW direct injection CI engine under dual-fuel mode with two low temperature combustion (LTC) strategies; (i) retarded pilot fuel injection timing and (ii) water injection. Experiments were carried out under conventional strategies of diesel dual-fuel mode (DDM) and B20 dual-fuel mode (BDM); and LTC strategies of retarded injection timing dual-fuel mode (RDM) and water injected dual-fuel mode (WDM). The results explored that the H2 energy share increased significantly from 18% with conventional DDM to 24, and 36% with RDM, and WDM respectively. The energy efficiency increased with increasing H2 energy share under dual-fuel operation; however, for a particular energy share of 18% H2, it decreased from 34.8% with DDM to 33.7% with BDM, 32.7% with WDM and 29.9% with RDM. At 18% H2 energy share, oxides of nitrogen emission decreased by 37% with RDM and 32% with WDM as compared to conventional DDM due to reduction of in-cylinder temperature, while it increased slightly about 5% with BDM. It is emerged from the study that water injection technique is the viable option among all other strategies to enhance the H2 energy share in the engine with a slight penalty of increase in smoke, hydrocarbon, and carbon monoxide emissions.
B20|After Ricardo â€“ after Marx â€“ after Keynes: comparative advantage, mutual advantage and implications for global governance|This paper submits that one of the most fallacious paradigms in economic thought and policy, stemming from Ricardo, has been that of comparative advantage, as it has assumed no capital mobility whereas it has been mainly foreign direct investment that has driven global trade since World War II and has confirmed Marx's claims for uneven development. The paper outlines that this has meant asymmetric outcomes compromising the post-war Bretton Woods system and suggests that this needs both a post-Ricardian and a post-Keynesian conceptual framework for global governance.
B20|Institutional benchmarking of foreign aid effectiveness in Africa|Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to integrate two main strands of the aid-development nexus in assessing whether institutional thresholds matter in the effectiveness of foreign-aid on institutional development in 53 African countries over the period 1996-2010. Design/methodology/approach - – The panel quantile regression technique enables us to investigate if the relationship between institutional dynamics and development assistance differs throughout the distributions of institutional dynamics. Eight government quality indicators are employed: rule of law, regulation quality, government effectiveness, corruption, voice and accountability, control of corruption, political stability and democracy. Findings - – Three hypotheses are tested and the following findings are established: first, institutional benefits of foreign-aid are contingent on existing institutional levels in Africa; second, but for a thin exception (democracy), foreign-aid is more negatively correlated with countries of higher institutional quality than with those of lower quality; third, the institutional benefits of foreign-aid are not questionable until greater domestic institutional development has taken place. The reverse is true instead. government quality benefits of development assistance are questionable in African countries irrespective of prevailing institutional quality levels. Originality/value - – This paper contributes to existing literature on the effectiveness of foreign-aid by focussing on the distribution of the dependent variables (institutional dynamics). It is likely that best and worst countries in terms of institutions respond differently to development assistance.
B20|İktisadi Düşüncenin İzleğinde Piketty’i Değerlendirmek|Bu çalışmada, iktisadi düşünce tarihinde önemli bir yer edinmiş olan iktisatçıların görüşlerinden hareketle Piketty’nin kapitalist sisteme dair düşünceleri ve bu iktisadi düşünce okulları ile ilişkisi değerlendirilecektir. Piketty kitabında pek çok iktisatçıdan bahsetmekte ve çalışmasını geçmişin kuramsal yapısı üzerine temellendirmektedir. Ancak, bu kuramlarla ilişkisi irdelendiğinde Piketty’nin bu kuramları derinlemesine analiz etmediği açıkça görülmektedir. İdeolojik yönelimi, metodolojik seçimi ve kuramsal kafa karışıklığı Piketty’nin bütüncül bir kapitalizm teorisine ulaşmasını engellemiştir. Kuramsal tartışmaların kapsamı ve derinliği açısından Piketty’nin analizini ne klasik iktisatçıların, Marx’ın ve kurumsal iktisatçıların ne de kendisi gibi kapitalizmi kurtarma derdine düşmüş Keynes’in analizi ile karşılaştırabilmek mümkün görünmemektedir. Piketty, neoklasik iktisada eleştiriler yöneltmiş olsa da sermaye kavramı başta olmak üzere pek çok neokasik kavram ve aracı kullanmış ve dolayısıyla neoklasik analizin analitik sınırlarının dışına çok fazla çıkamamıştır. Dolayısıyla, Piketty neoklasik ortodoksinin sınırları içinde kalarak kapitalizmi kurtaracak bir takım reform önerilerini tartışmıştır. Piketty’nin kitabının bu kadar ilgi görmesinin nedeni hem iktisat teorisi alanında hem de iktisat politikası alanında bir paradigma değişikliğine duyulan ihtiyaçtır. Bu anlamda, Piketty’nin 2008 krizi sonrası süreçte ihtiyaç duyulan söz konusu paradigma değişiminin bir aracısı olacağı umulmuştur. Bu yazıda, Piketty’nin hem teorik anlamda hem de politik anlamda ihtiyaç duyulan paradigma değişimine öncülük edebilmesinin güç olduğu ileri sürülmektedir.
B20|"Le ""prefazioni"" di J.M. Keynes alle traduzioni della sua teoria generale: estemporanee annotazioni"|"The forewords by Keynes to the German, Japanese and French edition of the General Theory are in this paper under examination in order to consider, once again, some disputed topics, especially the real meaning that have to be attached to the adjective ""general"" which stands out on the book cover of his work and the reliability of the presumed support to totalitarian regimes that some of his statements would disclose, together with accusations of sympathies for, or indifference to, Nazi regime."
B20|Is History of Economics What Historians of Economic Thought Do? A Quantitative Investigation|This paper presents a quantitative investigation into the history of economic thought (HET). Building on previous work (Marcuzzo 2008; 2012), we propose an empirical study with the aim of describing the dynamics of changes in HET in recent years, detecting three trends: 1) a sort of ‘stepping down from the shoulders of giants’, namely a move towards studies of ‘minor’ figures and/or economists from a more recent past; 2) the blossoming of archival research into unpublished work and correspondence; 3) less theory-laden investigations, connecting intellectual circles, linking characters and events. Using data from Econlit we show the evolution of the overall publication of het articles (1955-2013) and of HET fully or partially specialized journals (1993-2013); for the latter, by devising proxies which are amenable to quantitative assessment, we demonstrate that there is some evidence to support these claims.
B20|Crossing Boundaries, Displacing Previous Knowledge and Claiming Superiority: Is the Economics of Discrimination a Conquest of Economics Imperialism?|Becker’s work on discrimination is commonly viewed as one of the first expressions of “economics imperialism”. This paper challenges this view by looking at previous and later works on discrimination. Two elements define economics imperialism: the crossing of established frontiers between approaches and disciplines and the intention of substituting one approach for another. Section 1 briefly presents the origins of economics imperialism and proposes a two-aspects definition of the concept. Section 2 contextualizes Becker’s model of discrimination as imperialism “within economics” rather than towards other social sciences. Section 3 characterizes Arrow’s statistical discrimination as a humble theoretical imperialism, calling for the complementarity of social sciences rather than for the superiority of economics. Section 4 states that empirical measurements of discrimination in economics are a type of empirical imperialism essentially because these methods replace other social sciences in their contexts of expertise.
B20|Virginia political economy: a rational reconstruction|Recognition of a distinctive style of political economy denoted as Virginia political economy appeared early in the 1960s. It is common though not universal to identify a school of thought by the academic location of the main figures associated with the creation and propagation of a particular set of ideas. By this approach, Virginia political economy is associated with the three academic venues where James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock did most of their work. This paper takes a methodological approach to identifying Virginia political economy, which gives Virginia political economy an analytical rather than a regional identity. I do this by employing a form of rational reconstruction to articulate what I perceive to be the analytical hard core of Virginia political economy. While Buchanan and Tullock were pivotal characters in the development of Virginia political economy, that hard core is neither reducible to Buchanan and Tullock nor do they convey fully that hard core as is has arisen through scholarly interaction among many people over 50 years.

B20|The past, present and future of Virginia Political Economy|We present a short history of the Virginia School of Political Economy in its institutional settings of University of Virginia (UVA), Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, or Virginia Tech (VPI), and George Mason University (GMU). We discuss the original research and educational project as envisioned by Buchanan at UVA, its maturity into a normal science at VPI, and its continuation at GMU. We argue that the future of Virginia Political Economy will depend critically on the various alternative interpretations of the Buchanan project in positive economics, welfare economics, and political economy.

B20|Traditions of Foreign Countries Studies in Modern Russian Economic Expertise|The article deals with Russian traditions of studies of foreign countries which have become an intellectual pillar for Russian economic expertise. The modern application of experience of Soviet scientific schools in international studies is shown, especially in the fields of world development forecasts, analysis of Russian foreign economic relations and research of economic policy abroad. The article is based on open sources with publications, reports and presentations about expert and analytical activities of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) and other institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences, VNIKI-Institute, MGIMO-University and some other centers. It is explained that results of international studies have become a necessary element for consulting of governmental bodies and businessmen in the epoch of globalization.
B20|Roberto Simonsen and the Brazil-U.S. Trade Agreement of 1935: Economic ideas and political action [Roberto Simonsen and the Brazil-U.S. Trade Agreement of 1935: Economic ideas and political action]|In this paper we identify elements that reveal the specificity of Roberto Simonsen’s economic thought and his singular interpretation of Brazilian economic history, based on documents related to the debate held in Congress when the Brazil-U.S. Trade Agreement was signed, in 1935. We have verified how in a concrete political struggle Simonsen used diverse theoretical references in order to support his arguments and how at the same time this participation in the political scene contributed to the formation of his economic thought. Simonsen’s appropriation of the ideas of two German authors, namely Adolph Wagner and Karl Rodbertus, is analyzed by means of the study of Simonsen’s quotations and of the works of the authors themselves. Simonsen’s participation in the debates around the Trade Agreement is of a particular character, because of the consistent manner in which he defended class interests, resorting to the works of international economists and to well-informed historical digressions. This differentiates Simonsen from other industrialists, his colleagues, who defended industry based on moral arguments.
B20|Through the Methodological View of the Historiographic Discussion of Mid-1990s|At the centre of the present study is shedding some additional light for the further clarification of the concepts of “whig” and “counter-whig” in the historiography of economics. The focus is on the relation (partial coverage in the content or other crossings) of the concepts of the absolutist and the relativist approaches and the corresponding types of history, the internalist and the externalist approaches and the corresponding kinds of history, and especially on the relation between “whig” and “contra-whig” types of history of economics in the light and in the context of the envisioned relations. The study is based on an electronic publication in December 1996 of selected by Esther-Mirjam Sent postings of historians of economics, intellectual historians, etc., who have taken participation in the discussion, the rise of which was given by a Guest editorial of James P. Henderson (November 1996) “Whig History is Dead – Now What?”, addressed to the attention of the members of the History of Economics Society. The central message argued through the view of this discussion is in a direction of conceptualizing a relatively holistic historiographic approach, reviving the role of the History of Economics in constructing contemporary social-economic theory and against the divide and tearing apart the unity of methodology of economics, history of economics and economics.
B20|The Economic Theory of European Competition Policy. Retrospectives and Perspectives [Teoria economică a politicii europene a concurenţei. Retrospective şi perspective]|The purpose of the present paper is to present the inherent theoretical presuppositions of the EU Competition Policy (ECP) and to offer a critical appraisal of them. In addition, the paper advances the catallactic competition model as a possible alternative theoretical framework to be used in enforcing ECP. The research is divided into three main parts.
B20|The Rate of Time Preference of Government|Here, I examine the mechanism by which the rate of time preference (RTP) of government is formed and present a model of government RTP. The RTP of government has been largely neglected in the study of economics, but it is an important factor in inflation acceleration. The model presented indicates that the RTP of government is determined by the expected RTPs of the median voter and the representative household, as well as the strength of the government’s fluid intelligence. The model also indicates, however, that households actually use “beliefs” or heuristics to generate their expected RTPs of government.
B20|Rational Asymmetric Development, Piketty and the Spirit of Poverty in Africa|The study extends the implications of Piketty’s celebrated literature from developed countries to the nexus between developed nations and African countries by building on responses from Rogoff (2014) & Stiglitz (2014), post Washington Consensus paradigms and underpinnings from Solow-Swan & Boyce-Fofack-Ndikumana. The central argument presented is that the inequality problem is at the heart of rational asymmetric development between rich and poor countries. Piketty has shown that inequality increases when the return of capital is higher than the growth rate, because the poor cannot catch-up with the rich. We argue that, when the return of political economy (or capitalism-fuelled illicit capital flight) is higher than the growth rate in African countries, inequality in development increases and African may not catch-up with the developed world. As an ideal solution, Piketty has proposed progressive income taxation based on automatic exchange of bank information. The ideal analogy proposed in tackling the spirit of African poverty is a holistic commitment to fighting illicit capital flight based on automatic exchange of bank information. Hence, contrary to theoretical underpinnings of exogenous growth models, catch-up may not be so apparent. Implications for the corresponding upward bias in endogenous development and catch-up literature are discussed.

B20|Rethinking the industrial district: 35 years later|The year 2014 marked a double anniversary: the 35th and 25th anniversaries of the publication of two seminal papers of Giacomo Becattini on the industrial district. The first paper (Becattini, 1979) conceptualizes the industrial district as a «unit of investigation», while the second (Becattini, 1989) conceptualizes the industrial district as a «model of production». Between the two papers there is a mutual dependence. The industrial district as a «model of production» deprived of the industrial district as a «unit of investigation» loses its originality as a way of interpreting economic change and becomes merely «one type of a cluster». This paper deals with the relationship between district and cluster, then also between the industrial district as a singular theoretical construct and the many industrial districts described by empirical investigations, and concludes with some remarks on the topicality of the industrial district.
B20|What about Industrial District(s) in Regional Science?|The aim of this paper is to critically consider how the concept of «industrial district» was born and evolved in the field of regional science. Despite the claim by Isard that the emergence of a spatial dimension in economics was being hampered by Marshall’s alleged prioritising of time over space (Isard, 1956), the concept of «localization economies» introduced into regional science by Ohlin, Hoover and Isard clearly is itself a legacy from Marshall. This contradiction in the work of Isard and others followed to a large extent from the way in which Marshallian concepts were historically situated in economic thought before Giacomo Becattini’s re-reading of Marshall and his ideas. This re-reading began in the 1960s, focussing on conceptual issues related to industry (Becattini, 1962), and then culminated in the following decades with work on the idea of the «industrial district»: considering it first as a unit of investigation of economic research (Becattini, 1979) and, later, as a way of industrial development (Becattini, 1989). In brief, the originality of Marshall’s economic thought can be found in Book IV of his Principles of Economics. This originality can be seen in the statement that economics is more important as a way of studying man in society than as a way of studying wealth; and continues through the affirmation that man’s character is moulded by his daily work. That is to say, a person’s «place of living» (where individuals live and work) is important not only for the formation of human skills but also for the formation of character. The place as the unit of investigation (i.e. the «functional region») is one of the main elements which distinguishes the identity of regional science from other branches of economics.
B20|On the Cambridge, England, Critique of the Marginal Productivity Theory of Distribution|The Cambridge critique of the marginal productivity theory of distribution is entwined with the criticsâ€™ theories of value, price, distribution, capital, growth, and methodology that occurred alongside it. The article first discusses these dimensions, then the inescapable need to explain the origin and size and rate of profits in any approach to the theory of distribution. The need in the neoclassical approach to have a unit in which to measure capital that is independent of distribution and prices is examined. The alternative classical/Marxian alternative and the relationship of pricing and market structures to systemic relationships in Post-Keynesian theory are analysed. Unresolved debates among the critics of the mainstream are outlined including those between Garegnani and Hahn. Ways forward are suggested in the concluding section.

W obliczu mało rozpowszechnionej znajomości jego dzieł w Polsce, zastosowano metodę badawczą merytorycznej analizy ich treści, rozpatrując je w nawiązaniu do danych z zakresu społeczno-gospodarczej sytuacji w Niemczech Zachodnich po II wojnie światowej. Artykuł przedstawia w logicznym porządku idee autora: diagnozę kryzysu społecznego w XX w., ordo i „społeczny irenizm” oraz krytykę leseferyzmu i kolektywizmu. Następnie dokonuje się przedstawienia programu społecznej gospodarki rynkowej A. Müller-Armacka. Program składał się z postulatów powrotu do rynku i konkurencji, aktywnej polityki gospodarczej państwa oraz stworzenia systemu zabezpieczeń socjalnych. Analiza prowadzi do wniosku, że koncepcja ta odpowiadała na pytanie, jak pogodzić ze sobą wzrost gospodarczy oraz wolność i społeczne zabezpieczenie jednostek ludzkich. Dlatego w podsumowaniu artykułu wskazuje się na wysoki walor poznawczy koncepcji społecznej gospodarki rynkowej i jej aktualność w dobie współczesnej dyskusji o możliwych kierunkach rozwoju obecnego systemu gospodarczego.
B20|Joseph Schumpeter and John Kenneth Galbraith: two sides of the same coin?|Joseph Schumpeter and John Kenneth Galbraith were two of the most influential scholars of the previous century addressing the most fundamental questions confronting society—what is the nature of economy and how is it shaping society? At the heart of their work was a concern about the gap between what they perceived to be the standard models in economics and the evolution of the actual economy. In particular, this meant abandoning the standard models of neoclassical economics and instead focusing on what both perceived to be an evolution towards a more managed economy. The purpose of this paper is to explain the relationship between the works of Schumpeter and Galbraith. Perhaps one of the enduring lessons that bonded Schumpeter and Galbraith is their keen focus on how the economy was evolving over time, and with it, the institutional landscape, that carried with it huge implications for public policy.

B20|Richard Abel Musgrave and Joseph Alois Schumpeter: Two intellectual authorities in economics and their shared and different frameworks, read through the lenses of the Perlman dichotomies|The paper compares R.A. Musgrave and J.A. Schumpeter and their relationship. First, their biographical and intellectual backgrounds are analyzed. Then the approach of shared intellectual frameworks according to M. Perlman’s dichotomies are applied to Musgrave’s and Schumpeter’s contributions.Musgrave was an admirer of Schumpeter but the analysis of their approaches applying the dichotomous approach and the inclusion ofMusgraves article on Schumpeter and the tax state also highlight their intellectual differences despite the fact that both had deep roots in the European tradition and a broad understanding of the social sciences, social economics and the embeddedness of the economy in the institutional-judicial nexus on the one and more individualist traditions on the other hand.

B20|The beauty of simplicity? (Simple) heuristics and the opportunities yet to be realized|This Handbook is a unique and original contribution of over thirty chapters on behavioural economics, examining and addressing an important stream of research where the starting assumption is that decision-makers are for the most part relatively smart or rational. This particular approach is in contrast to a theme running through much contemporary work where individualsâ€™ behaviour is deemed irrational, biased, and error-prone, often due to how people are hardwired. In the smart people approach, where errors or biases occur and when social dilemmas arise, more often than not, improving the decision-making environment can repair these problems without hijacking or manipulating the preferences of decision-makers. This book covers a wide-range of themes from micro to macro, including various sub-disciplines within economics such as economic psychology, heuristics, fast and slow-thinking, neuroeconomics, experiments, the capabilities approach, institutional economics, methodology, nudging, ethics, and public policy.
B20|Innovative Enterprise or Sweatshop Economics? In Search of Foundations of Economic Analysis|In Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, Joseph Schumpeter asserts: â€œperfect competition is not only impossible but inferior, and has no title to being set up as a model of ideal efficiency.â€ For neoclassical economists, the large corporation is a â€œmarket imperfectionâ€ that, compared with â€œperfect competition,â€ should result in higher product prices and lower industry output. Yet business history reveals the capability of the most productive enterprises to generate massive quantities of output at low costs to attain large market shares with buyers benefiting from low prices even as employees receive higher pay and shareholders ample dividends. By integrating the history of industrial development in Britain and the United States with the ideas of leading economic thinkers, this essay demonstrates the absurdity of perfect competition as the ideal of economic efficiency. Indeed, I show that, in their desire to make the market rather than the firm the main arbiter of resource allocation, neoclassical economists have enshrined the sweatshop as the foundation of their analysis, with profoundly negative consequences for understanding how a modern economy actually operates and performs. In doing so, neoclassical economists ignore not only the economic history of capitalism but also the intellectual history of their own discipline. I conduct a journey through two hundred years of economic thought â€“ from Adam Smithâ€™s The Wealth of Nations (1776) to Alfred Chandlerâ€™s The Visible Hand (1977) â€“ to derive analytical foundations for a theory of innovative enterprise that can explain and explore firm-level sources of productivity growth in the economy. What then do more sophisticated theories of the firm rooted in the neoclassical tradition have to offer? In a section of this essay that I call (borrowing a phrase from Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means) â€œEconomic Theory for â€˜an Era of Corporate Plunderingâ€™,â€ I outline the shortcomings of Williamsonian transaction-cost theory and Jensenian agency theory for analyzing the role of the business corporation in the operation and performance of the economy. From the perspective of the theory of innovative enterprise, I demonstrate how the methodology of constrained optimization trivializes the business enterprise while the ideology that companies should be run to maximize shareholder value legitimizes financial predators, many senior corporate executives among them, in the looting of the industrial corporation. The â€œera of corporate plunderingâ€ since the mid-1980s has contributed to extreme concentration of income among the richest households and the erosion of middle-class employment opportunities. Finally, I call for a transformation of economic thinking so that the innovative enterprise is at the center of economic analysis. The theory of innovative enterprise exposes as costly intellectual failures â€œperfect competitionâ€ as the ideal of economic efficiency, â€œconstrained-optimizationâ€ as the prime tool of economic analysis, and â€œmaximizing shareholder valueâ€ as the ideology of superior corporate governance. The theory of innovative enterprise provides, moreover, a clear and compelling rationale for sharing the gains of business enterprise among stakeholders in the broader community, in conjunction with government policies that seek to support sustainable prosperity, characterized by stable and equitable economic growth.
B20|O debate Gudin/Simonsen paralelo ao debate do cálculo econômico socialista|This paper analyzes the historical context of the debate between Roberto Simonsen and Eugênio Gudin on the role of state planning in the post-war Brazilian economy. Both had different views on how to develop the Brazilian economy: Simonsen defended the active state intervention with the objective of closing production bottlenecks and to coordinate efforts in order to increase the productive efficiency; Gudin defended the adoption of liberalization policies and incentive to private entrepreneurship. Such positions resemble a lot the positions adopted by socialists and liberals during the socialist economic calculation debate, which occurred a decade before. Although Simonsen had been influenced by other traditions (such as the Old American Institutionalism), he defended practical applications of planning that emerged from that debate, Gudin was directly influenced by the liberal positions, citing Hayek, Mises and Robbins. In the end, I argue that the debate can open way to understand complexity questions in the economy and the relation between complexity of the productive structure and development
B20|Economic-Financial Operating Mechanism Of Compossessorates From Transylvania|This paper presents a succinct levers, instruments, means, methods that worked compossessorates in Transylvania. Based on detailed studies of specific legislation, archival materials, statistical and literature, trying to provide a more complete picture of the mechanism by which compossessorates as a form of property specifies contributed to socio-economic development. This mechanism of operation, although it relates to the economic history of Transylvania is topical, and the paper tries to offer some solutions for integrating the organizational forms in the current financial and economic mechanism in Romania.
B20|Late Neoliberalism And The Global Financial Crisis|"The analysis is based on the introduction of the notion of ""late neoliberalism"" as contrasted with the practice established in the literature to unequivocally use the concept ""neoliberalism"". There are given arguments in favour of the differentiated approach chosen by us. The content of the ideology of late neoliberalism is connected with the changes that have taken place since the end of the 1970s in the structure of Anglo-Saxon capitalism, as well as those in the economic and social policy of the USA and Great Britain under Thatcherism and Reaganomics. There is emphasized the central place of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and is revealed its untenability against the background of the global financial crisis."

B20|What happened to heterodox economics in Germany after the 1970s|In the context of ongoing criticisms of the lack of pluralism in economics, the present article aims to discuss the development of 'heterodox' economics since the 1970s. Following Lakatos's concept of scientific research programs (srp), and concentrating on the situation in Germany, the article will discuss classifications of economics, and will specify the understanding of diversity in the light of 'axiomatic variations' of the economic mainstream. This will form the basis for the subsequent description of the development of heterodoxy in Germany, with special reference to the founding of new universities and the reform movements in the 1970s. It can be shown that the heterodox scene flourished in this period, but that this pluralization remained fragmented and short-lived; by the 1980s at the latest heterodoxy was again on its way to marginalization. The history of heterodoxy in Germany thus presents itself as an unequal 'battle of the paradigms', and can only be told as the story of a failure.
B20|Ökonomie und Moral: Eine kurze Theoriegeschichte|Die ökonomische Theorie hat mit Moral wenig oder gar nichts zu tun. In den gängigen Lehrbüchern der Mikroökonomie findet sich in den Stichwortverzeichnissen kein Eintrag zu Moral oder Ethik. Die Studierenden lernen über die Wirtschaft nachzudenken, aber sie lernen dabei nicht, systematisch über ethische Fragen zu reflektieren. Nach der neoklassischen Lehre, wie sie in den Lehrbüchern präsentiert wird, weist wirtschaftliches Handeln nicht grundsätzlich moralische Aspekte auf. Ein solcher Tatbestand ist erstaunlich. Er widerspricht (phänomenologisch) unseren ökonomischen Alltagserfahrungen und (theoriegeschichtlich) einer jahrhundertelangen Tradition, die vor gut zwei Jahrhunderten schrittweise aufgegeben und im 20. Jahrhundert durch dezidiert morallose Standpunkte ersetzt worden ist.
B20|Geld und Sprache: Der innere Widerstreit in der Modernisierung|"Geld und Sprache sind das ""Band der menschlichen Gesellschaft"" (Cicero). Im vorliegenden Text wird die menschliche Sprache als soziale Form, als Prozess der Vergesellschaftung rekonstruiert und das damit verbundene Denken daraus entwickelt als Logos. Das Geld stellt logisch und historisch ein Novum innerhalb dieser Vergesellschaftung dar, das zu einer sich immer weiter einlagernden berechnenden Vernunftform (Ratio) führt. Diese wachsende Dominanz der Ratio über den Logos charakterisiert den Prozess der Modernisierung und erlaubt zugleich ihren inneren Gegensatz aufzudecken. Es zeichnet sich schließlich in der völligen Verdinglichung der Ratio in der Künstlichen Intelligenz eine neue Weise der Vergesellschaftung ab, worin die Herrschaft des Geldes in neuer Form reproduziert wird."
B20|The formal-informal economy dualism in a retrospective of economic thought since the 1940s|Central to the scientific debate about the 'informal sector' and the validity of the concept used to be a twofold challenge. The crux laid not only in the objective to explain the widely visible persistence of the informal economy in developing countries, but also in the identification of its roots and the proliferation conditions to be met ex ante. The present paper aims at establishing a link between the theories on informality and marginalization which is another important issue that has arisen within the discussions on the causes of persistent poverty a few years ago. Both concepts are interlinked and self-enforcing. On the macroeconomic level, any economy - be it formal or informal - consists of a set of different economic sectors and any of these sectors basically consists of an accumulation of people on the microeconomic level. Every time one looks at the macro level where political and economic conditions frame the dynamics of the formal and the informal economy, one has at the same time to look at the micro-level where the social and economic conditions determine the incentives for every actor to participate either in the formal, the informal or in both economies. Informality has multiple sources depending on whether the agent took a voluntary choice or had to involuntary opt-out from an institutional system. In this paper, the connection between informality and involuntary exclusion shall be examined in a retrospective of economic thought since the 1940s. The roots of the intertwined concepts of informality and economic exclusion have been laid in the dual economy theories of the 1940s-1950s. Recapitulating the works of Julius BOEKE, Arthur LEWIS, John HARRIS & Michael TODARO, Albert HIRSCHMAN and other socio-economists of that time, it will be argued that one of the necessary reasons for the persistence of the informal economy in developing countries is the dualism in institutional frameworks that leads to the marginalization of social groups and their subsequent exclusion from formal economic activities. By referring to the groundbreaking Africa studies of Keith HART (1971) and the INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION (1972), special emphasis will be given to the causal reciprocity between informality, marginalization and economic exclusion. The paper closes with a brief overview of current schools of thought that deal very differently with the issue of informality and economic exclusion.
B20|International aid, corruption and fiscal policy behavior|The Okada & Samreth (2012, EL) and Asongu (2012, EB; 2013, EEL) debate on ‘the effect of foreign aid on corruption’ has had an important influence in policy and academic circles. This paper provides a unifying framework by using investment and fiscal behavior transmission channels in 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. Findings unite the two streams of the debate and broadly suggest that while the ‘government’s final consumption expenditure’ channel is consistent with the latter author, the investment and tax effort channels are in line with the former authors. Justifications for the nexuses are provided. Policy implications on how to use foreign aid constraints in managing fiscal behavior as means of reducing (increasing) corruption (corruption-control) are discussed.
B20|The Evolving Debate on the Effect of Foreign Aid on Corruption and Institutions in Africa|This policy chapter summarises an evolving debate on the effect of foreign aid on corruption and institutions. It entails a series of publications that have been successively motivated by feedbacks from academic and policy making circles. The plethora of papers explores debates sustaining the direct, conditional and indirect effects of foreign aid on institutions. Moreover, another debate on the incidence of foreign aid distortions on corruption is also assessed in light of a recently celebrated literature on development assistance. Overall, the findings show that the effects of foreign aid on corruption and institutions are: directly positive; conditionally positive with a magnitude dependent on initial institutional capacity levels; contingent on fundamental characteristics of development due to heterogeneity and; indirectly positive or negative depending on the transmission mechanism. While the impact of foreign aid uncertainty on corruption is also positive, the sign on governance could change in light of governments’ commitment to increase its dependence on local tax revenues.

B20|The Questionable Economics of Development Assistance in Africa: Hot-Fresh Evidence, 1996–2010|This paper assesses the aid-development nexus in 52 African countries using updated data (1996–2010) and a new indicator of human development (adjusted for inequality). The effects of Total Net Official Development Assistance (NODA), NODA from the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and NODA from Multilateral donors on economic prosperity (at national and per capita levels) are also examined. The findings broadly indicate that development assistance is detrimental to GDP growth, GDP per capita growth and inequality adjusted human development. The magnitude of negativity (which is consistent across specifications and development dynamics) is highest for NODA from Multilateral donors, followed by NODA from DAC countries. Given concerns on the achievement of the MDGs, the relevance of these results point to the deficiency of foreign aid as a sustainable cure to poverty in Africa. Though the stated intents or purposes of aid are socio-economic, the actual impact from the findings negates this. It is a momentous epoque to solve the second tragedy of foreign aid; it is high time economists and policy makers start rethinking the models and theories on which foreign aid is based. In the meantime, it is up to people who care about the poor to hold aid agencies accountable for piecemeal results. Policy implications and caveats are discussed.

B20|Taxation, foreign aid and political governance: figures to the facts of a celebrated literature|This paper puts figures to the facts of Eubank (2012), a recently celebrated paper in the Journal of Development Studies. We investigate the underpinning Somaliland-based hypothesis that foreign aid dilutes the positive role of taxation on political governance. The assessment is based on 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. For more policy options, the dataset is disaggregated into fundamental characteristics of African development based on income-levels, legal origins, natural resources and landlockeness. While the Eubank hypothesis is invalid in baseline Africa, low-income and English common law countries of the continent, we cannot conclude on its validity for other fundamental characteristics of development. Policy implications, caveats and future directions are discussed.
B20|Foreign Aid and Corruption: Clarifying Murky Empirical Conclusions|This note reconciles an on-going debate on the effect of foreign aid on corruption by introducing a previously missing heterogeneity dimension of aid. The relationship was estimated using dynamic system GMM and quantile regressions (QR). Results show that both narratives in the debate are correct, contingent on the type of development assistance. The QR results are robust to endogeneity when the independent variables of interest are instrumented with their first-lags.
B20|A brief clarification to the questionable economics of foreign aid for inclusive human development|The study clarifies the questionable economics of foreign aid for inclusive human development. It investigates the effect of a plethora of foreign aid dynamics on the inequality adjusted human development index. Contemporary and non-contemporary OLS, Fixed-effects and a system GMM technique with forward orthogonal deviations are employed. The empirical evidence is based on a sample of 53 African countries for the period 2005-2012. The following findings are established. First, the impacts of aid dynamics with high degrees of substitution are positive. These include, aid for: social infrastructure, economic infrastructure, the productive sector and the multi-sector. Second, the effect of humanitarian assistance is consistently negative across specifications and models. Third, the effects of programme assistance and action on debts are ambiguous because they become positive with the GMM technique. Justifications for these changes and clarifications with respect to existing literature are provided. Policy implications are discussed in light of Piketty’s celebrated literature and the post-2015 development agenda. We also provide some recommendations for a rethinking of theories and models on which development assistance is based.
B20|Foreign aid, investment and fiscal policy behavior: theory and empirical evidence|The paper provides theoretical and empirical justifications for the instrumentality of foreign aid in stimulating private investment and fixed capital formation through fiscal policy mechanisms. We propose an endogenous growth theory based on an extension of Barro (1990) by postulating that the positive effect of aid mitigates the burden of the taxation system on the private sector of recipient countries. The empirical validity is based on 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. While the findings on the tax effort channel are overwhelmingly consistent with theory across specifications and fundamental characteristics, those of the government expenditure channel are a little heterogeneous but broadly in line with the theoretical postulations. Justification for the slight heterogeneity and policy implications are discussed.
B20|Reinventing foreign aid for inclusive and sustainable development: a survey|This survey essay reviews over 200 papers in arguing that in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive development, foreign aid should not orient developing countries towards industrialisation in the perspective of Kuznets but in the view of Piketty. Abandoning the former’s view that inequality will fall with progress in industrialisation and placing more emphasis on inequality in foreign aid policy will lead to more sustainable development outcomes. Inter alia: mitigate short-term poverty; address concerns of burgeoning population growth; train recipient governments on inclusive development; fight corruption and mismanagement and; avoid the shortfalls of celebrated Kuznets’ conjectures. We discuss how the essay addresses post-2015 development challenges and provide foreign aid policy instruments with which discussed objectives can be achieved. In summary, the essay provides useful policy measures to avoid past pitfalls. ‘Output may be growing, and yet the mass of the people may be becoming poorer’ (Lewis, 1955). ‘Lewis led all developing countries to water, proverbially speaking, some African countries have so far chosen not to drink’ (Amavilah, 2014). Piketty (2014) has led all developing countries to the stream again and a challenging policy syndrome of our time is how foreign aid can help them to drink.
B20|La recepción de Wicksell en España (1930-1960)|En un trabajo de 1927, Schumpeter llamó a Wicksell (1851-1926) “el Marshall sueco” y dijo de él que “ningún otro de los arquitectos que han plantado los cimientos del análisis moderno tiene hoy día tanto que ofrecernos”. Pese a este juicio, y a que efectivamente hoy se le reconoce como uno de los grandes economistas de todos los tiempos, Wicksell fue poco conocido fuera de su país hasta que sus obras comenzaron a traducirse al inglés a partir de 1934. España no fue una excepción a este hecho, pero tampoco estuvo muy a la zaga, como sí ocurrió realmente con otros economistas importantes. En este trabajo se estudian las distintas vías de recepción en España de sus principales aportaciones analíticas a la ciencia económica así como su influencia sobre los economistas españoles en el periodo 1930-1963.
B20|MIT Graduate Networks: the early years|After World War II economists acquired increasing importance in the American society in general. Moreover, the production of economics PhDs in the United States increased substantially and became a less concentrated industry. This period witnessed also the reformulation of the graduate education in economics in the US, informed by the several changes that were occurring in economics: its mathematization, the neoclassicism, the advancement of econometrics, the “Keynesian revolution”, and the ultimate Americanization of economics. The centrality that the MIT graduate program acquired in the postwar period makes it an important case study of the transformation of American economics more generally. Therefore, my aim here is to scrutinize the formative years of the PhD program, mostly the 1940s and 1950s.
B20|Becoming Applied: The Transformation of Economics after 1970|Abstract: This paper conjectures that economics has changed profoundly since the 1970s and that these changes involve a new understanding of the relationship between theoretical and applied work. Drawing on an analysis of John Bates Clark medal winners, it is suggested that the discipline became more applied, applied work be ing accorded a higher st atus in relation to pure theory than was previously the case. Discussing new types of applied work, the changing context of applied work, and new sites for applied work, the paper outlines a research agenda that will test the conjecture that there has been a changed understanding of the nature of applied work and hence of economics itself.
B20|A Brief History of International Trade Thought: From Pre-doctrinal Contributions to Contemporary Neoclassical Economics|The present paper outlines the development of international trade thought, from the pre-doctrinal contributions of Greek philosophers and scholastic theologians, through the theories of the first schools of economic thought, and up to modern trade theories. I follow filiations of ideas in a chronological order, and show how theoretical investigation into the causes and effects of international trade - and the necessity of government intervention - has evolved over centuries of economic thought.

B20|Albert O. Hirschman y la economía del desarrollo: lecciones para el presente|Albert Hirschman vivió casi cinco años en Colombia, donde según él, adquirió un punto de vista. Este punto de vista le permitió formular una aproximación original al desarrollo, alejada de las grandes teorías y del mero empirismo; lo llamó una estrategia de desarrollo y, en ella, resaltaba los eslabonamientos entre sectores productivos pero, sobre todo, las habilidades, creencias y expectativas necesarias, y muchas veces inexplotadas, para hacer posible un proceso dinámico de toma de decisiones. Estaba convencido de que los individuos eran más que simples beneficiarios de las políticas de desarrollo y los veía como agentes activos de sus propios procesos. Este artículo, después de explorar su punto de vista, presenta las posibles lecciones de Hirschman a la economía del desarrollo actual, en general, y al método de experimentos sociales controlados, en particular. Albert Hirschman spent almost five years in Colombia were he said he had acquired a point of view. This point of view led him to formulate an original approach to development, far from grand theories and mere empiricism. What he called a strategy of development relied not only on linkages between productive sectors but mostly on skills, beliefs and expectations necessary, and many times unexploited, to make a proactive decision process possible. He was convinced individuals were more than recipients of development policies, and saw them as active agents of their own development processes. In this paper, after exploring this point of view, I present what I see as Hirschman's possible lessons for modern day development economics, in general, and randomized field experiments, in particular. Albert Hirschman a vécu près de cinq années en Colombie où, selon lui, il s’est fait un point de vue. Ce point de vue lui a permis de formuler une approche originale du développement, éloignée des grandes théories et du simple empirisme ; il l’a appelée une stratégie de développement et il y soulignait les échelons entre les secteurs productifs mais surtout, les talents, croyances, et expectatives nécessaires, et souvent inexploitées pour permettre un processus dynamique de prise de décisions. Il était convaincu de ce que les individus étaient davantage que de simples bénéficiaires des politiques de développement et les voyait comme des agents actifs de leurs propres processus. Cet article, après avoir exploré son point de vue, présente les possibles leçons d’Hirschman sur l’économie du développement actuel en général, et sur la méthode d’expérimentations sociales contrôlées, en particulier. Albert Hirschman morou quase cinco anos na Colômbia onde, segundo ele, adquiriu um ponto de vista. Este ponto de vista lhe permitiu formular uma aproximação original ao desenvolvimento, afastada das grandes teorias e do mero empirismo; o chamou de uma estratégia de desenvolvimento e, nele, ressaltava os encadeamentos entre setores produtivos mas, principalmente, as habilidades, crenças e expectativas necessárias, e muitas vezes inexploradas, para tornar possível um processo dinâmico de tomada de decisões. Estava convencido de que os indivíduos eram mais do que simples beneficiários das políticas de desenvolvimento e os via como agentes ativos dos seus próprios processos. Este artigo, depois de explorar o seu ponto de vista, apresenta as possíveis lições de Hirschman à economia do desenvolvimento atual, em geral, e ao método de experimentos sociais controlados, em particular.
B20|Génesis, desarrollo e impacto de la eficiencia marginal del capital en teorías ecónómicas no keynesianas|Esta propuesta de ensayo contempla la posibilidad de contrastar la posición keynesiana sobre ciclos económicos con algunos contrapesos históricos. Particularmente se busca comprobar la aceptación, o no, del concepto de Eficiencia Marginal del Capital por parte de algunos pares teóricos de Keynes. Para ello se hará una revisión literaria que advierta la mayor cantidad de conexiones – ya sea a favor o en contra – entre la teoría keynesiana y otras escuelas económicas. La breve revisión histórica toma elementos de la economía clásica; luego se revisan otras posiciones teóricas contemporáneas a Keynes para terminar con algunos aportes neoclásicos. En ese orden de ideas, se podrán presentar algunos aportes de autores como Marshall, Mitchell, Hicks y Lucas. Se concluirá que no existe consenso, ni mucho menos beneplácito, sobre la teoría sobre ciclos de Keynes en las escuelas de pensamiento económico más modernas. Particularmente, se reconocerá y expondrá las diferencias entre unas teorías sobre ciclos donde prima la inestabilidad – caso de Keynes –, por otras donde se asegura la trayectoria hacia un equilibrio de parte del sistema económico.
B20|La influencia de la investigación operativa en la conformación de los precios comerciales y su impacto en las teorías del valor|A partir del estudio técnico, tecnológico e histórico de la evolución de la investigación operativa,como disciplina matemática aplicada al campo de la Economía Política previo desarrollo de la manufactura y la maquinaria, el autor estudia la influencia de dicha disciplina en la conformación de los costes de producción y su influencia en los precios de producción, así como el impacto que ello supone en los precios comerciales de las mercancías en tanto se trata de conectar esta influencia con la relación entre técnica y tecnología y teorías del valor. La forma en que tanto la teoría de la utilidad marginal como la teoría del valor trabajo enfocan esta influencia tecnológica será analizada desde la teoría del cierre categorial, teoría de la ciencia desarrollada por el filósofo español Gustavo Bueno.
B20|Does market coordination lead to justice or to strict efficiency in Social Choice and Individual Values?|The paper tries to clarify the status of the market in Social Choice and Individual Values. It shows how Arrow at first intended to propose a third theorem of welfare economics (Feldman [1991]), which would show that the market achieves not only Pareto-optimality, but also equitable social allocations. The impossibility theorem proves this is impossible. Arrow’s solution to impossibility is interpreted here as a further limitation of the market’s objectives. At the end of the book, the market is presented as a technical mechanism that guarantees economic efficiency, if it doesn’t take individual values into consideration.
B20|Modeling the interaction of cycles and growth in the fifties: two schumpeterian attempts|In post-war macroeconomics, economic dynamics generally refers to two distinct phenomena, economic growth and business cycles, which implies the existence of a strict dichotomy between short run and long-run analysis. In this paper we focus on two original exceptions to this prevailing view during the fifties: the attempt made by A. Smithies using ratchet effects, and the nonlinear approach initiated by Goodwin. Both explicitly refer to Schumpeter’s view on cyclical growth combined with postwar macroeconomic advances. However, they did not really succeed to overcome the major difficulties of a unified analysis of cycles and growth, stressed notably by Pasinetti in 1960. On the one hand, the introduction of ratchet effects into consumption or investment functions does not provide, contrary to Smithies’s claim, an endogenous explanation of cycles and growth. On the other hand, Goodwin’s nonlinear approach provides a promising perspective, but, in the fifties his attempt to connect a Keynesian framework with Schumpeterian insights remains rather tentative.
B20|Ragnar Frisch and the Postwar Norwegian Economy|In the story of Norwegian economics, and of Norwegian economic policy and performance during the postwar years, a central place must be given to Ragnar Frisch (1895–1973). In 1969 he was awarded the first Nobel Prize in economics, together with Jan Tinbergen (1903–1994). In our view, the brighter parts of the story come only in the later years, and they involve the overcoming of Frisch’s influence and legacy. As professor, Frisch started a grand project to establish economics as a science based on mathematical models and quantitative analysis, creating what became known as the “Oslo School.” This school contributed to the development of a system of economic planning that became close to the centrally planned economies of Eastern Europe. The Norwegian postwar planned economy managed in the first three decades to achieve growth rates on par with the other countries in Western Europe. Growth was achieved, however, partly through investment ratios that were significantly higher than that of other countries; as a consequence, both private and public consumption rates were substantially lower. At the end of the 1970s the inefficiency of the planned economy impelled a change. Reform moved Norway toward a more decentralized market economy, where markets would be governed through a framework of general laws, taxes, and levies. The grand vision of Ragnar Frisch had dissolved.
B20|Ragnar Frisch and the Postwar Norwegian Economy: A Critical Comment on SÃ¦ther and Eriksen|This article is a critical review of the picture drawn by Arild SÃ¦ther and Ib Eriksen (2014) of the economic policy and development of postwar Norway and of the influence exerted by Ragnar Frisch. Regarding the postwar economy the present article draws on a number of comprehensive studies by American and other scholars, and finds that the presentation in SÃ¦ther and Eriksen (2014) is seriously flawed. Also flawed is SÃ¦ther and Eriksen’s discussion related to Ragnar Frisch’s teaching and general influence. In the characterization of Frisch and to some extent of the Norwegian economists as a group the problem is not so much ignorance as ideological and moralistic bias, leading SÃ¦ther and Eriksen astray and relieved from the obligation of providing evidence for assertions, not least for defamatory ones.
B20|A Reply to Olav Bjerkholt on the Postwar Norwegian Economy|Professor Olav Bjerkholt has provided a spirited critique of our 2014 article titled “Ragnar Frisch and the Postwar Norwegian Economy.” Here we reply briefly, noting that many of the quotations he provides actually support our interpretation, that it is naÃ¯ve of him to play the ideology card, and that he offers no response whatsoever to our central point: that Norway’s postwar growth rates have to be understood in light of the country’s exceptionally high investment ratios, which meant that Norwegian consumers were consuming less in order to sustain those growth rates.
B20|Chasing the B: A Bibliographic Account of Economics’ Relation to its Past, 1991-2011|Some historians argue that the history of economic thought (HET) is useful and important to economists and that historians should remain in economics departments. Others believe that historians’ initiatives toward economists are doomed in advance to failure and that they should instead ally themselves with historians and sociologists of science located in humanities departments. Generally, the contributions that are devoted to reviewing the state of HET take a firm side for either one of these two positions and therefore have a prescriptive view on how history should be written. By contrast, our paper proposes a descriptive account of the kind of contributions to HET that have been published in major economics journals over the past two decades. To avoid definitional issues over HET, we use the B category of the JEL classification to retrieve and analyze the relevant literature. We show that, though contributions to HET are still found in top economics journals, the rate of publication of such papers has become increasingly uneven and the methods and narrative styles they adopt are increasingly remote from that advocated in the sub-disciplinary literature. For this reason, historians who are still willing to address the economics’ community should be more interested in expanding the frontiers of their field rather than in trying to anticipate their targeted readers’ preferences..
B20|Development thresholds of foreign aid effectiveness in Africa|Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to examine whether initial levels in GDP growth, GDP per capita growth and inequality adjusted human development matter in the impact of aid on development. In substance its object is to assess if threshold development conditions are necessary for the effectiveness of foreign aid in Africa. Design/methodology/approach - – The panel quantile regression technique enables us to investigate if the relationship between development dynamics and development assistance differs throughout the distributions of development dynamics. Findings - – Three main findings are established. First, with slight exceptions, the effectiveness of aid in economic prosperity (at the macro level) increases in positive magnitude across the distribution. This implies high-growth countries are more likely to benefit from development assistance (in terms of general economic growth) than their low-growth counterparts. Second, the positive nexus between aid and per capita economic growth displays nonlinear patterns across distributions and specifications, with the correlations broadly higher in top quantiles than in bottom quantiles after controlling for the unobserved heterogeneity. Third, the aid-human development nexus is negative and almost similar in magnitude across distributions and specifications. Practical implications - – As a policy implication, there is need to improve management of aid funds destined for health and education projects in the sampled countries. Moreover, given the magnitude of the nexuses, while blanket aid initiatives could be applied for policies targeting the human development index (due to the absence of significant differences in the magnitude of estimated coefficients), such are unlikely to succeed for aid targeting economic prosperity at macro and micro levels. From the weight of the findings, given a policy of balancing the impact of aid, it could be inferred that low-growth countries would need more aid than their high-growth counterparts because of the less positive effects in the former countries. Originality/value - – This paper contributes to existing literature on the effectiveness of foreign aid by focussing on the distribution of the dependent variables (development dynamics). It is likely that high- and low-growth countries respond differently to development assistance.
B20|The theory of the firm in the scientific work of graziani|"The analysis of the scientific production of Graziani is a difficult but challenging task. His contributions to numerous areas of economics provide plenty of interesting and stimulating insights. However, the search for a systematic assessment of his work proves to be extremely complex. This turns out to be particularly true for his contributions to fields that have not been at the very centre of his research agenda, as is the case of the theory of the firm. In order to provide a tentative analysis of his contribution in this field, this note presents a rapid overview of Graziani’s critical evaluation of the neoclassical theory of the firm, from his textbook analysis to his critical remark on the design of incentive policies. The note aims at showing that his originality, joint with the full command of the ""orthodox"" theory, made Graziani capable of providing interesting insights even in this field."
B20|Implications of different understandings of financial crises for divergent conclusions on the connections between finance and sustainability|The reasons and implications of different understandings of the ongoing financial crisis may be thoroughly assessed by starting the investigation from a taxonomy of the competing visions of the capitalist system and of the approach required to understand it. This paper focuses in particular on the nexus between money/credit/finance (from now on “money”) on one side and the real economy on the other side and is articulated in a sequence of sections grouped in three parts. The first part sketches the historical and conceptual path that leads from the early reflections on money to the recent insights on financialisation, stressing only the basic conceptual options and their implications. The analysis starts from the quantitative aspects of money that have been since long a crucial object of political economy, then economics and finally macroeconomics. Section 2 I sketches a bird’s eye view of the mainstream approach from Hume to Woodford; then section 3 outlines the parallel evolution of the heterodox point of view from Marx to Minsky. Section 4 discusses the main views of orthodox and heterodox economists on money as structure. Section 5 investigates why the different paradigms mentioned above lead to different understandings of the meaning and role of financialisation. The second part sketches the conceptual path that leads from the early reflections on economic crises to different understandings of the great crises and to contrasting views on the sustainability of the economic system. Section 6 I discusses the foundations and implications of different views on business-cycle crises while section 7 I considers the main approaches to the understanding and control of great crises. Finally section 8 examines the concepts of sustainability associated to the paradigms analysed above. The third part investigates the interaction between financialisation and sustainability from the synchronic point of view (section 9), and then from the diachronic point of view (section 10), focusing on their broad policy implications. Section 11 concludes.
B20|Financialisation and Sustainability:a Long-run Perspective|This paper argues that there is a secular tendency towards financialisation that is intrinsic in the development of market relations. The driving force of this evolutionary process is rooted in a progressive but discontinuous flow of financial innovations meant to remove the existing constraints to the flexibility of economic transactions. According to received wisdom, the adoption of money as medium of exchange has removed the strictures of double coincidence of wants, while the modern forms of credit have been developed to relax the cash-in-advance constraint to economic transactions. As these examples suggest, financial innovations aim to extend the set of exchange options in time, space and contents for the decision makers who introduce them. Financial innovations are adopted because, ceteris paribus, a larger option set is positively correlated with higher expected returns and pay-off opportunities. Their systemic effects, however, may have negative implications such as financial instability, underinvestment in the real sector, unemployment, stagnation. When the negative consequences accumulate beyond a tolerable threshold, the remedy has been sought in stricter rules of self-regulation, or rather of regulation by law, or even in severe measures of financial repression. The fact that this did not happen so far after the recent deep crisis has further enhanced the unsustainability of the current process of financialisation.
B20|Monetary Policy and Value Judgments : Did we forget Myrdal’s legacy ?|"Myrdal’s works are usually analysed with a dual and separated point of view : on the one hand the methodological papers concerning the value problem and based on a strong non neutrality thesis ; on the other part the theoretical analysis concerning monetary theory and policy, with a Wicksellian filiation. In fact both the dimensions are strongly connected by a common way : the application of the Hägerström’s Swedish guillotine between is and ought, but also the construction of a bridge between economic science and political views on social engineering and economic policy. Myrdal wants to address this problem : how economic science can become politically relevant ? This paper analyses two stages of that unique project : the proposition of a ""technology of economics"" (1930), and the selection process for a ""norm for monetary policy"" (1939). It shows that Myrdal distorts an initial end and means scheme by proposing some intermediary concepts between positive and normative fields. From a theoretical and statistical framework and an explicit value judgment these concepts enable to elaborate an iterative tree of selection of a speci-c monetary policy. If the Myrdal’s project encounters difficulties in conciliating a non-cognitivist thesis with economic prescriptions and in proposing a tractable method, it remains an important benchmark for the analysis of the links between positive and normative views concerning monetary policy."
B20|Becoming Applied: The Transformation of Economics after 1970|This paper conjectures that economics has changed profoundly since the 1970s and that these changes involve a new understanding of the relationship between theoretical and applied work. Drawing on an analysis of John Bates Clark medal winners, it is suggested that the discipline became more applied, applied work being accorded a higher status in relation to pure theory than was previously the case. Discussing new types of applied work, the changing context of applied work, and new sites for applied work, the paper outlines a research agenda that will test the conjecture that there has been a changed understanding of the nature of applied work and hence of economics itself.
B20|Slaves or Mercenaries: Milton Friedman and the Institution of the All-Volunteer Military|Milton Friedman was the leading public proponent for an all-volunteer military. This chapter traces his influence upon the national debate over conscription, which culminated in Friedman’s service on the Gates Commission. Friedman’s argument relied on economic reasoning and appeal to cost-benefit analysis. Central was his conjecture that the social cost of the draft, which imposed an “implicit tax” on draftees, exceeded that of the all-volunteer military. This was supported by the work of Walter Oi. Friedman’s position attracted support both within the conservative movement and from across the political landscape, allowing Friedman to form coalitions with prominent individuals otherwise in disagreement with his politics. With the social context ripened by the draft and the Vietnam War, Friedman’s argument echoed in influential circles, reaching policymakers in Washington and Martin Anderson on the Nixon advising team. The successful institution of the all-volunteer armed force reflected Friedman’s intellectual entrepreneurship.
B20|Crises e Ciclos no Pensamento Económico Português na Primeira Metade do Século XX|This research aims to critically assess the references to theories of crises and economic cycles that existed in the main textbooks on political economy of Portuguese universities during the first half of the 20th Century, and, as much as possible, categorise their authors into international trends of economic thought. The conclusions support the position that the various studies that have been made of the panorama of economic thought in Portugal up to the end of the first half of the past century, have essentially shown, namely, a delay in the reception of new economic theories and an absence of autonomous production during that period.

B20|Economic Development and the Effectiveness of Foreign Aid: A Historical Perspective|In this paper I discuss the effectiveness of foreign aid from a historical perspective. I show that foreign aid is a relatively new concept in economics, and I emphasize the role of exchange rate policies in the foreign aid controversies of the 1970s through 1990s. I show that in the early 1980s there were major changes in views regarding aid and agriculture. I emphasize the role of “ownership” of aid programs by the recipient countries as a way of increasing effectiveness. I argue that there is little hope of making progress in these debates if the economics profession continues to rely, almost exclusively, on cross section regressions. In order to move forward, these analyses need to be supplemented by in depth case studies that follow a country’s history for many decades.
B20|The Curious Treatment of the Coase Theorem in the Environmental Economics Literature, 1960--1979| This article examines the first two decades of the history of the Coase theorem in environmental economics, a period during which the theorem's validity was widely acknowledged but its relevance for economic analysis of environmental issues was almost universally dismissed. The repeated claims of the theorem's irrelevance and its dismissive treatment in the literature raise the question of why environmental economists were so interested in the Coase theorem in the first place. Several explanations are offered here including the roots of environmental economic theory in the theory of externalities, economists' fascination with the interesting and challenging theoretical puzzle posed by the theorem, and the normative and ideological thrust that permeated discussions of the theorem, both within and outside the field of environmental economics.

B20|Evaluation and Determining Risks in an Entity through Methods Adapted to Economic Vulnerability|The present economic situation in which we stand, attracts more and more the attention of specialists, researchers, managers of economic entities and governments, in order to take steps to protect primarily the economy and the survival of the business and secondly, in order to optimize the harnessing of the resources available and the discovery of new technologies for replacement of exhaustible and non-renewable raw materials. The entire company is concerned by the numerous analysis and research conducted in the idea of improving the effects of the economic crisis, the discovery in due time of the risks economic entities are exposed to and mitigation of uncertainties on the evolution of a business activity.
B20|La disoccupazione nell'Italia fascista. Dinamiche reali, riflessione teorica e indagine statistica (Unemployment in fascist Italy. Real changes, theoretical analysis and statistical inquiry)|By the end of the 1920s the reduction of unemployment represented one of the goal of the fascist regime. To achieve this goal the state should have produced a reliable statistical information, and it should have dealt also with the placement, the execution of public works, the reclamation and especially the battle for ruralization. The target was not achieved: despite the proclamations and the announcements, until the mid-1930s the fascist economic policy did not improve neither the workers’ conditions nor the levels of employment. As shown by official data, unemployment regularly increased between 1925 and 1933. This statistical information is not completely reliable, as confirmed by a debate started since then, but the official data could not have hidden the real growth of the number of unemployed. Several facts indicate a possible attitude of the regime – and of its scholars – to hide or underestimate the existence of imbalances in the labour market. Fascism planned a rigid control of the labor market in order to reduce the conflicts arising from a chronic excess of labour supply. Between the two wars the emigration flows decreased, due both to the restrictions imposed by the United States and to the fascist population policy. The 1929 crisis, then, aggravated the situation of the labour market. The ruralist myth and the anti-urbanist rhetoric aimed to mask unemployment. Between the two wars the corporative themes influenced the theoretical debate, which did not offer adequate answers to the phenomenon of mass unemployment. Italian economists took little account of the new theoretical suggestions from Keynes’ General Theory. Many demographers also supported the compatibility between the demographic policies of the regime and its action to combat unemployment.
B20|International aid corruption and fiscal behavior policy|The Okada & Samreth (2012, EL) and Asongu (2012, EB; 2013, EEL) debate on ‘the effect of foreign aid on corruption’ has had an important influence in policy and academic circles. This paper provides a unifying framework by using investment and fiscal behavior transmission channels in 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. The richness of the dataset enables us to disaggregate countries into 16 panels depicting fundamental characteristics of corruption based on wealth-effects, legal origins, openness to sea, petroleum-exporting, regional proximity and religious domination. Findings unite the two streams of the debate and broadly suggest that while the ‘government’s final consumption expenditure’ channel is consistent with the latter author, the investment and tax effort channels are in line with the former authors. Justifications for the nexuses are provided. Policy implications on how to use foreign aid constraints in managing fiscal behavior as means of reducing (increasing) corruption (corruption-control) are discussed.

Partnerships proposals actively promoted favorable conditions.
B20|Taxation, foreign aid and political governance: figures to the facts of a celebrated literature|This paper puts figures to the facts of Eubank (2012), a recently celebrated paper in the Journal of Development Studies. We investigate the underpinning Somaliland-based hypothesis that foreign aid dilutes the positive role of taxation on political governance. The assessment is based on 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. For more policy options, the dataset is disaggregated into fundamental characteristics of African development based on income-levels, legal origins, natural resources and landlockeness. While the Eubank hypothesis is invalid in baseline Africa, low-income and English common law countries of the continent, we cannot conclude on its validity for other fundamental characteristics of development. Policy implications, caveats and future directions are discussed.
B20|Foreign Aid and Corruption: Clarifying Murky Empirical Conclusions|This note reconciles an on-going debate on the effect of foreign aid on corruption by introducing a previously missing heterogeneity dimension of aid. The relationship was estimated using dynamic system GMM and quantile regressions (QR). Results show that both narratives in the debate are correct, contingent on the type of development assistance. The QR results are robust to endogeneity when the independent variables of interest are instrumented with their first-lags.

B20|A brief clarification to the questionable economics of foreign aid for inclusive human development|The study clarifies the questionable economics of foreign aid for inclusive human development. It investigates the effect of a plethora of foreign aid dynamics on the inequality adjusted human development index. Contemporary and non-contemporary OLS, Fixed-effects and a system GMM technique with forward orthogonal deviations are employed. The empirical evidence is based on a sample of 53 African countries for the period 2005-2012. The following findings are established. First, the impacts of aid dynamics with high degrees of substitution are positive. These include, aid for: social infrastructure, economic infrastructure, the productive sector and the multi-sector. Second, the effect of humanitarian assistance is consistently negative across specifications and models. Third, the effects of programme assistance and action on debts are ambiguous because they become positive with the GMM technique. Justifications for these changes and clarifications with respect to existing literature are provided. Policy implications are discussed in light of Piketty’s celebrated literature and the post-2015 development agenda. We also provide some recommendations for a rethinking of theories and models on which development assistance is based.
B20|Foreign aid, investment and fiscal policy behavior: theory and empirical evidence|The paper provides theoretical and empirical justifications for the instrumentality of foreign aid in stimulating private investment and fixed capital formation through fiscal policy mechanisms. We propose an endogenous growth theory based on an extension of Barro (1990) by postulating that the positive effect of aid mitigates the burden of the taxation system on the private sector of recipient countries. The empirical validity is based on 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. While the findings on the tax effort channel are overwhelmingly consistent with theory across specifications and fundamental characteristics, those of the government expenditure channel are a little heterogeneous but broadly in line with the theoretical postulations. Justification for the slight heterogeneity and policy implications are discussed.
B20|Reinventing foreign aid for inclusive and sustainable development: a survey|This survey essay reviews over 200 papers in arguing that in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive development, foreign aid should not orient developing countries towards industrialisation in the perspective of Kuznets but in the view of Piketty. Abandoning the former’s view that inequality will fall with progress in industrialisation and placing more emphasis on inequality in foreign aid policy will lead to more sustainable development outcomes. Inter alia: mitigate short-term poverty; address concerns of burgeoning population growth; train recipient governments on inclusive development; fight corruption and mismanagement and; avoid the shortfalls of celebrated Kuznets’ conjectures. We discuss how the essay addresses post-2015 development challenges and provide foreign aid policy instruments with which discussed objectives can be achieved. In summary, the essay provides useful policy measures to avoid past pitfalls. ‘Output may be growing, and yet the mass of the people may be becoming poorer’ (Lewis, 1955). ‘Lewis led all developing countries to water, proverbially speaking, some African countries have so far chosen not to drink’ (Amavilah, 2014). Piketty (2014) has led all developing countries to the stream again and a challenging policy syndrome of our time is how foreign aid can help them to drink.

Its evolution up to the present state of a distinguished discipline can be divided into six distinct phases. The paper argues that the modern Islamic economics was never a sectarian subject.

B20|Will the Financial Crisis Become a Milestone in the Development of Methodology of Economics?|It has been widely accepted that philosophers of science wrote a “swansong” for positivism during the second half of the 20th century. Milton Friedman and Paul Samuelson, major contributors in the fi eld of economic methodology at the time, the argument goes, never refl ected the demise. Therefore, positivist roots are still to be found in infl uential theoretical concepts developed by mainstream economists. Specifi cally, I present the hypothesis of rational expectations and the theory of effi cient markets as two signifi cant outcomes of a “high tide” of positivist thinking in economics. However, quite a large number of scholars currently share the view that the two concepts contributed in a non-negligible manner to the development leading to the fi nancial crisis culminating in 2008 and 2009 and should be replaced by behavioural or other approaches. The article thus asks, in quite a novel way, if the crisis - seen by many as an empirical rejection of both the concepts - can also be seen as a milestone in the development of methodology of economics.
B20|Formation and (Re)Formation of Spatial Identities under Globalization|Present essay tries to discuss the process of formation and reformation of spatial identities in the aftermath of globalization. The basic premise of the paper is that identities are more often remain attached to space and these are direct outcome of the culture if the culture is taken as sum total of one’s interaction with the given surroundings. Then it is but natural to presume that both space and time one belongs to have a limit in opted approach. The local patterns and designs grow and have their uniqueness and identity considerably recognizable in creativeness, reflections, in formation of ideologies and so on. Further the article seeks to analyze the role of knowledge as a deciding force in the formation of such identities as second premise of the paper is that it is knowledge of different kinds ‘local’ and ‘global’; ‘tacit’ and ‘explicit’ that is basis of culture. People with dominating tendency if organized themselves as power-unit use the raw products of information, ideas, and ideologies by innocent but sincere people as roots in their intentional aims to dominate and produce cultural hegemony through creation of so-called ‘knowledge society’ and ‘knowledge economy’. It is in this context that the paper argues that dispersed/fragmented concentration of knowledge has led to formation of different kinds of spatial identities that are transnational and at the same time sub-national.

B20|On Ricardo and Cambridge|David Ricardo’s key place in the history of economic thought is well established. However, both the understanding of his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation and its role in the development of economic analysis is much more controversial. Cambridge economists have contributed significantly to both of these issues. They have played an important part in two extremely divergent interpretations of Ricardo’s place in the development of economic thought. Understanding how Ricardo has been viewed in Cambridge does not result in homogeneity, but in a spectrum of interpretations. In this paper, we focus on the role of Ricardo’s Principles in the development of economics as seen by Cambridge economists.
B20|Verborgene metaphysischen Voraussetzungen in der zeitgenössischen Wirtschaftslehre|Der Text klärt zunächst den Begriff der Metaphysik, der sich auch bei Adam Smith finden lässt. Es zeigt sich, dass die Metaphysik ein formales Schema ist, in dem wissenschaftliche Aussagen formuliert werden, ohne dieses Schema selbst zu reflektieren. Die Wirtschaftswissenschaften erscheinen in Forschung und Anwendung als formal exakte Theorie, die der physikalischen Mechanik bis in die mathematischen Details gleicht. Die Mechanik fungiert hier als verborgene Metaphysik. Diese physikalistische Denkform verfehlt aber das freie und kreative menschliche Handeln, dessen Totalität die Ökonomie ausmacht. Wird sie dennoch praktisch angewandt, so scheitert sie als prognostische Wissenschaft und fungiert faktisch als implizite Ethik.
B20|On the effectiveness of foreign aid in institutional quality|We extend the Okada & Samreth (2012, EL) and Asongu (2012, EB) debate on ‘the effect of foreign aid on corruption’ by: not partially negating the former’s methodological underpinning (as in the latter’s approach) with a unifying empirical framework and; broadening the horizon of inquiry from corruption to eight institutional quality dynamics (rule of law, regulation quality, government effectiveness, democracy, corruption, voice & accountability, control of corruption and political stability). Core to this extension is a hypothetical contingency of the ‘institutional perils of foreign aid’ on existing institutional quality such that, the institutional downside of development assistance maybe questionable when greater domestic institutional development has taken place. Based on the hypothesis of institutional thresholds for foreign aid effectiveness, the perilous character of development assistance to institutional quality is broadly confirmed in 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010.
B20|Consult your gods: the questionable economics of development assistance in Africa|This paper assesses the aid-development nexus in 52 African countries using updated data (1996-2010) and a new indicator of human development (adjusted for inequality). The effects of Total Net Official Development Assistance (NODA), NODA from the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and NODA from Multilateral donors on economic prosperity (at national and per capita levels) are also examined. The findings broadly indicate that development assistance is detrimental to GDP growth, GDP per capita growth and inequality adjusted human development. The magnitude of negativity (which is consistent across specifications and development dynamics) is highest for NODA from Multilateral donors, followed by NODA from DAC countries. Given concerns on the achievement of the MDGs, the relevance of these results point to the deficiency of foreign aid as a sustainable cure to poverty in Africa. Though the stated intents or purposes of aid are socio-economic, the actual impact from the findings negates this. It is a momentous epoque to solve the second tragedy of foreign aid; it is high time economists and policy makers start rethinking the models and theories on which foreign aid is based. In the meantime, it is up to people who care about the poor to hold aid agencies accountable for piecemeal results. Policy implications and caveats are discussed.
B20|On the channels of foreign aid to corruption|The debate by Okada & Samreth (2012, EL) and Asongu (2012, EB; 2013, EEL) on ‘the effect of foreign aid on corruption' in its current state has the shortcoming of modeling corruption as a direct effect of development assistance. This note extends the debate by assessing the channels of foreign aid to corruption in 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. Two main findings are established to unite the two streams of the debate. (1) Foreign aid channeled through government's consumption expenditure increases corruption. (2) Development assistance channeled via private investment and tax effort decreases corruption. It follows that foreign aid that is targeted towards reducing corruption should be channeled via private investment and tax effort, not through government expenditure. Our results integrate an indirect component and reconcile the debate by showing that, the effect could either be positive or negative depending on the transmission channel.
B20|The (Normal) Rate of Capacity Utilization at the Firm Level|This paper examines the endogeneity (or lack thereof) of the rate of capacity utilization in the long run at the firm level. We provide economic justification for the adjustment of the desired rate of utilization toward the actual rate on behalf of a cost-minimizing firm after examining the factors that determine the utilization of resources. The cost-minimizing firm has an incentive to increase the utilization of its capital if the rate of the returns to scale decreases as its production increases. The theory of economies of scale provides justification for this kind of behavior. In this manner, the desired rate of utilization becomes endogenous.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B20|Development and goals of competition law|The article presents the historical development of competition law discussing reasons for adopting particular national antimonopoly legislation. The following analysis of goals of competition law leads to the conclusion that there is no agreement what goals competition law should have. Furthermore some of identified goals of competition law are conflicting. Nonetheless the majority of national competition laws and the academics accept that competition law should aim at achieving the basic economic goals that is consumer welfare. The rest of possible goals of competition law depend on political choices of governments.
B20|General Equilibrium and Social Justice: Neoclassical Theory as a Political Philosophy?|We study the willingness of some authors, including H. Varian in the 70’s, to elaborate a theory of justice that would fit standard general equilibrium theory in its Pareto’s canonical version. We first show, through an analysis of market socialism in the 30’s, that the Paretian ethic is based on the value judgment of consumer sovereignty. Then we are able to discuss the specific contribution of Varian, who, by introducing the criterion of equity as envy-freeness, produces a – very specific – theory of justice that seems compatible with this value judgment and can stand at the heart of standard general equilibrium analysis.
B20|Lecciones olvidadas de tres economistas difuntos|En este trabajo el autor se lamenta de la importancia cada vez menor que se otorga a la historia del pensamiento económico en la comunidad académica mundial, defiende que esta recesión está dando lugar a visiones unidimensionales de la obra de los principales autores en economía y afirma que, si lo analizamos de cerca, podemos sorprendernos de la simplicidad de las concepciones más corrientes. Como triple ilustración, básicamente citando algunas partes omitidas de sus trabajos, el autor hace hincapié en los casos de Adam Smith, Francis Ysidro Edgeworth y John Maynard Keynes, que imparten lecciones cruciales ignoradas por la mayoría de la generación actual de economistas.
B20|The Informal Economy in Monsoon Asia and Melanesia: West New Guinea and the Malay World|his is the third in a series of papers concerned with the intellectual history of the 'informal economy' and its relevance to current concerns in Papua New Guinea (PNG; the eastern half of the island of New Guinea). Proceeding from the observation that monetized informal economic activity in PNG has been of relatively limited importance, the paper seeks explanations by comparing two stylized constructs, Monsoon Asia (where the informal economy is dynamic) and Melanesia (where it is limited in scope and contribution to livelihoods). Papua (occupying the western half of the island of New Guinea) is seen as a meeting point, or zone of transition, between Monsoon Asia and Melanesia. A long history of 'trading and raiding' on this frontier marked the encounter between ceremonial exchange, as practiced by Melanesians, and the system of tribute imposed on Papuans by Moluccan sultanates. Limited economic specialization and exchange in Melanesia contrasted with the Asian household economy, enmeshed in complex social hierarchies and systems of occupational differentiation. Historically, the Malay Archipelago engaged in a world trading system, into which it drew west New Guinea/Papua over millennia. Travelling peddlers played a key role in the archipelagic trade system, demonstrating the antiquity of the informal economy tradition in the cultures of Monsoon Asia. The paper seeks explanations for the comparative absence of that tradition in Melanesia. Finally, it examines the recent and rapid emergence of an informal economy in Papua, dominated by non-Melanesian immigrants, in the wake of the incorporation of (Dutch) west New Guinea into the Republic of Indonesia in 1963.
B20|Convention, interest rates and monetary policy: a post-Keynesianâ€“French-conventions-school approach|This article aims at analysing the relationship between conventions and monetary policy using both the post-Keynesian and the French-conventions-school approaches, treated as complementary; and stressing the design of monetary policy frameworks (for example, inflation targeting) and the setting of interest rates as phenomena highly governed by conventions. The Brazilian monetary policy after the mid 1990s â€“ marked by the highest real interest rates in the world â€“ will be used as a case study.
B20|Economic Theory and Policy in Dictatorship and Democracy: Spain 1939-1996|The role played by economists and thus economic theory in implementing the Spanish economic policy during the second half of the 20th century is the main topic analysed in this article. Political framework indeed is crucial for understanding the relationships between Spanish economists and economic policy during the period. The authoritarian regime imposed by victorious General Franco did not leave room to economic rationality as he entrusted economic policy to engineers politically committed with the dictatorship. Later on, once these policies proved to be ruinous, a group of technocrats assumed the responsibility for economic policy on the basis of more rational principles although political goals prevailed on economic ones. The advent of democracy in the mid-1970s, however, meant the contribution of economists to both the transformation of the economic institutions and the implementation of the economic policy that took place during a period of economic turbulences.
B20|Central Banking, Japanese Style: Economics and the Bank of Japan, 1945-1985|The paper deals with the relationship between economics and monetary policy from 1945 to 1984, conducted by the Bank of Japan. During the period Japan has experienced almost all types of growth rate change from high inflation to disinflation, and the monetary policy of the BOJ was discussed, and sometimes criticized. The paper shows that the behavior of the BOJ has been trying to be consistent with its particular interpretation of the policy objective, prescriptions, and past history as well as its bureaucratic concern over its own survival as an organization. However, this does not mean that there has been no conflict of ideas within the BOJ. Despite its attempt to portray itself as a unified entity, there have been several strands of thought within it, which evolved historically.
B20|Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa: Macroeconomic and Monetary Thought, and Policy-making at the European Commission|Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa was one of the great architects of the euro. He is remembered in particular as co-rapporteur for the Delors Committee and as a founding member of the European Central Bank’s Executive Board. For Padoa-Schioppa, becoming Director-General of the European Commission’s DG II (from 1979 to 1983), was a defining moment in his career and life. This period is the main focus of this paper. At the Commission, Padoa- Schioppa’s main priority was the European Monetary System, which was launched in March 1979. He was closely involved in several projects to strengthen the EMS, to improve economic policy convergence and develop the position of the ECU. The other main objective for Padoa-Schioppa was the strengthening of DG II’s analytical capacity, especially its model-building capacity and its links with the academic world. As such, he played a crucial role in the professionalization of economics at the Commission and in preparing DG II for the important role it would play in the EMU process. This also shows that, for assessing the legacy of an economist, it is not only important to look at his own writings and contributions, but also how he shapes the institutions in which he participates.
B20|La scienza delle finanze in italia nel trentennio 1915-1945|The essay examines various aspects of the teaching of public finance in the Italian universities during the period of thirty years 1915-1945: the academic staff; the chair competitions; the main textbooks; the main theoretical contributions of public finance scholars.
B20|Causal Structures In Economics: Fuzzyness And Supervenience As Ontological Problems|"In his article ""The Causal Structure of the World"" (2010), Wesley Salmon observes that the work contained in the Reichenbach´s famous paper of 1925 broke the grund for a development that flourishes today. Reichenbach´s main concerns in ""The Causal Structure of the World and the Difference Between Past and Future"" (1925) centered on causal determinism, i.e., the thesis famously articulated by Laplace that throughout the history of the universe what happens in the future is rigidly determined by what has happened in the past. But Reichenbach desagreed with Laplace: he believed that, at any given moment, the past is completely determined but the future remains, at least partially, undetermined. This distinction could be drawn in terms of certain probabilistic structures, and this oppinion led him to formulate a theory of probabilistic causality. Considering the probabilistic approach to knowledge in Economics, Kevin Hoover (2001) sustains the thesis according to which the literature on causality has been shaped by causal intuitions that suggest the existence of causal structures, revealed in the way things work. Both authors appeal, as we can see, to the structural configuration of reality. Both of them refuse to accept a rigid causal determinism and, in doing so, they set the conditions to discuss many ontological consequences of the undeterministic point of view, like ontological fuzzyness and the necessity of supervenience to explain the way undeterministic causality works."
B20|Innovation concepts and typology – an evolutionary discussion|This paper is devoted to the analysis of evolution of innovation concepts, aspects and types. First emergence and evolution of different aspects and concepts of innovation are analyzed, and then the development of innovation concepts from a historical perspective and finally an overview of the types of innovation classifications developed in the literature are given. Complementary the different definitions of innovation are described and analyzed in detail. The main goal of the article is to identify, describe and visualize the development trend of innovation conceptualization and understanding over time
B20|Economics for the Masses : The Visual Display of Economic Knoledge in the United Staes (1921-1945)|The rise of visual representation in economics textbooks after WWII is one of the main features of contemporary economics. In this paper, we argue that this development has been preceded by a no less significant rise of visual representation in the larger literature devoted to social and scientific issues, including economic textbooks for non-economists as well as newspapers and magazines. During the interwar era, editors, propagandists and social scientists altogether encouraged the use of visual language as the main vehicle to spread information and opinions about the economy to a larger audience. These new ways of visualizing social facts, which most notably helped shape the understanding of economic issues by various audiences during the years of the Great Depression, were also conceived by their inventors as alternative ways of practicing economics: in opposition to the abstraction of “neoclassical” economics, these authors wanted to use visual representation as a way to emphasize the human character of the discipline and did not accept the strict distinction between the creation and the diffusion of economic knowledge. We explore different yet related aspects of these developments by studying the use of visual language in economics textbooks intended for non-specialists, in periodicals such as the Survey, a monthly magazine intended for an audience of social workers, the Americanization of Otto Neurath's pictorial statistics and finally the use of those visual representations by various state departments and administrations under Roosevelt's legislature (including the much-commented Historical Section of the Farm Security Administration). We show how visualizations that have been created in opposition to neoclassical economics have lost most of their theoretical content when used widely for policy purposes while being simultaneously integrated into the larger American culture. It is our claim that those issues, which are familiar to those involved in cultural and visual studies, are also of crucial importance to apprehend the later developments of modern economics.
B20|The Political Economy of Textbook Writing: Paul Samuelson and the making of the first ten Editions of Economics (1945-1976)|Over the past two decades, numerous contributions to the history of economics have tried to assess Paul Samuelson’s political positioning by tracing it in the subsequent editions of his famous textbook Economics. This literature, however, has provided no consensus about the location of Samuelson’s political ideas. While some authors believe that Samuelson has always had inclinations toward interventionism, others conclude that he more often acted as a pro-business advocate. The purpose of this paper is not to argue for one of these two interpretations but to depict the making of Economics itself as a political process. By ‘political’ it is not meant the conduct of party politics but the many political elements that a textbook author has to take into account if he wants to be published and favorably received. I argue that the “middle of the road” stance that Samuelson adopted in the book was consciously constructed by the MIT economist, with the help of his home institution and his publishing company, McGraw-Hill, to ensure both academic freedom and the success of the book. The reason for which the stance developed is related to pre-McCarthyist right-wing criticisms of the textbook and how Samuelson and the MIT department had to endure the pressures from members of the Corporation (MIT’s Board of Trustees), who tried to prevent the publication of the textbook and threatened Samuelson’s tenure at MIT as soon as 1947 – when early manuscripts were circulated. As a result, it was decided in accordance with both the Corporation and McGraw-Hill that the Readings volume would be published to balance conflicting ideas about state intervention. Following these early criticisms, the making of the subsequent editions relied on a network of instructors and referees all over the US in order to make it as successful and consensual as possible. This seemed to work quite well in the 1950s and for a good portion of the 1960s, until Economics became victim of its own success and was seen, in an ironical twist of fate, as a right wing text by younger, radical economists. From now on, Samuelson will try to have his book sent as often as possible to the radicals for referring process, with mixed results. Eventually, the book became criticized from both its left and its right.
B20|The principal problem in political economy: income distribution in the history of economic thought|The paper considers the history of theories of income distribution, from the time of Adam Smith until the 1970s. It is divided into two main parts. Part I considers the positive theory of income distribution, beginning with the classical economists’ analysis of the functional distribution of income between wages, profits and rent. It goes on to present the new theories that emerged with the marginalist revolution and which were based on maximizing behaviour and market equilibrium. The main focus during the early stages of the new developments was on the markets for consumer goods and the role of marginal utility in price determination. The later neoclassical economists, including Alfred Marshall and Knut Wicksell, paid more attention to the special features that characterized the labour market and the role of marginal productivity in wage formation. In the 20th century the neoclassical theory was extended to include analysis of the role of imperfect competition, human capital and risk-taking. Also included in this part of the paper is a discussion of statistical and institutional approaches. Part II covers normative theories of income distribution and their implications for redistributive policy. It begins with a consideration of the value judgements implicit in the policy recommendations of the classical economists and continues with the attempts to establish an analytical foundation for welfare economics. The rise of Paretian welfare theory with its emphasis on the impossibility of interpersonal comparisons of utility made it difficult to draw conclusions regarding income redistribution, but the older utilitarian approach, including equal sacrifice theories, continued to live on in the modern analysis of optimal redistribution. A short Part III contains some concluding reflections on the position of income distribution theory within economics as a whole.
B20|Innovation Concepts and Typology – An Evolutionary Discussion|This paper is devoted to the analysis of evolution of innovation concepts, aspect and types. First emergence and evolution of different aspects and concepts of innovation are analysed, then the development of innovation concepts from a historical perspective and finally an overview given of types of innovation classifications developed in the literature. Surrounding this different definitions of innovation are described and analyzed in detail. The main goal of the article is to define the trend of development of innovation conceptualization and understanding over time.
B20|Keynesian Dominance in Crisis Therapy|This paper scrutinizes the debate of Keynes and Hayek concerning the adequate re- sponse to economic crises from a historical perspective. In a first step the develop- ment of the Keynesian economic theory, its ascent during the Great Depression and its use during financially sound times is analyzed. In a second step the Hayekian cri- tique to discretionary government intervention and its long run consequences is scru- tinized. In the last step it is analyzed why, in the wake of a crisis, short-run oriented Keynesian therapy dominates long-run Hayekian therapy as in the most recent crisis.
B20|Between Nationalism And The Flat World Of Thomas Friedman|The present paper aims to disseminate the impact of globalization on the nation-state throughout the history. The research objective consists in the reviewing of the assertion of the globalization phenomenon and the conflicts it stirred at the national level by reasons related to cultural, economic, social or political issues. The analysis will be conducted by two antagonistic positions: an optimistic view according to which globalization has a positive effect overall and a pessimistic one under which globalization causes the decline of the nation-state. The main findings will show that nationalism is not doomed to disappear, but instead it will adapt over time and will steal from the benefits globalization brings everything that culturally, politically, socially, or economically suits to a certain nation.
B20|Love, war and cultures: an institutional approach to human evolution|Love, war and culture have all played an important role in the evolution of human institutions and they have been characterized by complex relationships. War can select unselfish groups ready to sacrifice themselves for the love of their communities that they recognize to be culturally different from the others. At the same time, horizontal cultural differentiation cannot be taken for granted. Culture is the outcome of long evolutionary processes. It requires some human specific characteristics, including a large brain, that are likely to have been influenced by sexual selection and by the peculiar structure of human love affairs. Thus, if war may have generated love, also the reverse may be true: by favoring the development of human culture, love may have produced the conditions for war among culturally differentiated groups. In turn, war may have co-evolved with group solidarity only under the prevailing social arrangements of hunting and gathering economies. In general, human relations have been influenced by the prevailing features of the goods (private, public and positional) that have characterized production in different stages of history. They have been embedded in institutions involving very different levels of inequality, ranging from mostly egalitarian hunting and gathering societies to typically hierarchical agrarian societies and to wealth-differentiated industrial societies. The perspectives of the present-day knowledge-intensive economy can also be seen through the same institutional approach to human evolution. The different nature of contemporary production processes involves a new set of alternative possible arrangements that have different implications for social (in)equality and different capabilities to satisfy basic human needs.

B20|The Financial and Economic Crisis and the Aberrance of Economics|Positivism-empiricism-falsificationism has become the ‘state-of-the-art’ methodology of economics. In this article it will be argued that this approach (1) suffers from (logical) deficiencies when applied to the science of human action and (2) has helped legitimizing, and putting into practice, policies that have actually contributed greatly to bringing about the latest financial and economic crisis. The ‘Austrian’, or to be more precise: the ‘Misesian’, method (praxeology) will be outlined as the proper methodology in the field of social science.
