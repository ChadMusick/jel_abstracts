M49|The Effect of Corporate Tax Planning On Firm Value|Objective – This research aims to empirically examine the effect of tax planning on firm value. The population of this research consists of manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) from 2014 to 2016. Methodology/Technique – This research uses 3 recent years and uses variables not used in previous research. The 43 respondents were chosen using purposive sampling. The hypotheses were tested using multiple regressions with Eviews program to determine the relationship between each independent variable to firm value. Findings – The empirical results show that tax planning that is measured by the cash effective tax rate has a negative effect on firm value, while tax planning measured by effective cash rate and tax savings has no effect on firm value. Novelty – The study recommends the need for firms to institute more robust tax planning practices that will help reduce their effective tax liabilities and therefore improve their overall value. Firms that engage in better tax planning practices are likely to get higher firm value. Type of Paper: Empirical.
M49|The Determinants of Islamic Social Reporting Disclosure in Indonesia|Objective – The purpose of this research is to identify the relationship between corporate performance, Good Corporate Governance (GCG), and corporate characteristics on Islamic Social Reporting disclosure in Indonesia. Methodology/Technique – A quantitative approach is applied in this research. The sample of this study consists of companies that were consistently listed on the Jakarta Islamic Index (JII) from 2012 to 2017. A purposive sampling method with certain criteria was employed to produce a total of 72 samplings. Partial Least Square (PLS) was also used to analyse the data. Findings – The results of this research indicate that corporate performance has a positive and significant effect on ISR disclosure, GCG has a positive and significant effect on ISR disclosure, and corporate characteristics have a negative and insignificant effect on ISR disclosure. Novelty – Islamic Social Reporting is the answer and solution to the needs of the interested parties concerned with the company's financial statements. ISR becomes a very important thing for the reputation and performance of Islamic financial institutions. Islamic financial institutions that succeed in revealing their ISR value will be perceived as a reliable entity by the Muslim community in channelling their fund. Type of Paper: Empirical.
M49|The Influence of Dividend Policy and Income Tax on Income Smoothing|Objective – This research aims to obtain the empirical evidence on the influence of dividend policy, income tax, firm size, profitability, and leverage on income smoothing. Methodology/Technique – In this research, income smoothing is proxied with the Eckel index and logistic regression is used to test the hypothesis. The research population consists of non-financial companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2013 to 2016. The sampling method used in this research is purposive sampling. The number of companies selected is 79 with 316 data. Findings – The results show that dividend policy, income tax, profitability, and leverage all have an influence on income smoothing. Meanwhile, firm size has no significant influence on income smoothing. Novelty – These findings are consistent with a firm's dividend policy and income tax having an incremental impact on income smoothing behavior. Type of Paper: Empirical.
M49|The Effect of Corporate Governance on Financial Performance in Non-Financial LQ-45 Firms Listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2012 to 2017|Objective – This research is conducted in order to determine what factors in corporate governance affect the financial performance of a firm. Methodology/Technique – Financial performance, as the dependent variable, is measured by Return on Asset (ROA), while the independent variables (corporate governance) are measured using Board Independence, Board Size, Dividend, Firm Size, and Financial Leverage. The sampling method used in this research is purposive sampling. The requirements for the sample of this research are the non – financial firms included in LQ-45 from 2012 to 2017 that publish annual reports that are available to the public. The research method used in this paper is a quantitative method. Panel data analysis technique and E-views tools were also used. Findings – The results indicate that firm size and percentage of board independence has no effect on financial performance, while board size, dividends, and financial leverage all effect financial performance. Novelty – The study adds to the literature of corporate government and firm performance in emerging countries. Type of Paper: Empirical.

The sampling method used in this research is purposive sampling. 64 companies are examined, with 192 items of data being obtained. Finding - This research also uses statistical testing through a multiple regression. The results show that return on assets, financial leverage, free cash flow, and sales growth all have an influence on earnings management. Meanwhile, other variables such as managerial ownership, institutional ownership, board size, the presence of an audit committee, firm size, and audit quality have no significant effect on earnings management. Novelty - In this research, company characteristics are proxied with the return on assets, financial leverage, firm size, free cash flow, and sales growth, while corporate governance is proxied with managerial ownership, institutional ownership, board size, and the presence of an audit committee. Type of Paper - Empirical.
M49|Determinants of Personal Financial Literacy among Young Adults in Malaysian Accounting Firms|Objective - In the twenty-first century, financial competencies are an essential tool in understanding the connection between financial behaviour and knowledge of individual financial problems. High financial knowledge may encourage young adults to carry less debt, increase their wealth and have a better financial retirement plan. According to Wolla (2017), less than one-third of youths have basic financial knowledge. This will have an impact to their lifelong financial well-being. Hence, this research intends to explore the personal financial literacy of young adults in Malaysian accounting firms. Methodology/Technique - The study examines 150 young working adults between the ages of 18-35 years old, working in accounting firms in Malacca, Malaysia. Stratified sampling and convenience sampling techniques were used to distribute questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple regression analyses were also employed. Findings - The empirical findings show that geographical locations and family characteristics are significantly related to the personal financial literacy of young adults in accounting firms in Malacca. However, financial education and financial experience do not influence young adults in their financial decision making. Novelty - The results of this study suggest that the relevant authority should take an appropriate action to improve the financial well-being of young adults in Malacca, Malaysia.
M49|The Construction of Entrepreneurial Accounting: Evidence from Indonesia|Objective - This research aims to identify a cultural theme embedded in entrepreneurial accounting and construct the form of entrepreneurial accounting. Methodology/Technique - A cognitive anthropology method is employed in this research to investigate the cultural atmosphere of entrepreneurial accounting. This is achieved by conceiving the atmosphere into informants' (owner/entrepreneur-director) mind-set. The research was conducted at various Padang restaurants in Jakarta, Indonesia, that were classified into four groups based on their size and level of complexity. Finding and Novelty - Firstly, a number of cultural themes of entrepreneurial accounting are revealed among the four Padang restaurant groups. There are four similar cultural themes: (a) business process turbulence; (b) togetherness intensity; (c) informal control processes; and (d) formal control processes. Despite the fact that all of the restaurants have similar cultural themes, the elements embedded in each theme are different and require certain adjustments in the design of entrepreneurial accounting based on a profit sharing system. Secondly, a construction of entrepreneurial accounting coloured with a unique socio-cultural background was also discovered. This construction enables owner/entrepreneur-directors to execute work programs with a view to achieving the company's goal to enhance performance, either financially or non-financially.
M49|Firm Value, Firm Size and Income Smoothing|Objective – Income smoothing is a form of earnings manipulation to show that the company's performance is good. Income smoothing can be detrimental to investors, because investors do not know the real financial position and fluctuations of the company. Management of the company engage in income smoothing because investors tend to focus only on the amount of profit reported without regard to the process of generating profits. The purpose of this research is to obtain empirical evidence about the effect of firm value and size on income smoothing. Methodology/Technique – The sample of the research includes manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2014-2016. The samples were determined using a purposive sampling method and there are 51 companies that meet the criteria used. This research uses a logistic regression method for data analysis. Findings – The results of the research show that the effect of firm value on income smoothing is positive and significant. Meanwhile, the effect of firm size on income smoothing is negative and significant. Companies that create value in the eyes of investors will try to retain their investors by engaging in income smoothing. Income smoothing will convince investors to invest in the company. Meanwhile, large companies that are convinced that investors will continue to invest do not typically engage in income smoothing. Novelty –This study proves that, in the context of agency theory, the principal's desires are not often aligned with the wishes of management which can give rise to agency costs, one of which occurs as a result of income smoothing. Further, firm size can minimize opportunist income smoothing actions. Type of Paper: Empirical.
M49|Regulatory Spillovers in Common Audit Markets|We find that Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) had two significant effects on the audit market for nonpublic entities. The first short-run effect stems from inelastic labor supply coupled with an audit demand shock from public companies. As a result, private companies reduced their use of attested financial reports in bank financing by 12%, and audit fee increases for nonprofit organizations (NPOs) more than doubled. The second long-run effect was a transformation in the audit supply structure. After SOX, NPOs were less likely to match with auditors most exposed to public companies, while auditors increasingly specialized their offices based on client type. Audit market concentration for NPOs dropped by more than half within five years of SOX and remained at this level through the end of our sample in 2013, while the number of suppliers increased by 26%. Our results demonstrate how regulation directed at public companies generates economically im-portant spillovers for nonpublic entities.
M49|Controlling as driving force at today?s dynamic changing companies|The task of controlling is to support the management with reports, forecasts and analyses in order to be able to take economically rational decisions. In today?s fast changing economic and information technological environment the management has to react rapidly. This means new challenges for controlling. Due to digitalization, even more real time data is available, can be stored and shared fast. This lead to a change of controlling processes. The focus of reports changed from analysing past figures to current and future trends. Controlling become the strategic early warning system of the companies. This changes the role of controllers, as it is transforming into business partners of management, and also new roles, like Data Scientist will turn up and new skills are needed. Controlling support management to take more adequate decisions, what secure the long-term survival of the company, so in an indirect way the transformation of controlling is a driving force of the companies at today?s dynamically changing environment.
M49|Analysis of Voluntary Disclosure Before and After the Establishment of the Integrated Reporting Framework|"Objective - The goal of integrated reporting is to enhance the cohesiveness and efficiency of corporate reporting. It encourages organizations to create greater value by identifying the factors that have a material impact on its operations. The Integrated Reporting (IR) Framework guides the overall content of an integrated report through the Guiding Principles and Content Elements. The Framework has eight elements. This study explores the level of voluntary disclosure of information related to these eight elements by companies listed on the Bursa Malaysia before and after the establishment of the Framework. Methodology/Technique - This study examines the annual reports of 603 Main Market listed companies of Bursa Malaysia between 2012 and 2015. The year 2012 is referred to as the ""pre-issuance period"" while 2015 is referred to as the ""post issuance period"". Findings - The findings of the study show that the companies that do disclose more information, do so in relation to three out of the eight elements only. These are: governance, strategy and resource allocation, and outlook. Overall, there is a lack of lineage among the information related to the IR elements presented in the annual reports. Novelty - The findings demonstrate the need for the full adoption of integrated reporting in Malaysia."
M49|Information Asymmetry in the Post-IFRS Adoption Period: Evidence from Developing Countries|Objective - The adoption of IFRS aims to reduce the level of information asymmetry. Prior studies conducted in developed countries prove that the adoption of IFRS enhances transparency and diminishes information asymmetry. However, in developing countries with a low level of openness, limited regulation, and more centralized ownership, the ability of IFRS to reduce information asymmetry remains unknown. To address this issue, this study aims to investigate whether IFRS adoption will reduce information asymmetry in some developing countries in South East Asia. Methodology/Technique - This research is applied in three developing countries: Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. Information asymmetry is proxied by the cost of capital using the Easton model (2004) and a bid-ask spread. Listed firms from the three countries are selected as the research sample resulting in 5.313 firm-years for the period between 2007 and 2016. Findings - This study concludes that the adoption of the IFRS decreases information asymmetry in developing countries. These finding confirm that the benefit of the adoption is the same as in developed countries, despite the level of law enforcement in developing countries being lower. Managers, standard authorities and investors must note that the IFRS conveys benefits to the market, which increases transparency by asking lower returns and valuing company stocks appropriately. Novelty - This study examines the benefits of the adoption of the IFRS in reducing information asymmetry in some emerging countries to enhance the generalization of the results from prior studies that are mostly conducted in developed countries.
M49|Gender-Diversity, Financial Performance and Cash Holding in Family Firms|Objective - This research aims to determine the presence of partial effects on gender-diversity and financial performance variables on the cash holding of family firms on the Indonesian Stock Exchange included in the Kompas100 index. Methodology/Technique - The approach used in this research was causal associative testing using a panel data regression with a General Least Square (GLS) method using six independent variables: size, growth opportunity, dividend, return on assets, leverage, and gender diversity. Meanwhile, cash holding acts as a dependent variable. Findings - The results of the research show that the independent variables of leverage have significantly negative relationships on cash holding on the Kompas100 index of Indonesia in the period of 2013-2016. Contrary to this, return on asset has a significantly positive relationship with cash holding. Novelty - Gender diversity is an important variable of boardroom; this paper reveals the impact of gender diversity and performance on family holding firms. These results can be used to assess the performance and fundamentals of a firm.
M49|The Design and Development of a Framework for Enhancing Internship Programs in Malaysia: A Model for Accounting Students|Objective - The purpose of this study is to explore the ability of accounting graduates to improvise i.e. the ability to deal with complicated and unexpected situations in an entrepreneurial, contextual, creative and professional manner, the ability to react in conditions of complexity and temporariness, the ability to identify opportunities and try new methods on the spot from the perspective of employers, institutions and students. All these dimensions are very important to students and organizations as part of the skills required to succeed in a highly competitive business world. Unemployment among local graduates has become a serious problem in Malaysia. The problem does not lie with limited employment opportunities but stems from a lack of work-ready graduates. The Malaysian government has introduced a compulsory internship program for each graduate student. Various attempts have been taken to study the effectiveness of this internship program. However, there remains limited knowledge on how interns can improve their skills within the internship program, to gain meaningful employment in the future Therefore, this research will examine the ability for accounting graduates to improve their improvisation through their internship programs. Methodology/Technique - The first research gap of this study looks at the micro perspective i.e. student's improvisation capacity within an internship. The second research gap is the lack of empirical evidence on the factors affecting student/individual/employee improvisation from three perspectives i.e. employers, institutions and students. The last research gap is the limited availability of research on the development of a framework for enhancing internship programs in Malaysia for accounting students.
M49|Deconstructed CSR and Social Audit Model: Postmodernist Paradigm Observations in Luwu Mining Areas, Indonesia|Objective - The research aims to decode the model of Social Audit on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and develop a new model for CSR. Methodology/Technique - The study uses qualitative research using Derrida's deconstructive postmodernism paradigm. This study scrutinises all models of CSR, distinguishing between capitalism and socialism in audit practices, and creates a new CSR model that integrates the local wisdom of indigenous peoples. Findings - The study observes several unfair practices without ensuring social and distributive justice to the indigenous community where mining activities are conducted. Several concepts linked to sustainable development were evolved during the data collection phase. By deconstructing the two major concepts of CSR and Social Audit, the research develops a new model of sustainable corporate responsibility which enables stakeholders to empower the Luwu community by ensuring cultural integration and social development. Novelty – By exploring CSR activities in the Luwu area, this study verifies all existing CSR practices and Social Audit models to generate a sustainable corporate social responsibility model for corporations, government and allied stakeholders. This research may be used to support policy agreements between governments, industry players and the corporations, towards effective SCSR implementation.
M49|Internet Financial Reporting Of Public Institutions and E-Government as a Medium of Good Governance in Indonesia|Objective - Transparency of financial reporting can be achieved through various media including the internet and is an important factor of good governance. The use of internet in government has been regulated to encourage the government to build and develop websites to present information to the public. This research analyzes the factors that influence the government's internet financial reporting (IFR) through e-government. Methodology/Technique - The factors tested in this research are: size, leverage, capital expenditure, and audit opinion of the Republic Indonesia Audit Board (BPK). The population of this research is 25 ministries registered on the e-government ranking index (PeGI) between 2013 and 2015. Path analysis using the SPSS 21 application program is used. Findings - The results show that size, capital expenditure and audit opinion of BPK affected the use of IFR through e-government, whereas leverage did not affect the use of IFR through e-government. Novelty – These findings indicate that e-government is an important mediating factor in disclosing financial reports on the internet as a medium of good governance for public institutions in Indonesia.
M49|The Effect of Integrating Reporting on Earnings Quality: A Study of Family Firms in Indonesia|Objective - The implementation of integrated reporting (IR), which is a composite of financial and non-financial information, in one single report makes financial reporting more comprehensive and more transparent. Transparent information in IR gives annual reporting of family firms a higher earnings quality. Methodology/Technique - This research aims to examine the effect of IR on earnings quality of family firms in the mining industry on the Indonesian Stock Exchange between 2014 and 2017. Findings - The results of this study indicate that there is a positive and significant relationship between integrating reporting and earnings quality. These results confirm that firms that use integrated reporting tend to show higher earnings quality. The study also finds that larger sized companies and larger leverage amounts equals a higher volume of information disclosed. Novelty – The motivation of this research is to examine IR issues that are relatively new.
M49|Auditor Retention: Auditor and Auditee Factors|Objective - This study aims to examine the influence of auditor and auditee factors on auditor retention. Methodology/Technique - The analysis unit of this research is manufacturing firms that were listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange between 2010 and 2014. Using purposive sampling, 54 companies, or 270 observations, were obtained. This research uses a logistic regression; there are 12 outliers in the data that disturb the regression model, hence, the final research data set was 258. Findings - The result of the logistic regression analysis shows that auditee and auditor factors can simultaneously explain auditor retention by up to 4%. This partial effect shows that only audit quality affects auditor retention by 57.2%, at a level of significance of less than a = 5%. Meanwhile, firm size affects auditor retention by 14.8%, at a significance level of less than a = 10%. Novelty – This research is unique because auditor retention and proxy of audit quality has never been investigated in previous studies.
M49|Capitalization of tangible and intangible assets in non-profit organizations in Bulgaria|The report analyzes applicability of the equity capital approach for the acquisition of tangible and intangible assets by non-profit organizations in Bulgaria. Attention is also paid to the accounting of depreciation of the assets. Without any claims of comprehensiveness, the conclusions in the report are based on analysis of accounting and legal literature, Bulgarian national accounting standards, as well as data collected from individual interviews that the author conducted among accountants.
M49|Съдържателни Аспекти На Счетоводната Политика На Сдружения В България От Гледна Точка На Ползвателите На Документа<BR>[Content of the accounting policies of Bulgarian non-profit associations from user's point of view]|According to data published in the Sustainability Index for Central and Eastern Europe and Eurasia, 1579 new associations and 370 foundations are registered in 2016 in Bulgaria. As a comparison in 2015 the newly registered associations are 1463, and the foundations - 306. Being active entities at the economic life of our country, not only the number of foundations and associations is increasing, but also the range of their business and non-profit activities are expanding. In this respect, non-profit organizations are involved in the political, economic, spiritual, cultural and social life of Bulgaria. Such an idea undoubtedly has a direct impact on the accountability of these activities. As an appendix to the financial statements, accounting policies provide information regarding the accounting methodology used for preparing the statements and hence are essential for the purposes of interpreting the data by the users. The accounting policies must ensure that the information they contain is cautious, reliable, neutral and impartial. Due to the possibility of certain conflicts of interest between the needs of different users, the data written inside the document is not as transparent and comprehensible as it should be. Based on that a main goal of the report is to present data analysis regarding the main content components of the document and their importance based on the user’s point of view. The subject of the study is the content of the accounting policy of Bulgarian associations. The methodology used for the analysis is a survey conducted among target groups related to the activities of the associations. The data collection period covers the months July 2018 - August 2018. For the analysis of the data, the programs SPSS, ver. 16.0/2007, as well as Microsoft Office Excel 2013 are used. The results from the questionnaire are based on the methods of mathematical statistics. The study of statistical relations and dependencies is done on the basis of a Chi square - analysis (χ2). Cramer’s (V) coefficient is used to measure the strength between the nominal variables. The author’s hypothesis is that users are not aware of the role, functions, and purposes of the accounting policies. In this respect the information they expect to find out in the document is irrelevant to the essence of the accounting policy. The results of the survey would help for better understanding of the accounting policy of associations, its structure and expected content components.

M49|Динамички Коефицијенти: Нови Приступ У Анализи Солвентности Предузећа<BR>[The Dynamic Coefficients: New Approach to the Analysis of Company’s Solvency]|Serbian. У чланку се разматра коришћење двају приступа анализи солвентности предузећа – традиционалног, заснованог на показатељима из биланса стања и биланса успеха, и новог, заснованог на показатељима из извештаја о кретању новчаних средстава. Уз помоћ дисперзионе анализе показано је да та два приступа резултирају значајно различитим оценама солвентности. То омогућује закључак, да за анализу солвентности (превасходно) треба користити и динамичке показатеље. English. The article considers the use of two approaches in the analysis of enterprise’s solvency – traditional, based on balance and profit and loses balance, and new, based on indicators from cash-flow report. With the analysis of variance, on the data for one of the branches of Serbian economy, it was showed, that these two approaches give significantly different estimates of enterprise’s solvency. It makes possible to conclude, that for analysis of solvency it is necessary to use too (at first) dynamic indicators.
M49|Waning Student Engagement with Lifelong Learning?: A Case Study|Capstone experiences for graduating seniors have garnered growing attention as we see a cultural shift in the understanding of a college degree?s purpose. With exponentially increasing costs associated with acquiring a college degree, it is no wonder that we see the world?s focus turn to its ROI. Many feel the returns from this investment are best demonstrated by colleges with job placement rates and average starting salaries of its graduates. Unfortunately, for many academics, they feel such a focus demands curriculum be changed to suit equipping students with ready-to-use job skills at the cost of truly teaching critical skills necessary to be a life-long learner. Many feel this causes students to disengage from their learning, and instead concentrate only on skills that will directly help them in their first job. It is possible to help students see beyond the direct relation of their education to a job, and engage with them on a higher level, pushing them academically in ways that create better students and better professionals. This paper will provide a case study of a capstone class of graduating senior accounting students who are asked to collaboratively set the agenda of their learning as the last step in their formal education as a way to engage them with the act of learning itself, and the many forms it can take outside the classroom.Best practices will be presented to get students fully engaged in the process of collaboratively setting the agenda for the class, as well as pitfalls to avoid. Instructors will have the most success with such student collaboration if they focus on the desired learning outcomes of the course, and pre-emptively design ways in which that learning can occur. Guiding the students to activities that best suits their learning, seemingly by their design, is the desired outcome. The class in the case to be presented creates a conference and hosts local business professionals who attend- thus the student becomes the teacher as the culminating outcome for the course.
M49|Determinants of Dividend Payout Ratio in Thailand|Dividend payout ratio has been a controversial topic among scholars for some decades. Researchers have different conclusion and attempt to construct theoretical models to defy factors that impact dividend payout ratio such as transaction theory or agency theory for examples. The purpose of this study is to investigate some financial indicators that affect the dividend payout ratio in Thailand?s capital market. From existing literature reviews, we select seven factors including dividend payout ratio a previous year, corporate size, current ratio, debt to equity ratio, sale growth, free cash flow and return on equity or return on assets. This study uses secondary data collected from annual financial statements of listed companies in Thailand Stock Exchange exclude financial sector during 2014 -2016 periods. After we evaluate the data based on specific criteria, only 106 companies remained qualified. Therefore 318 firm-year financial information has applied for this study. A panel multiple regression model is implemented for statistic testing at the significant level 0.05. The results show the positive and statistically significant effect of current ratio, debt ratio and return on equity to dividend payout ratio. While the results show negative and statistically significance of sales growth to dividend payout ratio. The results are consistent with prior survey except for debt ratio which shows the opposite direction. However, the results show no significant effect of dividend payout ratio a previous year, firm size and free cash flow to dividend payout ratio. Nevertheless, return on assets is better explanation than return on equity since the result demonstrates higher r square. This research limits determinants from previous literatures. Other explanatory variables such as investment opportunities, business risk or firm life cycle are subject to future research.
M49|Government Ownership, Firm Performance and Corporate Philanthropy in Thai Listed Firms|Studies in corporate social responsibility (CSR) have been tremendously conducted in both terms of CSR determinants and consequences. The results, however, are inconclusive yet. Rather using an aggregated score, this study focuses on one CSR strategy at a time. Philanthropy is focused because it is extensively chosen. Thailand is a Buddhist-based country and documented that philanthropy outstandingly appears. The disclosures on philanthropy activities are observed. Using a path analysis, this research found that philanthropy makes firm financial performance increased. Firm size and industry are important factors of philanthropy. Large firms and firms in high impact industry (i.e. oil and gas, and chemical) have a higher number of philanthropy activities. Government ownership, however, has no impact on philanthropy. The empirical findings support the corporate visibility as a determinant of CSR.
M49|Ethical Sensitivity of Accounting Students: Evidence from Malaysia|The goals of ethics education include the fostering of awareness about ethical components in managerial decision making and assist the students to apply ethical analysis to daily business activities. It is claimed that the inclusion of ethics in accounting curriculum can give students guidance as to how to deal with the real business situations. This paper investigates the importance of ethical sensitivity of accounting students and how ethics education would affect them. Specifically, it attempts to examine how attending ethic classes would affect their decision making. Questionnaires were distributed to 114 final year accounting students at the beginning of the semester (pre) and at the end of the semester (post). Interviews were also conducted to understand the issues of the study. Paired sample t-tests were employed to analyze the data. The results appear to suggest that the final year accounting students understand the importance of ethics in general. The paired sample t-tests results show that after attending the ethic classes, their ethical sensitivity improved. However, when they were given some ethical situations to assess, the students indicated that they possessed moderate ethical sensitivity for both pre and post results.
M49|Effects of business diversification on asset risk-taking: Evidence from the U.S. property-liability insurance industry|We investigate the effect of line-of-business diversification on asset risk-taking in the U.S. property-liability industry. The coordinated risk management hypothesis (Schrand and Unal, 1998) implies a negative relation between underwriting risk and investment risk. Consistent with this hypothesis we find that diversified insurers take more asset risk than non-diversified insurers, and that the degree of asset risk-taking is positively related to diversification extent. Our results are robust to corrections for potential endogeneity bias, selectivity bias, and alternative diversification and asset risk measures. We also provide event study evidence that further supports the coordinated risk management hypothesis. Specifically, we find that when a focused firm diversifies, it increases its asset risk relative to firms that remain focused, and when a diversified firm refocuses, it reduces its asset risk relative to firms that remain diversified.
M49|Earnings management to exceed thresholds in continental and Anglo-Saxon accounting models: The British and French cases|The purpose of this paper is to compare the extent to which French and British firms manage their earnings in order to avoid losses, decreases in earnings and earnings below the forecasts of analysts. Further, this study aims to investigate the factors that potentially influence earnings management to exceed thresholds with reference to the Anglo-Saxon and continental accounting models. Britain and France, correspondingly, belong to those different socio-economic environments. Based on a panel data of 1771 French and 2057 British firm-year observations during the period 2002–2012, we show that all firms considered manage earnings to beat zero and last year’s earnings. However, earnings management in order to meet analysts’ forecasts appears to be more prevalent in British firms. Considering earnings management incentives, we find that firm size has a positive effect for all thresholds considered. Similarly, the signaling hypothesis is more evident for British firms for all thresholds examined. The corporate governance structure is also found to impact the extent of earnings management.
M49|The Effect of IFRS Convergence on Earnings Quality: Empirical Evidence from Indonesia|Objective –The purpose of this research is to examine the impact of the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) convergence in Indonesia on earnings quality. Methodology/Technique – Earnings quality is measured on both accrual earnings management and real earnings management. Indonesia began convergence IFRS in 2012. IFRS is considered capable of improving comparability, transparency, and earnings information, which is expected to ultimately improve earnings quality. The sample in this research uses manufacturing firms listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange that were suspected to avoid loss during the observation period. The data consist of 45 companies examined between 2008 and 2015. Results –This study uses statistical methods and multiple regression linear to analyse the data. The research results show that IFRS convergence in Indonesia has had a negative impact on accrual earnings management and no impact on real earnings management. Novelty –The evidence shows that IFRS convergence in Indonesia has the ability to improve earnings quality related to a decrease in accrual earnings management but not real earnings management.
M49|The Effect of Corporate Governance, Ownership and Tax Aggressiveness on Earnings Management|Objective –The purpose of this research is to empirically examine the effect of corporate governance, ownership and tax aggressiveness on earnings management. Methodology/Technique –The population of this research consists of non-financial companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) between 2013 and 2015.

Findings –The results show that the board of director have a positive influence on earnings management, while board independence, audit quality, managerial ownership, and tax aggressiveness have no influence on earnings management. Novelty –This research add value in the existing literature and empirically study the effect of the board of directors, independence of the board, audit quality, managerial ownership, and tax agressiveness on earnings management.
M49|Recognized intangibles and the present value of growth options|Abstract We investigate the relation of recognized intangibles, defined as acquired intangibles net of goodwill, and the market’s perception of firm growth options (PVGO). We find that: (a) on average recognized intangibles are positively associated with PVGO after controlling for intangible expenditures immediately expensed, firm specific characteristics, industry membership and systematic risk (b) the said relation is highly non-linear (negatively skewed) and more strongly pronounced in companies with lower accumulation of R&D Capital; recognized intangibles are not that significant at higher levels of PVGO and whereas firms have committed to in-house technological development, and (c) while adjusted levels of recognized intangibles increase approximately tenfold over the last 35 years their explanatory power to PVGO over the period generally wanes. Our results are informative for the interpretation of recognized intangibles as a summary balance sheet item and therefore useful to users of financial statements forming investment and credit decisions, to policy makers aiming at stimulating firm growth and to standard setters aiming at improving value relevance.
M49|Достоверното Счетоводно Дефиниране На Научноизследователската И Развойна Дейност<BR>[Defining and interpreting the term research and development for accounting purposes]|The process of planning the research activities that are included within the scope of an innovative project is a complex and multi-layered one. At the end of this process an intangible asset is developed. For the purposes of a successful innovation the intangible asset must be properly valued and priced. It is mainly associated with the proper accounting of the expenditures within the scope of R&D. The thesis that the author advocate is that for the proper accounting of the intangible asset it is important to clearly distinguish the activities that are included at the research and the development phase. The main objective of the paper is to distinguish the activities within the scope of R&D, by a comparison of the accounting standards used in the United States, Great Britain and Bulgaria.
M49|Static and Dynamic Indicators in the Analysis of Internal Sources of Companies’ Investments Financing|The Republic of Serbia is characterized by an unsatisfactory macroeconomic environment. Under the conditions of an evident shortage of liquid assets, the financial capital has moved from real to the financial sector, which led companies to over-indebtedness and shutdown of their own capacities. Therefore, capital investments largely depend on internal financing sources and the ability of companies to internally generate funds for investments. In this regard, an emphasis is placed on the difference in the assessment of the company’s investment capacity based on internal financing sources, which are measured using static and dynamic indicators in order to prove the necessity of applying dynamic coefficients, which are unfortunately not present in our domestic practice. The paper examines and proves the advantages of the use of the dynamic approach for such analyses using the example of energy sector, which is one of the most important branches in Serbian economy.

Main task of the paper is to outline and compare the views of the respondents regarding the verbal communication skills of the accountants and the main forms of communication they use.
M49|Disclosure of Information in Company’s Annual Reports: A Bibliometric Analysis|This study evaluated the development of research publications towards the disclosure of information in companies’ annual reports. The aim of this study is to provide a preliminary source of references for related scholars interested in research mapping in this field. By using several bibliometric indicators, all research publications related to the disclosure of information in the companies’ annual reports in the online Web of Science (ISI Thomson Reuters) database were analysed. The authorship, number of citations, journal sources, publishers, institutions, and countries, year of publication, categories, and author keywords were examined. The results of these analyses were underlined and discussed.
M49|Corporate Sustainability Disclosure and Profitability of Petrochemicals and Chemical Industry|The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between corporate sustainability disclosure level and the profitability of petrochemicals and chemicals industry. The sample is selected from listed companies in the Stock Exchange of Thailand with sustainability disclosure according to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines during the year 2013 to 2015. This study used content analysis to evaluate the sustainability disclosure in sustainability reports, annual reports and annual registration statements according to 91 indicators of GRI G4 related to economic, environmental, and social performance. The study shows that the sustainability disclosure level of companies in petrochemicals and chemicals industry have been relatively low but slightly improved over time. The correlation analysis results indicate no relationship between the disclosure level related to economic and profitability ratios. The disclosure levels related to environmental and social performance have been found negatively related to return on assets and return on equity but not related to net profit ratio. Since GRI G4 guidelines has been recently used in petrochemicals and chemicals industry in Thailand, future study may need to examine long-term value of sustainability disclosure.
M49|The Internal Control Management Development Strategy in Romania|The internal control management means all the forms of control exercised at the public entity, including internal audit, established by the management in accordance with its objectives and legal regulations in order to provide fund administration economically, efficiently and effectively; it also includes the organizational structures, methods, and procedures. The phrase, â€œinternal control managementâ€ emphasizes the responsibility of all hierarchical levels for controlling all internal processes undertaken in order to achieve its general and specific objectives. The internal control management development strategy prioritizes managerial responsibility and ensures that the implemented internal control management systems are adequate and prevent or limit errors and fraud.
M49|Quelle influence de la création de valeur partagée sur les risques liés à la responsabilité sociétale des entreprises ?|Bien que la responsabilité sociétale permette aux entreprises de surmonter certains risques principalement sociaux, comme le risque de réputation, elle contribue à créer et à aggraver l’ampleur d’autres risques, principalement d’ordre économique. Actuellement, la tendance de quelques entreprises comme NESTLE, INTEL, COCA COLA à passer de la responsabilité sociétale à la création de valeur partagée est souvent justifiée par le fait que cette dernière permet une meilleure conciliation entre objectifs sociaux et financiers. Le présent article constitue une réflexion concernant les possibilités offertes par la création de valeur partagée pour limiter les risques liés spécialement à la responsabilité sociétale de l’entreprise.
M49|Financial And Non-Financial Indicators For Organizational Performance Measurement|The organizational performance is reflected in the results that the organization obtains, those one being measured by key performance indicators. In the last years, the acerbity competition from the business world, aroused the desire and the interest of companies to improve their performance and to experience ways of measuring the level of performance achieved. The measurement is a condition “sine qua non” of performance assessment, but does not represent a finality by itself. Knowing and understanding a company’s financial data is done in order to predict the future and to improve the performance level of this
M49|The Quality And Utility Of Annual Financial Reports Between Expectations And Reality|Any company makes its presence felt in the market by providing financial - accounting. Users will be more interested in issuing entity, to the extent that the information provided is attractive and quality, showing favorable results. So any accounting information quality is a measure of objectivity and transparency pursued transposition. Setting targets for financial statements depends on many factors and in addition, there is a universal set of objective, valid for all businesses, whatever the accounting system adopted. Over time, in our country, the accounting system has undergone various changes aimed at ensuring financial accounting information as qualitative targets, so try to bring the national accounting system close to international accounting standards. From an analysis of the three periods to improve national accounting system, no one can see only instability reform process accounting, which included regulations associated initially with European directives (which is also found in French accounting system), then with IAS and European directives, in order to subsequently take place reversing the order of accounting regulations, putting in this regard, European directives first, and IFRS (whose application is reduced) on the second place, combination that has led to the emergence of contradictory situation in some cases.
M49|Evaluating The Role Of The Regulators Of The External Audit Profession In Achieving The Audit Quality In Iraq|The profession of quality auditing can have direct or indirect effects on the performance of accountants and auditors. Both particular research and professional recommendations provided evidence on measuring and evaluating service performance of audit profession by taking into account the relationship between quality and accountant performance. Applied research was developed in Republic of Iraq to reveal the function of bodies that regulate external audit for achieving the required level of audit quality and for identifying the obstacles that prevent the compliance with International Auditing Standards. Research focuses on the role of these bodies in order to achieve the quality of audit by implementing a quality control system. Its benefits reduce chances of criticisms and weaknesses, improving the auditing environment in Iraq.
M49|Standard Calculation Per Product In The Chemical Fertilizer Industry|The main goal of the research is to present a way of organising the managerial accounting of totally and semi finished product obtained in chemical fertilizer industry entities. For this study, we analyzed the current principle of managerial accounting to an entity in the studied area, in order to emphasize the need of organizing and implementing a modern accounting management to control the cost and increase the performance of the entities in this area, starting from the premise that there are sufficient similarities between entities in the field. Research carried out has revealed that currently, the costing is organized in terms of using traditional methods and that it is necessary to organize and implement an accounting management based on the use of modern methods, namely the method of standard costs combined with the method of centres of costs. The major implications of the proposed system for the investigated field consist of determining a relevant cost-oriented management entity, highlighting the shortcomings of traditional methods of cost
M49|Etyczny aspekt teorii normatywnych rachunkowosci / Ethical Aspect of the Normative Theories of Accounting|The aim of this study is to show the ethical aspects of the so-called normative accounting theory (NT), with particular emphasis on the ethical and normative theory (EN) important for the development of accounting as a science, taking into account its social function. Attention is focused on the so-called axiological layer with regard to the methodological foundation (pragmatic methods and related metascience) regarding the work of theorists in Western Europe. Although in the years 70s shall be considered as unscientific and begin the process of domination positive theory of accounting. It seems that in the twentyfirst century takes rebirth specific ethical and social topics in accounting. The importance and usefulness of ethics in accounting due to turbulent environment changes of accounting and social needs, as well as changes within the science.
M49|The relationship between the audit committee|Audit committees, governance type or otherwise, are a less common feature in EU Member States, where only few countries have extended audit committees or “governance” or similar such committees . Audit committees in the private sector focus on ensuring the reliability and the internal and external reporting, and therefore on the internal and external audit, the quality of internal control systems and risk management processes. For many countries applying this type of public sector audit committee may be too sophisticated, because there are no preconditions for its existence. The existence of audit committees does not automatically mean that organizations function properly and have no governance, internal control and external reporting problems. Because of the importance of communication between the internal auditors and the audit committee, the paper addresses issues such as planning discussions with internal auditors, analysis and conclusions as a result of communication, questionnaire models for the addressed areas and planning the meetings with external auditors.
M49|A comprehensive conceptual profile on control|The paper starts from the persisting uncertainties regarding the use of the term “control”. In order to mitigate such ambiguities, after a brief subject exposure, a range of questions are proposed, whose adapted answers may help us to refine a correct understanding and perception of control, of course in relation with a plethora of similar concepts. Our argumentation includes the elaboration and presentation of a range of conceptual pillars or vectors regarding the control in its widest meaning, in contrast with other more restricted forms, equivocal or even altered explanations. The text is enriched with some assertions of the authors regarding the assurance of the appropriate control, with its meaning of a state of harmony, which can successfully meet honest expectations. At the end, we conclude that, in the current conditions, control can only be defined in a holistic style and we proposed a conceptual profile, through which we can easily explain what the control actually includes.
M49|The importance of professional judgement applied in the context of the International Financial Reporting Standards|Guidance has always been welcome in terms of applying professional judgement in the context of the principles-based accounting standards – International Financial Reporting Standards. This fact is the result of the complexity and diversity of some situations, which might give rise to difficulties in terms of choosing the appropriate accounting policies and methods (depreciation, inventory valuation on hand at the end of an accounting period, the recognition of revenues and expenses from a construction contract, accounting for lease contracts by the proper determination of the type of lease: financing or operating), and respectively the need to verify if the criteria set by the principles-based accounting standards are met. This “freedom” of choice and disclosure might create problems in terms of accounting information quality. The possibility to select accounting methods based on the Standards’ provisions is meant to generate a true and fair view of the company’s financial position and financial performance. In these cases it is recommended to use professional judgement in order to reach a conclusion which is in accordance with the accounting principles and is not enforced by any accounting rules, since the exercise of individual professional judgement is preferred against the “pure” compliance with prescriptive legal requirements.
M49|Specific Restrictions And Theoretical Background For Joint-Stock Company Equity|"This article considers approaches to the economic content of the concept of equity, as well as the theoretical and scientific analysis of the definitions (perspectives) and their functions. The research carried out identified and studied 5 groups of approaches and characteristics related to the essence (meaning) of equity; additionally a scientific foundation for the notion of ""equity of the joint-stock company"" has been laid down."
M49|Towards Integrated Reporting: Analysis Of Information Published On The Companiesâ€™ Websites That Could Be Part Of The Integrated Reporting|Integrated reporting is a new approach to corporate reporting which is rapidly gaining international recognition. Integrated reporting is based on integrated thinking, which include interconnectivity of strategy, performance, risk and incentives and helps to identify sources of value creation. In this paper are summarized the need for integrated reporting, companiesâ€™ benefits of its implementation as well as content of the integrated report. The aim of the paper is to increase the awareness of the companies about integrated reporting especially in the Republic of Macedonia due to the absence of its implementation in Macedonian companies realized by pre-research phase about implementation of integrated reporting conducted on companies listed on Macedonian stock exchange. Furthermore, as a result of the negative results from the pre-research phase, it is made qualitative analysis about publication of information through the companiesâ€™ websites that might be part of the integrated report if it commence to be prepared by the companies.
M49|Incidencia de estándares internacionales en la sostenibilidad corporativa: una perspectiva de la alta dirección|Los estándares internacionales inciden en la sostenibilidad corporativa y contribuyen al desempeño y a la gobernanza del negocio. El objetivo de este estudio es analizar esta incidencia desde la óptica de la alta dirección de una empresa del sector energético colombiano. La metodología de investigación es un estudio de caso exploratorio, provisto de 5 entrevistas en profundidad. Los resultados muestran que los directivos recurren a los estándares en busca de control y legitimidad desde 2 posturas complementarias: una pragmática frente al desempeño y otra prudente frente a la gobernanza. Se concluye que la adopción de los estándares es el resultado del liderazgo y los valores de los directivos, que confieren identidad a la empresa al mismo tiempo que la ponen frente a nuevos retos de cara a la sociedad.
M49|Relación entre los sistemas de contabilidad y control de gestión y los sesgos en la evaluación y toma de decisiones|Resumen Los directivos realizan evaluaciones y toman decisiones que pueden estar sesgadas y, como consecuencia, provocar efectos contrarios a los deseados en el rendimiento organizacional. La identificación de los sesgos y sus causas han sido ampliamente estudiadas en la literatura de contabilidad y control de gestión en las últimas décadas. El objetivo de este trabajo es sintetizar los resultados previos, lo cual permite disponer de una visión más clara y comprensiva del papel de los Sistemas de Contabilidad y Control de Gestión (SCCG) en relación a los sesgos en las decisiones y evaluaciones. Como resultado se obtiene un marco conceptual en el que los SCCG se postulan al mismo tiempo como generadores e inhibidores de sesgo, en función de sus propias características y de las características de los usuarios. Este resultado permite que profesionales (especialmente los controllers) y académicos conozcan mejor los procesos de utilización de la información generada por los SCCG y así actúen en consecuencia.
M49|La implantación del cuadro de mando integral en el sector agroalimentario: el caso del grupo alimentario guissona|Resumen El Grupo Alimentario Guissona (ubicado en la provincia de Lleida en España), nació con una visión estratégica que le ha llevado a posicionarse con notable éxito en el mercado. Así mismo ha implementado diversas herramientas de gestión que le han permitido desarrollarse, adaptarse y crecer durante más de 50 años. El presente artículo plantea la implantación de un Cuadro de Mando Integral (CMI) para poder monitorear la referida estrategia. Se sugiere implementar esta herramienta concreta, ya que es la quinta herramienta de gestión más utilizada en el mundo según el estudio bianual que realiza Bain & Company (Rigby & Bilodeau, 2013). La propuesta de CMI contenida en el presente estudio incluye 27 indicadores, clasificados en las 4 perspectivas propuestas en el CMI.
M49|Contabilidad y RSE Objeciones a una relación planeada sin daños a terceros|El presente texto esboza algunas líneas reflexivas en torno a la importancia de una visión alternativa de la contabilidad, que integre en su corpus teórico-práctico lo socio-ambiental, lo cultural y lo humano, con el fin de que la realidad organizacional sea mejor representada en sus informes, en especial los sociales y medioambientales. Finalmente, se muestran algunos eufemismos que se presentan en las prácticas de Responsabilidad Social Empresarial - RSE y se hace hincapié en la necesidad de un modelo pedagógico integral e integrador que permita comprender las relaciones empresariales y generar actos de consumo responsable, impulsores de un futuro esperanzador.
M49|Creation of Provision for Doubtful Debts|The purpose of this study is to develop methods of creation of provision for doubtful debts. It was proposed to use two methods of provisioning for doubtful debts, both individually and in the aggregate. The first method is percentage of sales approach that is used in international standards. Its use requires to calculate the average percentage of doubtful debt by determining the average ratio of the outstanding accounts receivable to revenue volume over 3-5 years. This method is recommended for use to organizations with a large number of debtors with minor amounts of debts. The second method, developed by the authors, takes into account the timing of incurring of debt, the solvency of the debtor and the risk of non-repayment. It is advisable to apply for debtors with significant amounts of debt. Using the author’s method, the provision for doubtful debts was calculated according to the data from the existing company “Elephant” LLC for 2015, which resulted in revealing the deviation in the amount of the provision from the actual data. The use of the proposed methods will improve the reliability of the accounting (financial) statements in terms of the reflection of the receivables and simplify the work of accountants in finding a method to create a provision for doubtful debts.
M49|Compensation or feedback: Motivating performance in multidimensional tasks|Employees often perform tasks with multiple dimensions. In this study, we examine how employees' performance on multidimensional tasks differs under different control structures. We conduct two experiments in which we manipulate the presence of compensation controls and the presence of feedback controls on multiple task dimensions. Our findings suggest that when employees are compensated on multiple dimensions they commit to multiple goals and divide their attention among those task dimensions. However, when feedback controls are implemented on one task dimension with compensation controls on another dimension, employees can improve performance on individual dimensions as well as their overall task performance. As a result, we find that employee performance on a multidimensional task can be higher when firms compensate employees on one task dimension and provide feedback on the other task dimension than when firms compensate on both task dimensions. This study highlights the benefits of complementing compensation-based controls (i.e., incentive pay) with non-compensation based controls (e.g., feedback), and provides a theoretical basis to help explain the prevalence of this approach in practice.
M49|Analyst coverage: Does the listing location really matter?|Using a count panel regression method, we find that the listing location really does matter as stocks listed on the main board (FTSE350) rather than the junior market (AIM) attract more analyst coverage than can be explained by existing factors, even when we control for listing requirements and the type of cross-listing. We also find that listing requirements have a significantly greater impact on the number of analysts following AIM companies rather than their FTSE350 counterparts. Moreover, pooling stocks from different listing locations can conceal additional differences in the determinates of analyst services for the main board and junior markets. For example, cross-listing on a stock exchange increases analysts coverage for FTSE350 stocks but not AIM stocks and listing on less transparent trading venues such as over the counter and alternative trading systems (dark pools) decreases analyst coverage, especially for AIM stocks.
M49|The information role of audit opinions in debt contracting|This study examines the relevance of modified audit opinions (MAO) in private debt contracting. We use the auditor׳s explanatory language to partition MAOs into Inconsistency opinions, resulting from an accounting change or a restatement; and Inadequacy opinions, arising from a material uncertainty or a going concern (GC) opinion. Using the loan contracts of firms with MAOs, we find that, compared with loans issued in the year after a clean opinion, loans issued in the year after an MAO are associated with higher interest spreads (17 basis points on average), fewer financial covenants, more general covenants, smaller loan sizes, and a higher likelihood of requiring collateral. We find that the effect on loan spreads (as well as on other non-price terms) varies by the type of MAO, ranging from no effect for an accounting change to an average increase of 107 basis points for a GC opinion. Additional analyses of GC opinions find that auditors communicate incremental information to lenders about clients’ credit risk. Overall, our empirical results suggest that lenders incorporate the information contained in MAOs into debt contracting.
M49|Shared auditors in mergers and acquisitions|We examine the impact of shared auditors, defined as audit firms that provide audit services to a target and its acquirer firm prior to an acquisition, on transaction outcomes. We find shared auditors are observed in nearly a quarter of all public acquisitions and targets are more likely to receive a bid from a firm that has the same auditor. Moreover, these shared auditor deals are associated with significantly lower deal premiums, lower target event returns, higher bidder event returns, and higher deal completion rates. These results are driven by bids in which targets and acquirers share the same practice office of an audit firm and in which the target is small. Overall, our evidence suggests that bidders benefit from sharing an auditor with the target. Our results are robust to controls for alternative explanations and for selection bias in the shared-auditor effect.
M49|Common auditors in M&A transactions|We examine merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions in which the acquirer and the target share a common auditor. We predict that a common auditor can help merging firms reduce uncertainty throughout the acquisition process, which allows managers to more efficiently allocate their capital, resulting in higher quality M&As. Consistent with our prediction, we find that deals with common auditors have higher acquisition announcement returns than do non-common-auditor deals. Further, we find that the common-auditor effect is more pronounced for deals with greater pre-acquisition uncertainty and deals involving acquirers and targets that are audited by the same local office of the common auditor. We also find that there is an increased probability of an M&A for firms with a common auditor. Collectively, our evidence suggests that common auditors act as information intermediaries for merging firms, resulting in higher quality acquisitions.
M49|Does PCAOB inspection access improve audit quality? An examination of foreign firms listed in the United States|To gain insight into the impact of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s (PCAOB) auditor inspection program, I examine the association between the PCAOB’s access to inspect auditors of foreign SEC registrants and audit quality. Although the PCAOB is mandated to inspect all auditors of SEC registrants, certain foreign governments prohibit PCAOB inspections of their domestic auditors, providing variation in PCAOB inspection access that is not available when studying a sample of US companies. I find that auditors subject to PCAOB inspection access provide higher quality audits as measured by more going concern opinions, more reported material weaknesses, and less earnings management, relative to auditors not subject to PCAOB inspection access. There is no observable difference between the two sets of auditors prior to the PCAOB inspection regime. The positive effect of PCAOB inspection access on audit quality is observed in jurisdictions with, and without, a local audit regulator. Overall, the results are consistent with PCAOB inspection access being positively associated with audit quality
M49|Customer concentration and corporate tax avoidance|Firms with a concentrated corporate customer base need to hold more cash and have a stronger incentive to manage earnings upwards. Since tax planning can increase both cash flow and accounting earnings, firms with a concentrated customer base may be more likely to engage in tax avoidance. We find evidence of a positive association between the level of corporate customer concentration and the extent of tax avoidance. In addition, we find that the positive relation between corporate customer concentration and tax avoidance is more pronounced when a firm has a lower Market Share in its industry, enjoys less revenue diversification, and engages less in real earnings management. In contrast to corporate major customers, governmental major customers provide stable cash flow to suppliers, which is likely to alleviate supplier firms’ need for tax avoidance. We find that firms engage in lower levels of tax avoidance when they have a governmental major customer, and that this association is less pronounced under Democratic presidencies. Taken together, our findings indicate that a firm's customer concentration (i.e., corporate and governmental major customers) has a significant effect on the extent to which it avoids taxes.
M49|Credit rating model development: An ordered analysis based on accounting data|In this paper we propose and test a methodology for constructing a credit rating model. We follow a polytomous ordered probit analysis leading to the specification of statistically significant credit rating intervals. We test our model with accounting data of Greek listed firms over the years 2004–2013, a period which includes both the pre-crisis growth and the crisis phase of the Greek economy and the stock market. Using the empirically—based rating categories that the model generates endogenously, we observe not only a clear and timely response of ratings to the changing economic environment, but we also obtain significant predictive ability over a period of one, two and three years.
M49|Ethical values in the evaluation of corporate social performance|Purpose - – This paper aims to explore two factors that may moderate the relation between an individual’s ethical values and their evaluation of competing ethical and financial outcomes. It is argued that distance (i.e. low proximity) attenuates moral intensity, thereby inhibiting ethical decision-making (EDM). In contrast, it is argued that presenting outcomes in a separate social and environmental perspective in the balanced scorecard (BSC) increases EDM. Design/methodology/approach - – In an experiment, participants evaluated social outcomes presented in a BSC. Proximity and scorecard format were manipulated in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Findings - – The results indicate that physical and social proximity increase the extent to which performance evaluation is influenced by the ethical values of the evaluator. Contrary to expectations, BSC format did not influence the EDM of the evaluator. Research limitations/implications - – Participants were undergraduate students which may limit the generalisability of the results. Further research should be conducted with practicing managers. The study focused on a particular ethical issue, hiring and training from the local community. Further research is necessary to consider the effect of personal ethical values on other aspects of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Practical implications - – This study indicates that ethical values will be less salient when the outcomes relate to distant locations. There are important implications for multinational corporations seeking to avoid the liability of foreignness in their distant operations. Originality/value - – Previous CSR research has focused on the institutional level. The focus of the authors on the individual’s decision-making process increases our understanding of the biases that can affect EDM.
M49|The provision of business advice to SMEs by external accountants|Purpose - – Business advisory services are an emerging service category for external accountants in the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) environment. The purpose of this study is to investigate determinants of SME demand for business advice, drawing on the agency theory, relational marketing and resource-based literatures. Design/methodology/approach - – The study empirically tested theoretical predictions based on an Australia-wide survey of SMEs, in which 485 firms responded to a questionnaire. Findings - – The results show that the purchase of business advice is significantly and positively associated with the perceived competence of the external accountant, but significantly and negatively associated with length of the relationship. However, the authors observe a significant positive interaction between tenure of the relationship and competence. A unique contribution of this study is the development of the understanding of the combined role of the external accountant’s competence and the tenure of the relationship. The findings indicate that SMEs require time to verify whether accountants have the competence to provide business advice, suggesting that information asymmetry and uncertainty is minimised only after SMEs have nurtured relationships with their external accountants, and after they have developed some confidence in the competence of their external accountants. At the same time, the negative association with tenure suggests that when accountants are not perceived as competent advisors, SMEs purchase less advice over time. Research limitations/implications - – The paper has important theoretical implications by augmenting agency theory, the relational marketing and the resource-based literature, and it clarifies which antecedent factors are important in explaining demand for business advisory services provided by accountants to their SME clients. In particular, the paper highlights the importance of the combined roles that the external accountant’s competence and tenure play in the SME–accountant relationship, highlighting how these two factors can overcome credence issues and ex ante information problems. Practical implications - – The findings have practical implications for government initiatives targeting support to SMEs, as the findings identify small firms and firms planning to grow as likely to gain the greatest benefit from external advice and support. Originality/value - – This study adds to the limited literature and scant theoretical discussions on the emergence of business advisory services that accountants provide to their SME clients by drawing on several theories to explain the determinants of business advice.
M49|The 'Typical' Club? A Configuration Analysis of Scottish Football Clubs|The focus of this paper is the complex relationships amongst ownership, financing, accountability and governance structures on the performance, resilience and perceived value of Scottish professional football clubs. However, there are numerous clubs which would regard themselves as successful without recently, or indeed ever, winning a trophy. For many, avoiding relegation or surviving until the end of the season could constitute success. Many contemporary professional football clubs are now complex businesses, intrinsically concerned with financial matters. Yet it is not uncommon for financially secure clubs to be criticised while the owners of clubs with extreme levels of indebtedness are praised for their commitment. We conceptualise football clubs as boundary objects; organizations that co-exist in different social worlds, serving different functions for those in these social worlds. Football clubs can be seen as spaces where different values/ideas can be translated and exchanged, and therefore the value of a football club is something that a club co-determines through engagement with its key stakeholders. The resilience of a football club is likely to be affected by a combination of different notions of value and the diversity of roles demanded by its network of stakeholders. This suggests that it is the alignment between a clubâ€™s ownership structure, governance mechanisms, accountability and methods of financing and the demands from the social worlds in which it inhabits that will be critical for the success, however defined, of a club.
M49|Value Relevance Of Voluntary Risk Disclosure Levels: Evidence From Saudi Banks|This study seeks to examine whether the levels of voluntary risk disclosure in Saudi listed banks are valuerelevant or not. The sample of this investigation consists of all banks listed on the Saudi Stock Market Exchange (Tadawul). All data was collected from the annual reports of the sample banks from 2009 to 2013 using manual content analysis. Other variables were collected using DataStream and Bloomberg. Ordinary least squares regressions analysis was used. The findings of the multivariate analysis demonstrated that there is no association between the levels of voluntary risk disclosure and firm value as measured by the market to book value at the end of the year (MTBV). But, the results generate from the accounting based measure (ROA) show that there is a positively significant association between the levels of voluntary risk disclosure and firm value. This study contributes to the literature on general accounting disclosure and in particular advances and contributes to the literature on risk disclosure in developing economies. It also contributes to the understanding of the role of accounting information in relation to the market valuation of a firm. The empirical findings of this study have several implications for banksâ€™ investors, regulatory bodies and any other interested group as they report the importance of corporate risk disclosure and its economic consequences. This can be used to increase the value relevance in the banking sector. This study also informs regulators about the current level of risk disclosure in all Saudi listed banks.To the best of the researcherâ€™s knowledge, no prior research has been conducted on the relationship between firm value and levels of risk disclosure in general nor especially in emerging markets, such as Saudi Arabia, the focus of this study
M49|Social And Environmental Accounting: Evidence From The Stock Exchange Of Mauritius|This paper looks at the social and environmental disclosure in Mauritius. In particular, the listed companies of Mauritius were targeted to assess their views for and against the social and environmental practices. Using a sample of 30 listed companies, the results suggest that there are listed companies in Mauritius which are engaged in some of the elements of social and environmental accounting (SEA) practices such as disclosing issues, ensuring transparency, complying with corporate governance. However, there are still areas of improvement such as proper education and wellbeing of the citizen, training, employment of handicapped person with adequate equipment amongst others which need to be addressed.
M49|Gaap Vs. Ifrs Treatment Of Leases And The Impact On Financial Ratios|As of January 1, 2013, most of the world financial market economies are using International Reporting Standards (IFRS) as the required framework for financial statements. A non-comprehensive listing includes the European Union Countries, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand. In the United States, US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is still required but adoption of IFRS has support of many accounting firms and professional organizations and is under consideration by the SEC. This case study focuses on differences in the treatment of leases and the impact of these differences on financial statements and selected financial ratios. Students take GAAP financial statements and prepare an IFRS based balance sheet, cash flow statement and income statement.

M49|A Chinese Kandi Recipe: One Part Sustainability And One Part Entrepreneurial Spirit|The call for environmentally sustainable business practices is growing in momentum. As supplies of fossil fuels decline, damages from environmental disasters mount and radical climatic effects appear, the logical result is that organizations operate in a more eco-friendly fashion. This paper examines the efforts of one Chinese automobile company, Kandi Technologies Group, Inc., to deal with the level of air pollution in China. Kandi and various end users may be in the process of transforming the way consumers think about and use automobiles. The Kandi Model is one where customers no longer own, but rather lease or share electric vehicles. Implications for the number of privately owned vehicles, air quality, and urban congestion are provided.
M49|Corporate Social Responsibility And Professionals Of Economic Sciences – Administrative , Responsabilidad Social Empresarial Y Los Profesionales De Las Ciencias Económico - Administrativas|"Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) plays an important role in government, academia and corporate (businesses). In this study, we were particularly interested in the advances of CSR in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and the understanding that professionals with a degree on administration, economics, finance have of CSR. To determine the level of understanding and implementation of CSR in MSMEs, We applied a 13-item questionnaire to a sample of 383 business professionals. Data collection took four weeks. We collected 183 questionnaires in the first week and 200 questionnaires in second weeks. The remains two weeks were used for data processing. The results show that MSMEs professionals supportthe implementation of CSR practices to bolster the protection of natural resources and fulfillment of ""Cleaner Production"" as part of the principle of sustainability and CSR"
M49|Assessment of corporate governance disclosure in the GCC countries using the UNCTAD ISAR benchmark|This paper aims to present and analyze corporate governance disclosure (CGD) practices among listed non-financial companies in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries’ stock exchanges. GCC include Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates (UAE). The study utilizes the benchmark developed by the Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting (ISAR) of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). This benchmark comprises 52 disclosure items that are divided into five broad categories: (a) financial transparency and information disclosure; (b) ownership structure and exercise of control rights; (c) board and management structure and process; (d) corporate responsibility and compliance; and (e) auditing. This benchmark is based on the UNCTAD publication Guidance on Good Practices in Corporate Governance Disclosure. Results indicate a low level of CGD since corporate governance is still considered novel in the GCC countries. The average disclosure level was 26% while the maximum was 65%. The category with the highest disclosure level was the ‘Financial transparency and information disclosure’ which is the case with other emerging markets. Providing an assessment of CGD using ISAR benchmark provides a tool for its future re-assessment in the GCC countries. Results show how important it is to enhance the awareness of CGD in the GCC countries stressing its importance on the micro and macro levels. Results also provide regulators and policymakers with recommendations on enhancing CGD in the GCC counties. The evaluation of CGD in the GCC countries can also help various stakeholders in their investment decision making.

M49|The Role of the Patrimonial Result Account in Rendering Performance in the Secondary Educational Institutions|Through its tools, in particular through patrimonial result account, accounting gives information about the performance in the secondary educational institutions and beyond. In the work â€ Informational valence regarding the role of the patrimonial result account in rendering performance at secondary educational institutionsâ€ it is presented an analysis model of the performance in the pre-university education institutions based on the economic-financial indicators. These indicator simply an analysis of the dynamics and structure of revenues, costs, results and enable the knowledge of the resource management in order to cover expenses from the revenue, their evolution and their total balance. The analysis was based on hypothetical data over a period of two years, and after this period it was determined that the institution has managed to maintain its level of efficiency in resource management.
M49|Utilisation of the Hungarian SAO's Work in the Light of Auditing Public Procurements|In the last two years, the State Audit Office of Hungary has played a major role in uncovering irregularities in public procurements. 30-40 per cent of the public procurement legal remedy cases were initiated on the basis of recommendations provided by the office. As an audit organisation and the initiator of public procurement legal remedy proceedings, the SAO has an insight into the reasons of irregularities. The basis for good public procurement can and must be created by observing the relevant legal regulations regarding the internal control system. Whether public procurement procedures are conducted in the required manner depends on keeping appropriate records, collecting the right data in a targeted way as well as making thorough preparations. If a given organisation does not provide all the sufficient and required information or the information is not available on site, there is a very high risk of irregularities to occur. These risks can be reduced through the effective control of public finances – especially through the internal control system.
M49|Empirical study on the effect of the return on investment on budgetary slacks in investment expenditures|The purpose of this thesis is to undermine the possible effect of the return on investment on budgetary slacks. Prior literature on slacks, on the one hand, and return on investment on the other is rather extensive. Hence, we have been appraising the effect of the ROI on budgetary slacks in investment expenditures. For this purpose, we have been setting a cross-sectional study in a worldwide known company by using inferential statistics. We did not find any effect or possible association between this profitability ratio and budgetary slacks, however, we found that slacks could be highly influenced by the size of the project. Firstly, this might suggest that the ROI is not a good tool to manage budgetary slacks in investment expenditures and secondly, the fact that slacks could be influenced by size might undermine the “weaknesses” of some papers on this very subject.
M49|How compliant is the Romanian accounting with the Europan directives and international accounting standards?|"Cultural, economic, political, religious and social differences exercises influence also at accounting level, most contradictions existing between Anglo-Saxon and continental accounting systems. European directives, as well as IFRS are not binding in law, they do not bind national courts only in terms of outcome to be achieved and leaves them free when it comes to form and means used to achieve it. The enunciated aspect explains why we are dealing with national standards (rules) considering that, not only once, legislature and specialists in the field in our country have embraced all the collocations of ""harmonization"", ""convergence"" and newer, ""compliance"" of Romanian accounting regulations with European directives, with international accounting standards, namely IFRS, by which heads all countries and contributing to the globalization of accounting. The question naturally arises, how are European directives comply with International Financial Reporting Standards? but our national accounting regulations with IFRS or European directives? To answer these questions we considered useful to undertake a comparative empirical study in the international-European-national perimeter."
M49|Determinants of Internal Audit Task Performance in Nigerian Tertiary Institutions: A Conceptual Approach|The increasing rate of financial irregularities, fraud, and mismanagement rocking Nigerian Tertiary Institutions calls for concern. Despite all control measures put in place by the government, coordinating and regulating agencies, and the institutions themselves, lack of transparency and accountability continues unabated. Literature and documentary evidence have shown that lack of functional internal audit department is one of the factors responsible for the frequent occurrence of these acts. The objective of this study, therefore, is to examine conceptually management support and communication skills as the key factors affecting internal audit task performance in the Nigerian tertiary institutions. Based on the existing literature and the pronouncement of accounting and auditing professional bodies, the study develops a framework of these factors as influencing task performance. The study suggests that adequate management support and effective communication skills of internal auditors will enhance the task performance of internal audit department, hence, curbing the incidence of financial malpractices. The study has policy implications as it will assist the proprietors (government and private individuals), coordinating ministries, regulatory authorities, professional bodies, councils and management of tertiary institutions, and auditors in their decision making and oversight functions.

M49|The Effectiveness of Risk Management Committee and Hedge Accounting Practices in Malaysia|This study examines the effectiveness of Risk Management Committee (RMC) in influencing hedge accounting practices among non-financial companies listed on the Bursa Malaysia. Our regression results reveal that that there is no significant relationship between the application of hedge accounting and the effectiveness of RMCs. However, there are positive and significant relationships between the choice of hedge accounting and each of company size and leverage. The implications of the findings were discussed.
M49|Management of financial results of the organization by using management accounting techniques|The purpose of this article is to analyze methods of management accounting and their impact on the financial results of the company. In flexible manufacturing systems, the information required for management must be obtained in a short time and with minimal costs. We studied in more detail both in theoretical and practical terms, method of management accounting on the basis of the theory of constraints (throughput accounting, TA),shows its historical aspects, principles and methods, methods of calculation of financial results of the company based on it. The main difference of TA method from traditional methods of management accounting is the direction offset from a focus on costs to assessing the value of generating money (throughput). Throughput accounting is designed to solve wide range of problems, through the use of information about the inputs and outputs of the system. Clearly defined information system will enable managers to make informed management decisions in the areas of production, promotion of products (works, services), pricing and others. The article outlines the problem of determining the Throughput rate of the product and the company as a whole and their solutions.
M49|Innovative management control systems in knowledge work: a middle manager perspective|Abstract Integrating theorizing in sensemaking and conceptual or contextualized metaphor theory, this study investigates how middle managers in knowledge work settings support or contest the implementation of changes in management control systems (MCS) by examining how they make sense of the new control roles allocated to them. It draws on case study evidence from an organizational unit of a US multinational technology company. Results from qualitative analysis show that managers employed contextualized metaphors as collective symbols to make sense of and deal with differing views of changes in MCS and the impact on their roles, responsibilities and identity at work. Specifically, the results indicate that individuals’ acceptance of innovative control practices varied and that by remaining unaware of managers’ dilemmas, the organization ran the risk of failing to properly implement the changes, even though the system had been deemed appropriate for knowledge work. Because of their fundamental role in the success of implementing MCS-related changes in knowledge work settings, realizing how middle manager develop an understanding and react to changes in MCS is a critical endeavor for both researchers and practitioners alike.
M49|La transparencia organizativa y económica en la Web de las fundaciones: un estudio empírico para España<BR>[Organizational and financial transparency in the website of the foundations: an empirical study for Spain]|A través de los estudios realizados durante las últimas décadas ha quedado demostrado que la transparencia en el sector no lucrativo en general y en las fundaciones en particular, es un elemento clave para la mejora de la confianza de los agentes interesados en la organización. Dicha transparencia puede ser considerada desde diferentes ámbitos y conseguida a través de distintos canales o medios. Este trabajo se centra en el análisis de la transparencia organizativa y económica de las fundaciones, que es mostrada a través de la información que voluntariamente ofrecen estas entidades en sus páginas Web. Antes de pasar a exponer el trabajo empírico, se realiza una revisión teórica de algunos de los estudios publicados sobre el concepto de transparencia y la importancia en el ámbito no lucrativo. Este marco teórico se ha centrado en la rendición de cuentas que realizan, relacionada con su función social y su gestión, desde la perspectiva de la transparencia informativa a través de la Web. Bajo este enfoque se ha diseñado un índice de transparencia que se refiere a la información que las fundaciones ofrecen en sus Webs de forma voluntaria. El índice ha sido elaborado ad hoc y se ha aplicado a un grupo de grandes fundaciones empresariales, obteniéndose datos de carácter descriptivo e inferencial, por cuanto se determina, mediante un análisis de regresión lineal múltiple, si hay correlación estadística entre la transparencia económica y la transparencia organizativa obtenida a través de la información publicada on line y cuantificada en las variables resultantes del índice. A la luz del análisis se obtienen conclusiones acerca del nivel de transparencia que tienen las fundaciones en lo que se refiere a su información organizativa y económica y la relación explicativa entre ambos tipos.
M49|Reporting of Non-Financial Performance Indicators – a Useful Tool for a Sustainable Marketing Strategy|The current research has as objective to identify the reporting practices of non-financial information through the indicators proposed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the degree in which, for marketing purposes, there is a preference for the communication on positive aspects. In this respect we used the information published into the non-financial reports of 19 organizations that had adhered to the pilot programme of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). We selected a number of 30 environment and social indicators reflecting both positive and negative aspects, and we analysed the manner in which they are presented within the reports published by the organizations, following the activities to be taken into consideration for the development of a sustainable marketing strategy: supply – production – distribution. The results of the study emphasized the fact that, regardless of the sector where the organizations run their activity, though there is no homogenous display, they report mainly the indicators presenting positive information 53 %), whereas the indicators presenting negative information are reported only in proportion of 33%. The organizations holding information regarding suppliers’ sustenability emphasize this aspect in order to create a brand value whereas the rest of the organizations state that they shall proceed to such evaluations in the future. Interpreting these results through the agency of the institutional theory leads to the conclusion that certain organizations’ option to voluntarily report according to a certain referential is carried out mainly in order to obtain rightfulness. Moreover, the sustainable conduct adopted by the main market competitors generates a mimetic-type isomorphism.
M49|About Ethics In Plant,Machinery And Equipment Valuation Domain|In this paper we put in discussion some ethical aspects of plant, machinery and equipment valuation. After a presentation of the general issues of ethics in valuation domain, we analyze the application of the fundamental ethical principles in plant, machinery and equipment valuation domain. To support our conclusions we use some findings of a study that we conducted to identify the particularities of the plant, machinery and equipment valuation activity in Romania.
M49|Employees Stimulation Policies From Accounting And Fiscal Perspective|More and more frequently, the negotiation of the said wage of the employees is accompanied by the possibility to get additional bonuses by the nature of food vouchers, distributed profits, rewards granted by various circumstances, advantages in nature of other similar elements. The specialty literature defines the assembly of the elements mentioned through the concept of wage packet. At the level of the entity's management we can find, on one hand, the awareness of the fact that the proposal of some attractive wage packet represents an important factor for the increase of financial performances, but, on the other hand, it can be also noticed a reservation regarding the effective implementation determined, among others, by the fiscal implications related to these.This paper aims the approach of the mentioned aspects both in terms of the accounting treatment applied and in terms of the fiscal implications related.
M49|Opinions Concerningthe Organizationof Standard Costs Accountancy|The main purpose of this research is to present a way for organizing the accountancy under the conditions of applying the method of standard costs, such that to allow both the registration of standard and effective costs and the separate registration of the deviations from standard costs. Making some pertinent and performance decisions is mainly influenced by the quality of the information provided to managers and by the promptitude they are sent. This desiderate is not possible if using classical methods for calculating costs, reason for which it is mandatory to organize and implement a managerial accountancy, based on using a modern method, namely the method of standard costs. The main implications of this method consist of establishing a pertinent cost, orientated towards the entity management, regardless the activity domain where it is implemented. The carried out study concerns only one of the phases performed for applying the method of standard cost, respectively the organization of the standard costs accountancy.
M49|Can Be Used The Income Approach In Plant,Machinery And Equipment Valuation|In this paper we put in discussion some cases “when it can” or “when it can’t” be used the income approach in plant, machinery and equipment valuation. After a presentation of the particularities of the plant, machinery and equipment valuation we describe the income approach and we present some case studies about when it can or it can’t be use the income approach in this field. To support our conclusions we use some findings of a study that we conducted to identify the particularities of the plant, machinery and equipment valuation activity in Romania.
M49|An Empirical Analysis of Metadiscourse in the Abstracts of Romanian Accounting Research Articles|Metadiscourse is vital in academic writing, whereas abstracts are arguably considered by some authors to be the most important part of an academic paper. The aim of this paper is to study the evolution of interactional metadiscourse elements present in the abstracts of accounting research articles (RA) published in the Journal of Accounting and Management Information Systems (JAMIS) over the period 2006-2014. 130 RA abstracts were analyzed, yielding a total of 25,570 words. The research design is empirical. The research hypotheses have all been accepted. First, there is a correlation between the publication’s maturity and the number of interactional instances. Second, the number of such metadiscourse elements has increased over time. Third, hedges, boosters and attitude markers are the most frequent elements of interactional metadiscourse. This suggests that once Romania underwent historical changes (such as the transition from the communism to capitalism, the integration in the European Union, the adaptation to the internationalization trend in research), Romanian accounting authors became increasingly aware of their place in the competitive scholarly community, whereby this awareness becomes tangible through the increased use of interactional metadiscourse elements.
M49|Blended Learning in Tertiary Accounting Education in the CEE Region – A Polish Perspective|Nowadays, universities increasingly exploit the potential of the internet implementing blended learning as a key feature of modern education. The paper focuses on the quality, benefits and drawbacks of online academic accounting courses. On the basis of literature review and previously performed empirical studies we have developed four research hypotheses. In order to verify them, we have conducted a survey among students at Cracow University of Economics in Poland. The sample consists of 713 students who participated in blended learning courses in International Accounting, Bank Accounting and Controlling and Accounting Computer Systems. The results of the survey have shown that blended learning is positively perceived by students. Over half of them stated that e-classes did not differ from the traditional ones in terms of difficulty. The most important benefits of e-classes were: the possibility of learning at any place and time, saving time and lower costs of education. The most serious drawbacks included the impossibility to ask questions on a regular basis, the lack of direct contact with the teacher and the need for independent education organization. The regression analysis has provided evidence that students’ attitude towards e-classes is the most important determinant of their satisfaction with the course after its completion.
M49|Some Issues Related To Cash Flow Statement in Accounting Education: The Case of Turkey|This paper focuses on some issues related to the cash flow statement in the context of accounting education in Turkey. I identify eight aspects related to the cash flow statement based on my experience in teaching IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows, and discuss their evolution over time. The paper also incorporates the educational perspective of Turkish accounting academics who teach an undergraduate level accounting course that covers this statement. For the purpose of this study, a survey of Turkish academics was conducted. The findings provide insights on how the students' competencies related to the cash flow statement should be improved in the context of undergraduate level accounting education in Turkey and, by extension, in Central and Eastern European countries. While the paper is focused on the Turkish context, the findings might be of interest for other countries in the region, embarked in the modernization of financial reporting and International Financial Reporting Standards-based accounting education.
M49|The Long Term Impact Of Different Methods Of Boosting The Activity|The activity of a company, given the actual conditions characterized by financial difficulties due to the economic crisis, are confronting a conglomerate formed by difficulties and unknown elements whose management involves the detailed knowledge and understanding of the phenomena that gravitates in the activity area of the company. The economic crisis that has challenged the survival of the companies transmitted to the management that in order to survive certain environment troubles, it is necessary for the companies to be flexible, the measures to be adopted rapidly and the companies’ objectives to always target the insurance of profitability and necessary cash flow. The non-fulfillment of the objectives that target the profitability and insurance of cash flow leads to a company in difficulty. A company that is not profitable cannot continue its activity because the funds at its disposal do not allow normal financing of the operating cycle. The fact that the Romanian economy has gone through a hard and unknown path, from an economy that worked under planned economy principles to a market economy, is remarkable. The fact that companies went through different extreme situation needed recovery strategies and revitalization of the activity in order for them to resist and overcome the difficult moment. The privatization, merger/acquisition, insolvency do not mean a recovery and revitalization strategy, but only a method. In this regard, a strategy may include more methods that can be applied in different stages of the evolution of a company. Regarding the results a method or a recovery and revitalization strategy may have, they depend very much on the external environment of the company and the management’s ability to take into consideration all the variables that may influence the results. Only by referring to the privatization process that took place in Romania and the diversity of methods through which it was made, we can conclude that its quantitative dimension wil not be found in a near future. In the same conditions we can also discuss about the volume of nationalizations that were made at the middle of the XX century.
M49|An Overview On State Of Knowledge Of Risk And Risk Management In Economics Fields|The purpose of this paper is to present a history and an evolution of concepts of risk and risk management in economic, respectively financial fields, highlighting the usefulness (or not) and complexity of tools for risk assessment developed over time. The main objective of risk management is to reduce costs and increase the value of company and stakeholders gains; also, a coherent risk management strategy may improve entity capital structure which will derive in a healthy financing policy. The risk and risk management field has been developed merely after the second world war and creates the favourable context of a new C position in business chart – Chief Risk Officer. The paper will explore the etymology of term risk correlated with the uncertainty. Research on risk and risk management is not possible without taking into account the derivatives market.
M49|Why Is Important To Do The Performance Analysis?|This paper deals with the importance that should be given to the performance analysis, mainly the one of the profit and loss account, for being able to take the best financial decisions. Profit and loss account is considered the tool that measures business performance. Although appears a question mark on the confidence you need to attach to this result because it arises from the application of the accounting standards and regulations. And there are many possibilities for recognize revenues and expenses, cutoff, income or revenue, expenditure connection, which asks a little caution about the importance given. The aim of the paper is to see how helps the economic analysis in the process of decisions making.
M49|Regression Model For Risk Reporting In Financial Statements Of Accounting Services Entities|The purpose of financial reports is to provide useful information to users; the utility of information is defined through the qualitative characteristics (fundamental and enhancing). The financial crisis emphasized the limits of financial reporting which has been unable to prevent investors about the risks they were facing. Due to the current changes in business environment, managers have been highly motivated to rethink and improve the risk governance philosophy, processes and methodologies. The lack of quality, timely data and adequate systems to capture, report and measure the right information across the organization is a fundamental challenge for implementing and sustaining all aspects of effective risk management. Starting with the 80s, the investors are more interested in narratives (Notes to financial statements), than in primary reports (financial position and performance). The research will apply a regression model for assessment of risk reporting by the professional (accounting and taxation services) for major companies from Romania during the period 2009 – 2013.
M49|Lean Accounting – By When In Romania?|The research is fundamental for the technical progress; its aim is to ensure the visibility of a new concept appeared worldwide – “lean thinking” which could be successfully implemented by Romanian companies too. The article makes a review of the specialized literature regarding this new concept and analyses the evolution of the publication of articles based on the following key words: lean accounting, lean manufacturing, lean philosophy, lean production and value stream. Also, it presents the stage of publishing specialized articles by Romanian authors or in Romanian magazines indexed in international databases.
M49|When Organizations Deinstitutionalize Control Practices: A Multiple-Case Study of Budget Abandonment|Drawing on a framework of deinstitutionalization, this study explores the abandonment of budgeting through a multiple-case study of four companies. The findings illustrate how a number of antecedents to deinstitutionalization acted in each setting and show that abandonment was only achieved through skillful agency by dominant insiders to construct the need and manage for change. In addition, an interesting finding of the study is that two of the four companies reversed the deinstitutionalization and re-introduced traditional budgeting. This is explained by highlighting the role of remnants of formerly institutionalized practices and by demonstrating the importance of administrative and cultural controls which can support the abandonment of a central control practice in the first place. Overall, this research extends previous studies of deinstitutionalization by analyzing a taken-for-granted practice at the micro level and by giving a more agentic account of its processes.
M49|Accounting, Management Control and the Financial Function in the Mission of the Firm|Accounting systems are an essential tool for providing information for decision-making intended for the survival of the firm in the long run, which will benefit the different stakeholders of the firm (if managed properly) and society in general. Of course, the financial function and the financial institutions have an important role to fulfill from a social welfare point of view as well: that of obtaining resources at a reasonable cost and using them efficiently. But financial management, instead of being a tool, can be converted in the main objective of the firm, and accounting in this context (heavily influenced by finance) may be misused for this purpose, mainly in the short run. Often, this leads to behaviors that become unethical. The functions accounting and finance should perform as understood only as tools to achieve higher objectives (essentially, an operational and sound mission for the firm) are taken to be the objectives to be pursued, to the detriment of the firm's mission itself. Typically, when this is done, this type of inversion of values encourages unethical behavior. This paper is intended to show how this is possible and why, and what the possible ways to keep this from happening are.
M49|An empirical investigation of fraud risk assessment and knowledge requirement on fraud related problem representation in Nigeria|Purpose - – The paper aims to investigate Task Performance Fraud Risk Assessment (TPFRA) and Knowledge Requirement (KR) of the forensic accountant and auditor on Fraud-Related Problem Representation (FRPR) in the Nigerian public sector. Design/methodology/approach - – The study used cross-sectional design and 400 survey questionnaires. The respondents are real professional people (auditors and forensic accountants in the Nigerian public sector) as true representatives to enhance the generalization of the outcomes. A total of 36 indicator items was measured on five-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Partial Least Square – Structural Equation Modelling 2.0 3M and IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 were used as the primary statistical analysis tool for the study. Findings - – The results of the present study confirm the positive relationship between KR on TPFRA, positive relationship of KR on FRPR and positive relationship of FRPR and TPFRA. Specifically, the results revealed that FRPR positively mediates the relationship between TPFRA and KR (forensic accountant and auditor) in the areas of fraud prevention, detection and response. Research limitations/implications - – The first limitation deals with fraud and corrupt practices in a developing country, Nigeria. Examining the mediating influence of FRPR on KR and TPFRA in the public sector could be considered as sensitive and raise the issue of bias. The second limitation is the adoption of cross-sectional design in which data are collected at one point in time. Researchers are encouraged to use a longitudinal design to explore interactions between KR, FRPR and TPFRA. Practical implications - – This empirical study has revealed the value of KR (forensic accountant and auditor) as a significant capability requirement in the workplace. In addition, it shows the importance of FRPR as an important mental state in decision-making or judgment and also the significance of FRPR as an important mediating variable on KR and TPFRA. Originality/value - – No nation is immune to fraud, and loss due to fraud in the public sector is enormous and costly; the result of this research will improve the KR of auditors and forensic accountants in the areas of fraud detection, prevention and response. It will also contribute to the regulatory, legal and institutional frameworks in accounting and auditing systems in Nigeria and portend an increase in demand for forensic accountants.
M49|Corporate social responsibility disclosures and earnings quality: Are they a reflection of managers’ opportunistic behavior?|Purpose - – This paper aims to explore the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures and earnings quality proxied by earnings accruals. Specifically, we examine whether CSR disclosures are context-specific, that is, whether companies dominated by powerful stakeholders are obliged to behave in a responsible manner to constrain earnings management, thereby reporting higher-quality earnings to investors. Design/methodology/approach - – This paper explores the relationship between CSR disclosures and earnings quality proxied by earnings accruals. Specifically, we examine whether CSR disclosures are context-specific, that is, whether companies dominated by powerful stakeholders are obliged to behave in a responsible manner to constrain earnings management, thereby reporting higher-quality earnings to investors. Findings - – Results show that managers in an emerging economy manage earnings when they provide more CSR disclosures. Such earnings management is achieved through income increasing discretionary accruals. Furthermore, companies from export-oriented industries dominated by powerful stakeholders (international buyers) disclosing more CSR activities, provide transparent financial reports through constraining earnings management. Originality/value - – The findings of this study are significant for both investors and policymakers. Investors should not take for granted that firms engage in CSR activities, behave ethically and provide transparent financial reports. As we document that firms might manipulate earnings through discretionary accruals and provide less transparent financial reports to shareholders, the credibility of firms’ CSR policies should be assessed with caution. Policies directing at promoting socially responsible practices instead of motivating the desired behaviour, may provide managers with additional incentives to utilise CSR for opportunistic behaviour. Thus, policymakers need to be cautious about this opportunistic behaviour and enhance monitoring to enforce social compliance. Possibly, some guidelines can be introduced to confirm that CSR disclosures are based on actual practice and not just a “green wash” statement to deceive stakeholders.
M49|Harmonization Of Accounting Systems, A Need For The Foreign Investors In Romania|Intensifying international capital movements combined with an increase of economic entities that use resources from the global markets have generated changes in the way we present the information in the financial statements. For this reason, there is the need of preparation of some financial statements reflecting the performance of the entities in different corners of the world into a global accounting language easily understood by stakeholders. Therefore, to facilitate the interpretation of the information provided by financial statements of entities in the same way in all markets and by all users of accounting information is necessary to reduce and finally eliminate, the differences of accounting treatments used by these companies through the process of international accounting harmonization. The construction sector contributes significantly to the prosperity and competitiveness of the national economy because is well known that a modern and efficient infrastructure is the key to productivity. In nowadays borders no longer represent a hindrance in making investment decisions. But investors are capable to understand the information presented in the financial statements if there is not a common accounting language? In this paper we want to present the factors that influence national accounting systems, considering the fact that a comparison of the financial statements of companies cannot achieve as long as they bears the imprint of different accounting practices and also we want to examine how the implementation of IAS / IFRS takes place in EU. In this paper we want to reflect the importance of the construction sector in regional development.
M49|Mode of Islamic Bank Financing: Does Effectiveness of Shariah Supervisory Board Matter?|This paper examines the relationships between the effectiveness of Shariah supervisory board (SSB), their remuneration and mode of financing Islamic bank. The SSB effectiveness is evaluated by an index based on 9 attributes score. This study comprises 18 Islamic banks in which operating in Malaysia from the year 2012 to 2013 as a sample. Our regression analysis shows that the effectiveness of SSB does not concern with the mode of Islamic bank financing. However, we found that SSB remuneration and bank’s financial growth shown a positive and significant relationship with mode of financing. The implications of these findings are discussed.
M49|Financial Ratios and Prediction on Corporate Bankruptcy in the Atlantic Salmon Industry|This paper addresses the issue of credit risk in the salmon industry. During the period 2000-2002 the Norwegian salmon industry witnessed a period of low prices leading to a wave of defaults and bankruptcies. The consequences were large monetary losses for both investors and banks, highlighting the importance of early detection of failing firms. Using financial ratios measuring the firms' financial status prior to this event, two credit risk models are developed; one using logit regression and the other Classification and Regression trees. The performance of the two models developed is compared to a cross-industry benchmark model developed by the Norwegian Central Bank. The models estimated on industry data is better at separating between companies with high and low credit risk in the salmon industry compared to the benchmark model.
M49|Relationships Between Institutional Ownership, Capital Structure And Research And Development Investment|Research and development (R&D) is vital for an information technology (IT) firmâ€™s innovation. This study investigates the relationship among institutional ownership, capital structure, and research and development investment for 336 listed information technology firms from 2006 to 2009. Empirical evidence shows that there is no significant relationship between institutional ownership and research and development investment. The finding suggests that institutional investors may not influence management decision making on research and development investment. This study also finds that capital structure has a negative relationship with research and development investment. The result indicates that information technology firms may use less debt when the investment outcome is uncertain.
M49|The Effectiveness Of Mobile Based Learning Technology Versus Face-To-Face Learning Of Accounting Information Systems|The fast developments of information and communication technology (ICT) today not only have an impact on the world of industry, but also in the world of education. In the world of education, the useage of ICT is expected to improve the performance, especially the performances of students with regard to their academic matters. The need to improve the quality of accounting graduates who have personal skills has long been a concern of accounting education. This study aims, first to provide empirical evidence that mobile learning will improve student performance not only in technical skills but also in personal skills. Second, to prove and test the effectiveness of mobile learning as opposed to face-to-face learning in improving the competence of accountants in accordance with the standards established by the Indonesian Institute of Accountants (IAI) and the national education goals. Method of learning with mobile technology is expected to support the learning process of the present method so as to improve the competence of accountants in terms of technical competency skills, personal skills, business knowledge and extensive expertise. The third objective is to understand the studentsâ€™ motivation in learning. This study is an exploratory research and developed a new mobile learning application of Accounting Information Systems. This study used quasiexperimental research design to test the new application.. Research results of the pre-test and post-test score indicated that mobile based learning technology is more effective than face-to-face learning for additional learning of accounting information systems
M49|Same Song, Same Dance: Evidence Of Patterns In Securities And Exchange Commission Funding|The actions of Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission subsequent to a financial crisis appear to follow a predictable set of steps. Each tries to position itself to gain the resources it needs to survive by couching its actions in terms of legitimacy. One outcome is a predictable dance that culminates with the annual funding process. The events surrounding the financial collapse of Lehman Brothers and the resulting scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission are hardly unique. In fact, they appear to be the predictable result of a period of boom and bust. These predictions are based on the historical behavior of politicians in funding the Commission. This paper uses an institutional theory perspective to examine the funding patterns in the wake of the collapse of Enron in 2001 and the global financial crisis precipitated by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Implications for the Securities and Exchange Commission are provided.
M49|Profit Return In Civil Aviation And Fleet Insurance: Gaap, Financial Reporting And Tax Applications|In the civil aviation market, unique insurance types are available. This market encompasses a small number of insurers who have the capacity to insure large fleet portfolios. Profit return is the portion of the insurance premium returned to the insured depending on the insurance contract. This paper examines the concept of profit return as used by civil aviation companies along with the scrutiny of accounting and tax applications implemented by Turkish civil aviation companies regarding aviation insurance premia. This work has particular implications on International Accounting Standards, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAPs) and Financial Reporting for a particular setting.
M49|Determinants of debt across sectors: Evidence from Chinese a-share listed firms|Almost all studies carried out so far in China regarding debt examinations do not recognize difference among business sectors. China completed the second split share structure reform of listed firms by the end of 2007, which converted 97% non-tradable shares into tradable shares. However, there has been no study conducted to analyze whether determinants of debt have changed since the reform. Therefore, this study aims to find determinants of debt of listed firms in China by analyzing data after the completion of reform across sectors. Data sample used in this study includes all A-share listed firms in China from 2008 to 2012. After deleting missing values, there are in total 547 firms with 2,735 observations, which are taken as the initial full data sample. The method employed by the study is a panel data model, because it has the advantage of taking both cross-section and time series into consideration. In addition, a Hausman test is employed to identify whether a model with fixed effects or random effects should be used for analysis. The main findings are: (1) Total debt is mainly dominated by short-term debt, while long-term debt is lowly financed. During 2008 - 2012, total debt as well as long-term debts increase, but short-term debt decreases; (2) Determinants have different effects on long-term and short-term debts; (3) The effects of determinants are different across different sectors, indicating that specific sectorial factors are at work; (4) The debt decision tends to follow the static trade-off theory with consideration for effects of non-debt tax shield and profits. In general, both long-term and short-term debts are affected positively by profits at different levels. Firm size is the most important determinant and is positively related to long-term debt, while non-debt tax shield contributes negatively to short-term debt. This paper presents an in-depth understanding of debt decision in listed firms in China using a joint model to test the interaction between employee productivity and debt. It, therefore, provides a new perspective on investigations of debt decisions of firms across sectors.
M49|The geography of US auditors: information quality and monitoring costs by local versus non-local auditors|Borrowing from recent finance research that describes geographic distance as a determinant of information asymmetry and performance, we examine the relation between audit quality and auditor–client proximity. After controlling for monitoring costs (audit fees) and client firms’ selection of auditors, we find that accruals quality (a common proxy for audit performance) improves with auditor proximity. The findings indicate that auditors have information advantage that dissipates with geographic distance (i.e., “soft” information in Berger et al. in J Financ Econ 76(2):237–269, 2005 ; Coval and Moskowitz in J Polit Econ 109(4):811–841, 2001 ; Petersen and Rajan in J Financ 57(6):2533–2570, 2002 ), suggesting that that investors, analysts, and regulators should pay additional attention to information risk for firms audited by non-local auditors.

M49|An Internal Audit Perspective on Differences between European Corporate Governance Codes and OECD Principles|The main purpose of this research is to realize an analysis from an internal audit perspective of European Corporate Governance Codes, in regards with Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development – OECD Principles of Corporate Governance. The research methodology used a classification of countries by legal regime, trying to obtain a global view over the differences between the European corporate governance codes and the OECD Principles provisions, from internal audit’s perspective. The findings suggest that the specificities of internal audit function when studying the differences between European Corporate Governance Codes and OECD Principles lead to different treatment.
M49|Evolution And Quality Of Financial Reporting In Romania: An Overview From 1990 To Present|The results of a business activity are concentrated in the financial reports; accounting is the instrument that provides these reports to internal and external users in order to help users to make useful economic decisions. At international level, the accounting is standardized by IASB (former IASC) which elaborate financial reporting standards (known as IAS / IFRS) in order to improve the quality and transparency of reporting. The changes in business environment (globalization, mergers and acquisition transactions, internationalization, corporate social implications) requires a continuous updated of financial reporting. The accounting information is useful to their users if comply with quality characteristics, defined through the Conceptual Framework of Financial Reporting issued by IASB (the new form of Conceptual Framework is in place starting 2010). Starting 1990, the researchers (namely academics) had to focus on new kind of works about accounting and accounting research; the process was difficult and is not end. Initially, the academics inspired from French accounting books and translated them with some changes/improvements correlated to Romanian economy. Gradually, some journals founded and the academics and practitioners begin to publish their work in a more scientific manner. In this paper, we will try to present an evolution of financial reporting in Romania, to identify if the alignment to international financial reporting standards improved the quality of reporting, and to investigate whether the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards for the individual financial statements of Romanian listed entities has improved the value relevance of the accounting numbers. The study uses data of entities listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, prior and post the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards for the individual financial statements. The year 2012 represents the year in which Romanian entities listed on the regulated market had to prepare their individual financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards. Due to the fact that the analysis aims to capture the quality ante and post the adoption of IFRS for individual financial statements, this analysis is conducted on a five-year period of time, namely between 2009 and 2013. The year 2011 is the year prior to the one in which entities had to prepare their individual financial statements in accordance to IFRS, and the year 2013 represents the second year of reporting accordingly IFRS requirements.
M49|Comprehensive Income Reporting by Listed Companies on the Bucharest Stock Exchange. Econometric Study|It is known that, among the components of financial statements, a statement of profit and loss allows users to assess aspects of the company's performance through accounting result. But, with business development and expansion of multinationals, investors showed interest not only for accounting result, but for a comprehensive income or economic. At international level, issues concerning the determination of Comprehensive income are not recent. In Romania, however, with the application of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the preparation of financial statements of listed companies, starting with the financial year ending at the end of 2012, the concept of comprehensive income acquires another dimension. In this context, we consider it necessary to analyze, through an econometric study, how to report Comprehensive income in the financial statements by a representative sample of companies listed on BSE, the frequency of elements Comprehensive income and the influence of individual components on whole.
M49|Aspects Regarding the Application of Lean Accounting in Taking the Managerial Decisions|The managerial decisions must be taken based on clear, concrete and usable information. The managerial activity involves correct and timely decision-making, this is only if the information based on which the managers act reflects the real activity of the company. This kind of information is provided by Lean Accounting, whose implementation within the company will increase the quality of the managerial decision. The article presents, in a comparative way, some situations where are emphasized the advantages of using Lean Accounting as basis for making decisions that lead to profit growth.
M49|Considerations Regarding Lean Approach Within Management Accounting|Due to the high competitiveness on the market, the managerial decisions have to be fast and correct because any type of hesitation or error can have major negative effects. Now more than ever, it is very important that the information based on which the decision is made to be accurate and provided in a timely manner in order to justify the quality of the managerial decision. Due to the fact that the traditional accounting is outdated from this point of view because the information is too complex and is not provided in time, the solution would be to use lean accounting instead. The article comparatively presents specific situations which aim to show the way lean accounting works and its terms of use.
M49|Forensic Accountant and Auditor Knowledge and Skills Requirements for Task Performance Fraud Risk Assessment in the Nigerian Public Sector|Despite the Nigerian government efforts at reducing the incidence of fraud and corruption through measures, such as establishing and strengthening organs of accountability and promoting the global best corporate practices, fraud and financial crimes in the public sector continue to be on the increase. This paper examines the capability and competence requirements – Knowledge (KR), Skills (SR) and Task performance fraud risk assessment (TPFRA) of a forensic accountant and auditor in the Nigerian public sector. Also, this study determines whether the forensic accountant has higher levels of SR, KR and TPFRA requirements than the auditor in an emergent area of fraud prevention, detection and response. The study employed cross-sectional design and a survey method. Of the 550 questionnaires distributed, 422 questionnaires were returned and out of which 328 questionnaires retained for analysis. The variables are considered a between-subject factor and measured at two levels with a total of 29 observable items (including demography information). The study used PLS-SEM (SmartPLS 2.0 M3) and IBM SPSS ver. 20.0 as the primary statistical analysis tools. The results of the study confirm the significant positive relationship of SR on TPFRA and KR on TPFRA. Also, the findings revealed that the forensic accountant has significant higher levels of KR, SR and TPFRA than auditor in respect of fraud prevention, detection and response. The implication of this study might result in the overall reduction of fraud and fraudulent acts, promote institutional, regulatory and legal framework, and create awareness amongst the accounting and auditing institutions in the Nigerian public sector.
M49|Does The Accrual Anomaly Exists In Stock Market? Evidence From Pakistan|This study examined the existence of accrual anomaly exclusively in Karachi Stock Exchange by measuring accruals from cash flow approach and by using a sample of 100 non-financial firms registered at Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) for the time period of 2002 to 2013. The objective of the study is to examine the accrual anomaly by measuring accruals from cash flow approach as measuring accruals from balance sheet approach may contain estimation errors which may lead to biased result i.e. existence of accrual anomaly. Robust Fixed Effect method is used to achieve the objective. Result revealed that accruals predict the future stock returns positively when accruals are measured through cash flow approach which is contradictory to the accrual anomaly. It proved that measuring accruals from balance sheet approach contain estimation errors which lead to biased results. The study concluded that accrual anomaly does not exist in KSE and selection of specific estimation method is reason for accrual anomaly.
M49|Mode of Islamic Bank Financing: Does Effectiveness of Shariah Supervisory Board Matter?|This paper examines the relationships between the effectiveness of Shariah supervisory board (SSB), their remuneration and mode of financing Islamic bank. The SSB effectiveness is evaluated by an index based on 9 attributes score. This study comprises 18 Islamic banks in which operating in Malaysia from the year 2012 to 2013 as a sample. Our regression analysis shows that the effectiveness of SSB does not concern with the mode of Islamic bank financing. However, we found that SSB remuneration and bank's financial growth shown a positive and significant relationship with mode of financing. The implications of these findings are discussed.
M49|Forensic Accounting and Fraud: A Review of Literature and Policy Implications|This review present some evidence on fraud, forensic accounting, the skills and education of the forensic investigator. Also, some ex-planation for the diverging views among academics and regulators in relation to detecting fraud are provided. To regulators, I address the question on why academic research in forensic accounting have little significance to inform policy. Further, I present some rich set of questions and identify a number of important directions for future research in forensic accounting. This paper is intended to stimulate debates and future research of the issues identified.
M49|Risk Management Committee and Disclosure of Hedging Activities Information among Malaysian Listed Companies|This paper examines the relationship between Risk Management Committee (RMC) characteristics and the extent of hedging activities disclosure within the annual reports of the Malaysian listed companies. In particular, relationships are tested on RMC size, independence, RMC meeting, RMC gender diversity and RMC training. Our regression analysis shows that RMC independence significantly and negatively influences the extent of hedging activities information disclosure, while RMC meeting positively influences the disclosure. The implications of these findings are discussed.
M49|Hedging Activities Information and Risk Management Committee Effectiveness: Malaysian evidence|This study examines the extent of information about hedging activities disclosures within the annual reports of Main Market companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. The extent of hedging activities disclosures is captured through a 32-item-template, which consists of a mandatory and voluntary disclosure scores. The results of this study indicate that the extent of information on hedging activities disclosure is still insufficient among the sampled companies even though the disclosure scored is quite high. This study also examines the relationship between the existence of risk management committee (RMC), its characteristics and the extent of information on hedging activities disclosure in two separate statistical models. The regression results imply that the existence of RMC is positive but does not significantly influence the extent of information on hedging activities disclosure. However its characteristics (i.e. RMC independence and RMC meeting) have a significant influence. The findings may provide some meaningful insights to regulators, policymakers and researchers, towards the establishment of RMC as a part of the internal corporate governance mechanisms. In addition to its existence, the effectiveness of RMC also needs to be emphasized.
M49|The Effect of Advanced Management Accounting Practices on the Competitive Strategies and Performance|This study is based on a sample of 300 managers from the production industry of West Marmara Region. The goal of this study is to examine the interaction among advanced management accounting practices, competitive strategies and company performance. As a result of study, it is found that advanced accounting management practices have a positive effect on the company performance and competitive strategies. In addition, competitive strategies have an effect on the company performance positively. Furthermore, there is a positive and significant relation between long-term strategy based on management accounting practices and non-financial company performance and between activity based on management accounting practices and financial performance.
M49|Agronomists and accounting. The beginnings of capitalist rationalisation on the farm (1800-1850)|At the dawn of the nineteenth century numerous debates took place on the development of capita-list agriculture and the ways of making as much profit as possible from farm land. Until now this subject has hardly been examined and is unique in that it pertains to the economic history of agriculture, the history of agronomy and the history of managerial thinking. This article aims to highlight the usage of double-entry accounting for agronomic experiments in the first half of the nineteenth century, as well as the significance of the results and the way these were debated. Our aim is to present the authors’ reasons and the role played by bookkeeping in the construction of economically rational knowledge and reasoning. Thus we will bring to light two mechanisms which are common to this accounting quantification drive: data tabulation and the inclusion of data in balance sheets, making it possible to compare inputs and outputs in production processes.
M49|The impact of moral intensity dimensions in ethical decision making process of Albanian accounting students|"Several accounting and corporate scandals such as the collapse of Enron, Arthur Andersen, WorldCom, and Parmalat have shaken the business world over the last decade. After numerous studies, it is concluded that the main reason of this scandals have been especially the unethical conduct of accountants.Today more than ever, unfortunately, profit at any cost has become the most negative factor that endangers the accounting profession. Financial scandals all over the world, financial crisis that continues to be present, and the last cases of businesses rigging in Albania, in which are involved both accountants, have brought the issues of ethics in accounting in attention of the accounting professionals and academics. This paper investigates the ethical decisions of accountancy students and in particular analyses the effect of moral intensity dimensions: magnitude of consecuences, social consensus, temporal immediacy in ethical decision-making process of those individuals. Two classes of final year accountancy students of the ""Aleksander Xhuvani"" University in Elbasan, Albania were presented with four ethical scenarios. Based on their responses about this scenarios, this study came in the conclusion that three dimensions of moral intensity affect significantly the three first stages of ethical decision making process of the students that participate in the study.Since noticed a limited number of studies regarding ethical decision making of accountants in countries with developing economies, like Albania, this study will provide a valuable contribution in relation to this important issue of our country. It will conclude with some valuable recommendations on measures to be taken regarding the improvement of the current situation."
M49|Going Concern Research Assessment for Quoted Romanian Agricultural Companies|In a world without frontiers, the need for financial information is becoming greater and greater, being considered the main control instrument in economic activities.The transparency of financial information cannot be achieved without accountancy and audit contribution, main factors in identifying the observance of going ? concern assumption.Moreover the financial crisis may determine the risk increase which affects the proper development of business, in general and of agricultural activities, in particular. This increase in risk may be interpreted as a greater uncertainty as regards the agricultural companies capacity to continue their activity. The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate the logical connection between the observance of going concern principle in agricultural activities with the decrease of bankruptcy risk. The necessity to predict the bankruptcy risk is relevant not only for governance and company management but also for all other participants in the social act which interferes with the company. Therefore, the continuation of activity can be assessed by different methods applied to annual financial situations. The analysis is achieved both by using accounting methods and also by financial statistic methods. The present day economic life makes the audit resort to these methods of scientific and statistical analysis, directing the audit to another method ? the metric audit. The scientific ? technical basis of this paper is given by the research regarding the necessity of going concern ? an element of risk management.In order to make this research there have been used information and specialety reference materials. In order to attain the proposal objective there has been used a methodology of fundamental research as regards risk character.
M49|Ownership Structure and Dividend Policy: An Analysis of Consumer Goods Indusry in Nigeria|The study is aimed at determining the impact of ownership structure on dividend policy of firms listed in the Nigerian Consumer Goods Industry. The study employs the ex-post-facto research design. Data were collected from annual reports and accounts of sampled companies and were analysed using descriptive statistics, correlation and multiple regression methods. The study finds that insider share ownership (ISO) and outsider share ownership (OSO) have negative and insignificant impact on dividend per share (DPS) while block share ownership (BSO) has positive and insignificant impact on DPS. However, the impact of control variable earnings per share (EPS) on DPS is positive and significant. The study recommends that, in the analysis of dividend policy of companies in the consumer goods industry in Nigeria stakeholders should pay limited attention to the ownership structure of the company but the bottom line, as it is the earnings that matters not the dividend or ownership structure. This is because dividend per share is determined significantly by earnings not how the company is owned. However, considering dividend payout ratio as determinant of dividend payment, it is recommended that dividend clientele may be encouraged to invest in the consumer goods industry in Nigeria where there is high rate of block share ownership.
M49|New Didactic Approaches in Accounting: Moving Beyond the Calculation Exercise|Case studies have been utilized frequently throughout business curricula. In the domain of accounting, however, cases have not been as proliferated. The aim of the paper is demonstrate the use of secondary case studies in the didactics of an undergraduate introductory accounting course. Authentic stories from professional journals and daily newspapers have been used for students to critically examine real-life accounting applications. Based on subsequent longitudinal student survey undertaken in two consecutive academic years, secondary case studies have been found effective in delivering real-life accounting applications, enabling greater understanding of accounting phenomena, and enhancing didactic approach in and above the accounting domain.
M49|Financial Balance ? An Important Objective for the Stakeholders in Romanian?s Energy Sector|The annual financial statements represent the main point of view through which the stakeholders assess an entity?s financial position. An important aspect followed by the stakeholders is the existence of a solid financial position, which is manifested through a financial balance. The present study seeks to analyze the financial position of the Romanian entities that are representative to the energy sector, based on specific indicators of appreciating the financial balance. Within the analysis, indicators such as net situation, working capital, the need of working capital, net treasury and many others were taken into account.Also, within the study we tried to highlight the main differences between the analysis of the financial balance based on the regular balance sheet and its analysis based on the financial balance sheet. Thereby, one of the main objectives of this study is to present the main advantages that the financial balance sheet brings to the analysis of the financial balance and raising the awareness of the stakeholders towards this approach.The results of the study have shown significant differences between the analyzes made on different types of balance sheets. These results could open new research directions, such as more detailed analyzes based on the financial balance sheet, but could also raise the awareness of the stakeholders (except the governments) about the fact that the balance sheet, in its present form (form which is imposed by the law), has some boundaries, and for a meaningful analysis of the financial position (financial balance) it is often necessary to resort to derivative forms of the balance sheet.
M49|Do Estate Tax Rates Really Affect Charitable Bequests? A Regression Model Analysis Of Estate Distributions|The United States federal estate tax, in a variant of its current form, has been in effect for almost a century, and the charitable bequest deduction has been allowed since the enactment of the tax. Although there has been much discussion of what effect repeal of the estate tax may have on charitable bequests, the evidence for the suggested effects is conflicting. Proponents of the estate tax state that charitable organizations will experience a significant reduction in bequests if the estate tax is eliminated; however, there appears to be a lack of consensus on this possible effect of changing estate tax rates. Previous research has provided mixed and conflicting evidence regarding the effect of changes in estate tax rates on charitable bequests. The purpose of this quantitative study was to identify and analyze the relationship, if any, between changes in estate tax rates, age, gender, marital status, number of heirs, and wealth and the dollar amount of charitable bequests. The study was conducted using an ex post facto multiple regression/correlational design to analyze the probate court records data of 169 estates of decedents from three Michigan counties who died from 2000 to 2010. Supplemental analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA and chi square analysis. The findings of the study indicated estate tax rates and the decedent’s wealth were positively correlated with the dollar amount of charitable bequests, whereas the number of heirs was negatively correlated with the dollar amount of charitable bequests. No significant relationship was identified between the decedent’s age, gender, or marital status and the dollar amount if charitable bequests. Supplemental analysis found gender and the existence of heirs to be significantly related to the decision to leave a charitable bequest, with women and those without heirs more likely to leave a bequest. Because the variables in this study explained only a small portion of the variation in the dollar amount of charitable bequests, further research is recommended to determine other factors that may explain why individuals leave charitable bequests and how they determine the amount of those bequests.
M49|Influencing Factors on Earnings Management, Empirical Evidence from Listed German and Austrian Companies|Purpose – Since the 1960s earnings management has been a widely researched area and became presumably known by the current accounting scandals. This paper aims at empirically showing which factors affect earnings management. Design/methodology/approach – According to former research literature factors are derived, which might influence the companies' earnings management behavior. These factors are the applied accounting standard, the industry sector and the country of official quotation. Although several measurements for earnings management like abnormal accruals or income smoothing exist, this paper is predominantly using the distribution of net income scaled by total assets (RoA) respectively total sales (RoS) as earnings management measure. These earnings management measures have been selected as they can measure the frequency of earnings management in reality and no estimates are necessary. Findings – In general, analyses show that the distribution in earnings management intervals differ from the total population. Most noteworthy is that by adoption of principle-based accounting standards (IFRS/US-GAAP), in case of this study no differences of earnings quality was observable. The other two variables yield in mixed results due to the robustness checks, which indeed questions the scaling variables for data-sets including the financial industries. Research limitations/implications – First, according to the chosen measurement parameter no distinct assertion concerning the reasons for execution or non-execution of earnings management can be deduced. Second, the method of earnings management's identification is not dividable and therefore real-, accounting-, legal- and illegal- earnings management cannot be identified. Third, the research results are just partially generalizable concerning representativity (e.g. other countries, non-market listed companies) and taken for granted just for similar data-sets. Originality/value – Although prior studies presume a rise in earnings quality, which indicates a decrease in earnings management by the adoption of principle-based accounting standards (IFRS/US-GAAP) in comparison to national GAAP, there is no difference or superior accounting standard identifiable through the results.
M49|Considerations Regarding The Accounting Principles Applied In Insolvency Proceedings|The Romanian economy, after 1990, has undergone a comprehensive restructuring process from centrally planned economy to an economy governed by the rules of the market economy, rules of the game led to a competitive type economy, with winners and laggards, with winners and losers. In the first phase, the restructuring of the Romanian enterprises has known just the division into two or more independent entities. Subsequently, according to the model of Western economies, the economic entities in our country during the process of restructuring and reorganization adopted a second way, namely the merger with its two versions: the merger by absorption and merger by fusion. The permanent struggle to maintain the market segments owned or even more to conquer other market segments as well as tax regulations adopted by our country led to the insolvency of a large number of businesses. Recent regulations bring some new administrative and foremost procedures to prevent insolvency. Thus, borrowers in financial difficulty are able to choose one of the following procedures: ad-hoc mandate and the preventive arrangement.
M49|Considerations Regarding The Quality Cost Of Traded Products And Services In The Context Of Performing Management Of The Entity|The quality of products and services offered and the costs of its assurance represent a major concern of the management of any entity, since the influence exerted on its activity is significant. The decisions concerning the quality costs have, on one hand, direct implications of the financial performance of the entity and, on the other hand, on the competitiveness of traded goods and services. In this context, this material proposes itself to illustrate the main aspects regarding the quality and the costs associated to it at the entity's level, which can represent elements which can be considered by the management in the administration of this matter.
M49|Contributions To Optimize Quality Costs In The Automotive Industry|The main goal of the research is that one to present a way of organizing the management accounting, so that it allow the calculate of a cost for quality pertinent for each activity and on every product made in the automotive industry entities. We critically analyzed the current system used to determine and track quality costs at the studied entities, in order to emphasize the need of organization and implement a modern management accounting, which allows quality control costs and increase the entities performance in this area. The research made, revealed the fact that in present the quality calculation costing is organized in terms of using methods that do not comply with accounting principles, and that it is necessary to organize and implement a management accounting, based on the use of modern methods, respective the cost activities method. The major implications of the proposed system for the studied area consists in the determination of a pertinent cost quality oriented toward entity management, highlighting the shortcomings of the methods currently used to manage quality costs.
M49|Towards A Definition Of Controlling|Controlling is a concept that is still subject of many controversies. Nowadays, it is used both in theory and in practice to designate a variety of activities. The paper aims at shedding light on this enigmatic concept. First of all, the author offers an overview of the historical roots of “controlling”. Secondly, different definitions of the concept of “controlling” are contrasted. The author comments upon two types of definitions: concepts oriented towards the goal to obtain results (profit, turnover, low costs) and concepts oriented towards the universal goals of the company (e.g. product-related, environmental, social goals). Last but not least, the paper identifies the different perspectives used when defining the concept, in order to provide the proper background for understanding “controlling”: the information-oriented perspective, the coordination-oriented perspective and the reflection-oriented perspective, and the rationality-oriented perspective.
M49|Activity-Based Costing In The Manufacturing Sector: A Managerial Instrument For Decision-Making|The aim of this paper is to emphasize the importance of using the activity-based costing (management) system in the manufacturing sector. The utility of the ABC (ABM) system concerns decisions taken at a strategic and operational level. In our country, few managers understand the need for such a system and many Romanian companies use only a traditional costing system or don’t use one at all. The paper also includes a case study which is a small example of using the ABC method in a Romanian manufacturing company. The study shows that the ABC/ABM system helps managers to properly manage indirect costs (by activities) and understand the profitability of products, distribution channels and customers. Therefore, it offers a powerful instrument for decision-making. Although ABC is a new system of cost calculation that is absolutely necessary, in most cases the ABC method must be implemented in addition to the traditional costing systems, which are essential for the purposes of management accounting.
M49|The Expansion Of Accounting To The Cloud|The world today is witnessing an explosion of technologies that are remodelling our entire reality. The traditional way of thinking in the business field has shifted towards a new IT breakthrough: cloud computing. The cloud paradigm has emerged as a natural step in the evolution of the internet and has captivated everyone’s attention. The accounting profession itself has found a mean to optimize its activity through cloud-based applications. By reviewing the latest and most relevant studies and practitioners’ reports, this paper is focused on the implications of cloud accounting, as the fusion between cloud technologies and accounting. We addressed this innovative topic through a business-oriented approach and we brought forward a new accounting model that might revolutionize the economic landscape.
M49|The Relevance Of Goodwill Reporting In An Islamic Context|In recent years global finance has seen the emergence of Islamic finance as an alternative to the western secular system. While the two systems posses largely similar concepts of social equity and well-being the major divide between them rests in the distinction between divine and natural law as a source of protection for the downtrodden. As communication barriers between the Arabic and Anglo-European accounting systems start to blur, the question posed for the practitioners as to what constitutes a source of equity becomes more and more relevant. Considering the case of Islamic countries, besides internally-generated and acquired goodwill Islamic sources of social equity such as zakat also provide a source of social equity. For the purpose of this paper, two models pertaining to value relevance are tested for a sample of 56 companies in 6 accounting jurisdictions with the purpose of identifying the underlying sources of social equity revealing that zakat disclosures marginally improve the accuracy of the model.

Para medir y cuantificar estas evidencias, se utilizaron modelos econométricos de corte transversal y de panel de datos, empleando información publicada por sociedades anónimas chilenas, entre el período 2001-2009. El estudio demuestra que mientras mayor es la propiedad de las administradoras de fondos de pensiones en las empresas de la muestra, aumenta la revelación de la información; y por otra parte, el efecto del endeudamiento es negativo, es decir, a mayor apalancamiento menor revelación de información.
M49|Is the activity based costing system a viable instrument for small and medium enterprises? The case of Mexico|Small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) face serious challenges in order to be competitive, and they needto develop strategies enabling them to control their costs. This work aims to analyze and evaluate theimpact, penetration and characteristics of Activity-Based Costs (ABC). This research is of a quantitativetype descriptive design, with a sample of 180 SMEs. The results show low penetration of the ABC in SMEsusing traditional systems, due to the lack of knowledge, and that there are enterprises that do not use anycosting system at all. Finally the Mexican SMEs recognize the compatibility and usefulness of ABC, andthat the most important fact is to understand the possible application of different costing methodologiesfor different purposes.
M49|Presença dos pilares da teoria da estruturação na controladoria com o processo de convergência contábil|Resumo Este estudo objetiva identificar a presença dos elementos que formam os pilares da Teoria da Estruturação na controladoria com o processo de convergência às normas internacionais de contabilidade em empresas brasileiras do Novo Mercado da BM&FBovespa. Pesquisa descritiva foi realizada por meio de uma survey, com abordagem quantitativa do problema, fundamentada na Teoria da Estruturação, segundo as proposições de Giddens (1979; 1996; 2003). Das 118 empresas do Novo Mercado, 36 participaram da pesquisa, constituindo-se na amostra não aleatória. O questionário com 12 perguntas de múltipla escolha foi elaborado com base nos estudos de Macintosh & Scapens (1990; 1991), Barrachina (2001), Junquilho (2003), Giddens (2003), Busco (2009), bem como em um estudo piloto realizado com vistas nesta pesquisa.

M49|A Standardized Net Income Shares Model To Develop Basic Child Support Guidelines|Research regarding child support typically focuses on the effects of child support awards and its underlying principles within child support models. However, researchers have invested little effort in the analysis of child support guideline comparisons or in the development of analyses to determine whether state adopted guidelines seem reasonable based on state-specific macroeconomic variables. This analysis intends to develop a model to determine the reasonableness of child support guidelines for states that use the income shares method based on the net income of both parents. Further, it intends to suggest that the development of a standard model is possible and, to a certain extent, needed, to obtain interstate uniformity. Findings suggest that the implementation of such a model could lead to more equitable and uniform basic child support awards.

M49|Integrating Writing Assignments Into An Historically Non-Writing Intensive Course|Students, faculty, alumni and employers all agree that it is important for students to acquire strong communications skills. However, finding a way to integrate writing assignments into technical courses, such as mathematics and accounting, can prove to be a challenge. This paper discusses one approach to address the problem. Specifically, one course writing assignment, evaluated with the StyleWriter software package, is presented. The use of StyleWriter and a rubric tailored to it, allow the instructor to provide timely, detailed feedback to students regarding both mechanical writing difficulties and content related issues. It is hoped that more faculty will adopt software to help evaluate writing assignments and allow students to hone their writing skills.
M49|Types Of Restatement Decisions And Ex-Ante Red Flags Of Internal Control Quality|We investigate the association between financial restatements and internal controls by examining whether voluntary restatement decisions are associated with internal control quality. We focus on companiesâ€™ voluntary restatements because they are more susceptible to the numerous provisions imposed by SOX. Empirical results show that voluntary restatement decisions are associated with internal control deficiencies, particularly when companies of voluntary restatements suffer higher restatement severity. Our findings imply that voluntary restatement decisions may interpret as signals of internal control quality.
M49|Determinants Of Balanced Scorecard Usage: Indirect Correlation Through Attitudinal Factors|The successful implementation of Balanced Scorecard (BSC) requires a positive attitude toward the BSC. Specifically, the BSC should be perceived as simple to use and of great usefulness. This study develops the measurement of BSC usage and examines whether the determinants impact the BSC usage through attitudinal factors. Most existing studies have quantified the BSC usage by identifying the stages of BSC application whereby the discrete step of usage is reflected rather than the degree of usage. This research work thus develops a measurement to reflect the degree of BSC usage by taking into consideration the key characteristics of BSC usage and their theoretical weights. In addition, this study examines the determinant-innovation relation by drawing on the organizational innovation theory and the technology acceptance model. In particular, this research article seeks to determine whether top management support and training are associated with the BSC usage through the attitudinal factors of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Based on 73 complete questionnaires, it is found that top management support and training are indirectly associated with the BSC usage through the perceived ease of use and the perceived usefulness factors. These findings highlight the vital role of the attitudinal factors as the mediating factors.
M49|The Association between Firm Characteristics and Corporate Financial Disclosures: Evidence from UAE Companies|This paper provides empirical evidence of the impact of firm specific characteristics on corporate financial disclosures amongst UAE companies. A total of 153 public, joint-stock companies, listed and unlisted, were incorporated at the time of study. Both descriptive statistics and multiple regression analyses are used to test the relationship between the characteristics of UAE firms and the extent of their financial disclosure. Eight hypotheses were established to examine the relationship between a number of explanatory variables (namely, type of industry, listing status, return on equity, liquidity, market capitalization, foreign ownership, non-executive directors, and audit committee) and the extent of disclosure in corporate annual reports. The results of this study show that listing status, industry type, and size of firm are found to be significantly associated with the level of disclosure. This finding not only provides support for previous studies, but also is of relevance to those in the UAE who want to understand corporate disclosure and should also be of interest to UAE user-groups. Conclusions drawn from this study may be of interest to policy makers and regulators who want to improve corporate financial disclosure in their countries.
M49|The Neutrality Of The Forward-Looking Information,La Neutralidad De La Informacion Previsional|The near term vision of the company is potentially relevant information for decision-making from different users of financial information. The aim of this paper is to analyze the information content of forward-looking information disclosed in the directorÂ´s report. In the univariate analysis we conclude that the tone of the forward-looking information is optimistic regardless of the companyÂ´s performance, so we confirm that the forecasts are not neutral. But, in the multivariate analysis we found that within that optimism in forecasts is a more optimistic tone among companies that improved results obtained in the following year. Therefore, the tone has some informative content.
M49|The Importance of the Sustainability of Environmental Accounting|Rapid population growth, industrialization, unplanned urbanization, global warming, tourism activities and natural disasters have resulted in environmental issues that have reached global dimensions and started to threaten the life of creatures. For the permanent protection of ecological balance and sustainability, massive national and international regulations are needed. Threatening the life of creatures has not been considered in the system consisting of the establishment of equilibrium between man and nature as required. At this point businesses have important responsibilities. Businesses, for example, in order to prevent environmental pollution waste control systems, filtration systems, recycling methods etc. endured environmental costs in a variety of ways, as these costs are incurred also causes more businesses to see the value of protecting the environment. The result of the activities of environmental impacts of enterprises can be considered, to be taken in the preparation of the necessary data to guide decisions, contacts and presentation of the stages of the environmental accounting system. In this study, we first examine the concepts of environmental accounting, sustainability and environmental costs and then in the cement factories located in Turkey the environmental costs and environmental accounting will be given in the results of a survey made for the calculation of the sensitivity.

In this paper we aim to present a potential research roadmap in this area.
M49|A Strategic Analysis Of Collective Urban Transport In Spain Using The Five Forces Model / Un Análisis Estratégico De Transporte Urbano Colectivo En España Usando Elmodelo De Las Cinco Fuerzas|The transport sector in Spain is a branch of economic activity which is already of great importanceaccording to its own invoicing, value added and occupation figures, in addition to its indirect economic effects. It has an additional strategic value for economic policy, since it constitutes a fundamental part ofthe cost of placing products on increasing markets in a competitive manner. The mobility and trans-portation of passengers in cities in turn plays an essential role in the economic and social activity. All of these reasons, in addition to the recent significant problems of ustainability which this priority sector is currently confronting in all aspects, justify an interest in a study which attempts to obtaina profile of this public service by using a strategic analysis through the application of the traditional Porter Five Forces Model. The application of this model will allow us to obtain a general strategic vision which, when combined with a maturity analysis, ill provide a more in-depth knowledge of the object under study, that will serve as a basis for subsequent analyses of the collective urban public transport service. / El sector del transporte en España es una rama de la actividad económica que tiene ya una gran importan-cia por sus propias cifras de facturación, valor añadido y ocupación, así como por sus efectos económicosindirectos. Tiene un valor estratégico añadido para la política económica por constituir una parte fun-damental del coste de colocación de los productos de forma competitiva en mercados cada vez másamplios. A su vez, la movilidad y el transporte de viajeros en las ciudades tienen un papel esencialen la vertebración económica y social de estas. Todas estas razones, además de los recientes y significativos problemas de sostenibilidad que, desde todas sus vertientes, está teniendo hoy en día estesector prioritario, justifican el interés de este estudio que trata de obtener un perfil de este serviciopúblico mediante un análisis estratégico del mismo, aplicando el modelo tradicional de las Cinco Fuerzas de Porter. La aplicación de este modelo nos permitirá obtener la visión estratégica general que, complementada con un análisis de madurez, facilitará un conocimiento más profundo del sector objetode estudio que sirva de base para posteriores análisis sobre el servicio público del transporte urbanocolectivo.
M49|Financiación Del Servicio Público De Transporte Urbano: Un Estudio Empírico En Las Empresas Españolas / Financing Public Urban Transport: An Empirical Study In Spanish Companies|Los problemas en el sector del transporte público urbano, centrados en la búsqueda de una progresiva mejora en las condiciones técnicas, medioambientales y de calidad del servicio, combinada con una mejora en la eficiencia de sus recursos económicos, hacen que sea necesario diseñar, entre otras cuestiones, un sistema de financiación pública trasparente acorde a las actuales circunstancias económicas de nuestro país. Estos hechos han propiciado el interés e inquietud general en mejorar el conocimiento de la estructura y evolución económica y financiera de las empresas de este sector. Esta circunstancia favoreció la creación, en 2010, del Observatorio de Costes y Financiación del Transporte Urbano Colectivo (Observatorio TUC) que ofrece información de las condiciones de explotación y financiación de las concesionarias de transporte urbano colectivo en superficie en España, a través de la generación de medidas representativas de patrones de comportamiento en costes y financiación. A partir de los resultados de las medidas representativas del Primer Informe del Observatorio TUC (2008-2009), en este trabajo se realiza un estudio descriptivo de la estructura económico-financiera de las empresas, para identificar los factores explicativos de la problemática actual de la financiación del servicio de transporte público urbano en España. / The sensitivity in the public urban transport sector, focusing on a progressive improvement in the economic and technical management of passenger services and the need to design a transparent public finance system and according to the current economic circumstances, has led to increased interest and concern to improve the knowledge of its structure and evolution. This has encouraged the emergence of the conditions for the adoption of the initiative of the institutions that have promoted the creation of the Costs and Funding of Collective Urban Transport Watchdog (TUC Watchdog). The TUC Centre’s objectives focus on the study of the operating conditions and financing of surface urban public transport concessions in Spain, through the generation of representative measures of behavior patterns, in order to enhance the real knowledge of the sector. In this paper, we present a study of the current problems in the financing of urban public transport in Spain, from the work carried out for the first report of the TUC (2008-2009).
M49|The Significance of 18 Weeks in Internet Business Reporting Research (IBR): A New Dimension in Data Collection Procedures|The present study intends to explore and ascertain the appropriate time interval in which the information on corporate website changes significantly. A sample of top 50 listed companies was drawn from five countries, namely the US, the UK, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia. The quality of the internet business reporting (IBR) practices is measured using the IBR quality (IBRQ) index as it permits relevant quantification. This study involves careful examination of the time interval data within 9 and 18-week intervals. Initial analysis revealed that there was no significant difference on the quality of IBR practices within 9 internet-weeks but significant changes for website financial content, website non-financial content, and total score of the IBRQ within 18 internet-weeks. Nonetheless, further analysis involving developed and developing countries as well as individual country revealed diverse results. The present study offers new insight that complements the existing body of knowledge. The present findings are unable to provide conclusive evidence that the information on corporate websites changed significantly after 18 weeks. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates longitudinal analysis of increasing important website data trends with relevance to IBR practices.
M49|Controlling in Romania. A Literature Review|Nowadays, the controller is considered to be operating as a business partner of the management. Controlling acts as a vital managerial support that enables companies not only to survive, but also to succeed in the market economy. Despite its obvious importance, controlling in the Romanian academic literature has not received enough attention. The paper’s objective is to perform a thorough literature review on controlling in Romania. From a methodological point of view, the research consists in a literature review of papers published in Romanian renowned journals over the period 2014-2014. The conclusions of the study are that, as expected, the Romanian literature on controlling is scarce. Some authors even mistake controlling for control. However, there are also papers that include empirical research or modern views on controlling such as socio-controlling. All in all, there is a gap in the Romanian literature regarding the topic “controlling”.
M49|Considerations On Entity'S Risk Analysis|In the present paper, because of the complexity of this topic, the purpose is to discuss the main aspects involved by risk analysis; starting with few conceptual approaches about risk and to outline the contributions about methods to assess different risks categories, especially methods to assess bankruptcy risk prediction (entity insolvency) from economic literature. The methods used to estimate bankruptcy risk are based on the score function which helps to find if an entity is confronted with financial difficulties. The score functions are a diagnosis method elaborated relying on the discriminant analysis, allowing to assess and to predict the bankruptcy risk of the entity using a set of relevant financial ratios.
M49|Forensic Accounting and Fraud: Capability and Competence Requirements in Malaysia|The 2011 Global Economic Crime Survey instituted by PricewaterhouseCoopers confirms the economic crime in Malaysia to be on the increase and, therefore, requires immediate attention to stem the tides. In anticipation of the challenges occasioned due to a shift from the modified cash basis to the accrual basis of accounting, the Malaysian State’s determination to move from a developing nation to a developed nation and to be ranked among the first 10 in 2020, this paper presents the need for forensic accountant and auditor capability (i.e., mindset and skills) on forensic accountant and auditor competence (i.e., task performance fraud risk assessment (TPFRA)) in the Malaysian public sector. It also draws the attention of the users of public sector accountants and auditors to the understanding of fraud mechanisms and how to deal with fraudsters. The population of this study comprised the accountants and auditors in the office of the Accountant General and Auditor General of Malaysia. The objective of this paper is to investigate the competence requirements of accountants and auditors in the effective and efficient utilization of capability requirements, which have the potentials to usher in the best global practices in fighting fraud in the Malaysian public sector.
M49|Forensic Accounting Knowledge and Mindset on Task Performance Fraud Risk Assessment|The paper investigates the relationship between knowledge (KR) and mindset (MR) on task performance fraud risk assessment (TPFRA) of forensic accountant and auditor in the public sector environment. It also examines the claim that forensic accountants possess higher level of KR, MR and TPFRA than auditors. The study design is cross-sectional. Survey questionnaire is used. The 300 respondents are real professional people (i.e. auditors and accountants in the Nigerian public sector) as true representatives to enhance the generalisation of the outcomes. PLS-SEM and IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 were used as the primary statistical analysis tools for the study. The results of the present study confirm the positive relationship of KR and MR on TPFRA. Specifically, the results revealed that forensic accountants have higher levels of KR, MR and TPFRA than auditors in the areas of fraud prevention/deterrent, detection and response. Because of the adoption of cross-sectional design in which data are collected at one point of time, there is no time to wait for different follow-up stages or interventions before data analysis. Researchers are encouraged to use longitudinal design to explore interactions between KR, MR and TPFRA. This empirical study has revealed the value of KR and MR (forensic accountant and auditor) as a significant capability requirement in the workplace. Since no nation is immune to fraud and as loss due to fraud is costly, the result of this research will improve the corporate governance and accountability practices among public sector accountants and auditors.
M49|Fraud and Forensic Accounting: Knowledge and Risk Assessment Task Performance in Malaysian Public Sector – Conceptual study|The PwC’s 2011 Global economic crime survey confirms the fact that loss due to economic crime in Malaysia is on the increase and requires immediate intervention. The Malaysian government vision 2020 to be a developed nation with the drive: “People first, performance now” [1] will require high level acquisition and adoption of technology as a business facilitator, new legislation, and increase in the activities of government offer new opportunities for fraud perpetrators and forensic accountants. In anticipation of these challenges, this paper discusses the need for a forensic accountant knowledge on task performance fraud risk assessment in the Malaysian public sector. It also creates awareness to stakeholders fighting fraud in the public sector to the understanding of fraud mechanism and how to deal with fraudsters. The objective of the study is to examine the relationship between knowledge and fraud risk assessment task performance in the office of the Accountant general and Auditor general of Malaysia which has the potential to usher in the best global practices in fighting fraud in the Malaysian public sector.

M49|The Use of Cost Information in Frozen Food Logistics|Transportation of different kinds of products to different locations is an activity that requires specialization. From this point of view, logistics industry plays a vital role in providing efficiency in economic activities. When logistics activities, which already have a complex structure, are managed inefficiently, business activities in general also become inefficient. In this context, preferring the third party logistics service, which is biasedly considered as an additional cost creating factor, can be supported to be a possible way in cost cutting. In this study, the results of operations of a medium sized frozen food transporting company is considered for making this consideration. By calculating all the costs of logistics activities (goods reception, storage, demand collection and transportation) done in the frame of operational framework of workflows, monetary advantages and disadvantages are considered for comparing the alternatives of carrying out the logistics operations with the companies’ own resources and using outsourcing services. Results show that carrying out the logistics activities by outsourcing provides a medium sized enterprise a more flexible logistics service with less cost and higher customer satisfaction.
M49|Corporate governance and securities class actions|This study investigates the governance attributes of firms that have been subject to securities class actions (SCAs). There has been a recent sizable increase in the number of firms subject to SCAs in Australia. We examine a sample of firms that have been subject to SCAs due to disclosure breaches and match the firms by industry and size to a control sample. First, we examine the compliance culture of the SCA firms via the frequency of Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) queries of the firm and find that the frequency of ASX queries is positively associated with the occurrence of a SCA. Secondly, we provide evidence that SCA firms exhibit weaker levels of corporate governance than the matched control sample. In addition, we contribute to the understanding of firms subject to SCAs and their corporate governance attributes. Our results suggest the presence of a nomination committee may be associated with higher agency costs and that the influence of CEO duality may reduce the effectiveness of a nomination committee.
M49|Tax Agents Perceptions of the Corporate Taxpayersâ?? Compliance Costs under the Self-assessment System|Reforms and changes in tax laws may affect the level of complexity in the tax system and increase taxpayer compliance costs burden. In Malaysia, the introduction of Self-assessment System (SAS) imposes greater accountability in terms of computational, recordkeeping and filing requirements upon taxpayers. The increase in taxpayer obligations coupled with higher possibility of audit may require taxpayers to seek assistance from tax agents to handle tax matters on their behalf. In spite of the expanding role of tax agents in tax reporting under the SAS, very little research has been directed at examining their views and perceptions. This study, therefore, evaluates the compliance costs of corporate taxpayers from the perspective of tax agents.
M49|A Model of Social Interactivity through Internet-based Technologies: Implications for Marketing Communications|The emergence and the rapid adoption of social media in recent years have led to the political, economic and social changes. The recent political upheavals in several countries from the Middle East, Eastern Europe to Southeast Asia have sparked an interest for the participants to use internet-based technologies for instantaneous communications among themselves. News, rumors and various messages can spread swiftly without frontiers and obstruction from the opponents. The new communications technologies themselves cannot be censored or limited any longer. Facebook, twitters, instagrams, you tube, blogs etc. have been effective tools to link the messages among the participants. This up-to-date information can be beneficial to understand what happens in social interactivity using social media. Moreover, in an anonymous environment of the Internet, participants speak out more loudly than ever before. Instead of focusing on the interactions between the company and its customers, this study intends to explore significant factors in the society which leads to social interactivity in the Internet-based technologies. The model will help us learn more about the processes of how the Internet-based technologies function in the society and will be applied for the marketing activities using the social media. The implications for integrated marketing communications would help us understand more deeply how the social interactivity can be applied for the brand building and relationships among communications participants.
M49|Accounting Of Environmental Costs: A Comparision Of Ready Mixed Concrete Industry And Cement Industry|Due to rapid population growth and industrialization environmental problems has increased. So, businesses have social responsibility with regard to protection of the environment. Besides social responsibility, due to some legal regulations businesses use environment like an production input and there is also that take protective measures about it. For environmental protection, businesses have to both manufacture environmentally friendly products and to the reduce of hazardous waste and environmental costs information is required for the recycling. Traditional accounting system shows the environmental costs as overhead costs so environmental decision making processes constitute deficiency in the provision of the necessary information. Expressing an economic value of natural resources, bear to cost for prevention and reduction of environmental problems has revealed the concept of environmental accounting.Environmental Accounting, as a result of business activities, can be measured with money, occurring increases and decreases in environmental resources, records, reports, analysises. Environmental Accounting describes the businesses about status of environmentally in environmental information system.In this study, Ready Mixed Concrete Production Plant and Cement Production Plant which are operating in Turkey were conducted comparative analysis in terms of environmental costs, environmental accounting records in order, laws and social responsibilities about how do they reduce environmental impact.
M49|Green Accounting - The Fifth Element Of A The Balanced Scorecard|Managing a company is conditioned by many factors. Among them there are ecological factors closely associated with the consumption of natural resources in the production and the capacity of the natural environment . Depletion of natural resources, constantly progressing environmental degradation are forcing entrepreneurs to focus in addition to profit maximization, also on achieving objectives for the protection of the environment.Entities are increasingly including pro-ecological activities in its core business. Thereupon, the demand for information dealing with this area of activity is increasing and thus it becomes necessary to calculate and determine the costs associated with this segment. Appearing in the economic practice problems with the identification, measurement, valuation and disclosure in the costs and benefits statement of pro-environmental projects is a challenge for modern accounting . Taking the measurement of appearances and processes associated with the natural environment may consist of modification in the already existing accounting system or the separation of the environmental accounting system. For the purpose of generating, processing and presentation of environmental information, it is considered necessary to integrate management accounting and financial accounting tools.Pro-ecological activities of the enterprises are no longer considered only as a source of cost to them, but are increasingly being recognized as an asset, perceived in the sphere of strengths and opportunities for the future. The need to disclose the financial aspects of environmental protection in the company financial statement is dictated by the economic consequences of these activities affecting its property and financial situation. Currently reporting covering environmental issues goes beyond the typical financial statement, representing mostly a separate report or a separate chapter of the statement and information concerning costs associated with environmental protection are usually qualitative data and do not indicate their impact on the company financial position.
M49|The Issue Of Management Accounting In Small And Medium-Sized Enterprises|The role of management accounting in improving the efficiency of business entities management has been described in literature repeatedly. The positive side associated with its use has long been known and the creation of new tools of management accounting only strengthens it. However, so far the management accounting has been used primarily in large enterprises. Numerous examples showing possibilities of its practical application, its advantages and benefits of using it are cases based on experience gained in large business entities. Does it mean that management accounting cannot be applied in small and medium-sized enterprises?The article takes the issue of application of management accounting in small and medium-sized enterprises. The assumptions of management accounting in relation to the specific needs of small and medium-sized enterprises will be discussed. The experience in terms of the applicability of accounting in small and medium-sized enterprises will be analysed. The review of the issues being faced by the managers in small and medium-sized enterprises concerning the application of management accounting tools will be conducted. Challenges for people professionally engaged in management accounting will be intimated. This article is debatable. It is a review of the literature. It complies the result of work concerning the application of management accounting in small and medium enterprises coming form various research centres and other centres professionally dealing with accounting. It also refers to the issue of supporting managers in small and medium-sized enterprises in application of management accounting tools. Its aim is to seek answers to the question whether the outsourcing of accounting in small and medium enterprises creates the possibility to popularize the management accounting. This article is also a reason to consider undertaking further works, the effect of which should be growing knowledge about management accounting among managers/owners of small and medium-sized enterprises as well as the development of abilities of the practical application of management accounting tools in small and medium enterprises. Such work will thus contribute to the improvement of effectiveness of the enterprises? operation. This is especially important in the economy of the European Union. According to data contained in the ANNUAL REPORT ON EUROPEAN SMEs 2012/2013 in 2012 small and medium-sized enterprises were the place of employment of about 86,8 million of people and the development of over 57% share in gross value added generated by the private, non-financial economy in Europe.
M49|The Development of Accounting in Turkey and Analysis of the Accounting Culture In Terms of International Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)|Culture may be defined as ?the collective programming of the mind which distinguishes the members of one human group from another?. Each human group shares its own social norms, consisting of common characteristics, such as a value system which is adopted by the majority of constituents. Moreover accounting is determined by culture and the lack of consensus in accounting practices between countries, because the purpose of accounting is not technical but rather cultural. The culture of a country determines the choice of its accounting techniques and the perception of its various accounting phenomena. For this reason, the accounting culture is to limit the style of financial reporting by determining the principles and rules to be followed in financial reporting and by determining the principles, rules, and valuation measures that the financial reporting based on. Globalization, increase in the international movement of capital, the development of capital markets, changing conditions of competitions, legislative regulations and specialization are the factors affecting accounting culture. Another factor which affects accounting culture is the unfolding experience with the implementation of international accounting and financial reporting systems. International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) is formulated for the standardization of accounting regulations all over the world. A growing number of countries have adopted IFRS developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and other countries plan to adopt or converge with IFRSs in the near future. IFRS is a set of accounting principles that is generated to support processes of principle based reporting. IFRS is very useful for making the comparability, intelligibility and transparency of the financial statements. Because accounting standards necessitate the development of one unique accounting system across the globe, this necessity leads to changes in the perceptions of accounting and thus a decline in the affect of culture on accounting. When the accounting regulations in Turkey are considered, it can be seen that accounting culture is shaped in parallel with economic and political relations. Accounting culture in Turkey has been discussed within the culture model of the Continental Europe through uniform accounting plan which has to be implemented as from 1994. On the other hand, with IFRS applications, it tends to be closer to the Anglo-American culture model. In the light of these developments, the aim of our study is to discuss the term of accounting culture theoretically; and analyze the affect of International Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) over accounting culture in Turkey.

M49|Work–Family Conflicts of Practitioners of Accountancy: Practice of Diyarbakir|The aim of the study is to determine the level of work - family conflict of practitioners of accountancy. The study is carried out on 136 practitioners of accountancy that are operating in Diyarbakir. As the scale of work - family conflicts; Netemeyer, Boles and Mc Murrian (1996) work - family conflicts and family- work conflict scales are used consisting of 10 questions (5 of them are about work - family conflicts and 5 of them are about family - work conflicts). As a result of the study, it was examined that the practitioners of accountancy operating in Diyarbakir have generally conflicts between work - family and family- work in accordance with the answers given to the scale of work - family conflict. However, the average of the answers given to the scale of work - family conflict is as “I am not sure”. Therefore, it can be said that there may be a secret conflict owing to the fact that the problems occurred from work may affect family.
M49|Application of ‘cost-volume-profit’ Analysis In The Hotel Industry (Based on Survey Data of High-ranking Hotels in the North-east Region of Bulgaria)|At this stage there is still insufficient empirical data and analyses regarding the application of the tools of managerial accounting in the tourist sector and mainly in the hotel industry. The present study examines the application of the interdependence cost-volume-profit with a view to the specific character of the hospitality product in Bulgarian high-category hotels. To that end there is studied the rate, the frequency of use and the informational usefulness of the aspects of the analysis in the context of the attained level of development of managerial accounting in the enterprises, which operate the hotels in the Northeastern region, Bulgaria.
M49|An Integrated Model For Assessing The Activity Of The Enterprise|In the article oneself there is developed a practical and applied model binding the lagging (financial) and leading (non-financial) indicators in the assessment of the activity of the enterprise and its future development. The conducted empirical analysis demonstrates a strong dependency and high explicative force between the leading indicator, expressing the ratio of the average list number of employees to the net amount of the revenue from sales, and the resultant indicator - economic valu? added. The obtained result reinforces the need for the use of a comprehensive approach in the assessment of the activity of the enterprise.
M49|The Censorial Control - Sufficient For A Non-Profit Organisation|The object of the present paper is to answer the question regarding the sufficiency ofthe censorial control for a non-profit organization. In order to answer the question, we studied thespecific literature and also the law and we tried to find the specific areas that should be the mainobjectives of a censorial control. The sufficiency of the censorial control in this case is conditionedby proper objective setting and these have to be none other than those specific for this sector. If thespecific objectives are beyond the capacity of censorial control, its sufficiency is threatened.
M49|An Inquiry Into The Effects Of Multiple Graded Factors On Student Performance In Managerial Accounting|As many Managerial Accounting syllabi for live classes are built, the students‘ finalgrade is based on the following components: class participation, attendance, homework, mid-termexams and the final exam. We conducted a research in this Spring term for the ManagerialAccounting course with two classes of 30 students each at the College of Business Administration,Plymouth State University, New Hampshire, USA. Our research results indicate that (1) classparticipation, attendance, and homework submission are factors that do not have significant effecton the students‘ examination grades and (2) the first midterm exam was significant as a tool tostimulate learning, in that it functioned as a ‘wake up‘ signal for the majority of the studentsanalyzed. A major implication of this research suggests rethinking the structure of the final gradeformula in the syllabus to further emphasize the elements that most directly increase students‘motivation to learn.
M49|Analysing The Similarities Between Oecd Principles Versus European Corporate Governance Codes - An Internal Audit Perspective|The aim of this paper is to realise a comprehensive analysis of European corporategovernance codes, from the perspective of internal audit, in the manner it is provided in the OECDPrinciples of corporate governance. The research methodology used a classification of countries bylegal regime and the determination of Russel and Rao Similarity Measure, aiming to obtain aglobal view over the similarity between the European corporate governance codes and the OECDPrinciples provisions, from internal audit‘s perspective. The findings suggest that countries from‘Former socialists‘ group are less similar to OECD Principles, from internal audit perspective,while the countries from ‘French Civil‘ and ‘Scandinavian Civil‘ have a better similarity measurecomparing to OECD Principles of corporate governance.
M49|Decoding Gimmicks of Financial Shenanigans in Telecom Sector in India|Major corporate financial shenanigans get away in the name of creative accounting. But, they need to be studied for lessons learned and strategies to avoid or reduce the incidence of such frauds in the future. It is essential for shareholders, particularly the common man who does not have any access to the company except reported financial numbers. This paper aims to decode the level of financial shenanigans practices in corporate enterprises in telecom sector in India. The reason being is that telecom sector is a part of service industry and is dependent on tariff policies; therefore it is the most volatile sector where financial shenanigans are probable on a large scale. We have tried to contribute by detecting these shenanigans in totality not in isolation, on five parameters: quality of earnings, quality of revenue, volatility of income, discretionary accruals, and manipulation score. The results indicate the visibility of financial shenanigans in the companies under study. It is therefore expected that the study improves investors’ belief of a company’s performance, as reflected in their financial numbers.
M49|A Comparative Study on the Business School Students’ Perceptions on the Professional Accountancy of Turkey|Accounting profession has had a bad reputation in many countries for years. This might come from misinformation or misperception. This has been well studied around the world recently. The studies realized in the last decade mainly have been on the understanding and analyzing the opinions and/or perceptions of the public or the different communities on the professional accountants in different countries. Inspired from these studies, the purpose of the study is to examine any changes occurred on the negative perceptions of the business school students of Istanbul University on the Turkish accounting profession in five years from 2007 to 2012. In that regard, this study has sought whether any changes occurred in Turkey in five years; (1) on the factors affecting the students’ perceptions, (2) on their perceptions about the differences of the duties conducted by two different levels of the accounting profession, and (3) on their perceptions about the accounting profession by demographical features (gender, section, and level). A structured questionnaire was adopted from the study of Jackling (2002) and conducted first in 2007, and the study simply concluded that the accounting profession has a bad reputation for business school students in Turkey (Pekdemir and Pekdemir, 2011). This was not unique or new since it was the same in many countries. The study was repeated in 2012 in the same school of business in order to identify possible differences on the perceptions of the business school students. Four different sections of questions were asked to the students in both studies. The data gathered were analyzed through the SPSS Software Package. Findings of the comparison are interesting themselves, and also might be intriguing for particular people to make more comparative studies.
M49|Accounting Professionals’ Perceptions of Ethics Education: Evidence from Turkey|The purpose of this study is to investigate accounting professionals’ perceptions of (1) importance of education phases and environmental conditions in development of ethics awareness, (2) approaches in accounting ethics education in university and professional pre-qualification, and (3) coverage of accounting ethics education. Data was collected from public accountants via an online questionnaire during November and December, 2011. The questionnaire was developed based on a review of earlier studies. A total of 219 accountants replied to the survey. The findings demonstrated that most of the respondents (i.e. practicing accountants) have not taken ethics education previously. Secondly, the results provided evidence that all stages of education life, ranging from kindergarten to university, are important and contribute to the development of ethics awareness. Environmental factors are also important in the development of ethics awareness. Giving ethics as a stand-alone course is considered the most appropriate approach in teaching ethics. Responses indicated that “auditing” is the most and only course in which ethics should be taught. Moreover, the respondents approved the inclusion of ethics within various stages of the certified accountancy curriculum.
M49|Effects of Financial and Non-Financial Information Disclosure on Prices’ Mechanisms for Emergent Markets: The Case of Bucharest Stock Exchange|This paper investigates the impact of publicly disclosed information on market values for Romanian companies listed on Bucharest Stock Exchange, using as benchmark a more developed market, the Madrid Stock Exchange. The study is motivated by the European Union’s decision to require the use of the International Financial Reporting Standards for the consolidated financial statements of all listed companies (Regulation EC 1606/2002) and by the 2007 Romanian adoption of the Markets and Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) - which is the cornerstone of the European Commission’s Financial Services Action Plan. Thus, we compare the value relevance of Internet disclosed information provided by annual and interim financial reports and other non-financial news in the decision making process of investors. In order to evaluate the overall impact of information disclosure, we built a global disclosure indicator according to the so-called Principal Components Analysis by including individual disclosure dummies. Empirical tests support our research hypothesis according to which there is a relative incremental value of a higher volume and a better quality of information, reflecting prices’ overreactions even in the case of a market with imperfect trading mechanisms.
M49|The Soviet Accounting Bulletin, 1973-1983|The Soviet Accounting Bulletin was published from 1973 to 1983. It provided rare and fascinating direct insight into the role, function and position of the bookkeeper/accountant in the Soviet system, both in theory, e.g. through Lenin’s writing, and in practice, e.g. through extensive quotations in the words of the bookkeepers themselves. It was largely written by Derek Bailey, who had not only the contacts and language ability to obtain and translate material, but also the knowledge to write critical and informative commentaries thereon. This paper gives extensive extracts, preserving both the wording and the ethos of the original material as much as possible. The unifying theme is the life and role of the Soviet bookkeeper in all its aspects. Such an existence embraced real tensions, which we highlight, juxtapose and discuss.
M49|Benefits and Costs of Auditor's Assurance: Evidence from the Review of Quarterly Financial Statements|Even though there is a worldwide consensus as to the necessity of an audit of annual financial statements for public companies, there is divergence of views as to the review of interim financial statements. While some jurisdictions make it mandatory (e.g., Australia, France, US), others allow the review without requiring it (e.g., Canada, UK). Using a sample of companies listed in Canada, we examine the costs associated with these reviews and the benefits they generate in terms of improvement in the quality of interim financial statements for the years 2004 and 2005. Controlling for the decision to purchase the reviews, we find that audit fees are 18 percent higher for firms with interim reviews and, contrary to many regulators’ assumption, we find no evidence that this cost increase is proportionally higher for smaller firms. Regarding the benefits of interim reviews, we find no significant association between either accruals- or non accruals-based measures of earnings management and the fact that the interim statements are reviewed by the auditor, neither in the interim reports nor in those of the fourth quarter. The results suggest that auditors’ involvement with interim reports may not be as effective as previously thought at controlling the quality of interim financial statements.
M49|Combaterea Fraudelor In Fuziunea Dintre Societatile Transfrontaliere|The number of cross-border mergers and acquisitions has increased lately. Along with these the possibilities to commit fraud have multiplied. This article synthesizes the research undertaken so long in this field, aiming to approach specific issues related to fraudulent practices in the reorganizational process of companies. Beginning with the analysis of the international accounting framework regarding companies restructuring operations, we present specific issues related to fraudulent practices. Many researchers have tried to explain the poor performance of the acquisition process and the fact that many deals do not create value to companies involved. In our approach we identify key problems faced and solutions used by acquirers during the stages of the acquisition process. Based on the international practices the results show that cross-border mergers and acquisition is a complex process, in which companies involved have to pay attention to national and international accounting regulation and the features identified in each country.
M49|The Role Of Budgeting In The Management Process: Planning And Control|This paper is a literature review on management accounting and it examines the necessity and the role of budgeting and budget controlling in the management process.Budgets are necessary to highlight the financial implications of plans, to define the resources required to achieve these plans and to provide a means of measuring, viewing and controlling the obtained results, in comparison with the plans. Many managers, especially those familiar with accounting, criticize budgets saying that this implies additional consumption of effort and waste of time, claiming that there are too many estimates in the budget and that these estimations are unreliable, for it to be useful. And yet, any large company prepares budgets. Why? Because it forces managers to foresee, to study trends and develop necessary strategies. Also, the budget can prevent imminent issues. Budgets are excellent communication tools, pointing out the operational and financial objectives of the period. Budgets communicate to the upper and middle management which are the top-management’s expectations, and also communicate the management’s priorities to the lower levels. In some cases, it can give a manager the authority to dispose of certain funds, but being limited by the budget. Furthermore, the budget sets the prices for internal services and is the basis for performance evaluation. The controlling function confirms or not the compliance or noncompliance of the results with the predetermined objectives, highlighting occurred deviations and the causes that produced them. Budget controlling compares costs, revenues and actual performance with the budget so that, if necessary, it can be reviewed and corrective measures can be applied. This paper also includes a case study in a Romanian company and the collected data will be valued and interpreted in detail. Not all managers in our country understand the importance of budgeting. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the necessity of budgets in planning and controlling of a company’s activity.

M49|Accounting Between Law, Ethics And Morality|This paper deals with the fact that nowadays, society and business, show high expectations regarding the accounting discipline, and therefore professionals in this area should expand their horizons to meet all requirements. First of all, accounting assumed a certain responsibility to the public interest, by its fundamental purpose, namely to provide financial-accounting information, information that will form the basis of decision making. Second of all, for the successful fulfilment of the public responsibilities, accountants must rely on elements of doctrine, ethics, or ethics and morality. The study wants to show the importance of the accounting discipline, which has begun to increasingly focus on the creation of a moral or ethical basis, putting these issues on the same level with respecting the law. The boundary between what is legal but not ethical or moral is very small, and there were many business cases where unethical behaviour led to business failure.
M49|Validez espacial de las normas jurídicas: una mirada a la legislación tributaria venezolana|En el presente artículo se hace una reflexión sobre el ámbito de validez espacial de las normas jurídicas tributarias, analizando los instrumentos normativos necesarios para dilucidar, ¿cuándo una norma jurídica tributaria venezolana tiene eficacia jurídica en un determinado ámbito territorial? Para la realización del presente papel de trabajo, fue necesario adoptar un proceso de investigación que obedeció al diseño bibliográfico, desplegando un proceso de análisis y reflexión sobre la doctrina, jurisprudencia y los diversos tópicos jurídicos que enmarcan dicha materia. Se encontró que en Venezuela se adopta un sistema mixto, apoyado en el principio de la territorialidad de las normas, así como en el principio de la extraterritorialidad, hallándose como caso emblemático de este último principio, lo previsto en la Ley de Impuesto Sobre la Renta (LISLR), donde está consagrado el principio de la Renta Mundial.

M49|Shared Auditors in Mergers and Acquisitions|We examine the effect of shared auditors, defined as audit firms that provide audit services to both target and acquirer prior to an acquisition, on transaction outcomes. We find that shared auditors are frequently observed-in a quarter of all public acquisitions-and are associated with significantly lower deal premiums, lower target event returns, higher acquirer event returns, and higher deal completion rates. Moreover, targets are likelier to receive a bid from a firm that has the same auditor. These results are more pronounced when targets and acquirers are audited by the same office of the audit firm and are mitigated to an extent after the adoption of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Overall, our results suggest that the bidder benefits from sharing the same auditor with the target, in part because of the lower costs to learn about it.
M49|The separation of ownership and control and corporate tax avoidance|We examine whether variation in the separation of ownership and control influences the tax practices of private firms with different ownership structures. Fama and Jensen (1983) assert that when equity ownership and corporate decision-making are concentrated in just a small number of decision-makers, these owner-managers will likely be more risk averse and thus less willing to invest in risky projects. Because tax avoidance is a risky activity that can impose significant costs on a firm, we predict that firms with greater concentrations of ownership and control, and thus more risk averse managers, avoid less income tax than firms with less concentrated ownership and control. Our results are consistent with these expectations. However, we also consider a competing explanation for these findings. In particular, we examine whether certain private firms enjoy lower marginal costs of tax planning, which facilitate greater income tax avoidance. Our results are consistent with the marginal costs of tax avoidance and the separation of ownership and control both influencing corporate tax practices.
M49|Economic effects of SOX Section 404 compliance: A corporate insider perspective|We use survey responses from 2,901 corporate insiders to assess the costs and benefits of compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The majority of respondents recognize compliance benefits, but they do not perceive these benefits to outweigh the costs, on average. This is particularly true among smaller companies where the start-up costs are proportionately larger. However, the perceived efficiency of compliance increases with auditor attestations, years of compliance experience, and after the remediation of a material weakness. Notably, the perceived effects of compliance depend largely on firm complexity, but are mostly unrelated to firm governance structure.
M49|Effect of Packing Cost on The Sales Price and Contribution Margin|The basic characteristic of packing is to protect the product from external factors while the product is delivering to consumers. However, recently packing has become an indispensable aspect of marketing. Because, packing is considered as a silent dealer which directly reaches consumers. Packing is one of the most important factor of product sales. Consumers assess a product with its packing and make up a purchasing decision accordingly. In addition to its protective function, packing also performs functions such as selling and communication.Recently, firms have begun attaching great importance on packing investments. A high-quality and attractive packing means expenditure. A firm can increase its sales as much as it creates difference with its packing. Therefore, it is required to take a risk of increasing the packing costs for increasing sales. Increasing packing cost is an important factor of prices. In this study, the relation between the packing cost and price has been researched by making regression analysis.
M49|Relationships Between Stakeholders And Reports Using Fuzzy Relations|The main parameter of the concept of corporate social responsibility is to consider the expectations of different stakeholders (employees, partners, customers, local communities, the environment, shareholders, vendors, etc.) regarding the behavior of companies. Even if a relatively homogeneous group is selected, as in this paper, differences are seen when establishing preference levels. These discrepancies are inherent to individuals based on their interests, which may be affected by both concrete and subjective circumstances. This paper is divided into two parts. The first part consists in segmenting preferences of users from the agribusiness sector with respect to social and environmental accounting information. Then, based on this prior task, we will try to determine which standard reports relating to social and environmental information meet to a greater extent these users’ needs. This will be done using fuzzy incidence matrices. Through the max-min composition of matrices, a relation matrix of users and the chance of meeting their information needs according to the standard reports considered for this work is produced. This paper has sought to address the preferences of users of social and environmental information through a scientific methodology, trying to group users by means of the affinities theory. We believe this proposal may help identify similar stakeholders in the future, so as to schedule interviews, establish common patterns and be able to prepare reports meeting their needs, or, as in the case proposed, use existing reporting models
M49|Accounting Student And Lecturer Ethical Behavior: Evidence From Indonesia|Research on ethical behavior has been conducted to understand human behavior in their environment. It became an issue in Indonesia since there are many issues related to accountant behavior in their professional role. This study provides empirical evidence on an ethical behavior issue related to accounting student and lecturers in a private university in Surabaya, East Java-Indonesia. We added a personal variable of gender and locus of control to identify how women differ from men. Women in Indonesia have been treated as second citizen, not only in education but also in the working environment. This has held despite efforts of emancipation undertaken for many years. The locus of control as an individual factor represents how individuals react to making decision. About half of 23 private universities in Surabaya and 548 respondents engaged in the survey. The universities were separated by accounting program accreditation. Using analysis of variance and Pearson correlation the result of this study show womenâ€™s ethical attitudes were better than menâ€™s. Second, it was concluded that individuals with internal lotus of control are more reluctant to do unfair and unethical acts than individual with external locus of control. Finally, accounting programs with better accreditation revealed better ethical behavior, even though the difference was statistically insignificant.
M49|Balanced Scorecard Attributes: Key Determinant And Perceived Benefits|This study explored the application among Thai listed firms of four BSC attributes, i.e. translating strategy into operation terms, aligning the organizational units to the strategy, communicating strategy to employees, and providing feedback and learning. The study also provided evidence of key determinant and perceived benefits of each BSC attribute. With respect to the determinant, it was found, based on 81 returned questionnaires, that top management support was positively associated with each of the BSC attributes. Therefore, the support was the facilitating factor vital to the implementation of each BSC attribute. Concerning the consequence, thirty-seven BSC users perceived the four BSC attributes as the source of various benefits, e.g. overall benefits, planning, control and communication. The study contributed to the existing body of research on BSC as the determinant and consequence findings were derived from examination of each of the BSC attributes separately rather than collectively.
M49|Legislation Of Ethics In The Early Years Of The Securities And Exchange Commission|Enforcement action by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the years following its formation and prior to the beginning of World War II created reporting sanctions viewed as symbolic by much of corporate America. That is, powerful chief executive officers of many of Americaâ€™s giant publicly held corporations believed these sanctions were instituted only to placate a worried investing public and would not be enforced with rigor. These managers, therefore, believed they could either ignore the Securities and Exchange Commission pronouncements or implement them only superficially. I submit the result has been many continual challenges of authority and corporate disregard of ethical behavior throughout the remainder of the 20th century.

Ifrs Treatment Of Leases And The Impact On Financial Ratios|As of January 1, 2011, most of the world financial market economies are using International Reporting Standards (IFRS) as the required framework for financial statements. A non-comprehensive listing includes the European Union Countries, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In the United States, US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is still required but adoption of IFRS has support of many accounting firms and professional organizations and is under consideration by the SEC.
