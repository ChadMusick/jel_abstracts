J46|The Size and Characteristics of Informal (“Gig”) Work in Canada|Underlying wage growth has fallen short of what would be consistent with an economy operating with little or no slack. While many factors could explain this weakness, the availability of additional labour resources from informal (“gig”) work—not fully captured in standard measures of employment and hours worked—may play a role. We investigate this possibility through the Bank of Canada’s Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations (CSCE) by documenting the characteristics and size of such working arrangements. We find that just under one-third of Canadians participate in this type of work, and this participation is often consistent with labour market slack. Just over one-third of respondents who take part in informal work do so as a result of weak economic conditions, and over half would switch their hours worked for hours in formal employment with no increase in pay. Part-time workers, youth and people in provinces with historically high unemployment rates were most likely to participate in informal employment. A portion of these workers would not be considered part of the labour force by standard labour market measures due in part to the irregularity of their work schedules. Accounting for these workers could boost participation rates by 2–3 percentage points. Moreover, the magnitude of labour supply from such work that could become available to the formal sector is sizable. It amounts to roughly 700,000 full-time equivalent jobs or 3.5 per cent of the labour force on average over the third and fourth quarters of 2018. This additional margin of labour market supply may be contributing to reducing wage pressures.
J46|Análisis de la Pobreza y Condiciones de Vida en Valledupar|En Valledupar la pobreza ha incrementado durante los últimos cuatro años, pasando de 27% en 2014 a 33,4% para 2017. La distribución del ingreso también sufrió un revés importante durante el mismo periodo de tiempo, cuando el coeficiente de Gini pasó de 0,42 a 0,46, lo que indica que en 2017 hubo una mayor concentración de la riqueza que en 2014 (DANE, 2018). Este documento estudia los principales factores que han incidido en el aumento de la pobreza y propone una serie de inversiones para contrarrestar la desmejora en las condiciones de vida de los valduparences. Los resultados indican que el deterioro en el mercado laboral (empleo, salarios e informalidad) y la calidad de la educación son los factores que explican el incremento en pobreza. Las inversiones propuestas en temas de educación, vivienda y trabajo, que reducirían la pobreza y generarían un entorno propicio para el desarrollo económico de Valledupar, requieren de $230 millones de dólares para los próximos 10 años, lo que implicaría un esfuerzo fiscal adicional por generar $22,8 millones de dólares adicionales anuales hasta 2030. **** ABSTRACT: Poverty rate increased six percentage points in the past four years in Valledupar (DANE, 2018). The income distribution deteriorated as well during the same period of time. This document studies the main factors that explain the rise in poverty in Valledupar during 2014-2017 and proposes a series of investments that will help the city to overcome this drawback in their economic and social development. The results show that the worsening in labor market conditions (wages, employment and informality rate) due to negative shocks in coal prices and low quality of education are the factors driving the poor performance of Valledupar in terms of poverty reduction. We propose a set of investments in education, labor policy and housing that cost $230 millions of dollars for the next 10 years, in order to create structural conditions for development and lower poverty.

J46|Gender Gaps in Labor Informality: The Motherhood Effect|Recent work has quantified the large negative effects of motherhood on female labor market outcomes in Europe and the US. But these results may not apply to developing countries, where labor markets work differently and informality is widespread. In less developed countries, informal jobs, which typically include microenterprises and self-employment, offer more time flexibility but poorer social protection and lower labor earnings. These characteristics affect the availability of key inputs in the technology to raise children, and therefore may affect the interplay between parenthood and labor market outcomes. Through an event-study approach we estimate short and long-run labor market impacts of children in Chile, an OECD developing country with a relatively large informal sector. We find that the birth of the first child has strong and long lasting effects on labor market outcomes of Chilean mothers, while fathers remain unaffected. Becoming a mother implies a sharp decline in mothers’ labor supply, both in the extensive and intensive margins, and in hourly wages. We also show that motherhood affects the occupational structure of employed mothers, as the share of jobs in the informal sector increases remarkably. In order to quantify what the motherhood effect would have been in the absence of an informal labor market, we build a quantitative model economy, that includes an informal sector which offers more flexible working hours at the expense of lower wages and weaker social protection, and a technology to produce child quality that combines time, material resources and the quality of social protection services. We perform a counterfactual experiment that indicates that the existence of the informal sector in Chile helps to reduce the drop in LFP after motherhood in about 35%. We conclude that mothers find in the informal sector the flexibility to cope with both family and labor responsibilities, although at the cost of resigning contributory social protection and reducing their labor market prospects.
J46|Diversity of social protection forms in Madagascar\r\nA multi-scalar and multi-actor approach|Among the international recommendations, a new policy of social protection has been in progress of elaboration in Madagascar since 2015. In this country classified as being the less advanced, very exposed to the climatic and environmental risks, mostly rural and characterized by a high rate of informal employment, the challenges regarding social protection are numerous. Thereby, this article starting with the typification of the social protection system which prevails in Madagascar, puts into question its adaptation in the institutional context and its capacity to match the security needs related to the standards of living of the population. To reach this goal, this article is based on the institutionalist contemporary studies of social protection in the developing countries and suggests an original analysis, multi-scalar (national and local) and multi-actor (international and national, public and private, formal and informal). Supported by a diversified empirical material (gray literature, participative observation, qualitative interviews among the institutional actors and among the households), the study sets indeed that the sector of social protection in Madagascar remains characterized by a lack of integration, vertical as well as horizontal: vertical as we observe a strong disconnection between the forms of social protection thought at the national level and the mechanisms of social protection within reach by the malagasy population, largely dominated by the mechanisms of informal standard of living security ; horizontal as strong inequalities prevail from one place to another, the territory as being marked by micro- local forms of social protection. These elements lead to ask about the social sustainability of the malagasy social protection system.
J46|Informality over the life-cycle|In developing countries, informality is mainly concentrated on younger and older workers. In this paper, we propose a dual labor market theory that highlights how frictions and taxation in the formal sector as well as educational choices interact to shape the informality rate over the life-cycle. We develop a life-cycle model with search frictions, skill heterogeneities, and endogenous educational choices. We carry out a numerical analysis and show that our model reproduces remarkably well the life-cycle patterns of informality, non-employment and formal employment in Argentina. We analyze several public policies and show that an educational grant reduces both informality and non-employment and may be fully financed by the extra tax revenues generated by the increase in formal employment and wages. Lowering taxes may achieve similar results but is detrimental for the government budget, in the case of Argentina, despite increasing the base on which they are levied.
J46|Employer and Employee Preferences for Worker Benefits: Evidence from a Matched Survey on the Bangladesh Informal Sector|Informality is ubiquitous in the labor markets of developing countries, and requiring that firms formally register, pay taxes, and provide employee benefits stipulated in labor regulations to reduce such informality is challenging. However, a matched survey on employer-employee preferences suggests that mutually beneficial job benefits exist, and that encouraging their adoption might be feasible. Carefully designed discrete choice experiments on combinations of benefits related to compensation, leave and termination policies, working conditions, and accident insurance, along with incentives for employers, reveal the relative values that workers and employers attach to each benefit. The results show that workers tend to value advance notice for job termination and accident insurance, and that employers are not averse to providing these benefits. In contrast, workers find long working hours without overtime compensation to be highly undesirable, whereas many employers are generally unwilling to provide shorter hours or overtime pay unless they face the threat of fines or are offered substantial incentives for doing so. Our findings therefore suggest that encouraging the provision of termination notice and accident insurance may be relatively easy, but that increasing compliance with legal limits on working hours and overtime compensation is likely to require increased enforcement or substantial incentives.
J46|Effect of Enforcement Shock on Pushers' Activities: Evidence from an Asian Drug-Selling Gang|We study a Singaporean drug-selling gang's dataset and empirically find that the gang's pushers purchased larger quantities of drugs during periods of enforcement shocks caused by enforcement activities targeting the gang's drug supply chain. This counter-intuitive finding can be explained by the pushers' profit targeting behavior. Given that enforcement shocks increased the pushers' cost of drugs, pushers must compensate by purchasing more drugs to sell in order to reach their profit targets.
J46|What Aspects of Formality Do Workers Value? Evidence from a Choice Experiment in Bangladesh|In this study, we use a choice experiment to elicit workers' willingness to pay (WTP) for specific job benefits typically associated with formal employment (contracts, termination notice, paid leave, preferred working hours, and access to a retirement account). We find that workers most value job stability: the average worker would be willing to give up 19 percent of monthly income for a 6-month contract, 27 percent for a 1-year contract and 44 percent for a permanent contract (relative to no contract). Thirty days' of termination notice would also be valued at about 12 percent of monthly income. Using a latent class model, we explore preference heterogeneity and find that government workers are more likely to place a higher value on long-term contracts than private sector employees, while casual workers are more likely to have a particularly strong preference for higher salary, and a relatively low WTP for various benefits. This heterogeneity may be driven by sorting or loss aversion. Our work also lends support to the use of choice experiments to overcome the challenges associated with estimating WTP for specific job benefits from hedonic wage regressions or from observed job durations.
J46|Youth Labour Markets in Developing and Developed Countries: The Role of the Sectoral Composition of Production|"In this paper we explore the role of the sectoral composition of gross domestic product (GDP) in explaining the behaviour of youth labour markets. We provide a comparison of the behaviour of youth unemployment rates, employment-population rates, and labour force participation rates between developing countries and developed (rich) countries. In developing countries, open unemployment is less of a problem: the major problem faced by young people is employment in the informal sector that is poorly paid, intermittent, and insecure. A major part of employment in developing countries consists of ""vulnerable employment"". After a brief review of the literature, the paper uses panel data to estimate equations for unemployment rates, employment-population rates, and labour force participation rates for youths. We find that the sectoral composition of production and aggregate demand are important in explaining the behaviour of youth labour markets."
J46|The effectiveness of interventions to reduce informality in low- and middle income countries|"Labor markets in low- and middle income countries are characterized by high levels of informality. A multitude of interventions have therefore been implemented in many countries with the objective to increase the formalization of firms and workers, including information campaigns, simplification of registration procedures, reductions of payroll taxes and social security contributions, and interventions that enforce labor or business formalization. In this paper, we compile a database of 157 impact estimates from 32 academic studies that evaluate empirically one or more of these formalization interventions. The empirical analysis correlates the impact estimates of the primary studies - given as either (i) a measure of sign and statistical significance or (ii) the effect size - with explanatory factors such as the intervention type, the outcome variable, the scope of the intervention (program or policy), and other covariates. Several key findings emerge: first, the intervention type is not a strong determinant for the effectiveness of formalization interventions, though tax incentives and labor inspection are most likely to display significant positive effects. Second, the outcome ""worker registration"" shows significantly better results than other outcomes. Third, interventions at scale - i.e. formalization ""policies"" - are more effective on average than singular ""programs""."
J46|What Skills Lead to Entrepreneurial Success? Evidence from Non-Farm-Household Enterprises in Indonesia|The abundance of small enterprises in developing countries has led to debates regarding the role that of entrepreneurial skill in business performance. Analyses of the skills and characteristics important for success can inform entrepreneurship training programs or educational curricula designed to increase the number of successful entrepreneurs. We addressed these issues in the context of Indonesia, a low-middle-income country in which almost half of workers are self-employed. After developing a conceptual framework linking fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, and educational attainment, we estimated the effect of these different types of intelligence on the profit and value of non-farm-household businesses. We found that fluid intelligence had sizeable and positive returns on business. On the other hand, crystallized intelligence had a positive and large effect only in sectors that required intense concentration or computers. Some heterogeneous effects regarding business size were also found. Our results were robust when we controlled for possible selection into non- farm entrepreneurship.
J46|Formal Employment and Organized Crime: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from Colombia|Canonical models of criminal behavior highlight the importance of economic incentives and employment opportunities in determining crime (Becker, 1968). Yet, there is little causal evidence leveraging individual-level variation in support of these claims. Over a decade, we link administrative micro-data on socio-economic measures with the universe of criminal arrests in Medellin. We test whether increasing the relative costs to formal-sector employment led to more crime. We exploit plausibly exogenous variation in employment around a cutoff in the socio-economic score, below which individuals receive health care if they are not formally employed. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that the policy had the unintended consequence of inducing a fall in formal-sector employment and a corresponding spike in organized criminal activity. There are no effects on less economically motivated crimes like those of impulse or opportunity. Our results confirm the relationship between formal employment and crime, validating models of criminal activity as a rational economic choice **** RESUMEN: Los modelos canónicos del comportamiento criminal resaltan la importancia de los incentivos económicos y las oportunidades de empleo como determinantes del crimen (Becker, 1968). A pesar de esto, existe poca evidencia causal que soporte estos modelos a nivel de individuos. Nosotros pareamos, a lo largo de una década, información socioeconómica de individuos con el censo de todos los arrestos en Medellín. Nosotros probamos si incrementar el costo relativo del empleo formal conlleva a un incremento del crimen. Se explota una variación exógena en el empleo alrededor de un corte en el puntaje socioeconómico, por debajo del cual los individuos reciben aseguramiento en salud si no están formalmente empleados. Utilizando un diseño de regresión discontinua, mostramos que la política tuvo como consecuencia inducir una reducción en el empleo formal y un correspondiente incremento en la actividad del crimen organizado. No se encuentran efectos en crímenes con una motivación económica menor como aquellos de impulso u oportunidad. Nuestros resultados confirman la relación entre empleo formal y crimen, validando los modelos que explican la actividad criminal como una decisión racional.
J46| Oferta de trabajo del hogar remunerado en el Perú rural: 2015 – 2017| El objetivo de este artículo es analizar la evolución del trabajo del hogar remunerado (THR) en el Perú rural, así como los determinantes de la oferta de trabajo del hogar en dicho sector. Debido al diseño de la encuesta solamente contamos con los datos familiares de las trabajadoras del hogar remuneradas “cama afuera”; sin embargo, el porcentaje de trabajadoras del hogar remuneradas “cama adentro” es muy bajo y su inclusión no afecta las estimaciones. Dado que esta actividad es llevada a cabo en su mayoría por mujeres, y que es una entre otras alternativas laborales, postulamos que al haber menos alternativas en el sector rural, al contrario que en el sector urbano, el trabajo del hogar remunerado no es un empleo de refugio. Sobre la base de un modelo teórico de consumidor – productor, encontramos los determinantes de ofrecer la fuerza laboral a ésta actividad en relación a otras actividades, el desempleo y la inactividad. Asimismo, los determinantes de las horas ofrecidas, tanto al trabajo del hogar remunerado (THR) como a otras ocupaciones. Debido al reducido número de casos, para el trabajo empírico empleamos un pool con los datos de las ENAHO 2015 – 2017. Encontramos que los ingresos por hora en el THR son mayores que los ingresos de las mujeres en otras ocupaciones rurales. Asimismo, si bien a mayor nivel de educación es más probable que las mujeres rurales estén empleadas, el efecto marginal es mayor para las otras ocupaciones que para el THR. Las mujeres jefas de hogar, así como las casadas o convivientes tienen mayor probabilidad de trabajar en otras ocupaciones que en el THR. En el caso de la oferta de THR la elasticidad horas – salario es negativa y significativa, siendo de -0.0271 para el pool y similar para cada año por separado. En el caso de otras ocupaciones, la relación entre los ingresos y las horas trabajadas es positiva. Las obligaciones familiares reducen las horas ofrecidas al THR y aumentan las horas ofrecidas a otros trabajos. Finalmente, las jornadas de trabajo son más largas para las mujeres en la sierra y en la selva, respecto a la costa rural. JEL Classification-JEL: J15, J16, J21, J43, J46
J46|Informal employment and work health risks: Evidence from Cambodia|Workplace safety is a topical issue in public policy debates in industrializing countries like Cambodia where high economic growth rates have yet to translate into higher job quality. This paper studies the relationship between informal employment and occupational health using the 2012 Cambodia Labour Force Survey. I estimate probit models and find that informal employment on its own is associated with a significant increase in the probability of work injury/illness. However in the most complete specification with controls for personal, job and firm characteristics, the effect of informal employment turns out to be small in magnitide and statistically insignificant. I discuss possible explanations for this finding. Results from this analysis suggest that in a context of weak administrative capacity for the enforcement of labour regulations, as is the case in Cambodia, work health risks are a concern across the board, not just in the informal sector.
J46|Managing health issues with low wages – A study of female domestic workers|Domestic workers are the most vulnerable group of informal workers who work to supplement their household income. They work for survival, hypothesis being that, women work to make up the difference between subsistence requirements and the total earnings of the family. They lack education or skill, work for long hours and perform specific tasks in several households. They have no leave rules or security benefits as they are excluded from the ambit of labour legislation. They are susceptible to serious health problems that often go unattended. Health issues results in a toll on their consumption expenditure and they are in a constant fear of losing job. The present study is based on a primary survey of 300 domestic workers conducted in the district of South 24Parganas, West Bengal, India for a period of six months from January 16 to June 16. The choice of the district was prompted by the inter-linkage between the growth and expansion of the city of Kolkata in her southern part, existence of a large number of Bangladeshi migrants in South 24 Parganas (Kumar, 2010), evidences of large scale commuting of unorganized workers (Roy, 2003) and the growing informal market where the major source of manual labour comes from the fringes of the district. The study was conducted to understand the socio-demographic characteristics of the workers household, their economic status and method of coping with health issues subject to limited income of the family.
J46|Brothers or Invaders? How Crisis-driven Migrants Shape Voting Behavior|What explains voters’ negative attitudes toward immigration? Self-interested voters care about their personal economic and social circumstances. Sociotropic voters display in-group bias and perceive migrants as threats to their customs and culture. We study the electoral effects of forced internal and international migration in Colombia to provide evidence on the relative importance of these two hypotheses. We exploit the fact that migrants disproportionally locate in places with earlier settlements of people from their place of origin. In line with the sociotropic hypothesis, we find that only international migration inflows increase political participation and shift votes from left- to right-wing ideologies. Also consistent with the sociotropic hypothesis, we show that these results are not accounted for by the observed changes caused by migration inflows on socioeconomic variables.
J46|Formal Employment and Organized Crime: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from Colombia|Canonical models of crime emphasize economic incentives. Yet, causal evidence of sorting into criminal occupations in response to individual-level variation in incentives is limited. We link administrative socioeconomic microdata with the universe of arrests in MedellÎ¯n over a decade. We exploit exogenous variation in formal-sector employment around a socioeconomic-score cutoff, below which individuals receive benefits if not formally employed, to test whether a higher cost to formal-sector employment induces crime. Regression discontinuity estimates show this policy generated reductions in formal-sector employment and a corresponding spike in organized crime, but no effects on crimes of impulse or opportunity.
J46|Self-Employment in Developing Countries: A Search-Equilibrium Approach|This paper develops and estimates a life-cycle on-the-job search model with self-employment that captures labour market stylized facts typical of middle-income developing economies. Workers flow across unemployment, self-employment, formal and informal wage employment. Individuals differ across and within employment sectors in terms of earnings, self-employment ability and transition rates. Counterfactual analysis shows that a flat reduction in payroll taxation increases the share of formal sector workers mainly due to a drop in self-employment. A proportional reduction in payroll taxes improves total welfare by increasing formal sector wages and profits, and allowing for a better allocation of high education workers. Converting to a progressive payroll tax system, equivalent to a flat reduction, is ineffective in reducing informality and leads to a decline in total welfare. (Copyright: Elsevier)
J46|Beyond the agrimafie-caporalato binary: the restructuring of agriculture in Central Italy and its implications on labour relations|As in many other countries in the world, the Italian agricultural sector has witnessed a process of deep restructuring with the expansion of export-oriented production and the rise of global value chains in the agrifood sector. This paper argues that the new way of producing and delivering food, coupled with country-specific conditions, such as the structure of Italian agrarian capital, have created the room for new forms of exploitation, such as those based on seasonal migrant labour through practices of labour contracting and that sometimes amount to forms of 'modern slavery'. These new forms of exploitation are far from being exceptional. Although often associated with the territory control of Mafia organizations, this article argues that migrant labour exploitation through the labour contracting system is an integral feature of the contemporary agricultural production in Italy. This is shown through the case study of the fruit and vegetable production in the south area of Lazio region where firms can rely, through the role of labour contractors, on cheap and disposable migrant labour, especially Indian workers.
J46|The Effect of Exports on Labor Informality : Evidence from Argentina|This paper explores the causal impact of exports on the share of informal labor in the Argentinean manufacturing sector. Using an instrumental variable approach to address potential endogeneity concerns, I show that an exogenous 10 percentage points increase in export intensity induces a reduction of the informality rate of 2.2 percentage points. Then, I explore the channel through which exports affect informality. By differentiating exports according to the income group of their destinations, I find that the aggregate effect of exports is explained by the sales to high-income countries. Moreover, the effect is partially explained by an increase in the complexity of the tasks performed in the jobs. Overall, the evidence suggests that under an increase in the demand of higher quality exports, the manufacturing firms increase their productivity by reducing their share of informal workers.
J46|Economic Transition, Dualism, and Informality in India|In much of the literature on economic development, sustained economic growth is expected to be accompanied by several interrelated processes of structure change, which involve a shift in economic activities from ‘traditional’ / agricultural / informal to ‘modern’ / industrial / formal sectors. Such transitions are usually accompanied by a transition in the economic dependence of households towards relatively ‘modern’ and formal segments of the economy, along with a rise in their general economic well-being. In this paper, we examine the Indian economy using the only available household-level pan-India panel data over the high growth period between 2005 and 2011-12, to analyse the patterns and natures of household-level transitions across sectors and identify factors that affected the likelihood and nature of such transitions. We categorize households based on their primary income sources into seven sectors characterised by varying degrees of formality/informality and various production structures and labour processes. We find that while substantial proportion of households have transitioned across these sectors during the period, there has been a continued reproduction of the same economic structure, including a regeneration of dependence on ‘traditional’ informal sector and casual wage employment, which are often expected to dissolve over time with high economic growth. To ascertain the nature of these transitions (‘favorable’ or ‘unfavorable’), we employ a ‘counterfactual’ analysis. Contrary to some recent influential literature, we find that, on an average, the transitions towards informal and ‘traditional’ economic spaces are ‘unfavourable’ in nature in terms of well-being of households. Further, using a multinomial logit regression framework, we find that the likelihood and nature of these transitions are largely dependent on household characteristics like levels of education and social caste, some of which are structurally given and cannot be optimally chosen by households. The results show that despite significant churning in the economy, the structure continues to remain fractured, with substantial ‘unfavourable’ transitions towards economic spaces that are continuously reshuffled and reconstituted.
J46|New evidence on the wage curve: non-linearities, urban size, and spatial scale in Brazil|Agglomeration economies appear to have a significant impact on local labour markets. The interaction of workers and firms in dense urban areas may generate productivity advantages that result in higher wages. City size plays an important role in the relative bargaining power of workers and firms in the relevant labour market. When analysing the relationship between local wages and the business cycle – wage flexibility, measured by the wage curve –, this influence appears to be higher in informal sectors in less densely populated areas in Brazil. Therefore, large agglomerations are supposed to provide a higher bargaining power for workers, as they have more job opportunities. In addition, labour market dualism is an essential ingredient in the evaluation of the wage curve in developing economies. However, a dual labour market analysis should be conducted at the appropriate regional level (labour market areas), making it possible to find a relevant impact of city size on the relative bargaining power of workers and firms. Our study aims to shed new theoretical and empirical light on the importance of the wage curve, taking into account various specificities of developing economies. The applied modelling study in Brazil shows that wage flexibility is higher in less dense local labour markets and in the informal sector in relation to the formal sector. Furthermore, it is essential to control for unobserved local characteristics in order to obtain the ‘true’ elasticity of wages to local unemployment rates, and spatial effects should be accounted for when the unit of analysis is rather small. In this sense, a significant part of the difference between the formal and the informal sectors originates from spatial effects.
J46|Mining and Human Capital Accumulation: the Role of the Return to Education|The literature has long tried to explain the casual relationship between natural resources booms and human capital accumulation but yet with no definitive answer. Usually the literature finds that booms abates the process of human capital accumulation by increasing the cost of opportunity of studying. We want to further contribute to this discussion by studying the impact of the mineral mining boom in Peru on the interruption of post-secondary studies during the period 2004-2016. To do so, we rely on a differences-in-difference strategy. Our results show that the Peruvian mining boom had a positive impact on the probability of interruption of post-secondary studies. Furthermore, the probability of staying idle of young individuals increased. In contrast with previous studies, we find that our results are driven mainly by a decrease in the return to higher education relative to high-school education. Other mechanisms that may be playing a minor role is the health status of young individuals -which deteriorates with the mining boom-, and the labor reallocation that occurs within households.
J46|“What drives the spatial wage premium for formal and informal workers? The case of Ecuador”|This article investigates the incidence of agglomeration externalities in Ecuador, a small-sized, middle-income developing country. In particular, we analyze the role of the informal sector within these relations, since informal employment accounts for a significant part of total employment in the developing countries. Using individual level data and instrumental variable techniques, we investigate the impact of spatial externalities, in terms of population size and local specialization, on the wages of workers in Ecuadorian cities. The results show that spatial externalities matter also for a small developing country. Moreover, analysis of the interaction between spatial externalities and informality shows a general penalization for workers employed in the informal sector in terms of benefits arising from agglomeration externalities. Finally, by investigating the possible channels behind the heterogeneity found in spatial agglomeration gains between formal and informal workers, we show that the advantages from agglomeration for formal workers may well be accounted for by positive sorting and better gains from job changes, while for informal workers they arise from positive learning externalities.
J46|Finance and Employment Formalization: Evidence from Mexico's ENIGH, 2000-2016|We study the relationship between financial constraints and employment formalization by exploiting heterogeneity in the industry-level degree of financial dependence, in the spirit of Rajan and Zingales (1998). This dependence, and variation in aggregate credit, lets us measure industry-level financial slack, and estimate its effects on employment formality. We find formality among young workers increases, which is consistent with a model of informal firms that grow and formalize with financial resources, thus becoming more productive. However, we find that financial slack, apparently, decreases formality among older, experienced workers, which is consistent with a model of capital-constrained formal employees that turn into entrepreneurs when financial conditions improve. Descriptive statistics on formality, as well as regression estimates conditioning by age and schooling provide a detailed map of the differential effects of finance on formality.
J46|Sectoral and aggregate response to oil price shocks in the Colombian economy: SVAR and Local Projections approach|We employ Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) and Jordà’s (2005) Local Projection approaches to analyze the impact of a shock to international oil prices on the aggregate economy and three sectoral activities in Colombia: Agriculture, Mining and Industry. As an oil producer and exporter, this analysis is relevant due to the importance of the oil sector for Colombia’s economy. Using data from 2000:Q1 to 2017:Q3, our results show that a positive shock to the price of oil increases Gross Domestic Product, lowers risk perception, appreciates the exchange rate, and leads to the adoption of contractionary monetary policy. An inflation-targeting scheme with flexible exchange rate makes both inflation and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) non-responsive to the shock. Results at the sectoral level are mixed. Agriculture’s FDI, production and Producer Price Index (PPI) are unaffected by the shock. Industry’s production falls between the second and fifth quarters after the shock, with no significant responses in its PPI and FDI. Finally, the FDI and PPI respond positively in the Mining sector. **** RESUMEN: Usando Vectores Autorregresivos Estructurales (SVAR) y proyecciones locales (Jordà’s (2005)) analizamos el impacto de choques temporales no anticipados en los precios del petróleo sobre el agregado de la economía y tres sectores: agricultura, minería e industria. Dada su condición exportadora de petróleo, el presente análisis cobra especial importancia en Colombia. Usando datos desde 2000:T1 a 2017:T3, los resultados muestran que un choque positivo al precio del petróleo incrementa el Producto Interno Bruto (PIB), disminuye la percepción de riesgo internacional, aprecia la tasa de cambio e induce la adopción de una política monetaria contractiva. El esquema de inflación objetivo con tipo de cambio flexible hace que tanto la inflación como la inversión extranjera directa (IED) no respondan de manera significativa al choque. A nivel sectorial se presentan resultados mixtos. El sector agrícola no presenta impactos significativos en IED, PIB y en los precios al productor (IPP). En el sector industrial, el PIB disminuye entre el segundo y el quinto trimestre luego de recibir el choque, con respuestas no significativas en el IPP e IED. Finalmente, en el sector minero tanto la IED como el IPP responden de manera positiva.
J46|Optimal Redistribution with a Shadow Economy|We examine the constrained efficient allocations in the Mirrlees (1971) model with an informal sector. There are two labor markets: formal and informal. The planner observes only income from the formal market. We show that the shadow economy can be welfare improving through two channels. It can be used as a shelter against tax distortions, raising the efficiency of labor supply, and as a screening device, benefiting redistribution. We calibrate the model to Colombia, where 58% of workers are employed informally. The optimal share of shadow workers is close to 22% for the Rawlsian planner and less than 1% for the Utilitarian planner. The optimal tax schedule is very different then the one implied by the Mirrlees (1971) model without the informal sector.
J46|Informality, Governance and Growth|This paper develops a growth framework of a typical developing and democratic setting with formal and informal sectors, which faces trade-off of redistribution through either direct subsidy or strategic regulatory concession to operate informal activities. Inverted U-shaped growth and welfare functions against governance are found, which suggests a deliberated weak governance can raise growth and welfare of the economy with large informal sector keeping taxation at lower level. The governance that maximises growth varies inversely with subsidy given to informal sector and formal labour bargaining power. Unlike the level maximising welfare, the governance that maximises growth becomes independent of the bargaining power in case of no subsidy. Using standard parameters, the calibrated growth and welfare functions support these relations. Econometric results derived from instrumental and system regression models using pooled data for 46 countries during 1995-2009 justify such conjectures. This explains why the growing countries show higher level of informality.
J46|Un modelo para evaluar el sistema pensional colombiano|Este documento presenta el Modelo Pensional de Asofondos (MPA) y sus principales resultados. Inicialmente, se hace una revisión de las variables demográficas, macroeconómicas y del sistema pensional que utiliza el modelo y cada uno de los supuestos que se hacen sobre estas. Posteriormente, se explica en detalle cada una de las fases que componen el modelo, para terminar con las simulaciones de las variables más relevantes del sistema pensional colombiano en caso de no cambiar la normativa vigente. Con esto se encuentra que, dada la actual normatividad y regulación, solo el 27% de la población en edad de jubilación tendrá una pensión en 2055. De ese porcentaje el 85% correspondería a pensiones por el Régimen de Ahorro Individual con Solidaridad (RAIS), incluyendo las obtenidas por Fondo de Garantía de Pensión Mínima (FGPM), y el 15% restante correspondería al Régimen de Prima Media (RPM). Sería deseable que otras instituciones, públicas y privadas, documenten sus modelos de evaluación y predicción de las políticas de protección social en el país.

J46|Análisis Espacial de la Informalidad Laboral a Nivel Intra-urbano|En este documento se estudia la dimensión espacial de la informalidad laboral a nivel intra-urbano. Utilizando como caso de estudio la ciudad de Medellín (Colombia), se hace un análisis de la dimensión espacial de la informalidad laboral y a partir de modelos de regresión con dependencia espacial se estudian los principales factores que determinan éste fenómeno. Los resultados muestran que existen marcados patrones espaciales de la informalidad laboral a nivel intra-urbano en Medellín, en donde la ciudad se encuentra segmentada socio-espacialmente entre norte y sur en términos de la calidad del empleo, educación, oportunidades de empleo y condiciones de la vivienda. También se encuentra que un mayor porcentaje de mujeres y mayor porcentaje de viviendas precarias generan incrementos en los niveles de informalidad laboral. Por su parte, las variables asociadas a educación y empleo moderno tienen un efecto negativo sobre éste fenómeno.
J46|Informalidad empresarial en Colombia|Existen pocas fuentes para estimar la informalidad empresarial en Colombia, pero a partir de la Encuesta de Hogares es posible afirmar que constituye cerca del 60% de las firmas, el 37% de los trabajadores y el 33% del valor agregado, en las áreas urbanas. Esta gran prevalencia de la informalidad contrasta con los beneficios de la formalidad en términos de bienestar laboral, productividad y cumplimiento futuro de la normativa tributaria, sanitaria, ambiental y de calidad. La respuesta a esta paradoja puede encontrarse en los diferenciales de ganancias después de impuestos entre firmas formales e informales. En efecto, los beneficios económicos de la formalización exceden sus costos únicamente en las firmas de mayor productividad relativa. En estas firmas existe un círculo virtuoso entre formalidad y productividad que contrasta con el círculo vicioso al que se enfrentan las firmas de menor productividad relativa. Este análisis también permite adaptar una versión simplificada del modelo y la taxonomía de la informalidad de Ulyssea (2017) al caso colombiano e identificar algunas recomendaciones para su implementación, y en particular: 1) las políticas de reducción de costos de entrada a la formalidad focalizadas en firmas de muy baja productividad pueden tener poco éxito si se aplican sobre la informalidad de subsistencia y de manera aislada a otras políticas; 2) Las políticas de monitoreo y control deben estar focalizadas en firmas de mayor productividad relativa. Su aplicación sobre firmas de muy baja productividad, aunque reduciría la informalidad, podría ocasionar un problema de bienestar.
J46|Crecimiento verde inclusivo e informalidad|El presente trabajo realiza un análisis de la informalidad y el crecimiento verde inclusivo, con énfasis en los sectores de minería, actividades agropecuarias, silvicultura, construcción y manejo de residuos. La informalidad se estima para las unidades productivas desde el punto de vista de la normativa laboral, empresarial, ambiental y de títulos. El crecimiento verde inclusivo, se mide mezclando las metodologías utilizadas para estimar el Índice de Crecimiento Sostenible del WEF, y el Índice EPI, de la Universidad de Yale. Además de hacer evidentes las altísimas tasas de informalidad en los sectores seleccionados, la conclusión principal de este trabajo es que predomina una relación positiva entre formalidad y buen desempeño ambiental y esta relación se muestra robusta y significativa, aún después de controlar por variables observables como el tamaño, el sector, la geografía y la educación (como proxy de ingresos). Aunque no es posible realizar un ejercicio de causalidad, nuestros resultados sugieren que la relación entre las dos variables se explica principalmente por determinantes comunes. Bajo este entendido y después de realizar un análisis de ecuaciones simultáneas para establecer los determinantes del desempeño ambiental y laboral, formulamos algunas recomendaciones de política.
J46|Eliciting women's willingness to take a job. Evidence from displaced and extremely poor women in Cali, Colombia|Este documento presenta un experimento de laboratorio sobre las preferencias de mujeres desplazadas por la violencia y en condición de extrema pobreza, residentes en Cali, Colombia, en el mercado laboral formal e informal. En este experimento se obtienen las decisiones que estas mujeres toman respecto al ingreso constante diario, obtenido de trabajar en casa en un negocio pequeño y de baja productividad (como cocinar o coser), contra la opción de aumentar su ingreso diario trabajando fuera de casa, como empleados. El salario elegido está sujeto al número de horas lejos de casa, el precio del transporte y el costo del cuidado de los niños y/o adolecentes, y adicionalmente de si el empleo es formal o informal. Un total de 225 mujeres participaron en este experimento. Para obtener las negociaciones sobre las opciones de trabajo al interior de los hogares, el grupo de tratamiento estaba compuesto por mujeres casadas con sus esposos presentes en el experimento, y un grupo de control conformado por mujeres casadas sin que sus esposos estuvieran presentes. Se invitaron parejas para negociar en diferentes escenarios. Los resultados muestran que no hay diferencias significativas entre los grupos de tratamiento y de control, en el caso de los empleos informales. Mujeres teniendo a sus esposos presentes eran menos propensas a aceptar empleos con un menor salario en el sector formal, y más propensas a quedarse en casa, que sus contrapartes que no tenían a sus maridos presentes. Las preferencias de trabajo también varían de acuerdo a los costos del cuidado y del número de hijos menores a los 18 años.

J46|Payroll Taxes, Social Security and Informality. The 2012 Tax Reform in Colombia|I evaluate how the drastic reduction in payroll taxes in 2012 reduced informality in Colombia. By the end of 2012 the Colombian government implemented a tax reform that, among other things, substantially reduced payroll taxes. I evaluate the effect of this reform on informality both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, I develop a labor market model incorporating the changes introduced by the reform. As the reduction in payroll taxes was accompanied by a change in social trans-fers' funding, which led to uncertain changes in profits and social benefits, straightforward predictions on informality are not possible. Empirically, I obtain difference-in-difference (DID) estimates from two household surveys- one composed by many repeated cross sections across many years and the other a much shorter panel dataset. Estimates from the repeated cross sections data indicate small, short-term effects and large long-term effects. Industry was the first sector to enjoy a reduction in informality, followed by services and agriculture. For workers earning around one minimum wage, I find large point estimates. Estimates from the household survey panel data are in line with these results.
J46|Informal Employment Dynamics in Paraguay|I characterize informal-formal employment transitions in Paraguay. Results indicate that some factors, such as education and firms size, improve workers' movement between informal and formal employment, and wage gains from moving into formality are modest. Workers who tend to stay indenitely informal are more likely to become unemployed or inactive. Estimates, based on a survival model, indicate that education and firm size highly increase informal-to-formal transitions, especially if workers have stayed informal for a long time. Older women have lower formal-to-informal transitions and, surprisingly, education plays no significant role. Mincer estimates point to high wages for formal workers, compared with informal, but that individual workers' wage gains from moving into formality are small.
J46|SMMES in South Africa: Understanding the Constraints on Growth and Performance|Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) have been identified as a key component to advancing inclusive growth and development in South Africa. This paper serves to present a snapshot of the current profile of SMMEs in South Africa as well as the key inhibitors of growth for SMMEs. We provide a comparative perspective of the role of SMMEs and entrepreneurship in South Africa, then profile the current landscape of SMMEs in South Africa, evaluating the characteristics of SMMEs across three dimensions: firm, owner and employee characteristics. Following this, we distinguish between formal and informal SMMEs in order to highlight the unique nature of informality in South Africa. This paper also evaluates the endogenous and exogenous impediments to growth faced by South African SMMEs. Endogenous challenges are internal to the firm while exogenous challenges are external to the firm. In summarising these findings, we present the major challenges inhibiting the growth of SMMEs in South Africa, taking into account firm heterogeneity in terms of both firm size and informality status.
J46|"Progressive taxation and (in)stability in an exogenous growth model with non-market (""home"") production"|"We show that in a exogenous growth model with non-market (""home"") sector calibrated to Bulgarian data under the progressive taxation regime (1993-2007), the economy exhibits equilibrium indeterminacy due to the presence of non-market production. These results are in line with the findings in Benhabib and Farmer (1994, 1996) and Farmer (1999). Also, the findings in this paper are in contrast to Guo and Lansing (1988) who argue that progressive taxation works as an automatic stabilizer. Under the flat tax regime (2008-16), the economy calibrated to Bulgarian data displays saddle-path stability. The decrease in the average effective tax rate addresses the indeterminacy issue and eliminates the ""stable focus"" dynamics."

The governance that maximises growth varies inversely with subsidy given to informal sector and formal labour bargaining power.

Using standard parameters, the calibrated growth and welfare functions support these relations. Econometric results derived from instrumental and system regression models using pooled data for 46 countries during 1995-2009 justify such conjectures.

J46|The ups and downs of the gig economy, 2015–2017|A variety of researchers and public entities have estimated the prevalence of nontraditional work arrangements — using diverse definitions — in recent decades, and the topic has received increasing attention in the past five years. Despite numerous media reports that the prevalence of nonstandard work has increased since the Great Recession, not all sources agree on this point, and very little evidence exists relating to hours or earnings from such arrangements and their changes over time. Using unique data from the Survey of Informal Work Participation (SIWP), we describe changes in informal work activity across 2015, 2016, and 2017 along multiple dimensions and for a variety of specific jobs. Considering the net changes observed between 2015 and 2017, we find that participation rates and earnings were mostly flat across the period, while average hours for gig workers declined by economically and statistically significant margins. The aggregate number of full-time equivalent jobs embodied in informal work — a measure combining participation rates and hours — also declined by an economically significant margin between 2015 and 2017. A major exception to these trends is that average ridesharing hours more than quadrupled between 2015 and 2017. We find some evidence that the recent declines in informal work hours represented a response to declining unemployment rates, but during this time period there also appears to have been upward structural pressure on gig work that provided a particular boost to platform-based work.
J46|Informal employment in Poland: an empirical spatial analysis| The main goal of our article is to bridge the gap in the regional analysis of informal employment in Poland and in particular to indicate the propensity for informal work in the working-age population, to test if informal activities are typical for marginalized people (less educated, unemployed, older) and to identify the regional and spatial heterogeneity in the propensity. We use data from the ‘Human Capital Balance 2010–2014’ survey. Results indicate a strong relationship between the probability of informal work and age, sex and labour force status. Moreover, a strong spatial dependency can be observed.
J46|Informality over the life-cycle|In developing countries, informality is mainly concentrated on younger and older workers. In this paper, we propose a dual labor market theory that highlights how frictions and taxation in the formal sector as well as educational choices interact to shape the informality rate over the life-cycle. We develop a life-cycle model with search frictions, skill heterogeneities, and endogenous educational choices. We carry out a numerical analysis and show that our model reproduces remarkably well the life-cycle patterns of informality, non-employment and formal employment in Argentina. We analyze several public policies and show that an educational grant reduces both informality and non-employment and may be fully financed by the extra tax revenues generated by the increase in formal employment and wages. Lowering taxes may achieve similar results but is detrimental for the government budget, in the case of Argentina, despite increasing the base on which they are levied.
J46|The Value of Health Insurance: A Household Job Search Approach|Do households value access to free health insurance when making labor supply decisions? We answer this question using the introduction of universal health insurance in Mexico, the Seguro Popular (SP), in 2002. The SP targeted individuals not covered by Social Security and broke the link between access to health care and job contract. We start by using the rollout of SP across municipalities in a differences-indifferences approach, and find an increase in informality of 4% among low-educated families with children. We then develop and estimate a household search model that incorporates the pre-reform valuation of formal sector amenities relative to the alternatives (informal sector and non-employment) and the value of SP. The estimated value of the health insurance coverage provided by SP is below the governmentâ€™s cost of the program, and the corresponding utility gain is, at most, 0.56 per each peso spent.
J46|Export boom, employment bust? The paradox of Indonesia's displaced workers, 2000-14|In Indonesia, an export boom and sustained, rapid GDP growth in the decade after 2000 was accompanied by real earnings that were flat on average, and even declining for many workers. Conventional models of growth and trade predict that labor productivity rises as an economy develops; that this should not be observed during a period of high GDP growth is a puzzle that merits careful investigation. In this paper we explore these seemingly paradoxical trends using several waves of a panel of individual employment data. Economic growth is rarely balanced in a sectoral sense, and the nature of the structural change experienced by Indonesia is also strongly associated with lower competitiveness in sectors where formal employment rates are high, causing some degree of involuntary labor movement from formal to informal modes of employment. We explore this econometrically and find that the earnings of workers displaced from formal to informal jobs are significantly lower relative to workers who remain in the formal market. The fact of this displacement, and its implications for individual earnings, undercuts conventional thinking about the welfare gains from a sustained growth experience. Our findings add, perhaps for the first time, a developing-country dimension to the existing job displacement literature. They also shed some light on the causes of Indonesia's unprecedented increase in inequality during the same growth epoch.
J46|“What drives the spatial wage premium for formal and informal workers? The case of Ecuador”|This article investigates the incidence of agglomeration externalities in a typical developing country, Ecuador. In particular, we analyze the role of the informal sector within these relations, since informal employment accounts for a significant part of total employment in the developing countries. Using individual level data and instrumental variable techniques, we investigate the impact of spatial externalities, in terms of population size and local specialization, on the wages of workers in Ecuadorian cities. The results show that spatial externalities matter also for a typical developing country, especially as far as urbanization externalities are concerned. Moreover, analysis of the interaction between spatial externalities and the informal economy shows a general penalization for informal workers in terms of benefits arising from agglomeration externalities. Finally, by investigating the possible channels behind the heterogeneity found in spatial agglomeration gains between formal and informal workers, we show that the advantages from agglomeration for formal workers may well be accounted for by positive sorting and better gains from job changes, while for informal workers they arise from positive learning externalities.
J46|The Economic and Social Determinants of Migrants' Well-Being during the Global Financial Crisis|This paper investigates the economic and social determinants affecting the well-being of temporary migrants before, during and after the financial crisis. Exploiting unique panel data which cover migration spells from Tajikistan between 2001 and 2011, we find that migrants earn less but stay longer in the destination during the crisis; at the same time, they become more exposed to illegal work relations, harassment and deportation through the Russian authorities. Especially illegal employment has negative second order effects on wages. Despite the similarities in the demographics and jobs of migrant workers, we find substantial heterogeneity in how the financial crisis affects their well-being. Migrants who experience wage losses during the crisis rationally stop migrating.
J46|The Puzzles and Contradictions of the Indian Labour Market: What Will the Future of Work Look Like?|"Analysing the Indian labour market poses inherent challenges given the country's size and diversity. Rather than a case of ""jobless growth"", India has experienced concentrated employment growth, mainly in urban areas and for men. This has been accompanied by a decline in the female labour force participation rate, which emerged as a major puzzle. Informality remains a defining feature with rising informalization in the formal sector. Some outcomes partly reflect India's overall level of economic development. At the same time, structural transformation in other countries, including those in the region, has led to greater absorption of workers, particularly women, in manufacturing. Looking at the future of work, the current situation is likely to prevail in the near future. This means that workers will continue to leave agriculture and seek employment in urban areas. But the ability of the manufacturing sector to engage workers will be constrained by the capital and skill intensity of production. More wage employment will be created but the challenge is to ensure these workers have access to social security and other benefits. As women become better educated, their participation in the labour force is likely to increase but many constraints keep them out of paid employment. Rather than focusing singularly on the threat of automation to job creation, policymakers need to address the distributional effects of technological change, particularly in terms of its skill-bias. An important goal is to improve access to technology, which would enhance productivity and working conditions."

The analysis is based upon matched sex worker–client panel data, which were collected from ‘field reports’ on PunterNet.com website over the 1999–2009 time period. We find a steady increase in the incidence of unprotected oral sex during this period, rising from
J46|Enforcement of Labor Regulation and the Labor Market Effects of Trade: Evidence from Brazil|How does enforcement of labor regulations shape the labor market effects of trade? To tackle this question, we exploit the Brazilian trade liberalization episode and exogenous variation in the intensity of both the trade shock and enforcement across local labor markets. Regions with stricter enforcement observed no increase in informal employment but large disemployment effects. Regions with weaker enforcement had no employment losses but substantial increases in informality. All effects are concentrated on unskilled workers, with no effects on skilled workers. The results indicate that informality acts as a buffer that reduces trade-induced adjustment costs in the labor market.
J46|Probing for Informal Work Activity|The Current Population Survey (CPS) is the source of official U.S. labor force statistics. The wording of the CPS employment questions may not always cue respondents to include informal work in their responses, especially when providing proxy reports about other household members. In a survey experiment conducted using a sample of Mechanical Turk respondents, additional probing identified a substantial amount of informal work activity not captured by the CPS employment questions, both among those with no employment and among those categorized as employed based on answers to the CPS questions. Among respondents providing a proxy report for another household member, the share identifying additional work was systematically greater among those receiving a detailed probe that offered examples of types of informal work than among those receiving a simpler global probe. Similar differences between the effects of the detailed and the global probe were observed when respondents answered for themselves only among those who had already reported multiple jobs. The findings suggest that additional probing could improve estimates of employment and multiple job holding in the CPS and other household surveys, but that how the probe is worded is likely to be important.
J46|Measuring the Gig Economy: Current Knowledge and Open Issues|The rise of the “gig economy” has attracted wide attention from both scholars and the popular media. Much of this attention has been devoted to jobs mediated through various online platforms. While non-traditional work arrangements have been a perennial subject of debate and study, the perception that new technology is producing an accelerated pace of change in the organization of work has fueled a resurgence of interest in how such changes may be affecting both workers and firms. This paper provides a typology of work arrangements and reviews how different arrangements, and especially gig activity, are captured in existing data. A challenge for understanding recent trends is that household survey and administrative data paint a different picture, with the former showing little evidence of the growth in self-employment that would be implied by a surge in gig activity and the latter providing evidence of considerable recent growth. An examination of matched individual-level survey and administrative records shows that a large and growing fraction of those with self-employment activity in administrative data have no such activity recorded in household survey data. The share of those with self-employment activity in household survey data but not administrative data is smaller and has not grown. Promising avenues for improving the measurement of self-employment activity include the addition of more probing questions to household survey questionnaires and the development of integrated data sets that combine survey, administrative and, potentially, private data.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J46|The role of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in fostering inclusive growth at the local level in Southeast Asia|The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) for fostering inclusive growth at the local level in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN ) region. The first section provides a brief overview of the main developmental challenges in the ASEAN region that have resulted in growing inequalities in wealth distribution. The second and third sections review evidence from developed as well as developing countries regarding TVET’s impact on employment and wages (Section 2), as well as on poverty, inequality and social exclusion (Section 3). Section 4 summarises the key findings and highlights lessons learned for the ASEAN region. Good practice examples from the region are presented to illustrate how countries have used TVET to improve economic and social outcomes at the local level.
J46|Making growth more inclusive in Thailand|The People pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development focuses on quality of life in all its dimensions, and emphasises the international community’s commitment to ensuring all human beings can fulfil their potential in dignity, equality and good health. Thailand’s path from a low-income to an upper-middle-income country over recent decades is widely hailed as a development success story. Poverty has fallen impressively and inequality is on a downwards trend, but more efforts are needed to reduce still widespread informality and persistent, substantial regional inequalities, and to further improve living standards, especially for those who currently work informally. To achieve these objectives, the government needs to: (i) consider tax and regulatory measures to encourage formalisation; (ii) boost the participation rates of informal workers in social protection schemes; (iii) expand adequate social safety nets for poor households and the elderly; (iv) prepare the healthcare system for an ageing and modernising society; and (v) improve the education system, particularly in rural areas. Gaps also remain in ensuring women’s political participation and reducing gender-based violence. This Working Paper relates to the 2018 Initial Assessment report of the Multi-dimensional Country Review of Thailand (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/multi-dimensional-review-thailand.htm)
J46|Structural policies to boost productivity and inclusion in Costa Rica|Owing to past structural reforms, Costa Rica has enjoyed robust GDP growth and productivity levels are gradually converging towards the OECD average. However, large GDP per capita and productivity gaps persist. In addition, not everyone has benefited from this growth. Inequality has increased and labour market conditions are a concern. Costa Rica has a lower share of employed workers in the population than almost all OECD countries, unemployment remains well above its pre-global-financial-crisis level, labour market participation has decreased and the share of informal jobs is high. Recognising these challenges, Costa Rica has accelerated its structural reform momentum recently, with policy reforms underway or planned in several areas that present win-win opportunities to boost both productivity and inclusion. These include efforts to tackle labour market informality, simplify the minimum wage structure, increase competition and reduce regulatory burdens. In addition to further reforms in these priority areas, structural policy improvements are also needed to increase outcomes and reduce inequalities in education and address significant transport infrastructure gaps.
J46| Mercado de trabajo doméstico en los inicios de la República: 1876 – 1940| El objetivo de este artículo es analizar la evolución del trabajo doméstico en las primeras décadas de la República, tomando como base los datos de los Censos de 1876 y 1940, así como algunas estimaciones hechas por otros autores sobre la estructura del empleo y los ingresos de esta fuerza laboral. Aun cuando el trabajo doméstico remunerado cambió de una relación amo – esclavo anterior a otra relación patrón – trabajador libre, las estructuras jerárquicas del régimen colonial basadas en la supuesta inferioridad de los descendientes de los habitantes nativos y de los esclavos de origen africano se mantuvieron hasta bien entrado el siglo XX. Esto retrasó el desarrollo de un mercado laboral propiamente dicho. Hubo dos cambios importantes entre ambos censos. En primer lugar, se redujo el porcentaje de varones dedicados a esta ocupación se redujo del 50% al 25% del total de la fuerza laboral en esta ocupación. Las causas serían las mayores alternativas laborales para los varones debido a la mayor urbanización; así como el bajo nivel de educación de las mujeres rurales, y la supuesta seguridad de vivir en la casa del patrón. En segundo lugar, se da una lenta sustitución de trabajadoras afrodescendientes por trabajadoras de etnicidad nativa. Esto se debería a la mayor migración rural – urbana y al rechazo de los empleadores a contratar trabajadoras afrodescendientes libres. Finalmente, si bien existen estimaciones de los ingresos monetarios de los trabajadores domésticos en el siglo XIX, no se han hecho estimaciones similares para la primera mitad del siglo XX. Aun así, podemos decir que los ingresos monetarios de los trabajadores domésticos eran menores que los ingresos de los trabajadores no calificados, diferencia que se mantiene hasta hoy.

J46|Examining Vulnerabilities: the Cycle Rickshaw Pullers of Dhaka City|Dhaka, capital city of Bangladesh, is one of the fastest growing cities of the world in terms of population concentration. Centrally located, it attracts a large number of job seeking migrants from the rural areas of entire Bangladesh on a continuous basis. Some of these job seeking migrants are readily absorbed in the urban informal service sector, which includes cycle rickshaw pulling. Cycle rickshaw pulling is arduous and stressful, with no promotion prospect or insurance for occupational hazards such as accident injuries, while entry is easy as education and training as well as capital asset requirement is minimal. In order to examine vulnerabilities of the rickshaw pullers, a structured questionnaire survey has been conducted on a total of 120 randomly selected cycle rickshaw pullers in five locations across the Dhaka city. The primary survey has examined their current living conditions, livelihood strategies, shocks and insurances against shocks. The respondents lacked education and skill training, did not own capital assets and mostly supported their families stationed in the rural areas with earnings from this cycle rickshaw pulling. Econometric models of OLS and probit regression have been utilized to examine a number of issues, and the results are expected. Most respondents were willing to educate their children and did not want to include them in this sector. There are potentials of entrepreneurship if they are skill trained, financed and advised properly. They are reported to be willing to improve their living conditions, which is difficult due to the vulnerabilities that they face.
J46|Employment Targeting in a Frictional Labor Market|Governments in both developing and developed economies play an active role in labor markets in the form of providing both formal public sector jobs and employment through public workfare programs. We refer to this as employment targeting. In the context of a simple search and matching friction model, we show that the propensity for the public sector to target more employment can increase the unemployment rate in the economy and lead to an increase in the size of the informal sector. Employment targeting can therefore have perverse effects on labor market outcomes.
J46|Male-Female wage gap and informal employment in Bangladesh: A quantile regression approach|This article undertakes an examination of Bangladesh’s latest available Quarterly Labour Force Survey 2015-2016 data to draw indepth insights as regards gender wage gap and wage discrimination in Bangladesh labour market. Mean wage decomposition shows that an average woman in Bangladesh earns 12.2 per cent lower wage than man, and about half of the wage gap can be explained by labour market discrimination against women. Quantile Counterfactual Decomposition shows that women are subjected to higher wage penalty at the lower deciles of the wage distribution with the wage gap varying between 8.3 per cent to 19.4 per cent at different deciles. We established that at lower deciles a significant part of the gender wage gap is on account of the relatively larger presence of informal employment. Conditional quantile estimates further reveals that formally employed female workers earn higher wage than their male counterparts at the first decile but suffer from wage penalty at the top deciles.
J46|Earnings Inequality and the Minimum Wage: Evidence from Brazil|We assess the extent to which a rise in the minimum wage can account for three facts characterizing a large decline in earnings inequality in Brazil from 1996â€“2012: (i) the decline is more pronounced towards the bottom of the distribution; (ii) one quarter of the decline stems from an increase in relative pay at less productive firms; and (iii) another quarter is attributable to falling pay differences due to worker heterogeneity. To this end, we build an equilibrium search model with heterogeneity in worker ability and firm productivity. The central feature of the model is the presence of spillover effects of the minimum wage on higher earnings ranks due to monopsonistic competition among firms for workers. We estimate the model using indirect inference and find that the rise in the minimum wage explains 70 percent of the decline in the variance of log earnings. Spillover effects of the minimum wage account for more than half of this decline and quantitatively match the three empirical facts. Our results suggest that labor market dynamics can lead to large effects of policy on earnings inequality.
J46|Wage Dynamics and Peer Referrals|We present a flexible model of wage dynamics where information about job openings is transmitted through social networks. We show that the individuals' wages dynamic is positively associated across time and that this result holds outside the stationary distribution, and under observed and unobserved heterogeneity. We present an empirical application using the British Household Panel Survey by exploiting direct information about individual's social networks. We find that having more employed friends leads to more job offers, but to slightly lower offered wages. We also find that non-relative friends are more helpful than relatives, and that individuals benefit relatively more from their male friends. (Copyright: Elsevier)
J46|Labor Market Regulations in the Context of Structural Transformation|This paper constructs a theoretical model to study labor market regulations in developing countries within the context of structural transformation. When workers are risk averse and the market for insurance against labor income risk is missing, regulations that provide insurance to workers (such as severance payments) are efficiency enhancing and promote structural transformation. However, regulations that simply create barriers to the dismissal of workers not only impede structural transformation, they also end up reducing the welfare of workers. The implications of some other issues like general regulatory burden, weak state capacity, and minimum wage regulations are analyzed as well. The paper provides some empirical evidence broadly consistent with the theoretical results using cross-country data. While dismissal regulations increase the share of informal employment, severance payments to workers do not.
J46|The Value of Health Insurance: A Household Job Search Approach|Do households value access to free health insurance when making labor supply decisions? We answer this question using the introduction of universal health insurance in Mexico, the Seguro Popular (SP), in 2002. The SP targeted individuals not covered by Social Security and broke the link between access to health care and job contract. We start by using the rollout of SP across municipalities in a differences-indifferences approach, and find an increase in informality of 4% among low-educated families with children. We then develop and estimate a household search model that incorporates the pre-reform valuation of formal sector amenities relative to the alternatives (informal sector and non-employment) and the value of SP. The estimated value of the health insurance coverage provided by SP is below the government's cost of the program, and the corresponding utility gain is, at most, 0.56 per each peso spent.
J46|Is there a rainbow after the rain? How do agricultural shocks affect non-farm enterprises? Evidence from Thailand|Increasing weather volatility poses a significant threat to the livelihood of rural households in developing countries. While how rainfall shocks affect agricultural households has been well documented, there is not much evidence on the indirect effects on non-agricultural households. Combining household panel data with grid-level precipitation data, we analyze how rainfall shocks affect non-farm enterprises in rural Thailand. We examine the effects of rainfall shocks on labor supply for independent, non-farm activities as well as the indirect effects of rainfall shocks on non-farm enterprises through forward linkages, backward linkages and the consumption levels of farm households. We find that farm households increase their labor participation in non-farm self-employment in response to rainfall shocks. We also observe that rainfall shocks lead to increased input costs by non-farm enterprises in the food processing industry, to higher input costs by farms, to higher sales by agriculture-related non-farm enterprises and to lower expenditure by farm households on food and other consumption items. These effects are significant for surplus rainfall shocks (i.e., more rainfall than usual) but less robust for deficit rainfall shocks (i.e., less rainfall than usual), yet both surplus and deficit rainfall shocks lower agricultural production compared to normal rainfall conditions.
J46|Dependence or Constraints? Cash transfers, labor supply and the process of development|In this study, I use the timing and eligibility criteria of a large-scale conditional cash transfer program in Bolivian public schools to identify the efect of the program on adults’ labor supply. I find that adult females increase their labor supply due to the program, mostly through self-employment. To understand these results, I sketch a simple theoretical framework of selection into employment that introduces fixed costs to work and imperfections in capital markets, two main features of the process of development. In this environment, households select into employment only if they are able to self-finance the fixed costs. I derive additional predictions that are empirically tested. First, the positive treatment efects should manifest at the extensive and not the intensive margin. Estimating treatment efects along the cumulative density function of work hours/week, I find that the efects on labor supply come exclusively from the extensive margin. Second, the efects of an income shock should be stronger when capital market frictions are more salient. Using baseline data for the supply of financial services at the municipality level as a third diference, I find that the efects on labor supply are higher for women in more credit-constrained areas. I compare these results with compelling alternative explanations such as in creases in local aggregate demand induced by the program and the relaxation of time constraints for mothers due to the condition component of the program. I find no evidence supporting these two alternative mechanisms. Overall, the results suggest that after considering the role of credit and labor market frictions, the first step in limbing the ladder of development is to cover come the barriers households face in simply starting to work.
J46|Informalidad laboral y elementos para un salario mínimo diferencial por regiones en Colombia|Se presenta evidencia de que el salario mínimo en relación con el salario correspondiente al percentil 70 afecta el tamaño del sector informal en las áreas urbanas en Colombia. Dicho efecto se observa en promedio en todas las áreas urbanas. Sin embargo, cuando se analizan las ciudades individualmente, se encuentra que el efecto del salario mínimo relativo es diferencial; por ejemplo, en Barranquilla es muy bajo mientras que en Popayán, Villavicencio y Neiva es muy alto. Por ello, en estas últimas, más que en otras, parece haber una gran desconexión entre la productividad de la mano de obra menos capacitada y el salario mínimo. Se plantean dos propuestas para introducir un salario mínimo diferencial dependiendo del alejamiento de la informalidad (productividad laboral) de cada ciudad del promedio de 23 ciudades. Se presentan estimaciones del efecto de la actividad económica y los costos no laborales distintos del salario en un sinnúmero de variables del mercado laboral.
J46|War, Migration and the Origins of the Thai Sex Industry|This paper analyzes the determinants behind the spatial distribution of the sex industry in Thailand. We relate the development of the sex industry to an early temporary demand shock, that is, US military presence during the Vietnam War. Comparing the surroundings of Thai military bases used by the US army to districts close to unused Thai bases, we find that there are currently five times more commercial sex workers in districts near former US bases. The development of the sex industry is also explained by a high price elasticity of supply due to female migration from regions affected by an agricultural crisis. Finally, we study a consequence induced by the large numbers of sex workers in few red-light districts: the HIV outbreak in the early 1990s.
J46|The Impact of MGNREGA on Agricultural Outcomes and the Rural Labour Market: A Matched DID Approach|Abstract This paper attempts to address the impact of the MGNREGA on the rural agricultural sector, focusing on cropping patterns, irrigated area, crop yields, wages and rural employment. The analysis is based on two data sources: the first is a unique district-season level panel dataset that we construct using multiple sources, and the second is unit record data from the NSS Employment Unemployment Surveys. To identify causal effects, we employ a difference-in-difference matching procedure, where districts are matched based on propensity scores; the use of propensity scores represents a novel aspect of this paper. We also examine pre-programme trends for each outcome variable to provide a check on the validity of our estimates. Our results indicate modest changes in cropping patterns that are state and period specific; however, they do not indicate any improvements in crop yields that were expected given the MGNREGA’s focus on investments in irrigation, although there is some evidence that irrigated area may have expanded after a lag. We also find that there is no systematic evidence of impact on wages and therefore no evidence that public works employment in MGNREGA crowded out casual labour in agriculture.
J46|Migration Policy: Lessons from Cooperatives|We propose an immigration policy based the model of cooperatives. Incoming migrants have to acquire a participation certificate. In exchange, the immigrants may enter the country of choice without danger. The revenue goes to the country of the recipient nation rather than to human smugglers. The cost would be much lower than today’s efforts to secure the borders. Asylum seekers get back the money paid for the certificate. Immigration is therewith regulated more efficiently than today. Not all entrance barriers and coercive measures to prevent illegal entry would disappear. However, the pressure of illegal migrants is strongly reduced.
J46|Job Search, Unemployment Protection and Informal Work in Advanced Economies|This paper investigates the incentives that may induce workers to supplement income from unemployment benefits by engaging in temporary informal work. Using a dynamic model of job-search with moral hazard that incorporates a stylised schedule of benefit payments, we describe how informal sector participation changes over the duration of unemployment, in turn affecting the incentive to search for formal employment. We find that increasing benefit generosity makes job seekers less reliant on informal work, enabling them to search more intensively. At the same time, when detection rates are low, informal work participation may decline as benefit exhaustion approaches, reinforcing this effect. From a policy perspective, the analysis identifies scope for reallocation of resources towards less generous programmes within unemployment protection, which would reduce the size of the informal sector and unemployment in the economy.
J46|Pension Incentives and Formal-Sector Labor Supply: Evidence from Colombia|This paper describes how future pension benefits affect labor supply in economies that have an informal sector. From the perspective of the worker, a formal-sector job offers long-run gains, as it increases his likelihood of gaining pension benefits in the future. If workers take those gains into account when they search for formal-sector jobs, the pension system affects formal-sector labor supply. I estimate the causal link between pension incentives and formal-sector labor supply using a cohort-based reform undertaken in Colombia. I demonstrate that a change in future pension benefits generates a large shift between the formal-sector and informal-sector labor supply, and that this change does not affect labor force participation. The average effect of pension incentives on formal-sector labor supply is heterogeneous, and is consistent with the predictions of a theoretical model combining a pension system and informal job opportunities. The effect is concentrated among workers for whom the minimum qualifying conditions are binding, and among workers with higher expected pension wealth. The results presented here suggest that pension reforms have the potential to create large efficiency costs, an effect that should be taken into account when designing pension programs.
J46|Efectos de la migración forzada sobre la confianza y las actitudes hacia inmigrantes en los países destino: evidencia de la crisis de refugiados en Europa|Este artículo estima el efecto de la llegada de refugiados sobre la confianza generalizada en Europa y sobre las actitudes hacia los inmigrantes en los países destino entre 2002 y 2015. Con base en datos recientes de la encuesta social de Europa (ESS, por sus siglas en inglés) y utilizando un enfoque de variable instrumental, se encuentra que un mayor flujo de refugiados afecta negativamente la confianza entre las personas, y que las actitudes que tienen las personas hacia los inmigrantes mejoran entre 2014 y 2015. Se encuentra evidencia de dos mecanismos detrás de los resultados: la incertidumbre laboral y el nivel educativo de las personas, lo cual refleja la percepción que tienen los residentes de los países destino sobre el impacto económico que pueden tener los refugiados. Los resultados encontrados en este documento son robustos a diferentes agrupaciones de la variable de interés, al nivel de actividad económica y a la inclusión de eventos terroristas que podrían afectar la confianza.
J46|La inviabilidad de los regímenes de pensiones de reparto en países que aún gozan del dividendo poblacional: el caso de Colombia|Este artículo argumenta que, en países emergentes, como Colombia, la combinación de la transición demográfica con una alta informalidad del mercado laboral hace inviable la existencia de un régimen de pensiones de reparto. En teoría, un país como Colombia tiene aún una población joven y está, por lo tanto, “gozando” del llamado Bono o Dividendo Demográfico. En estas condiciones, cuenta con una relación entre la población económicamente activa y los adultos en edad de retiro relativamente elevada, lo que debería permitir que los trabajadores activos puedan durante algún tiempo más financiar con sus cotizaciones las pensiones de los adultos mayores. En Colombia, dicha relación es de casi siete trabajadores activos por cada adulto mayor de 65 años. Esta elevada relación es lo que permite la llamada “solidaridad intergeneracional”. Pero en la realidad, debido a la informalidad, solo hay dos trabajadores formales que cotizan a la seguridad social en pensiones por cada adulto mayor. En esas condiciones, aún si se adoptasen a la brevedad todas las medidas necesarias para incrementar radicalmente la formalidad laboral, cuando dichas medidas tuviesen efecto alguno en Colombia, la relación entre activos y adultos mayores habrá caído significativamente y, muy seguramente, Colombia habrá ya perdido su dividendo demográfico. Como consecuencia, los jóvenes, que hoy son solidarios con los mayores, no tendrán quiénes sean solidarios con ellos al llegar al retiro laboral.
J46|The Impact of Trade on Inequality in Developing Countries|This paper assesses the current state of evidence on how international trade shapes inequality and poverty through its influence on earnings and employment opportunities. While the focus is mainly on developing countries, in part because we have more evidence in that context, the discussion draws parallels to the empirical evidence from developed countries. The paper also discusses perceptions about international trade in over 40 countries at different levels of development, including perceptions on trade’s overall benefits for the economy, trade’s effect on the livelihood of workers through wages and jobs, and trade’s contribution to inequality. The paper concludes with a survey of evidence on several policies that could mitigate the adverse effects of import competition.
J46|Evolución del empleo en Chile: asalariados y cuenta propia|Un tema importante de discusión en los últimos años ha sido el cambio en la composición del empleo. Ello en vista del dinamismo que se ha observado en el trabajo por cuenta propia y el menor crecimiento o caída en el trabajo asalariado. Esto llevaría aparejado una mayor precariedad del empleo, en cuanto en promedio los asalariados tendrían mejores condiciones de trabajo que los trabajadores por cuenta propia. En este trabajo se hace un análisis grueso de las propiedades cíclicas del empleo en Chile. Se usa la encuesta de la Universidad de Chile, porque, a diferencia de la del INE, no ha sufrido cambios metodológicos. Esto nos permite tener una serie más larga al hacer el análisis. Se trata de un análisis simple de correlaciones. No se controla por otras variables. Se define como procíclica una variable cuyo cambio porcentual se correlaciona positivamente con el crecimiento del PIB o cuya participación dentro del total sube en la parte alta del ciclo. Se concluye, en primer lugar, que el comportamiento procíclico del trabajo asalariado y contracíclico del por cuenta propia no es sólo de este último tiempo, si no que se observa en las distintas etapas del ciclo de las últimas dos décadas. Específicamente, se encuentra que en los momentos de alto crecimiento aumenta la participación de trabajadores asalariados y disminuye la de los cuenta propia. Lo inverso sucede en períodos de desaceleración. Asimismo, se encuentra que este fenómeno se ha agudizado en los últimos años. En otras palabras, en lo más reciente el crecimiento del trabajo asalariado se ha hecho más procíclico y el por cuenta propia más contracíclico. En segundo lugar, se analizan los cambios en el empleo, tanto asalariado como por cuenta propia, según distintas clasificaciones: grupo ocupacional, actividad económica, edad, género y nivel de educación. Se aprecia que entre los asalariados, quienes tienen el comportamiento más procíclico son los empleados, que trabajan en construcción, comercio, industria, servicios de gobierno y financieros, y servicios comunales y sociales, de todos los tramos etarios pero más significativamente los más jóvenes, mujeres, y principalmente con educación universitaria y en cierto grado también con educación media y básica. En cuanto a los flujos de empleo, en los cuenta propia se observa que los grupos que siguen más el patrón cíclico del total de cuenta propia (es decir, contracíclico) son los que trabajan en los sectores de servicios personales y hogares, y en agricultura, en general en grupos más jóvenes y más recientemente en grupos de edad media, sin grandes diferencias entre hombres y mujeres, aunque en el último tiempo con más incidencia de hombres, y con educación básica y media.

J46|The Role of Informal Urban Settlements in Upward Mobility|The paper uses longitudinal data for South Africa to explore the magnitude of social progression among people living within informal settlements compared with the residents of rural areas and formal urban areas. The objective is to assess whether shack settlements foster or frustrate human progress in the way they link people to the services, contacts and livelihoods concentrated in cities.
J46|Social networks, job satisfaction and job searching behavior in the Chinese labor market|This study first investigates determinants of job searching strategies and then examines if social networks are connected with better job outcomes. Unlike previous studies that focus solely on income, this paper pays more heed to job satisfaction. Based on data drawn from China General Social Survey, we find that disadvantaged job seekers rely primarily on informal channels; whereas experienced and better-educated job seekers tend to search for jobs through formal channels. However, those reaping the largest benefit from using networks are the job seekers who are able to use formal and informal channels jointly. By disaggregating the whole sample, we further find that the promoting effect of network use is contingent on factors such as gender and types of jobs. Network use brings about larger benefits to female and job seekers target to prestigious occupations. Finally, it appears that whether a job seeker can receive influential help depends primarily on the social status of the contacts rather than their tie strength. The results of our paper thus urge us to examine the combination of different searching strategies rather than studying them separately.
J46|Progressive taxation and (in)stability in an exogenous growth model with an informal sector|We show that in an exogenous growth model with informal economy calibrated to Bulgarian data under the progressive taxation regime (1993-2007), the economy exhibits equilibrium indeterminacy due to the presence of an unofficial production. These results are in line with the findings in Benhabib and Farmer (1994, 1996) and Farmer (1999). Also, the findings in this paper are in contrast to Guo and Lansing (1988) who argue that progressive taxation works as an automatic stabilizer. Un- der the flat tax regime (2008-14), the economy calibrated to Bulgarian data displays saddle-path stability. The decrease in the average effective tax rate addresses the indeterminacy issue and eliminates the ”sink” dynamics.
J46|The Impact of Early Marriage on Women’s Employment in the Middle East and North Africa|Marriage is a central stage in the transition to adulthood in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). This paper builds on the existing literature on the effect of marriage on women’s employment in MENA. Besides examining how different types of work are affected by early marriage (defined as marriage by the median age of marriage) in a multivariate setting, the contribution of this paper is to endogenize the marriage decision using an instrumental variable approach. We find that marriage by the median age reduces the probability of working for women by 47 percent in Jordan, 33 percent in Tunisia and 16 percent in Egypt. Much of the effect is due to a reduction in the probability of private wage work, which is reduced by 76 percent in Jordan, 57 percent in Tunisia and 40 percent in Egypt. Differences emerge across the three countries in the extent to which self-employment after marriage is available to women to compensate for the reduction in wage employment opportunities.
J46|The Impact of the Action Plan for Promoting Employment and Combating Unemployment on Employment Informality in Algeria|This paper examines whether the Action Plan for Promoting Employment and Combating Unemployment, a labor market intermediation program adopted by the Algerian government in 2008, reduced the informality of employment in Algeria. Using repeated cross-section data from the Household Survey on Employment for the period from 1997 to 2013, and a difference-in-difference methodology, we estimate whether the Action Plan has reduced the probability that workers are employed informally in enterprises of more than 5 workers – the type of enterprise that is most likely to be directly affected by the Action Plan. Our results show that the Action Plan has in fact contributed to reducing employment informality in such enterprises, but with heterogeneous effects. More precisely, it reduced informality for employees of establishments of 10 workers or more but had no significant effects on informality for those working in enterprises of 5 to 9 workers. Furthermore, when we restrict our estimates to new entrants only, we do not find statistically significant effects.
J46|Wage inflation and informal work|Despite very low unemployment in the United States in recent months, wage inflation has remained modest. This paper investigates the possibility that there is hidden labor market slack in the form of informal or gig economy work, which may help explain this wage growth puzzle. Using unique data from 2015 and 2016 that we collected through the Survey of Informal Work Participation — part of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations — we find indirect and direct evidence for this hypothesis. First, we find that a measure of informal labor is negatively associated with wage growth at the census division level, while we observe no significant association between wage growth and the U-3 or U-6 unemployment rate. Second, most informal work participants in our survey report that for some increase in pay, they would drop hours of informal work in exchange for added hours of formal work. Together our results suggest that informal work represents an economically significant amount of potential labor supply to the formal market that may reduce pressure on measured wages. We also discuss other interpretations of our data.
J46|The ‘local economy’ effect of social transfers: A municipality-level analysis of the local growth impact of the Bolsa Familia Programme in the Brazilian Nordeste|This paper analyses the various impacts of Conditional social transfers (CCTs) on the structure of production and economic growth at municipal level. CCTs impacts on local productive structures have seldom been analysed, although they condition prospects of future economic growth and income generation. We first develop a simple illustrative demand multiplier model with two types of municipalities to illustrate that social transfers’ local growth impact may vary with the pattern of local productive structure change, some patterns eventually driving the formation of a redistribution trap for the least productive local economies which could well threaten the economic inclusion long-term outlook of the programme. By using an original dataset mixing up information on productive structures, growth determinants and Bolsa Familia (BFP) transfers for the 184 municipalities of the Brazilian state of Ceará between 2003 and 2010, we then find that although transfers had an overall positive effect on municipalities’ local economic growth, they also exerted a negative indirect growth impact by orienting local production toward services and informality. Although we could not find support for the hypothesis of a redistribution trap, since we find a positive effect of transfers on the development of transformation industries in municipalities with limited initial industrial capacities, our estimations indicate that, on average, the growth impact of the Bolsa Familia programme could have been two times bigger, absent the adverse impact of social transfers on structural transformation. In addition, we explain that, by promoting services and informal occupations, including in light manufacturing industries, the BFP might cause a possible problem of quality of jobs in the future if additional policies promoting local productive development are not associated to social transfers.
J46|Active labour market programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean: Evicence from a meta analysis|We present a systematic collection and assessment of impact evaluations of active labour market programmes (ALMP) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The paper delineates the strategy to compile a novel meta database and provides a narrative review of 51 studies. Based on these studies, the quantitative analysis extracts a sample of 296 impact estimates, and uses meta regression models to analyse systematic patterns in the data. In addition to analysing earnings and employment outcomes as in previous meta analyses, we also code and investigate measures of job quality, such as the effects on hours worked and formality. We find that ALMPs in LAC are particularly effective in increasing the probability of having a formal job, compared to other outcomes. Our results also show that training programmes are slightly more effective than other types of interventions. Moreover, when looking at the sample of training programmes alone, we observe that formal employment is also the outcome category that is most likely to be impacted positively by these programmes. In terms of targeting, we find that ALMPs in the region work better for women than for men, and for youth compared to prime-age workers. Finally, medium-run estimates are not more likely to be positive than short-run estimates, while programmes of short duration (4 months or less) are significantly less likely to produce positive effects compared to longer interventions.
J46|Eliciting Permanent and Transitory Undeclared Work from Matched Administrative and Survey Data|We study the undeclared work patterns of Hungarian employees in relatively stable jobs, using a panel dataset that matches individual-level self-reported Labour Force Survey data with administrative records of the Pension Directorate for 2001–2006. We estimate the determinants of undeclared work using Heckman-type random-effects panel probit models, and develop a two-regime model to separate permanent and transitory undeclared work, where the latter follows a Markov chain. We find that about 6-7 per cent of workers went permanently unreported for six consecutive years, and a further 4 per cent were transitorily unreported in any given year. The models show lower reporting rates – especially in the permanent segment – among males, high-school graduates, those in agriculture and transport, various forms of atypical employment, and small firms. Transitory non-reporting may be partly explained by administrative records missing for technical reasons. The results suggest that (i) the 'aggregate labour input method' widely used in Europe can indeed be a simple yet reliable tool to estimate the size of informal employment, although it slightly overestimates the true magnitude of black work (ii) the long-term pension consequences of undeclared work are substantial because of the high share of permanent non-reporting.

J46|Excluded Generation: The Growing Challenges of Labor Market Insertion for Egyptian Youth|Youth in Egypt hold rising aspirations for their adult lives, yet face an increasingly uncertain and protracted transition from school to work and thus into adulthood. This paper investigates how labor market insertion has been evolving over time in Egypt and how the nature of youth transitions relates to gender and social class. We demonstrate that youth today face poorer chances of transitioning into a good job than previous generations, despite large increases in educational attainment. Social class is playing an increasing role in determining the success of the transition from school to work in Egypt. Whether youth successfully make transitions to formal jobs, embark on such transitions and fail, or pursue a traditional route to adulthood depends on a complex and changing interaction between their own educational attainment and the resources of their families. In light of these findings, we discuss the policies that can help facilitate successful transitions for struggling youth in Egypt.
J46|Do payroll tax cuts boost formal jobs in developing countries?|Informal employment accounts for more than half of total employment in Latin America and the Caribbean, and an even higher percentage in Africa and South Asia. It is associated with lack of social insurance, low tax collection, and low productivity jobs. Lowering payroll taxes is a potential lever to increase formal employment and extend social insurance coverage among the labor force. However, the effects of tax cuts vary across countries, often resulting in large wage shifts but relatively small employment effects. Cutting payroll taxes requires levying other taxes to compensate for lost revenue, which may be difficult in developing economies.
J46|The impact of exports on income inequality in developing countries|Trade exhibits two contrasting effects on income inequality in developing countries (DCs). On the one hand, trade openness benefits unskilled labor in preference to skilled labor and capital (the Stolper–Samuelson effect). On the other hand, trade openness increases the demand for skilled (rather than unskilled) labor inputs (the skill premium effect). Recent studies that provide stronger support for the skill premium model have focused on wage inequality or have chosen higher-income DCs. We test the effect of export growth on income inequality for 70 lower income DCs and 36 higher-income DCs, using an unbalanced panel dataset for the 1971–2012 period. The results show that the export/GDP ratio has a negative effect on income inequality for lower-income DCs, but no significant effect was found for higher-income DCs.
J46|How Participating In The Shadow Economy Affects The Growth Of Latvian Firms|This paper examines the relationship between the growth of Latvian firms and their involvement in the shadow economy in 2015. When up to 10% of the overall economic activity of firms is in the shadow economy, this had a growth-enhancing effect on firms that recorded non-positive growth during the last five years. Using the perceptions of corruption and interview languages as instruments of measuring the shadow economy participation rate, the authors conclude that there is a positive relationship between perceptions of corruption and the shadow economy participation rate.
J46|Margins of Labor Market Adjustment to Trade|We use both longitudinal administrative data and cross-sectional household survey data to study the margins of labor market adjustment following Brazil's early 1990s trade liberalization. We document how workers and regional labor markets adjust to trade-induced changes in local labor demand, examining various adjustment margins, including earnings and wage changes; interregional migration; shifts between tradable and nontradable employment; and shifts between formal employment, informal employment, and non-employment. Our results provide insight into the regional labor market effects of trade, and have important implications for policies that address informal employment and that assist trade-displaced workers.

While the focus is mainly on developing countries, in part because we have more evidence in that context, the discussion draws parallels to the empirical evidence from developed countries. The paper also discusses perceptions about international trade in over 40 countries at different levels of development, including perceptions on trade's overall benefits for the economy, trade's effect on the livelihood of workers through wages and jobs, and trade's contribution to inequality. The paper concludes with a survey of evidence on several policies that could mitigate the adverse effects of import competition.
J46|The puzzles and contradictions of the Indian labour market: What will the future of work look like?|Analysing the Indian labour market poses inherent challenges given the country’s size and diversity. Rather than a case of “jobless growth”, India has experienced concentrated employment growth, mainly in urban areas and for men. Women’s participation in the labour force has declined. Some outcomes partly reflect India’s overall level of economic development. At the same time, structural transformation in other countries, including those in the region, has led to greater absorption of workers, particularly women, in manufacturing. Looking at the future of work, the current situation is likely to prevail in the near future, unless policy interventions inject a structural shift in trends. This means that workers will continue to leave agriculture and seek employment in urban areas. But the ability of the manufacturing sector to engage workers will be constrained by the capital and skill intensity of production, which will be further impacted by technological change. More wage employment will be created but the challenge is to ensure these workers have access to social security and other benefits. As women become better educated, their participation in the labour force is likely to increase but many constraints keep them out of paid employment.
J46| ¿Es la educación un mecanismo de salida hacia mejores ocupaciones para las trabajadoras del hogar?| Nuestro objetivo es analizar si la salida del trabajo del hogar remunerado lleva a mayores ingresos y/o mejores condiciones laborales. Asimismo, analizamos los determinantes de las transiciones laborales entre el empleo, el desempleo y la inactividad, así como entre diferentes ocupaciones. Para ello empleamos los datos de los paneles 2007 – 2011 y 2011 – 2015 de la ENAHO-INEI para el sector urbano. Luego del análisis estadístico y econométrico comprobamos que la salida del trabajo del hogar remunerado (THR) hacia otra ocupación está positivamente asociada a un aumento de los ingresos reales. Asimismo, el nivel de educación es un factor muy importante para salir del THR y para mantenerse en la fuerza laboral. En cuanto a las condiciones laborales, para lo cual empleamos el acceso a ESSALUD como proxy, encontramos que está positivamente asociada con una salida del THR hacia otra ocupación. Finalmente, vemos que si bien la educación tiene un efecto positivo sobre la probabilidad de salir de THR hacia otras ocupaciones, el efecto es mayor en la salida hacia el trabajo independiente, mientras que el efecto del acceso a ESSALUD será mayor en la salida hacia el trabajo obrero.

J46|Schooling, Skills, and Labor Market Outcomes in Africa: Evidence from Ghana and Kenya|Researchers have shown that there is a mutually reinforcing interaction between cognitive and socioemotional skills, and this combination explains the success in various aspects of life, such as employment, wage, and health status. This paper aims at understanding the interactions between cognitive skills and socioemotional skills in Africa. It also assesses the association of these skills with labor market outcomes, with a special focus on women and youth. To provide fine policy directions to inform decision-making and future research, this paper incorporates more relevant employment status in African labor market, such as high-skills occupation and education-job mismatch.
J46|Labor markets and informality: the case of Central Asia|Central Asian “stans”– Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan – jointly have 31.4 million people in the labor force (See table 1). The largest labor share belongs to Uzbekistan (13.6 million) and the smallest number live in Turkmenistan (2.3 million). Labor force participation rates in these economies, as a legacy of Soviet period, are high and, in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, at comparable level with advanced economies like South Korea. In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan labor force participation rates are even higher than in other economies.
J46|Spatially Heterogeneous Effects of a Public Works Program|Most research on labor market effects of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme focuses on outcomes at the district level. This paper shows that such a focus masks substantial spatial heterogeneity: treated villages located near untreated areas see smaller increases in casual wages than treated villages located farther from untreated areas. I argue that worker mobility, rather than spatial differences in implementation or program leakages, drives this spatial heterogeneity. I also present evidence that the effects of the program on private-sector employment display similar intra-district heterogeneity. Finally, by exploiting the difference in wage changes over space, I show that a large portion of consumption increases are driven by wage increases, not program employment. Overall, these results suggest that a district-level focus underestimates the true effect of the program on wages and also support the argument that increasing rural wages is an effective poverty-fighting tool in developing countries.
J46|Living on the Margins of Development: Domestic Women Workers|In India, workers in the informal sector are considered to be vulnerable and marginalised. Benefits of economic growth rarely reach to this segment of the society and they are also excluded from benefits of physical and social infrastructure expansion. This is particularly true for women. Women are constantly engaged in the household activities which are often unacknowledged and unquantified. This unparallel contribution of women towards social reproduction of class has remained unpaid. Now that more and more women have started to take up employment outside the house, they are not able to perform household activities. The domestic helps have replaced them for performing household work and are being paid for it. The household work which was earlier unpaid has been quantified to some extent as payment is made to the domestic workers for such work. This paper discusses the unaccounted and invisible contribution of women domestic workers in our country. Women domestic workers are not recognized as workers and their work is undervalued. Home of the employer is the workplace for the domestic workers and this unique feature makes them vulnerable to abuses, exploitation and acute working conditions. But, these workers themselves are left on the margins of the development matrix. Stuck between bad working conditions and expectations of subservient loyalty, the Indian domestic worker has to cope with the worst aspects of both feudalism and capitalism. This has led to a slew of new challenges for social justice that needs urgent consideration of the law makers and social scientists, given our national objective of inclusive growth. There is a common reluctance, in India, to accept the home as a work place. This is the prime reason for the low priority attached to labour rights and welfare in the current policy paradigm. The official data is unreliable and grossly inadequate as domestic work is notoriously under enumerated. The paper concludes by emphasising that the regulation and formalization of the domestic employment relationship is in the interests of both workers and employers. The government needs to draw its attention to the urgent need of provision of skill development, written contracts, regulatory body and regular inspections for the domestic workers. With the basic elements of protection, the government can assure them a minimum standard of living, compatible with self-respect and dignity which is essential to social justice.
J46|Microeconomics Foundations of Entrepreneurial Performance in the Informal Sector: A Case Study of Cameroon|This study aim is to identify, according to microeconomic approach, the determinants of the performance of individual entrepreneurs in the informal sector in Cameroon, through their units performance. Using the Second Survey in the Informal sector and Employment (SSIE) collected in 2010 in Cameroon, we made two regressions of a profit function of an entrepreneur with the method of multiple regressions after a statistic analysis of some characteristics that influence entrepreneur performance in the informal activities. After this analysis, some lessons emerge. First, there are significant gaps in the income generated by informal activities. Then, the impact of factors that can improve the performance of entrepreneurs varies widely depending on the measurement used to capture their performance (sales or income). Finally, individual factors such as education level, seniority, specific experience in entrepreneurship and the time spent on the job significantly increase the performance of informal entrepreneurs. Similarly, the factors of the firm (sector of activity, level of capital, number of permanent employees) exception due to the age of the firm, also significantly improve the performance of informal entrepreneurs better than the individual factors (27% against 15%). However, the main factor that reduce their performance are the economic environment (difficulties in accessing to infrastructure and finance). This could be explained by the fact that, operating in the informal sector, reduce access to financial services and public infrastructures. Several recommendations can be made in line with the improvement of informal entrepreneurship and access to financial services, in order to build strong entrepreneurship in developing countries.
J46|Transitions between informal and formal employment: results from a worker survey in Bangladesh|Abstract We study transitions between different types of formal and informal employment using retrospective job histories from a new survey in Bangladesh. Workers transitioning between jobs are most likely to remain in the same type of employment, although there is still substantial churn across employment types. Private wage employees have higher probability of transitioning to a new job, and changes in earnings and benefits suggest evidence of upward mobility. Nevertheless, there is also non-trivial risk of downward mobility, especially for those transitioning into casual employment, which has the lowest level of earnings and benefits and the highest levels of exposure to workplace hazards and violence. Overall, the informal sector appears to include subpopulations consistent with both the traditional view that it is a segmented portion of the labor market with few prospects of upward mobility, and with the alternative view that it is a dynamic, entrepreneurial alternative to wage employment.
J46|What Determines Labour Movement from Turkey to Europe? Extent of the Situation and Implications|There are several different issues affecting migration on the global scale, which are commonly interconnected. These include work migration, lifestyle migration, ecological migration, workers’ wages abroad, transit migration, irregular global migration, forced and forced humanitarian migration, human trafficking, refugees, and the safety of displaced populations. This study analyzes causation and consequences of Turkish workforce migration. Social and cultural discourse analysis have used in the study. It is preferable to investigate the macroeconomic factors of each country, in order to assess the economic implications of immigration. The present study looks at immigration from an economic, as well as a cultural and social point of view. Apparently, immigration policies are unable to achieve their prespecified demographic targets, at least under most circumstances, because controlling the synthesis and volume of net migration poses a remarkable challenge. Apart from the economic crisis, certain factors that are unique to Turkey lately, such as social-legislative problems and unemployment, push large segments of the population to migrate to other countries, raising the fraction of immigration therefore. Demographic circumstances and effects of relevant policies work in tandem, and their combined influence alters the volume and makeup of the workforce in complex ways. Moreover, any undertaking to pinpoint the needs of the future work market in a decisive way, regarding immigration, and to optimize immigration strategies, appears to have modest results as well.
J46|Unintended Consequences of Unemployment Insurance: Evidence from Stricter Eligibility Criteria in Brazil|This paper investigates the impact of changes in the eligibility criteria of unemploy- ment benefits (UI) on layoffs in Brazil. We exploit exogenous variation introduced by a reform in the UI system in 2015. Our difference-in-differences estimates show that UI accounts for 11 − 13% of the average dismissal rates of eligible workers. Our results are consistent with workers having the incentive to strategically induce their dismissals in order to collect UI benefits.
J46|Unemployment insurance, job mobility and formalization: an analysis of the Brazilian case|In order to assess the recent rise in the fiscal expenses due to unemployment insurance (UI) in Brazil, we build a simple matching model that takes into account the growing formalization rate, job mobility and other institutional characteristics of the country’s labor market. Our results indicate that around 77% of the positive variation in the UI expenses is due to an increase in the formalization rate, while 22% is due to a rise in the job mobility between 2000-2014.
J46|Quality of Work Life in Colombia: A Multidimensional Fuzzy Indicator|Abstract Quality of work (QoW) encompasses multiple objective and subjective dimensions, which may include labor income, job stability, job satisfaction, and social security. This paper follows the method proposed by Gómez-Salcedo et al. (2013) that introduces a new way of measuring QoW, which consists of (1) the use of Sen’s functioning and capabilities approach and (2) a fuzzy sets method to define membership to the sets of good job quality. Using the Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares, we obtain results at the national level about age, gender, educational level, firm size, and industry sector. The results are consistent with previous literature. One topic that is highlighted from our results is the existence of a “Quality of Work Life Cycle”, with higher levels of the index up to age 30, that may have critical implications for the social security system; people with lower quality jobs may not be contributing to health and pension funds, leaving many people without access to a retirement fund and implying more demands on the subsidized system to cover health expenses.
J46|The impact of Syrian refugees on natives’ labor market outcomes in Turkey: evidence from a quasi-experimental design|Abstract Civil conflict in Syria, started in March 2011, led to a massive wave of forced immigration from Northern Syria to the Southeastern regions of Turkey, which later had serious economic/political repercussions on the MENA region and most of Europe. This paper exploits this natural experiment to estimate the impact of Syrian refugees on the labor market outcomes of natives in Turkey. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that immigration has considerably affected the employment outcomes of natives, while its impact on wage outcomes has been negligible. We document notable employment losses among informal workers as a consequence of refugee inflows. Formal employment increased slightly potentially due to increased social services in the region. The majority of those who lost their informal jobs have either left the labor force or remained unemployed. Formal employment and unemployment rates have increased, while labor force participation, informal employment, and job finding rates have declined among natives. Disadvantaged groups, i.e., women, younger workers, and less-educated workers, have been affected the worst. The prevalence of informal employment in the Turkish labor markets has amplified the negative impact of Syrian refugee inflows on natives’ labor market outcomes. Overall, the impact of Syrian refugee inflows on the Turkish labor markets has been limited, which suggests that the potential costs on the European and other affected labor markets might also be limited.
J46|Aggregation With Sequential Indivisible And Continuous Labor Supply Decisions And An Informal Sector|The purpose of this paper is to explore the problem of non convex labor supply decision in an economy with both discrete and continuous labor decisions In contrast to the setup in Vasilev 2016a here each household faces a sequential labor market choice an indivisible labor supply choice in the market sector and conditional on non working in the official sector a divisible hours choice in the informal sector We show how lotteries as in Rogerson 1988 can again be used to convexify consumption sets and aggregate over individual preferences With a mix of sequential discrete and continuous labor supply decisions aggregate disutility of non market work becomes separable from market work and the elasticity of the latter increases from unity to infinity
J46|Aggregation with sequential indivisible and continuous labor supply decisions and an informal sector|The purpose of this paper is to explore the problem of non-convex labor supply decision in an economy with both discrete and continuous labor decisions. In contrast to the setup in Vasilev (2016a), here each household faces a sequential labor market choice - an indivisible labor supply choice in the market sector, and conditional on non-working in the official sector, a divisible hours choice in the informal sector. We show how lotteries as in Rogerson (1988) can again be used to convexify consumption sets, and aggregate over individual preferences. With a mix of sequential discrete and continuous labor supply decisions, aggregate disutility of non-market work becomes separable from market work, and the elasticity of the latter increases from unity to infinity.
J46|Insurance-markets Equilibrium with Sequential Non-convex Market-Sector- and Divisible Informal-Sector Labor Supply|This paper describes the lottery- and insurance-market equilibrium in an economy with non-convex market-sector employment and informal sector work. In contrast to Vasilev (2016a), the discrete-continuous labor supply decision in this paper is a sequential one, and instead of home production, we focus on informal activity. The presence of non- convexity requires that an insurance market for market-sector employment be put in operation to achieve market completeness. In addition, given that the labor choice for market work and informal-sector hours is made in succession, the insurance market for market employment needs to close before the labor supply choice in the grey economy is made. This timing is reminiscent of the results obtained in Vasilev (2016b) and also a direct consequence of the sequential nature of the discrete-continuous sectoral labor supply decision.
J46|Excluded Generation: The Growing Challenges of Labor Market Insertion for Egyptian Youth|Youth in Egypt hold rising aspirations for their adult lives, yet face an increasingly uncertain and protracted transition from school to work and thus into adulthood. This paper investigates how labor market insertion has been evolving over time in Egypt and how the nature of youth transitions relates to gender and social class. We demonstrate that youth today face poorer chances of transitioning into a good job than previous generations, despite large increases in educational attainment. Social class is playing an increasing role in determining the success of the transition from school to work in Egypt. Whether youth successfully make transitions to formal jobs, embark on such transitions and fail, or pursue a traditional route to adulthood depends on a complex and changing interaction between their own educational attainment and the resources of their families. In light of these findings, we discuss the policies that can help facilitate successful transitions for struggling youth in Egypt.
J46|Who Is Covered and Who Underreports: An Empirical Analysis of Access to Social Insurance on the Egyptian Labor Market|This paper investigates the dynamics and determinants of having access to social insurance coverage on the Egyptian labor market among wage and non-wage workers. The paper explores two issues: the worker- and enterprise- level determinants of having access to social insurance and the risk of underreporting insurable wage to the social security authority. Using data from the Egyptian Labor Market Panel Survey for 1998 and 2006, the likelihood of having access to social insurance coverage is estimated by a probit regression model for all workers, for wage and non-wage workers, separately. Given the potential endogeneity between the type of work and social insurance access, instrumental variable technique is applied. Results show that men, older, married, better educated and white collar highly skilled workers are more likely to be socially insured. Underreporting insurable wages is negatively correlated with education and work experience. High contribution rates requested from both the employer and employee, combined with basing benefits on wages level of the last few years of service, and the weak capacity of law enforcement encourage employers and employees to either not participate in the social insurance system or contribute on amounts that are lower than their actual wage. The paper is one of the few studies that focus on the phenomenon of coverage gap and underreporting salaries to the social security administration.
J46|The employment impact of microcredit program participation in Bangladesh: Evidence from a longitudinal household survey|•Microcredit program has a proven record of self-employment and income generation.•It contributes 245 hours (equivalent to 7 weeks) per person in self-employment.•The effect of microcredit program is more discernible on household labor income.•Participant households earn 9.4% higher labor income than non-participants.•Microcredit contributes to greater equality in household income.
J46|The Impact of Early Marriage on Women’s Employment in the Middle East and North Africa|Marriage is a central stage in the transition to adulthood in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). This paper builds on the existing literature on the effect of marriage on women’s employment in MENA. Besides examining how different types of work are affected by early marriage (defined as marriage by the median age of marriage) in a multivariate setting, the contribution of this paper is to endogenize the marriage decision using an instrumental variable approach. We find that marriage by the median age reduces the probability of working for women by 47 percent in Jordan, 33 percent in Tunisia and 16 percent in Egypt. Much of the effect is due to a reduction in the probability of private wage work, which is reduced by 76 percent in Jordan, 57 percent in Tunisia and 40 percent in Egypt. Differences emerge across the three countries in the extent to which self-employment after marriage is available to women to compensate for the reduction in wage employment opportunities.
J46|Active Labour Market Programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean: Evidence from a Meta Analysis|We present a systematic collection and assessment of impact evaluations of active labour market programmes (ALMP) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The paper delineates the strategy to compile a novel meta database and provides a narrative review of 51 studies. Based on these studies, the quantitative analysis extracts a sample of 296 impact estimates, and uses meta regression models to analyse systematic patterns in the data. In addition to analysing earnings and employment outcomes as in previous meta analyses, we also code and investigate measures of job quality, such as the effects on hours worked and formality. We find that ALMPs in LAC are particularly effective in increasing the probability of having a formal job, compared to other outcomes. Our results also show that training programmes are slightly more effective than other types of interventions. Moreover, when looking at the sample of training programmes alone, we observe that formal employment is also the outcome category that is most likely to be impacted positively by these programmes. In terms of targeting, we find that ALMPs in the region work better for women than for men, and for youth compared to prime-age workers. Finally, medium-run estimates are not more likely to be positive than short-run estimates, while programmes of short duration (4 months or less) are significantly less likely to produce positive effects compared to longer interventions.
J46|Ñ - Niños trabajadores|Resumen de la situación de trabajo infantil en Bolivia, 2008 - 2012
J46|Childhood Environment and Gender Gaps in Adulthood|We show that differences in childhood environments shape gender gaps in adulthood by documenting three facts using population tax records for children born in the 1980s. First, gender gaps in employment rates, earnings, and college attendance vary substantially across the parental income distribution. Notably, the traditional gender gap in employment rates is reversed for children growing up in poor families: boys in families in the bottom quintile of the income distribution are less likely to work than girls. Second, these gender gaps vary substantially across counties and commuting zones in which children grow up. The degree of variation in outcomes across places is largest for boys growing up in poor, single-parent families. Third, the spatial variation in gender gaps is highly correlated with proxies for neighborhood disadvantage. Low-income boys who grow up in high-poverty, high-minority areas work significantly less than girls. These areas also have higher rates of crime, suggesting that boys growing up in concentrated poverty substitute from formal employment to crime. Together, these findings demonstrate that gender gaps in adulthood have roots in childhood, perhaps because childhood disadvantage is especially harmful for boys.
J46|The Economic Impact of Syrian Refugees on Host Countries: Quasi-experimental Evidence from Turkey|The Syrian Conflict generated forced immigration from northern Syria to southeastern Turkey. Arrival of refugees resembles a natural experiment, which offers good opportunities to study the economic impact of immigration. I study three main outcomes: labor markets, consumer prices, and housing rents. I document moderate employment losses among native informal workers, which suggests that they are partly substituted by refugees. Prices of the items produced in informal labor intensive sectors declined due to labor cost advantages generated by refugee inflows. Finally, refugee inflows increased the rents of higher quality housing units, while there is no effect on lower quality units.
J46|Determinants of Land and Labour Market Participation Decisions in Rural Ethiopia|This paper attempts to determine the factors influencing farmers' land and labour market participation decisions in rural Ethiopia. A multivariate probit estimation technique is used to account for potential interdependencies between land and labour allocation strategies. Results suggest that households that are better endowed with farming resources such as oxen and farming skills are more likely to get access to more land and labour through factor markets, while households that are less endowed with these resources are more likely to rent out their land and participate in off-farm jobs. The complementary nature of land renting out and involvement in off-farm work suggests that policy makers should give due consideration to the development of rural off-farm jobs to reduce poverty in rural areas.
J46|Informality in the Process of Development and Growth|“Informality” is a term used to describe the collection of firms, workers, and activities that operate outside the legal and regulatory systems. It is widespread in the majority of developing countries—in a typical developing economy, the informal sector produces about 35 percent of gross domestic product and employs 70 percent of the labor force. This paper studies informality in the context of economic development by presenting a model and projections that link informality, regulations, migration, and economic growth. This analytical framework highlights the trade-offs between formality and informality, the relationship between the different types of informality, and the connection between them and the forces of labor, capital, and productivity growth. The paper models the behavior of the informal sector based on the following fundamental asymmetry: formal firms confront higher labor costs while informal firms face higher capital costs and lower productivity. Using mandated minimum wages as the policy-induced distortion, the model first studies the static allocation of formal and informal capital and labor in a modern economy. Second, it opens the possibility of labor migration from a rudimentary economy with an ample supply of labor (rural areas or less advanced neighboring countries). Third, the model analyzes the dynamic behavior of the formal and informal sectors, considering how they affect and are affected by economic growth and labor migration. Then, the paper presents projections for the size of labor informality, in the modern and rudimentary economies, in the next two decades for a large group of countries representing all regions of the world. The projections are based on the calibration and simulation of the model and serve to discuss its usefulness and limitations.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J46|Características y determinantes de la informalidad laboral en México|Desde el año 2012 el Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía de México (INEGI), adoptó el enfoque de informalidad laboral y lo integró a mediciones realizadas con información captada por la Encuesta Nacional de Ocupación y Empleo (ENOE). En este documento se estudian las características individuales de los trabajadores informales bajo el enfoque de informalidad laboral citado. Entre estas características se incluyeron el género (sexo) del trabajador, edad, escolaridad y ubicación geográfica según nivel de marginación de la entidad federativa en donde labora. Se encontró que la informalidad laboral está asociada a condiciones de alta vulnerabilidad o precarización socio demográfica del trabajador, tales como: baja o nula escolaridad, alta marginación, mujeres en general, sobre todo aquellas con hijos pequeños, jóvenes en general y su extremo, los mayores de 65 años. Se mostró además que la informalidad laboral funge como mecanismo para mantener bajas las tasas de desocupación, por lo que se presenta una especie de trade-off –sobre todo en épocas de crisis- entre esas dos alternativas de participación. Se utilizaron métodos econométricos (análisis probit) con microdatos de la ENOE de 2015.
J46|Una evaluación del efecto scarring en Argentina|En este estudio se evalúa el efecto de corto plazo del tránsito por el desempleo sobre los salarios y la inserción laboral posterior. El llamado efecto scarring no ha sido estudiado previamente en América Latina y en específico en Argentina. Utilizando el esquema rotativo de la muestra de la Encuesta de Hogares se estima la magnitud de la penalidad salarial, y del incremento en la probabilidad de transitar hacia la informalidad, luego del paso por el desempleo. Se utilizan dos estrategias de estimación: por un lado, el modelo lineal para datos de panel con efectos fijos y aleatorios; por otro, el estimador de diferencias en diferencias con propensity score matching. Se muestra que el paso por el desempleo eleva en el corto plazo la probabilidad de alcanzar un puesto informal, pero que no es significativa su influencia sobre las remuneraciones, una vez que se controla por el tipo de ocupaciones.
J46|Política social contemporánea. Un paradigma en crisis|Este trabajo consta de dos partes. En la primera se hace una crítica a la política social contemporánea, la cual tiene dos ejes: Lucha contra la pobreza y aseguramiento. El discurso afirma que gasto social se debe dirigir hacia los más pobres y que la mejor forma de ayudarlos consiste en dotarlos de activos para se puedan insertar al mercado y disfrutar de los beneficios del crecimiento económico. Ello se debe combinar con el manejo social del riesgo, permitiendo que los individuos puedan administrar sus seguros a través del mercado. La crítica a dicha política se basa en que promueve el individualismo y la ciudadanía invertida: Se hace necesario ser un fracasado social para acceder a prestaciones sociales gratuitas. En la segunda parte de este trabajo, se afirma que es necesario redefinir el sujeto social de la política social. No es el pobre ni el trabajador asalariado. Dicho trabajador hoy no representa al trabajador contemporáneo, ese trabajador está en la Economía Popular urbana. ****** This work is based in two parts. In first place it's formulated a critique of contemporary social policy, which has two axes: The fight against poverty and insurance. The discourse states that social spending should be directed towards the poorest and the best way to help is to provide them with assets so that they can be inserted to the market and enjoy the benefits of economic growth. This must be combined with social risk management, allowing individuals to manage their insurance through the market. This policy promotes individualism and citizenship inverted: It is necessary to be a social failed to access free social benefits. In the second part of this paper, it is stated that it's necessary to redefine the social subject of social policy. It's no more the poor or salaried worker. This worker today does not represent the contemporary worker, which is inserted in the Urban Popular Economy.
J46|Un análisis de los determinantes de la calidad del empleo en las medianas y grandes empresas y en el sector público de Argentina|Este documento tiene por objetivo analizar, durante 1995-2014, la interrelación entre la calidad del empleo en el mercado de trabajo de las medianas y grandes empresas y del sector público (MGEySP) y las variables macroeconómicas, laborales e institucionales que la literatura considera como sus principales factores determinantes. Para ello se utiliza la Encuesta Permanente de Hogares que permite seguir a 50 cohortes de individuos y se implementa el método de VAR. Los resultados obtenidos son consistentes con la hipótesis de segmentación. La tasa de informalidad laboral se mueve en forma contraria al ciclo económico mientras que la tasa de empleos de calidad es procíclica. También se aprecia una relación positiva entre el índice de apertura comercial y la tasa de empleos de calidad y negativa con la tasa de informalidad laboral. Pero los costes de contratación y las instituciones laborales incrementan los empleos informales y reducen las ocupaciones de mayor calidad.
J46|Discrimination in a Search-Match Model with Self-Employment|In this paper, we build a search-match model to help explain differences in the outcomes of women and men in urban African labour markets. First, we use longitudinal data from a panel collected in four of Ghana's largest cities to establish a set of stylised facts relating to the size of different sectors in the economy, the earnings gaps that persist within those sectors, and transitions between different jobs. We then construct a model, which allows for individual heterogeneity and participation in both self- and wage-employment, as well as discrimination against female workers in the wage sector. By numerically solving and simulating this model, we show that wage sector discrimination leads to average earnings gaps in all sectors of the economy, even if the underlying ability distribution is the same for both sexes. This result arises because discrimination creates extra frictions for women, making it harder for them to select jobs according to comparative advantage. We also conduct a series of experiments to examine how women and men may be affected differently by government policy, and consider the robustness of our results to alternative assumptions about individual heterogeneity.
J46|Job Flexibility and Occupational Selection: An Application of Maximum Simulated Likelihood Using Data from Ghana|"In many African labour markets, the vast majority of self-employed workers are female. It is often hypothesised that this is because self-employment enables workers to balance income-generation with caring for children and other domestic tasks and, since responsibility for these activities is divided unequally in the household, this effect is stronger for women than men. However, testing whether 'job flexibility' matters is difficult because variables that proxy for domestic obligations | such as the number of dependents in the household | may be endogenous to occupational choice. In this paper, we build a new estimator using maximum simulated likelihood, which allows us to couch the idea that selection on observables can be used as a guide to selection on unobservables within the multinomial choice problem individuals face when they select their occupations. We test this approach using detailed cross-sectional data from Ghana. Our results show that having extra dependents in the household pushes women towards low-input self-employment substantially more than men."
J46|Vulnerability In Employment: Evidence from South Africa|This paper sets out to update the impression of vulnerability in the labour market, by examining how low pay and informality interact with each other, and with poverty. Throughout, we try to include comparative results from within the sub-Saharan Africa and Latin American regions. What becomes clear is that a job alone is not a solution to poverty in South Africa. And informality in South Africa plays an important role as a buffer to unemployment in contrast to the higher levels of voluntary informality in Latin America.
J46|Perú, 2002-2012: crecimiento, cambio estructural y formalización|Cambiando drásticamente de tendencia, se ha observado un proceso de formalización laboral en el Perú, en un contexto de crecimiento económico, durante el cual también se impulsó una reforma laboral que creó un régimen especial para micro y pequeñas empresas —lo que redujo los costos laborales— y se introdujeron mejoras en la inspección del trabajo. Mediante un panel de regiones subnacionales se analiza el papel cumplido por estos factores en el proceso de formalización. En primer lugar, se confirma que la composición del crecimiento importa para la formalización. Al analizar de manera conjunta los factores económicos (crecimiento y crecimiento sectorial) y los cambios institucionales recientes, se encuentra que —en el período analizado— dichos factores explican la mayor parte del proceso de formalización y que el crecimiento de los sectores intensivos en empleo agrega poder explicativo, mientras que los cambios institucionales no incidieron significativamente a pesar de su magnitud.
J46|Peru, 2002-2012: growth, structural change and formalization|In a dramatic change of trend, labour formalization took place in Peru in the period covered by this study. The context was one of economic growth accompanied by a labour market reform that created a special regime for micro and small enterprises, thereby reducing employment costs, and introduced improvements in workplace inspections. A panel of subnational regions is used to analyse the role played by these factors in the formalization process. In the first place, this study confirms that the composition of growth matters to formalization. A combined analysis of economic factors (growth and sectoral growth) and recent institutional changes shows that the former accounted for the bulk of formalization in the period analysed and that growth in labour-intensive sectors adds explanatory power, while the institutional changes, far-reaching though they were, did not have a significant effect.
J46|University prestige, performance evaluation, and promotion: Estimating the employer learning model using personnel datasets|Employers rely on educational credentials to form their initial belief about a worker's ability and update the belief by observing the worker's performance on the job. We study the careers of white-collar university graduates, using personnel data from two large Japanese manufacturers. These data contain information about the university from which the worker graduated, as well as the worker's performance evaluations and positions in the promotion ladder. As employees move up the career ladder, performance evaluations become a more important determinant for promotion than educational credentials. Structural estimates suggest that employers learn workers' ability quickly through observing their performance on the job, with expectation errors halving after about 3 to 6years.
J46|¿Más escolaridad, menos informalidad? Un análisis de cohortes para México y América Latina|What is the relation between schooling progress and informal employment? Using household surveys from Mexico and 17 other Latin American countries, we separate the trend in the rate of informal employment into three effects: i) differences in years of education of successive generations of workers; ii) transitions between formality and informality during the working life of each generation; and iii) labor market characteristics. We find that in Latin America there has been a slight reduction in labor informality, associated mainly with the first effect: recent generations of workers with more schooling have lower informality rates than previous ones. In the case of Mexico we also observe that younger generations of workers have more years of schooling than previous ones; however, this has not translated into lower informal employment due to adverse labor market characteristics. Thus, even though Mexico has experienced faster educational progress than the average of the region, its progress in reducing informality has been nil.// ¿Cuál es la relación entre escolaridad e informalidad laboral? Con las encuestas de hogares de México y otros 17 países de América Latina, separamos la evolución de la tasa de informalidad laboral en tres efectos: i) diferencias en los años de escolaridad de sucesivas generaciones de trabajadores, ii) tránsitos entre formalidad e informalidad durante el ciclo de vida laboral de cada generación, y iii) características del mercado de trabajo. Encontramos que en América Latina se ha observado una ligera reducción de la informalidad, asociada fundamentalmente al primer efecto: generaciones más recientes de trabajadores con más escolaridad experimentan menores tasas de informalidad que las anteriores. En el caso de México, también observamos que generaciones más recientes de trabajadores tienen más años de escolaridad que las previas; sin embargo, este efecto ha sido contrarrestado por el mercado laboral. Así, a pesar de que en México se han observado mayores avances en años de escolaridad que en el promedio de América Latina, el progreso para reducir la informalidad laboral ha sido nulo.
J46|Informal Labour Markets in Pakistan|This paper describes the results of a survey of informal-sector firms in Pakistan. Firms belong to the informal sector mainly because of scarce financial resources. There are significant differences in the level of wages and the flexibility of wages with the informal sector having both lower wages and greater flexibility than the formal sector. While minimum wages are less binding in the informal sector, indexation of wages to inflation is more common. In spite of these differences the reasons for not cutting wages in a recession are similar between the two sectors.
J46|Who counts as employed?: informal work, employment status, and labor market slack|Several recent studies find that as of 2015, a significant share of working-age adults in the United States participates in nonstandard work arrangements. Such arrangements tend to lack long-term employment contracts and are often referred to as “gig economy” jobs. This paper investigates the implications of nonstandard or “informal” work for the measurement of employment status and labor market slack. Using original survey data, we find that as of 2015 roughly 37 percent of nonretired U.S. adults participated in some type of informal work, and roughly 20 percent participated in informal income-generating activities that did not exclusively involve renting out their own property or selling their own goods. The survey also elicits an individual’s employment status according to the definitions of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). While not the majority, a significant share of those who engage in informal work are classified as not being in the labor force; if all informal workers were counted as employed, the U.S. labor force participation rate (as of 2015) would have been 2 percentage points higher. In addition, individuals who are classified as working “part-time for economic reasons”—those who would like a full-time job but cannot obtain full-time hours—have the highest participation rate in informal work and the highest average hours per month. This latter finding suggests that informal work embodies labor market slack, and we offer several pieces of evidence that support the thesis that workers engage in informal work as a way to compensate for weak labor demand and may therefore drop informal work as formal labor market conditions improve. To estimate the amount of labor market slack embodied in informal work, we convert the total hours of informal work performed by those classified as employed part-time into a number of full-time job equivalents. This exercise yields a figure that ranges from roughly 275,000 to roughly 400,000, depending on the specifics of the calculation. At the same time, we point out that a significant share of informal work hours offer higher wages than what the same individuals earn in their formal jobs. Therefore, formal wages may need to increase by a relatively large margin moving forward in order to attract additional labor into the formal sector.
J46|How To Define And Measure Informal Employment In Developed Countries? A Case Of Poland|The main aim of this article is to point out the possible measures of how to improve the study of informal employment in developed countries. We choose the case of Poland to examine whether the existing definitions and measurement methods are suitable for indicating the prevalence of informal employment. Firstly, we present the most popular definitions of informal employment, secondly we show the existing research on informal employment in Poland, and thirdly we assess the previous estimations of informal employment in Poland with regard to the definition’s scope. Finally, we propose some improvements that would help in studying this phenomenon in Poland. Through a critical analysis of existing research on informal employment we contribute to the existing literature in two ways: (i) by constructing the definitional frames of informal employment in Poland; and (ii) by pointing out the possible extensions of surveys devoted to informal employment in developed countries.
J46|Sex Work Vs. Sexual Exploitation: Assessing Guesstimates For Prostitution In The European Union|Prostitution regimes in the EU-28 include prohibition, regulation and abolition; economics literature tackles this typology from the perspective of both free sex work and forced labour trafficking. We review the data sources on the demand-side and the supply-side in order to gauge how large is the sex market and informal employment for sex workers. We calculate Estimates 1A and 1B from miscellaneous sources, whereas HIV prevalence among sex workers from World Health Organisation provides Estimates 2A and 2B. We calculate Estimate 3 from victims of sexual exploitation trafficking according to data collected by the UNODC and Eurostat. We design an OLS model to test the five Estimates of prostitution in EU-28 according to GDP per capita, legislation, supply-side and demand-side variables. Last, we assess which might be the most likely Estimates as regards GDP enhancement in 2010, with respect to National Accounts adjustment for illegal production and consumption expenditure. Hence, we come up with a lower bound Estimate that may be used as a benchmark for macroeconomic policy.
J46|Eliciting permanent and transitory undeclared work from matched administrative and survey data|We study the undeclared work patterns of Hungarian employees in relatively stable jobs, using a panel dataset that matches individual-level self-reported Labour Force Survey (LFS) data with administrative data from the Pension Directorate for 2001–2006. We estimate the determinants of undeclared work using Heckman-type random-effects panel probit models, and develop a two-regime model to separate permanent and transitory undeclared work, where the latter follows a Markov chain. We find that about 6 per cent of workers went permanently unreported for six consecutive years, and a further 3-4 per cent were transitorily unreported in any given year. By simulating the permanent and transitory components of undeclared work, we examine the implications for health and pension eligibility.
J46|Deconstructing Informality: A Response to Vulnerability or an Optimal Choice?|The rapid growth of informal employment in China in recent decades has attracted attention, but to understand its implications, the concept of informality must be deconstructed. We reclassify employment status into three categories: salaried workers who have long-term contracts; the self-employed; and causal workers without long term contracts (working in either the formal or the informal sector). The monthly earnings of the self-employed are much (47%) higher than those casual employees. Self-employment is not necessarily a misfortune and the flexibility it provides may be optimal for some kinds of workers. For example, the self-employed are more likely to be disabled and to have young families. Institutionally, it is still difficult for casual workers and most rural-urban migrant workers to embark on business ownership. Although a large group of rural-urban migrants are employees with longer term contracts, their rural registration (hukou) means they lack the social protection of urban residents. The labour force with rural hukou is more likely to fall into the informal sector and, within that sector, is most likely to be engaged in casual labouring jobs. Policies to support small businesses may be warranted given the detrimental impacts of informality on casual workers. Experimental interventions could be tried along the lines of those used in Peru to provide funds to support entrepreneurial activities by this group to lift themselves out of a poverty trap into more sustainable employment. Skill training, encouragement for innovation, tax credits and reducing institutional constraints on starting up small business should be all considered.
J46|Informal Employment in China: Trends, Patterns and Determinants of Entry|We empirically deconstruct informal employment in China into private business owners and casual workers without job contracts. Survey data from 2007 and 2013 document a rise in informal employment to the point where it exceeds formal employment, potentially an unintended consequence of the 2008 New Labour Contract Law. Compared with formal employees and business owners, casual workers report the lowest monetary and subjective wellbeing although business owners work longer hours with less social protection. Descriptive statistics and multivariate modelling reveal formal employees tend to have more favoured characteristics, often being educated, male, healthy and able bodied. Casual workers are more likely to have the characteristics of vulnerable groups, so the growth of casual employment is particularly concerning. There are indications that running small business is not always a sign of vulnerability and it may provide job flexibility for those with dependents to care for.
J46|Remittances and Informal Work|This paper studies the effects of remittances on informal employment in the migrants' countries of origin, looking both at the remittance-receiving and non-migrant households. Using data from the Social Exclusion Survey, conducted in six transition economies in 2009, I find that receiving remittances increases the likelihood of working informally. At the regional level, high prevalence of remittances is associated with a higher likelihood of informal work among non-migrant households. Migration and remittances may thus be contributing to informal employment in migration-sending countries.
J46|Does crime deter South Africans from self-employment?|The very high crime rate in South African cities is often argued to be the main reason for the country's small share of business ownership and self-employment. This paper revisits this hypothesis. We estimate the effect of crime on business ownership and performance using a matched dataset of census, survey and police data. In contrast to previous studies, which take into account perceived rather than actual crime and often focus on specific geographic areas, we do not find robust evidence that high crime rates have a negative impact on business ownership. Even though our estimate of the effect of crime is statistically significant and negative, it is economically small. Further, we find no evidence for a negative effect of actual crime on sales, profits and investment of informal businesses. This may imply that the low share of business ownership and self-employment in South Africa must have other reasons. These results may also suggest that crime may not be in general a serious threat for small businesses in low and middle-income countries, however, this needs further empirical research.
J46|The 'Informality Gap': Can Education Help Minorities Escape Informal Employment? Evidence from Peru|"Discrimination in formal labor markets can push discriminated groups into labor informality, where wages are lower and pensions scarce. In this paper, we explore whether education offsets discrimination by empowering discriminated groups to successfully compete for formal jobs. Specifically, we calculate the returns to education on formal employment for a discriminated group (indigenous Peruvians). We find that certain education levels –primary and tertiary–allow indigenous workers equal access to formal jobs. But, for indigenous workers with only secondary education, we find an ""informality trap"" where returns to secondary education are 6.7 percentage points lower, a difference larger than the net returns of primary education. We find that differences in education quality across districts, more than migration and industry-specific patterns, are the main drivers of this effect. These findings have policy implications suggesting improvements to quality are essential for secondary education to empower discriminated groups to successfully compete in labor markets."
J46|Immigration and prices: quasi-experimental evidence from Syrian refugees in Turkey|Abstract We exploit the regional variation in the unexpected (or forced) inflow of Syrian refugees as a natural experiment to estimate the impact of immigration on consumer prices in Turkey. Using a difference-in-differences strategy and a comprehensive data set on the regional prices of CPI items, we find that general level of consumer prices has declined by approximately 2.5 % due to immigration. Prices of goods and services have declined in similar magnitudes. We highlight that the channel through which the price declines take place is the informal labor market. Syrian refugees supply inexpensive informal labor and, thus, substitute the informal native workers especially in informal-labor intensive sectors. We document that prices in these sectors have fallen by around 4 %, while the prices in the formal labor-intensive sectors have almost remained unchanged. Increase in the supply of informal immigrant workers generates labor cost advantages and keeps prices lower in the informal labor-intensive sectors.
J46|Earnings premiums and penalties for self-employment and informal employees around the world|This paper examines the earnings premiums associated with different types of employment in 73 countries. Workers are divided into four categories: non-professional own-account workers, employers and own-account professionals, informal wage employees, and formal wage employees. Approximately half of the workers in low-income countries are non-professional own-account workers and the majority of the rest are informal employees. Fewer than 10 percent are formal employees, and only 2 percent of workers in low-income countries are employers or own-account professionals. As per capita gross domestic product increases, there are large net shifts from non-professional own-account work into formal wage employment. Across all regions and income levels, non-professional own-account workers and informal wage employees face an earnings penalty compared with formal wage employees. But in low-income countries this earnings penalty is small, and non-professional own-account workers earn a positive premium relative to all wage employees. Earnings penalties for non-professional own-account workers tend to increase with gross domestic product and are largest for female workers in high-income countries. Men earn greater premiums than women for being employers or own-account professionals. These results are consistent with compensating wage differentials and firm quasi-rents playing important roles in explaining cross-country variation in earnings penalties, and raise questions about the extent to which the unskilled self-employed are rationed out of formal wage work in low-income countries.
J46|Workforce Composition, Productivity, and Labor Regulations in a Compensating Differentials Theory of Informality|We develop a search model of informal labor markets with worker and firm heterogeneity, intra-firm bargaining with imperfect substitutability across types of workers, and a comprehensive set of labor regulations, including minimum wage. Stylized facts associated with the informal sector, such as smaller firms and lower wages, emerge endogenously as firms and workers decide whether to comply with regulations. Imperfect substitutability across types of workers and decreasing returns to scale enable the model to reproduce empirical patterns incompatible with existing frameworks in the literature: the presence of skilled and unskilled workers in the formal and informal sectors, the rising share of skilled workers by firm size, and the declining formal wage premium by skill level. These features also allow us to analyze the equilibrium responses to changes in the demand and supply of different types of labor. We estimate the model using Brazilian data and show that it closely reproduces the decline in informality observed between 2003 and 2012. The change in the composition of the labor force appears as the main driving force behind this phenomenon. We illustrate the use of the model for policy analysis by assessing the effectiveness of a progressive payroll tax in reducing informality.
J46|Are apprenticeships beneficial in sub-Saharan Africa?|Apprenticeships are the most common form of non-academic training in sub-Saharan Africa. Most apprenticeships are provided by the private sector, for a fee, and lead to self-employment rather than to wage jobs. Where the effects have been measured, they show that earnings are not higher, on average, for people who did an apprenticeship than for those who did not. This presents a conundrum. Why would people pay for apprenticeship training that does not benefit them? Research reveals that apprenticeships do benefit some people more than others. Especially striking is that the returns to apprenticeships can fall with the level of education.
J46|Employment and rebellion in conflicted and fragile states|In addition to the heart-breaking human costs, violent civil rebellion is a cause of chronic economic under-development. Employment programs with former combatants and at-risk youth have improved their livelihoods, but not their support for non-violence and respect for law. Rebel groups provide security and social benefits that formal employment does not offer, possibly making switching out of rebellion into formal employment unappealing. However, a jobs program that addressed the psycho-social motivations to join rebel groups resulted in significant reductions in crime and violence. This is an important step forward in our understanding of how to lure people away from violent rebellion.
J46|Cash wage payments in transition economies: Consequences of envelope wages|In transition economies, a significant number of companies reduce their tax and social contributions by paying their staff an official salary, described in a registered formal employment agreement, and an extra, undeclared “envelope wage,” via a verbal unwritten agreement. The consequences include a loss of government income and a lack of fair play for lawful companies. For employees, accepting under-reported wages reduces their access to credit and their social protections. Addressing this issue will help increase the quality of working conditions, strengthen trade unions, and reduce unfair competition.
J46|Does unemployment insurance offer incentives to take jobs in the formal sector?|Unemployment insurance can be an efficient tool to provide protection for workers against unemployment and foster formal job creation in developing countries. How much workers value this protection and to what extent it allows a more efficient job search are two key parameters that determine its effectiveness. However, evidence shows that important challenges remain in the introduction and expansion of unemployment insurance in developing countries. These challenges range from achieving coverage in countries with high informality, financing the scheme without further distorting the labor market, and ensuring progressive redistribution.
J46|P.N. (Raja) Junankar, Development Economics: The Role of Agriculture in Development|Development Economics: The Role of Agriculture in Development is a compilation of academic writings from P.N. Junankar and coauthors on the topic of agriculture in India. These writings includeanalyses of government policies regarding the agricultural sector, farmer behavior, inequality, informal labor markets and female labor force participation. This book is a valuable contribution to the literature addressing growth within the agricultural sector in lesser developed economies.
J46|Assessing the loss due to working in the informal sector in Venezuela|In Venezuela, 40% of the workers are employed in the informal sector. This sector is known for being underproductive, meaning that the income received by its workers is less than what they could earn working in formal sector jobs. This paper uses data from the Household Sample Survey (2012-2013) to estimate differencein-differences linear and quantile regression models, controlling for some demographic characteristics, to quantify the loss associated with working in this market, as an indirect way to quantify the size of the informal sector. The parallel trend assumption is satisfied through propensity score matching, exception made for the highest quartile. The results suggest that informal sector workers lose about 34% of their potential income, loss that is larger for women and with an ambiguous behavior across levels of education. The study also indicates that the average difference in wages between the two sectors tends to narrow over time
J46|Women’s labor in South Africa – Time spent doing simultaneous paid and unpaid work|Empirical literature finds gender and presence of children as key determinants of unpaid work time. There is also extensive research on women’s role in small-scale agriculture and women’s disproportional representation in informal employment in developing countries. However, there has been no work to empirically link a woman’s time spent simultaneously doing paid and unpaid work with her type of employment. The availability of rich time use data from South Africa yields an opportunity to explore this critical question with empirical rigor. Results show that small-scale agriculture and informal employment are associated with women doing more paid and unpaid work simultaneously implying a positive non-pecuniary benefit of certain types of employment related to women’s need to navigate strict time constraints and limited choices.
J46|Aging, Informality and Public Policies in a Small Open Economy|We extend OGRE, the overlapping generation model developed by Baksa and Munkacsi (2016) by adding openness. We then employ the model to explore how the macroeconomic effects of aging, assumed to manifest itself as a decrease in the mortality rate, can be counteracted through public policies. The extended version inherits the previous modelling features of OGRE allowing us to also account for the impact openness has on the effectiveness of the considered policies.
J46|A Detailed Description of OGRE, the OLG Model|In this paper we present the structure of OGRE, a dynamic general equilib-rium model with overlapping generations, unemployment and a shadow economy. Based on a parametrized version of the model, we examine the impacts of aging and calculate multipliers of public pension and other fiscal policies. Also, we contrast macroeconomic reactions with pay-as-you-go and fully funded pension plans. Lastly, we highlight the role of unemployment and that of the underground sector in the framework.Classification-JEL: E24, E26, H55, J11, J46Keywords: population aging, public old-age pension reforms, pay-as-you-go, fully funded, shadow economy, informal employment, government debt, New Keynesian model, overlapping generations, demography, unemployment, retirement age
J46|Aging, (Pension) Reforms and the Shadow Economy in Southern Europe|Southern Europe is currently experiencing a double-whammy: high levels of government debt coupled with a rapidly aging population. Thus, the consolidation of (pension) budgets seems inevitable. In this paper we examine the short- and long-run macroeconomic e ects of public old-age pension reforms and other scal policies under conditions of population aging. To do so, we calibrate OGRE, a New Keynesian model with overlapping generations, unemployment and an underground sector to match annual data on Portugal and Spain. Our main nding is that a retirement-age increase is the least harmful policy with respect to long-run output. However, we raise some doubts about the feasibility of implementing this policy.Classification-JEL: E24, E26, H55, J11, J46Keywords: population aging, public old-age pension reforms, pay-as-you-go, fully funded, shadow economy, informal employment, government debt, New Keynesian model, overlapping generations, demography, unemployment, retirement ageLength: 71 pages
J46|The effect of one-on-one assistance on the compliance with labor regulation. A field experiment in extremely vulnerable settings|This is the first paper to analyze the effects of intense personal assistance on the compliance with labor regulation, within a population of deeply disadvantaged informal workers, using a field experiment. We randomly assign one-on-one assistance to these workers, and, within this treatment group, we randomly assign money to cover the cost of fulfilling the legal requirements to get a permit to work on the streets. One month after the intervention, we find that a worker who receives one-on-one assistance is three times more likely to comply with the legal documentation required by the government than a worker in the control group. We also find that a worker who receives both one-on-one assistance and cost coverage is four times more likely to comply with the legal requirements. The findings of this study shed light on strategies to help highly vulnerable workers to comply with labor regulations.
J46|Informal Labor and the Efficiency Cost of Social Programs: Evidence from the Brazilian Unemployment Insurance Program|It is widely believed that the presence of a large informal sector increases the efficiency cost of social programs -- transfer and social insurance programs -- in developing countries. We evaluate such claims for policies that have been heavily studied in countries with low informality -- increases in unemployment insurance (UI) benefits. We introduce informal work opportunities into a canonical model of optimal UI that specifies the typical tradeoff between workers' need for insurance and the efficiency cost from distorting their incentives to return to a formal job. We then combine the model with evidence drawn from comprehensive administrative data to quantify the efficiency cost of increases in potential UI duration in Brazil. We find evidence of behavioral responses to UI incentives, including informality responses. However, because reemployment rates in the formal sector are low to begin with, most beneficiaries would draw the UI benefits absent behavioral responses, and only a fraction of the cost of (longer) UI benefits is due to perverse incentive effects. As a result, the efficiency cost is relatively low, and in fact lower than comparable estimates for the US. We reinforce this finding by showing that the efficiency cost is also lower in labor markets with higher informality within Brazil. This is because formal reemployment rates are even lower in those labor markets absent behavioral responses. In sum, the results go against the conventional wisdom, and indicate that efficiency concerns may even become more relevant as an economy formalizes.
J46|Effects of IT-enabled Monitoring on Labor Contracting in Online Platforms: Evidence from a Natural Experiment| Two-sided platforms are typically plagued with asymmetric information, limiting market efficiency. Situated in the context of the increasingly popular online platforms for labor contracting (herein referred to as â€œonline labor marketsâ€ ), this paper investigates whether the implementation of an IT-enabled monitoring system mitigates moral hazard in online platforms and the consequences thereof. Our identification hinges on a natural experiment at Freelancer when it introduced an IT-enabled monitoring system with enhanced offline tracking features in August 2015. Based on a unique dataset including 17,827 fixed-price projects and 8,563 time-based projects matched on observable characteristics, we employ a difference-in-differences (DID) approach to identify the treatment effect of the monitoring system implementation on various outcomes from both the employer (demand) side and the contractor (demand) side, including employer contractor choice, platform entry barrier and employer surplus. We found that the implementation of the monitoring system lowers the employersâ€™ preference for high-reputation bidders in time-based projects, and thus reduces the reputation premiums and partially lowers the entry barrier for contractors who have not yet established a reputation on the platform. Specifically, using fixed-price projects as the baseline, on average, the implementation of the monitoring system increased the number of bids by 17.4% (primarily from bidders with no prior experience on the platform) and increased employer surplus in time-based projects by 21.5%. Our results testify the partial substitution relationship between reputation systems and monitoring systems, and suggest that IT-enabled monitoring systems have a significant effect on alleviating moral hazards, reducing agency costs, and intensifying supply-side platform competition.
J46|Spinning the Industrial Revolution|Abstract: The prevailing explanation for why the Industrial Revolution occurred first in Britain is Robert Allenâ€™s (2009) â€˜highâ€ wage economyâ€™ view, which claims that the high cost of labour relative to capital and fuel incentivized innovation and the adoption of new techniques. This paper presents new empirical evidence on hand spinning before the Industrial Revolution and demonstrates that there was no such â€˜highâ€ wage economyâ€™ in spinning, a leading sector of industrialization. We quantify the working lives of frequently ignored female and child spinners who were crucial to the British textile industry in the Early Modern period with evidence of productivity and wages from the late sixteenth to the early nineteenth century. Our results show that spinning was a widespread, lowâ€ wage, lowâ€ productivity employment, in line with the Humphries (2013) view of the motivations for the factory system.
J46|Multiproduct Cournot oligopoly|We present a general Cournot model in which each firm may sell multiple quality-differentiated products. We use an upgrades approach, working not with the actual products, but instead with upgrades from one quality to the next. The properties of single-product Cournot models carry over to the supply of upgrades, but not necessarily to the supply of complete products. A firm`s product line is determined by the properties of demand, its costs, and competitor characteristics. For symmetric firms, these determinants reduce to returns to quality and changes in demand elasticity as quality increases. For asymmetric firms whose (potentially endogenous) technological capabilities are defined by their maximum feasible qualities, gaps in product lines are determined precisely by the capabilities of lesser rivals. Strategic commitment to product lines prior to quantity competition is considered. Incentives to so commit are markedly different from those under price-setting models.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J46|Trabajadoras del hogar en el Perú y transiciones laborales| El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar las transiciones desde el trabajo del hogar remunerado hacia otras ocupaciones, el desempleo y la inactividad, así como los determinantes de estas transiciones. Para ello empleamos los datos panel de la ENAHO para los periodos 1998 – 2002, 2002 – 2006 y 2007 – 2011. Luego de un análisis detallado de las transiciones parciales y totales de cada panel, encontramos que alrededor de un tercio de las trabajadoras del hogar se quedan en la misma ocupación y que un porcentaje similar pasa a al trabajo independiente o a ocupaciones asalariadas de baja productividad. Luego de estimar las transiciones desde el trabajo del hogar remunerado hacia otras ocupaciones y hacia el desempleo o la inactividad, encontramos que un mayor nivel de educación está siempre asociado a una salida hacia otra ocupación. Asimismo, un mayor salario potencial tiene un efecto positivo en la salida hacia otras ocupaciones solamente en el panel 2002 – 2006, el único en el cual no hay crisis económicas. Por otro lado, la edad siempre disminuye la movilidad laboral. Finalmente, encontramos que en los paneles 1998 – 2002 y 2007 – 2001, en los cuales hay crisis económicas, aumentan tanto las salidas hacia otras ocupaciones —posiblemente relacionadas a caídas en la demanda—, así como las salidas hacia la inactividad.
J46|Demanda de trabajo del hogar remunerado en el Perú| El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar la demanda de trabajo del hogar remunerado (THR) y su relación con la participación laboral y los ingresos de los miembros del hogar demandante, especialmente de las mujeres. Dado que la mayoría de las trabajadoras del hogar se encuentra en el sector urbano y que las tareas llevadas a cabo por estas trabajadoras son distintas en el sector rural, analizamos solamente la demanda de THR en el sector urbano. Para ello empleamos los datos de la Encuesta Nacional de Uso del Tiempo (ENNUT) y de la Encuesta Nacional de Hogares (ENAHO), para el año 2010, y encontramos que mientras las familias de mayores ingresos son las que demandan la mayoría del THR “cama adentro”, las familias donde los jefes de hogar son más jóvenes demandan en su mayoría THR “cama afuera”. Por medio de ecuaciones Logit binomial y multinomial encontramos que los ingresos laborales y no laborales del jefe de hogar como de la cónyuge tienen un efecto positivo sobre la probabilidad de demandar THR. Asimismo, el efecto marginal del ingreso de la cónyuge sobre la demanda de THR “cama afuera” es mayor que el efecto marginal del ingreso del jefe de hogar; sucede lo contrario con respecto a la demanda de THR “cama adentro”. Encontramos que la probabilidad de demandar THR es menor si la lengua materna del jefe de hogar es una lengua nativa. Finalmente, la probabilidad de demandar THR es mayor a más hijos menores de 6 años de edad, si bien el efecto marginal es mayor para el caso del THR “cama adentro” en relación a la demanda de THR “cama afuera”.
J46|Determinants of Changing Informal Employment in Brazil, 2000–2010|This paper explores possible causal determinants of changing wage and salary informality over the period 2000–2010 in Brazil. We utilize demographic census and other institutional data sources from the opening and closing years of the decade, informality regressions in both years that exploit variation across workers and municipalities in informality rates and their causal determinants, and a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition of changing mean informality rates over the decade. Among the determinants considered are: changes in labor law enforcement, a near doubling of the real value of the minimum wage, the emergence and growth of conditional cash transfer programs, and changing industry composition and labor force demographics. We find that two of the most important policy changes over this period – the increase in the real value of the minimum wage and the dramatic expansion of conditional cash transfer programs – contribute positively, not negatively to informality. Among the factors accounting for the decline in mean informality rates over this time are rising rates of labor law enforcement, rising education levels, increased numbers of workers with spouses in the formal sector, and changes in industry composition, which explain between 16% and 57% of the mean decline in informality over the period. However, most of the decline is accounted for by the changing estimated coefficients on the industry categorical variables – that is, by the changing way in which industrial composition translates into informality.
J46|المرأة الماكثة في البيت في الجزائر: قدرات منسية؟!<BR>[The Housewives In Algeria: Forgotten Capacities?]|"The most research in labor economics field have focused on the determinants of the participation and the occupational choice of women in the labor market ignoring the behavior of a sub-population which remained outside of the traditional labor market, these are housewives despite their statistical weight. Indeed, three out of five women of working age are housewives. This disinterest is probably due to lack of data concerning these sub-population. In this article, we focus on the study of this population ""housewives"" from an original investigation, which included a special section on the activities of housewives. Several mutation indices were observed on the behavior of these housewives inside and outside the household. For example, it appears they assist more their children in homework. However, they occupy less nephews and grandchildren. They read, write and use the internet. Housewives participate in all the spots outside the household. In the case of certain activities, the proportions are relatively large. Other observed result, they invest more public space."
J46|Tackling The Informal Economy In The European Union: A Social Actor Approach|In recent years, participants in the informal economy have started to be viewed less as rational economic actors who engage in the informal economy when the pay-off is greater than the expected cost of being caught and punished, and more as social actors who engage when their tax morale (i.e., motivation to pay taxes) is low. To evaluate this new social actor approach and the implications for tackling the informal economy, this paper reports evidence from 41,689 face-to-face interviews conducted across the European Union. Multilevel logistic regression analysis reveals a strong association between participation in the informal economy and the level of tax morale. Finding that higher tax morale (and thus lower participation in the informal economy) is strongly correlated at the country-level with greater levels of state intervention and at the individual-level with characteristics such as gender, age, education and employment status, the outcome is to confirm a structuralist political economy explanation and refute the modernization and neo-liberal explanations and remedies, as well as to uncover the importance of some policy solutions not considered until now, including older citizens mentoring of younger people, and improving women’s participation in the labour force.
J46|Sex Work Vs. Sexual Exploitation: Assessing Guesstimates For Prostitution In The European Union|Prostitution regimes in the EU-28 include prohibition, regulation and abolition; economics literature tackles this typology from the perspective of both free sex work and forced labour trafficking. We review the data sources on the demand-side and the supply-side in order to gauge how large is the sex market and informal employment for sex workers. We calculate Estimates 1A and 1B from miscellaneous sources, whereas HIV prevalence among sex workers from World Health Organisation provides Estimates 2A and 2B. We calculate Estimate 3 from victims of sexual exploitation trafficking according to data collected by the UNODC and Eurostat. We design an OLS model to test the five Estimates of prostitution in EU-28 according to GDP per capita, legislation, supply-side and demand-side variables. Last, we assess which might be the most likely Estimates as regards GDP enhancement in 2010, with respect to National Accounts adjustment for illegal production and consumption expenditure. Hence, we come up with a lower bound Estimate that may be used as a benchmark for macroeconomic policy.
J46|Alternative Work Arrangements and Job Satisfaction|There has been a rise in alternative work arrangements in recent years, with much variation in who selects these work arrangements and the reasons for doing so. Higher participation rates may stem in part from individual’s needs which are not met in more traditional jobs and is reflected in the impact they have on job satisfaction. This study explores variations in job satisfaction by work arrangement, controlling for both occupation and gender for respondents to the 2006, 2010 and 2014 General Social Survey. The rise in such employment and the prospect of it continuing to rise may have implications for the structure of jobs offered by traditional firms and it may also have important implications for the social safety nets of such workers and their families given the nature of how such benefits are provided in our economy.

J46|Earnings Premiums and Penalties for Self-Employment and Informal Employees around the World|This paper examines the earnings premiums associated with different types of employment in 73 countries. Workers are divided into four categories: Non-professional own-account workers, employers and own-account professionals, informal wage employees, and formal wage employees. Approximately half of the workers in low income countries are nonprofessional own-account workers and the majority of the rest are informal employees. Fewer than 10% are formal employees, and only 2% of workers in low income countries are employers or own-account professionals. As per capita GDP increases, there are large net shifts from non-professional own account work into formal wage employment. Across all regions and income levels, non-professional own-account workers and informal wage employees face an earnings penalty compared to formal wage employees. But in low income countries, this earnings penalty is small, and non-professional own-account workers earn a positive premium relative to all wage employees. Earnings penalties for non-professional own account workers tend to increase with GDP and are largest for female workers in high income countries. Men earn greater premiums than women for being employers or own-account professionals. These results are consistent with compensating wage differentials and firm quasi-rents playing important roles in explaining cross-country variation in earnings penalties, and raise questions about the extent to which the unskilled self-employed are rationed out of formal wage work in low-income countries.
J46|A comprehensive analysis of the wage curve in Brazil: Non-linearities, urban size, and the spatial dimension|Agglomeration economies have a relevant impact on local labour markets. The interaction of workers and firms in dense urban areas may generate productivity advantages that result in higher wages. City size has an important impact on the relative bargaining power of workers and firms in the labour market. When analysing the relationship of local wages and the business cycle, wage flexibility, measured by the wage curve, is higher in informal sectors in less dense areas in Brazil. Therefore, large agglomerations are supposed to provide a higher bargaining power for workers, as they have further job opportunities. In addition, labour market dualism is an essential ingredient in the evaluation of the wage curve in developing economies. However, this type of analysis should be conducted in the adequate regional level (labour market areas), mking it possible to find a relevant impact of city size on the relative bargaining power of workers and firms.
J46|On the Puzzle of Diversification in Social Networks with Occupational Mismatch|This paper incorporates social networks into a frictional labour market framework. There are two worker types and two occupations. Both occupations are subject to correlated business cycle fluctuations in labour demand. The equilibrium in this model is characterized by occupational mismatch which is associated with a wage penalty. This paper shows that there exists a unique value of network homophily maximizing the present value of income. Therefore, there is a gain for risk-neutral workers if their network is diversified between the two occupations. The reason for diversification is that the present value of income is a non-linear function of the network composition. Thus, it is not the desire to reduce the volatility of income as in standard portfolio theory which is driving the decision of workers. Nevertheless, the optimal diversification level is higher with stronger negative correlation in labour demand between the two occupations, with a lower unemployment benefit and with a higher probability of recession in the primary occupation. On the other hand, the optimal diversification level is reduced if there is on-the-job search in the state of mismatch.
J46|Wages and Informality in Developing Countries|We develop an equilibrium wage-posting model with heterogeneous firms that decide to locate in the formal or the informal sector and workers who search randomly on and off the job. We estimate the model on Brazilian labor force survey data. In equilibrium, firms of equal productivity locate in different sectors, a fact observed in the data. Wages are characterized by compensating differentials. We show that tightening enforcement does not increase unemployment and increases wages, total output, and welfare by enabling better allocation of workers to higher productivity jobs and improving competition in the formal labor market.

J46|Informal Employment in a Growing and Globalizing Low-Income Country|We document several facts about workforce transitions from the informal to the formal sector in Vietnam, a fast growing, industrializing, and low-income country. First, younger workers, particularly migrants, are more likely to work in the formal sector and stay there permanently. Second, the decline in the aggregate share of informal employment occurs through changes between and within birth cohorts. Third, younger, educated, male, and urban workers are more likely to switch to the formal sector than other workers initially in the informal sector. Poorly educated, older, female, rural workers face little prospect of formalization. Fourth, formalization coincides with occupational upgrading.
J46|Social Networks and Factor Markets: Panel Data Evidence from Ethiopia| We investigate the role of an indigenous social network in Ethiopia, the iddir, in facilitating factor market transactions among smallholder farmers. We use detailed longitudinal household survey data and employ fixed effects estimation approaches to identify the effect of iddir membership on factor market transactions among farmers. We find that joining an iddir network improves households’ access to land, labour and credit transactions. Our findings also hint that iddir networks may crowd-out borrowing from local moneylenders (locally referred as ‘Arata Abedari’), a relatively expensive credit source. These results suggest that non-market institutions can play crucial roles in facilitating market transactions.
J46|“Calidad de vida laboral en Colombia: un índice multidimensional difuso”|"La calidad del trabajo abarca múltiples dimensiones objetivas y subjetivas, que pueden incluir las rentas del trabajo, la estabilidad laboral, la satisfacción laboral y la seguridad social. En este trabajo se sigue el método propuesto por Gómez et al. (2013), que introduce una nueva forma de calcular la calidad del trabajo, consistente en la medición de: i) el uso del enfoque de funcionamientos y las capacidades de Sen y ii) un método de conjuntos difusos. Usando la Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares (GEIH), se calcula un Índice Multidimensional de Calidad del Empleo (IMCE) a nivel nacional según edad, sexo, nivel educativo, tamaño de la empresa, y el sector de la industria. Un tema que se destaca de nuestros resultados es la existencia de una ""Ciclo de calidad de vida laboral"", con los puntajes más altos del índice a los 30 años, lo cual puede tener implicaciones importantes para el sistema de seguridad social."
J46|Your very private job agency: Job referrals based on residential location networks|Your very private job agency: Job referrals based on residential location networks This paper analyzes job referral effects that are based on residential location. We use georeferenced record data for the entire working population (liable to social security) and the corresponding establishments in the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area, which is Germany's largest (and EU's second largest) metropolitan area. We estimate the propensity of two persons to work at the same place when residing in the same neighborhood (reported with an accuracy of 500mÃ—500m grid cells), and compare the effect to people living in adjacent neighborhoods. We find a significant increase in the probability of working together when living in the same neighborhood, which is stable across various specifications. Additionally, we look at how referral effects differ for various groups like age, skill, ethnic groups and industry sectors. We find that especially low skilled workers make use of residential networks for job search, as well as some groups of immigrants. Especially migrants from the new EU countries as well as Italians and people from former Yugoslavia have a highly increased probability of working together when they share the same neighborhood. This is clear sign for network effects especially for some immigrant groups in the German labor market. Job Further, we are able to investigate a number of issues in order to deepen the insight on actual job referrals: distinguishing between the effects on working in the same neighborhood and working in the same establishment ? probably the more accurate measure for job referrals ? shows that the latter yield overall smaller effects. Further, we find that clusters in employment although having a significant positive effect play only a minor role for the magnitude of the referral effect, which makes us confident that what we find is actually related to a true referral effect and not some spurious correlation. When we exclude short distance commuters, we find the same probabilities of working together, which reinforces our interpretation of this probability as a network effect. The paper investigates the effect of living together on the probability of working together. We find strong evidence for a positive and highly significant relationship, which is robust across several specifications and robustness tests, addressing common issues on the identification of neighborhood effects.

J46|Informality and Segmentation in the Mexican Labor Market|In developing countries, some workers have formal jobs while others are occupied in informal positions. One view regarding this duality suggests that sectors are segmented, which means that a worker in the informal sector identical to another in the formal sector cannot get a formal position due to entry barriers. A second view states that workers self-select into informal jobs. Previous research suggests that these two situations may coexist in the same labor market. In this paper we identify the proportion of informal workers who are in each situation for the case of Mexico. Using a simple model of self-selection with entry barriers into the formal sector, we estimate that between 10 and 20 percent of informal workers would prefer to have a formal job. While this result provides evidence of the presence of some segmentation in the Mexican labor market, it suggests that an important proportion of workers in the informal sector self-select into it.
J46|Long Term Impacts of Vouchers for Vocational Training: Experimental Evidence for Colombia|We use experimental data of a training program in 2005 in Colombia. We find that even up to ten years ahead, the JeA program had a positive and significant effect on the probability to work in the formal sector, and to work for a large firm. Applicants in the treatment group also contributed more months to social security during the analyzed period. Earnings of treated applicants were 11.8% higher in the whole sample, and they made larger contributions to social security. We also present non parametric bounds showing that for some percentiles of the sample of women, there are positive and nearly significant effects of the program. Thus, the effects of the program would have been capitalized both in increases in the likelihood of being formal, and increases in productivity. We also present evidence that the estimated program effects on the likelihood of working for the formal sector, the likelihood of working for a large firm, and the earnings in the formal sector, are not an artifact of analyzing multiple outcomes. We also find those in the treatment group have 0.315 more years of education, and have a probability of graduating from high school 10 percent higher than the control group. We find no significant effect on the probability of attending college or any school program, nor on fertility decisions, marital status or some dimensions of assortative mating. Among applicants matching to the census of the poorest population, we find that beneficiaries are more likely to participate in the labor market, to be employed, and to be enrolled in a private health insurance at the time of the survey. Finally, we find that the benefits of the JeA program are higher than it costs, leading to an internal rate of return of at least 22.1 percent.
J46|Informalidad laboral y calidad del empleo en la Región Pacífica colombiana|El objetivo del presente documento es elaborar un diagnóstico sobre la informalidad laboral y su relación con la calidad del empleo en la región Pacífica colombiana. Los resultados muestran que en el Pacífico dos de cada tres empleados se ubican en el sector informal. Esta observación tiene implicaciones claves para la calidad del empleo y el bienestar de la población. En efecto, la región Pacífica presenta baja calidad del empleo, que es más crítica para los individuos con bajos niveles educativos, los empleados domésticos y, por ubicación geográfica, para los individuos del departamento de Nariño. ******ABSTRACT: The purpose of this document is to conduct an analysis of labor informality and quality of employment in the Pacific region in Colombia. The results show that on average two out of three individuals are employed in the informal sector. This finding has key implications for the quality of employment and well-being of the population. Indeed, the Pacific region has low quality jobs, which is more dramatic for individuals with low education levels, domestic workers, and for individuals from the department of Nariño.
J46|Explaining and tackling the shadow economy in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania: a tax morale approach|To explain the shadow economy in the Baltic states of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, this paper evaluates the relationship between the shadow economy and tax morale. Viewing tax morale as a measure of the symmetry between the codified laws and regulations of formal institutions (state morality) and the unwritten socially shared rules of informal institutions (civic morality), the proposition is that the lower the tax morale (i.e. the greater the asymmetry between state morality and civic morality), the greater is the likelihood to participate in the shadow economy. To evaluate this, a 2013 survey is reported involving 3036 face-to-face interviews in these 3 Baltic nations. Using logistic regression analysis, the finding is that the likelihood of participating in the shadow economy is greater, the lower is the tax morality of individuals, population groups and countries. In addition, the likelihood to participate is shadow economy is found to significantly vary by, for example, gender, employment status and country, people living in Latvia and Lithuania displaying significantly lower likelihood to engage in the shadow economy. The paper then explores the implications for theorizing and tackling the shadow economy.
J46|Cash-in-Hand, Benefit Fraud and Unemployment Insurance|Recent evidence questions the nature of the re-employment spike as unemployment insurance (UI) payments expire. Unemployed agents do not appear to devote more time to search and are observed leaving the UI scheme early without necessarily entering employment. We show that benefit fraud is consistent with both observations. Over time, UI recipients become increasingly willing to accept short-term cash-in-hand work. This takes them away from job search. Immediately before UI expiry, the risk of punishment for fraud exceeds the value of remaining payments. Recipients may voluntarily leave the scheme to accept cash-in-hand opportunities.
J46|The Search and Matching Equilibrium in an Economy with an Informal Sector: A Positive Analysis of Labour Market Policies|This paper contributes to the theoretical analysis of the informal sector through the search and matching framework. Building upon the work of Albrecht, Navarro and Vroman (2009), where the informal sector consists of unregulated selfemployment, I describe the search and matching equilibrium in an economy with an informal sector where workers are risk neutral and the government is able to see whether a worker is in the formal sector or in the informal one. In this case, I solve the matching equilibrium by introducing three policies: unemployment benefits, a formal lump sum tax, and a job creation subsidy. I analyse the effects of these policies on unemployment rates, formal employment and informal employment. I show that these policies affect the incentives of workers insofar as joining the formal or informal sectors, changing the composition of these two types of workers in the labor market.

J46|Women’s Empowerment among the Extremely Poor: Evidence from the Impact Evaluation of Red UNIDOS in Colombia|Currently, 9.1 per cent of Colombia’s population lives in extreme poverty. Poverty is more prevalent in rural areas, where it reaches 19.1 per cent (DANE 2012). In Colombia women are more affected by extreme poverty than men, which can be explained by gender gaps in the labour market. While female labour force participation in urban areas is 57.8 per cent, male labour force participation is almost 17 percentage points higher at 74.5 per cent. Among the extremely poor population, only 31.9 per cent of women in urban areas participate in the labour market. Job informality among extremely poor women can reach as high as 90 per cent (DANE 2013). How then can we help women living in extreme poverty achieve greater economic empowerment? A diagnostic study revealed that the most vulnerable population was not benefiting from government services created to improve their socio-economic conditions. This was due to a lack of information, a lack of identification and a lack of empowerment, as well as distance to the supply of services (Nunez and Cuesta 2006). Furthermore, evidence from Chile Solidario also suggests that extremely poor families lack the fundamental organisational skills for their own development; therefore, more than financial support, they also need psychosocial support (Galasso 2011). Armed with this evidence, Colombia created Red UNIDOS (previously Red JUNTOS) in 2009 as the government strategy to alleviate extreme poverty.
J46|Assessing the loss due to working in the informal sector in Venezuela|Abstract: In Venezuela, 40% of the workers are employed in the informal sector. This sector is known for being underproductive, meaning that the income received by its workers is less than what they could earn working in formal sector jobs. This paper uses data from the Household Sample Survey (2012-2013) to estimate differencein-differences linear and quantile regression models, controlling for some demographic characteristics, to quantify the loss associated with working in this market, as an indirect way to quantify the size of the informal sector. The parallel trend assumption is satisfied through propensity score matching, exception made for the highest quartile. The results suggest that informal sector workers lose about 34% of their potential income, loss that is larger for women and with an ambiguous behavior across levels of education. The study also indicates that the average difference in wages between the two sectors tends to narrow over time. Resumen: En Venezuela, el 40% de los trabajadores está empleado en el sector informal. Este sector se caracteriza por baja productividad, lo que implica que el ingreso de los trabajadores que en él se emplean es inferior al que podrían obtener en empleos formales. Este trabajo utiliza datos de la Encuesta de Hogares por Muestreo (2012-2013) para estimar modelos de regresión lineal y por cuantil de diferencia en diferencias, utilizando algunas características demográficas como covariables. Se busca con ello cuantificar la pérdida asociada al trabajo en el sector informal, como una manera indirecta de estimar el tamaño del sector. Para satisfacer el supuesto de igual tendencia en los grupos se recurre a procesos de emparejamiento basados en el propensity score; este supuesto no se cumple para el cuantil superior de salarios. Los resultados sugieren que el trabajador del sector informal pierde, en promedio, cerca del 34% de su ingreso potencial, pérdida que es superior en las mujeres que en los hombres, pero sin un claro comportamiento con respecto al nivel educativo. El estudio indica que la diferencia promedio en los sueldos de ambos sectores tiende a reducirse.

Se emplea un modelo Probit para el análisis de los datos. La conclusión final no podrá ser que las políticas públicas generen más o menos pobreza, sino si hay algún efecto sobre la participación laboral en el mercado informal.
J46|Measuring the Shadow Economy: Endogenous Switching Regression with Unobserved Separation|We develop an estimator of unreported income, perhaps due to tax evasion, that does not depend on as strict identifying assumptions as previous estimators based on microeconomic data. The standard identifying assumption that the self-employed underreport income whereas wage and salary workers do not is likely to fail in countries where employees are often paid under the table or engage in corrupt activities. Assuming that evading individuals have a higher consumption-income gap than non-evading ones due underreporting both to tax authorities and in surveys, an endogenous switching model with unknown sample separation enables the estimation of consumption-income gaps for both underreporting and truthful households. This avoids the need to identify non-evading and evading groups exante. This methodology is applied to data from Czech and Slovak household budget surveys and shows that estimated evasion is substantially higher than found using previous methodologies.
J46|Informality: Causes, Consequences And Policy Responses|A stylized prediction of the development economics discourse is that informality will disappear with development. And yet in the last twenty years conventional measures of informality, far from declining, have either remained stagnant or have actually increased. What exactly is informality and what are its magnitudes and trends? What are the causes of informality and why is it not decreasing as predicted by standard theories of development? What are the consequences for inclusive economic growth of a large and increasing informal sector? What are feasible and desirable policy responses to informality? These are the questions which motivate this broad based survey and overview of informality, with particular focus on India.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J46|Egypte 1998-2012: de l’emploi public protégé à l’emploi informel précaire, un marché du travail en déshérence|(english) Over the last two decades the Egyptian labor market has undergone major changes that the social claims of the January 2011 revolution brought to light. Among them, lack of job security and associated weak social protection have been particularly criticized. Therefore the aim of this article is it to present an overview of employment in Egypt, with a specific focus on the evolution of informal employment. To this end we use individual data from nationally representative household surveys carried out in 1998, 2006 and 2012. The descriptive and econometric analysis illustrates that over the period studied the withdrawal of the state as a provider of employment was very marked. Simultaneously, the state’s lack of commitment to enforce labor laws in the private sector has led to a significant increase in informal employment. Informal jobs concern specifically men, young people and the less qualified workers. Though, over time, age and education provide less effective protection against informal employment. The majority of private sector jobs not only lack social protection but are also becoming more and more insecure. _________________________________ (français) Le marché du travail égyptien a connu, au cours des deux dernières décennies, des mutations importantes que les revendications sociales de la révolution de janvier 2011 ont mises au jour. Parmi elles, le manque de sécurité des emplois et la faible couverture sociale qui leur est associée ont été particulièrement dénoncés. Aussi l’objectif de ce travail est-il de présenter un panorama de l’emploi en Egypte, en s’intéressant en particulier à l’évolution de l’emploi informel. A cette fin les données individuelles issues d’enquêtes sur les ménages représentatives au niveau national et disponibles pour trois années (1998, 2006 et 2012) seront mobilisées. Les analyses descriptive et économétrique montrent que le désengagement de l’Etat en tant que pourvoyeur d’emplois a été particulièrement marqué sur cette période. Dans le même temps, son absence d’engagement à faire respecter la législation du travail au secteur privé s’est traduit par une progression significative de l’emploi informel. Ce dernier touche particulièrement les hommes, les jeunes et les moins éduqués bien que l’âge et l’éducation assurent, avec le temps, une protection de moins en moins efficace face à l’emploi informel. A cette absence de protection sociale de la plupart des emplois privés s’ajoute la précarité qui caractérise nombre d’entre eux.
J46|Is There An Infırmal Employment Wage Penalty in Egypt?|This paper considers the private sector wage earners in Egypt and examine their wage distribution during 1998-2012 using Egyptian Labor Market Panel Survey. We first estimate Mincer wage equations both at the mean and at different quantiles of the wage distribution taking into account observable characteristics. Then we make use of the panel feature of the data and estimate models taking into account unobservable characteristics. We also consider the possibility of nonlinearity in covariate effects and estimate a variant of matching models. In all cases we find a persistent informal wage penalty in the face of extensive sensitivity checks. It is smaller when unobserved heterogeneity is taken into account and larger at the top than at the bottom of the conditional wage distribution. We also examine the informal wage penalty over time during the study period and in different groups according to experience and education. The informal wage penalty has increased recently over time and is larger for the better educated but smaller for the more experienced.
J46|Complementary Currency Systems: Employability and Welfare|"Complementary currency systems have developed around the world. Some are associated with local communities and aimed at developing local economic activity, social links or employability among the unemployed people. This paper uses a theoretical model to provides answers to practical questions associated with the implementation of complementary currencies aimed at eliminating the ""scar effect"" and facilitating recruitment in the formal sector. What are the condition for a successful complementary currency? Should credit be managed in the same way depending whether welfare or employment the chosen objective? The results point to the role of confidence in the adoption of a complementary currency, and also interest in a controlled level of mutual credit if employment is the main objective of complementary currency implementation."

This paper follows the method proposed by Gómez et al. (2013) that introduces a new way of measuring Quality of Work, which consists of: i) the use of Sen’s functioning and capabilities approach and ii) a fuzzy sets method to define membership to the sets of good job quality. Using the Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares, we obtain results for a Multidimensional Index of Quality of Employment, at the national level about age, gender, educational level, firm size, and industry sector. One topic that is highlighted from our results is the existence of a “Quality of Work Life Cycle”, with higher levels of the index up to age of 30, which may have critical implications for the social security system."
J46|Impacts of Informal Caregiving on Caregiver Employment, Health, and Family|As the aging population increases, the demand for informal caregiving is becoming an ever more important concern for researchers and policy-makers alike. To shed light on the implications of informal caregiving, this paper reviews current research on its impact on three areas of caregivers' lives: employment, health, and family. Because the literature is inherently interdisciplinary, the research designs, sampling procedures, and statistical methods used are heterogeneous. Nevertheless, we are still able to draw several conclusions: first, despite the prevalence of informal caregiving and its primary association with lower levels of employment, the affected labor force is seemingly small. Second, such caregiving tends to lower the quality of the caregiver's psychological health, which also has a negative impact on physical health outcomes. Third, the implications for family life remain under investigated. The research findings also differ strongly among subgroups, although they do suggest that female, spousal, and intense caregivers tend to be the most affected by caregiving.
J46|Do Parental Networks Pay Off? Linking Children's Labor‐Market Outcomes to Their Parents' Friends|In this paper, we examine whether children are better off if their parents have more elaborate social networks. Using data on high‐school friendships of parents, we analyze whether the number and characteristics of friends affect the labor‐market outcomes of children. While parental friendships formed in high school appear long lasting, we find no significant impact on their children's occupational choices and earnings prospects. These results do not change when we account for network endogeneity, network persistency, and network measurement error. Only when children enter the labor market do friends of parents have a marginally significant but small influence on their occupational choice.
J46|Bound to lose, bound to win? The financial crisis and the informal-formal sector earnings gap in Serbia|While the informal sector has received widespread attention in academic and policy arenas in recent decades, knowledge gaps and controversies remain. By examining the incidence and determinants of the formal-informal sector earnings gap for adult male dependent employees using two identical, nationally representative labor force surveys for Serbia—one just prior to the impact of the recent international financial crisis and one about a year into the crisis—for three alternative measures of informality, this paper adds to our understanding in several dimensions. Among the main results is the finding of a substantively large formal-informal sector earnings gap (favoring the formal sector)—across three alternative informality measures—which appears to have decreased substantially overall following the crisis. Additional results suggest that formal sector workers are concentrated in better paying industries and occupations and have more education and other favorable characteristics than informal sector workers, and at the same time also have higher returns to their (already favorable) characteristics overall, with education and part-time status consistently among the main drivers of the observed gap.

J46|Fear of Labor Rigidities – The Role of Expectations in Employment Growth in Peru|Many studies have been conducted to analyze the effect of stricter Employment Protection Legislation (EPL). However, almost all of them has focused on an ex-post impact; leaving aside a second but equally important channel: expectations. This paper aims to analyze the role of expectations on peruvian formal and informal labor market; using news as our identification variable. We use the monthly number of news related to the approval of the General Labor Law (GLL), a proposal entailing future stronger labor rigidities, from January 2001 to May 2012. Using the Permanent Employment Survey (EPE), we find a negative relation between expectations towards a stricter labor market and both employment and average income. News mainly affect formal occupied EAP, arousing a substitution effect from formal to informal employment. We also discover that the effect of expectations differs in periods with higher versus lower GDP growth. Finally, we find some evidence supporting news having a cumulative effect: the larger the previous stock of news, the weaker the effect.
J46|Entrepreneurship for the poor in developing countries|Can entrepreneurship programs be successful labor market policies for the poor? A large share of workers in developing countries are self-employed in low-paying work or engage in low-return entrepreneurial activities that keep these workers in poverty. Entrepreneurship programs provide business training and access to finance, advisory, and networking services with the aim of boosting workers’ earnings and reducing poverty. Programs vary in design, which can affect their impact on outcomes. Recent studies have identified some promising approaches that are yielding positive results, such as combining training and financial support.
J46|Underemployment in Latin America|Economics literature has paid relatively little attention to the study of underemployment, which is defined as the situation of an individual who works less than 35 hours a week, but wants to work more hours. This can be explained by the scarcity of data on underemployment, and by the fact that labor statistics treat it as employment, and thus its numbers may not create so much expectation as those of unemployment. The study of underemployment is important in view of its relation to poverty, especially as it affects women, and because of the psychological damages that result to underemployed individuals, particularly young people. This paper analyzes the behavior of underemployment in a sample of five Latin American countries by means of the estimation of an unrestricted vector auto-regressive (VAR) model using 2000-2008 panel data from five Latin American countries. The variables included in the VAR are: the unemployment and underemployment rates, female and male participation rates, and the indexes of formal employment and the real wage. Impulse response functions are analyzed to make inferences about the behavior of the variables in response to shocks to one of them. In addition, the paper develops models to represent the existence of participation and poverty traps, which, respectively, result from the interaction between unemployment, economic growth, inequality and participation and from the interplay between underemployment, poverty and children’s school desertion. The main results show that there exists an inverse relationship between formal employment and underemployment; that underemployment and female participation have persistent responses to shocks to unemployment; female and male participation decrease in response to a shock to the real wage; and underemployment and unemployment have persistent response to shocks to female participation. In general terms, the results show different responses along gender lines. Another result was that underemployment is the initial means of adjustment to recessionary periods and as such it is an early warning indicator of rising unemployment. The results show the prevalence of the discouraged and additional worker phenomena in the sample countries. The results have shown that underemployment can lead to persistent poverty and that it acts as a break on economic growth, which indicate the necessity of eliminating labor market segmentation by gender and directing attention to the particular needs of women (as well as those of young people, the elderly, the disabled, and ethnic minorities) with respect to their labor market participation.
J46|The voices and protests of China's labour NGOs and their effort to promote migrant worker rights|Labour NGOs in China are relatively new organizations that emerged in the 1990s and have spread during the 2000s. Migrant workers in China are weak both socially and economically and have been lacking ways of voicing grievances and protesting. Grassroots labour NGOs for migrant workers seem to be an efficient channel for their voices. This paper examines how labour NGOs emerged and how they function in the context of current Chinese society. This paper adopts the case study method to describe three NGOs in Beijing and Shenzhen. The paper shows that these NGOs are using different methods to resolve migrant worker problems. At the same time, they are voicing the migrants' grievances and protesting in their own ways.
J46|Welfare gains from the adoption of proportional taxation in a general-equilibrium model with a grey economy: the case of Bulgaria's 2008 flat tax reform|This paper provides a quantitative evaluation of the welfare effect of the introduc- tion of proportional taxation in Bulgaria in 2008, an effect that operates through the grey economy channel. Using a general-equilibrium model, augmented with informal sector, a computational experiment is performed to evaluate the welfare gain from the adoption of proportional taxation. The lower effective tax burden in the new tax regime produces a relocation of people into the official sector, stimulates investment, and increases output and consumption. Finally, under the flat tax regime, the size of the informal sector is smaller, and quantitatively consistent with OECD (2009) and European Commission (2012) figures.
