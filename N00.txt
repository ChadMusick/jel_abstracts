N00|How Cliometrics has Infiltrated Economics – and Helped to Improve the Discipline|Fenoaltea (2019) argues that cliometricians have failed as economists, historians, and economic historians. His argument is based on what he sees as a failure to appreciate the fine art of data gathering and what he perceives to be the lax attitude towards measurement. He embodies these complaints in the history of the creation of national income statistics, and the unforgiveable sin of economic historians who attempt to take those measurements backward in time. He concludes his polemic with his dream, that “cliometricians can take history and the humanities as seriously as we take economics, and lead us to the promised land.” (2019: 12) We are unsure of exactly what the “promised land” might be, but argue that any recent issue of Cliometrica, and any article in the Handbook of Cliometrics will provide ample evidence that cliometrics is alive and well, takes both history and economics very seriously, and does so with a careful and critical eye toward context (clio) and measurement (metrics). Herewith we defend the accomplishments and current robust health of cliometrics.
N00|Measuring Success: Clio and the Value of Database Creation|In a recent article Stefano Fenoaltea (2018) bemoaned the loss of respect and focus on the importance of creating databases, or “measurement” as he referred to it. Cliometrics has made and continues to make valuable contributions not just to the field of economic history, but economics in general. In particular, we focus on the contribution of cliometrics to the creation of datasets. We highlight several important cases in both the past and present, of recognized important contributions of new datasets to the economics discipline. We argue that Clio has continually focused on, and valued, the creation of new data sets and the clever and novel ways they have been exploited to further the frontiers of knowledge, and that these efforts are both appreciated and recognized.
N00|Análisis de la expansión urbana de Santa Cruz de Tenerife a través de sus liquidaciones de presupuestos de gastos (1959-1972)|La postración socioeconómica que había instaurado la autarquía tuvo matices propios en el caso de la economía insular al haberse cercenado el vínculo que había sido pieza clave en su trayectoria histórica, esto es, el libre acceso al mercado exterior. El Plan de Estabilización y Liberalización de 1959 supuso el comienzo de la alineación del país en el escenario internacional. El modo en que el municipio capitalino de Santa Cruz de Tenerife se benefició del nuevo marco derivó de la puesta en marcha del Plan Canarias, o la versión de los Planes de Desarrollo Económico y Social que se aplicó en Canarias, así como de la participación del municipio en los ingresos del Cabildo Insular mediante la denominada Carta Económica Municipal, que se tradujo en una fuente de financiación excepcional. Pero al resultar insuficientes dichas aportaciones se justificó el recurso al Banco de Crédito Local de España. Para contrastar esto, hemos utilizado los presupuestos de gastos liquidados del municipio, los presupuestos extraordinarios y los especiales de urbanismo. Los efectos de la estrategia inversora fueron significativos al instaurarse servicios asociados a la expansión y mejora del ámbito urbano-portuario, coincidiendo con la nueva inserción de la economía isleña en el mercado internacional.
N00|Higher Education Supply, Neighbourhood effects and Economic Welfare|This paper estimates neighbourhood effects in the local provision of higher education, and incorporates them in a welfare analysis of higher education supply. We use an own built dataset on the history of higher education institutions in Italy during 1861-2010 to implement an instrumental variables approach that exploits initial conditions in the pre-unitarian Italian states, interacted with post-unification comprehensive reforms of the university system. We provide robust evidence of local displacement between higher education supply in neighbouring provinces. These effects are mostly concentrated within the same field of study, the same region, and a spatial reach of 90 Km. We show that accounting for these displacement forces is important to evaluate the local economic returns of higher education supply. On average, higher education returns explain more than 4% of local value added per capita. Returns are very localised, and larger in provinces that host university hubs.
N00|Does Scientific Progress Affect Culture? A Digital Text Analysis|We study the interplay between scientific progress and culture through text analysis on a corpus of about eight million books, with the use of techniques and algorithms from machine learning. We focus on a specific scientific breakthrough, the theory of evolution through natural selection by Charles Darwin, and examine the diffusion of certain key concepts that characterized this theory in the broader cultural discourse and social imaginary. We find that some concepts in Darwin’s theory, such as Evolution, Survival, Natural Selection and Competition diffused in the cultural discourse immediately after the publication of On the Origins of Species. Other concepts such as Selection and Adaptation were already present in the cultural dialogue. Moreover, we document semantic changes for most of these concepts over time. Our findings thus show a complex relation between two key factors of long-term economic growth – science and culture. Considering the evolution of these two factors jointly can offer new insights to the study of the determinants of economic development, and machine learning is a promising tool to explore these relationships.
N00|Sovereign Bonds since Waterloo|This paper studies external sovereign bonds as an asset class. We compile a new database of 220,000 monthly prices of foreign-currency government bonds traded in London and New York between 1815 (the Battle of Waterloo) and 2016, covering 91 countries. Our main insight is that, as in equity markets, the returns on external sovereign bonds have been sufficiently high to compensate for risk. Real ex-post returns averaged 7% annually across two centuries, including default episodes, major wars, and global crises. This represents an excess return of around 4% above US or UK government bonds, which is comparable to stocks and outperforms corporate bonds. The observed returns are hard to reconcile with canonical theoretical models and with the degree of credit risk in this market, as measured by historical default and recovery rates. Based on our archive of more than 300 sovereign debt restructurings since 1815, we show that full repudiation is rare; the median haircut is below 50%.
N00|Pandemics, Places, and Populations: Evidence from the Black Death|The Black Death killed 40% of Europe's population between 1347-1352, making it one of the largest shocks in history. Despite its importance, little is known about its spatial effects and the effects of pandemics more generally. Using a novel dataset that provides information on spatial variation in Plague mortality at the city level, as well as various identification strategies, we explore the short-run and long-run impacts of the Black Death on city growth. On average, cities recovered their pre-Plague populations within two centuries. In addition, aggregate convergence masked heterogeneity in urban recovery. We show that both of these facts are consistent with a Malthusian model in which population returns to high-mortality locations endowed with more rural and urban fixed factors of production. Land suitability and natural and historical trade networks played a vital role in urban recovery. Our study highlights the role played by pandemics in determining both the sizes and placements of populations.
N00|Fertility and Modernity|We investigate the historical dynamics of the decline in fertility in Europe and its relation to measures of cultural and ancestral distance. We test the hypothesis that the decline of fertility was associated with the diffusion of social and behavioral changes from France, in contrast with the spread of the Industrial Revolution, where England played a leading role. We argue that the diffusion of the fertility decline and the spread of industrialization followed different patterns because societies at different relative distances from the respective innovators (the French and the English) faced different barriers to imitation and adoption, and such barriers were lower for societies that were historically and culturally closer to the innovators. We provide a model of fertility choices in which the transition from higher to lower levels of fertility is the outcome of a process of social innovation and social influence, whereby late adopters observe and learn about the novel behaviors, norms and practices introduced by early adopters at the frontier. In the empirical analysis we study the determinants of marital fertility in a sample of European populations and regions from 1830 t0 1970, and successfully test our theoretical predictions using measures of genetic distance between European populations and a novel data set of ancestral linguistic distances between European regions.
N00|Figuring out: the spread of Hindu-Arabic numerals in the European tradition of practical mathematics (13th-16th centuries)|The paper contributes to the literature focusing on the role of ideas, practices and human capital in pre-modern European economic development. It argues that studying the spread of Hindu-Arabic numerals among European practitioners allows to open up a perspective on a progressive transmission of useful knowledge from the commercial revolution to the early modern period. The analysis is based on an original database recording detailed information on over 1200 texts, both manuscript and printed. This database provides the most detailed reconstruction available of the European tradition of practical arithmetic from the late 13th to the end of the 16th century. It can be argued that this is the tradition which drove the adoption of Hindu-Arabic numerals in Europe. The dataset is analysed with statistical and spatial tools. Since the spread of these texts is grounded on inland patterns, the evidence suggests that a continuous transmission of useful knowledge may have played a role during the shift of the core of European trade from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic.
N00|Del Modelo de Industrialización por Sustitución de Importaciones (ISI) al Modelo Aperturista, adoptado en Colombia en 1991|Este documento busca responder por qué se vio rezagada la industria colombiana al momento de la apertura económica y cuáles fueron las causas de la caída del modelo de Industrialización por Sustitución de Importaciones (ISI). Para este fin, se presentan y contrastan los dos modelos económicos en la búsqueda de la industrialización en Colombia; acto seguido, se examina la incidencia del modelo de apertura económica después del año de 1991 a través de varios indicadores, lo cual permite evidenciar las causas de la debacle del modelo ISI. El documento se apoya principalmente en las publicaciones de Misas Arango, Bértola y Ocampo. *** This document seeks to answer why the Colombian industry was left behind at the time of economic opening and what were the causes for the fall of the Import ubstitution Industrialization model (ISI). To this end, the two economic models are presented and contrasted in the pursuit of industrialization in Colombia; then, the incidence of the model of economic opening after 1991 is examined through several indicators, which allows the causes of the debacle of the ISI model to be evidenced. The document relies mainly on the publications of Misas Arango, Bértola and Ocampo.
N00|Where is the Middle Class? Inequality, Gender and the Shape of the Upper Tail from 60 million English Death and Probate Records, 1892-2016|This paper analyses a newly constructed individual level dataset of every English death and probate from 1892-2016. The estimated top wealth shares match closely existing estimates. However, this analysis clearly shows that the 20th century's `Great Equalization' of wealth stalled in mid-century. The probate rate, which captures the proportion of English with any significant wealth at death rose from 10% in the 1890s to 40% by 1950 and has stagnated to 2016. Despite the large declines in the wealth share of the top 1%, from 73% to 20%, the median English person died with almost nothing throughout. All changes in inequality after 1950 involve a reshuffling of wealth within the top 30%. Further, I find that a log-linear distribution fits the empirical data better than a Pareto power law. Finally, I show that the top wealth shares are increasingly and systematically male as one ascends in wealth, 1892-1992, but this has equalized over the 20th century.

N00|Elite Violence and Elite Numeracy in Europe from 500 to 1900 CE: A Co-Evolution?|We develop a new indicator for elite numeracy in order to investigate trends in European elite numeracy since the 6th century CE and describe its co-evolution with elite violence over this period. During the early medieval period, Western Europe had no advantage over the east, but the development of relative violence levels changed this. After implementing an instrumental variable strategy and a battery of robustness tests, we find a substantial relationship and conclude that violence had a detrimental impact on human capital formation. The drastic increase in human capital since the High Middle Ages was at least partially due to declining violence.
N00|Hidden Wealth|Sharp declines in wealth-concentration occurred across Europe and the US during the 20th century. But this stylized fact is based on declared wealth. It is possible that today the richest are not less rich but rather that they are hiding much of their wealth. This paper proposes a method to measure this hidden wealth, in any form. In England, 1920-1992, elites are concealing 20-32% of their wealth. Among dynasties, hidden wealth, independent of declared wealth, predicts appearance in the Offshore Leaks Database of 2013-6, house values in 1999, and Oxbridge attendance, 1990-2016. Accounting for hidden wealth eliminates one-third of the observed decline of top 10% wealth-share over the past century.

N00|From state resource allocation to a 'low-level equilibrium trap': re-evaluation of economic performance of Mao's China, 1949-78|This paper provides a full picture of how Maoist economy actually performed. We argue that Mao’s China neither undertook a structural change towards industrialisation nor generated a sustainable growth from 1949 to 1978.2 With fatal shortcomings of a planned economic system imported from the Soviet Union – the ‘principle-agent’ problem and information asymmetry for the bureaucracy, and disincentives for producers – China’s economy remained not only deliberately unbalanced but also predominantly rural until the 1980s. More importantly, the Maoist economy was not designed to enrich and empower the masses in society. Instead, all key consumer goods including food, clothing and housing were strictly rationed. The material life of ordinary citizens in China saw no improvement. This paper aims to reveal the harsh reality of the Maoist economy with solid evidence and theoretical explanation.

N00|Past meets present in policymaking: The Federal Reserve and the U.S. money market, 1913-1929|This paper contributes to our understanding of how the past is invoked in the present in the realm of economic policy. It focuses on the systemic financial reform envisaged by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which was supposed to displace the powerful New York call market with a new discount or acceptance market as the centrepiece of the U.S. money market. The paper shows that the past was remembered and ignored in ways that were crucial in generating “lessons” about the necessity and possibility of radical financial reform in the United States. It reveals the strong commitment to these lessons by prominent officials in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in designing and implementing policies for reform. Their commitment proved to be unwavering even in the face of mounting criticism that their policies were failing to promote the development of an acceptance market. By focussing on the anaemic demand for acceptances as a key obstacle to reform, I suggest that policymakers were so fixated on the past that they overlooked the potential implications of unexpected changes in the US money market since the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act. Thus, they responded with frustration to the failure of their efforts to achieve the financial reform envisaged by that Act without contemplating any serious alternative to it.
N00|Surplus Dutch Colonial Big Profits in Indonesia 1878-1942|"Objective - This study aims to analyse the Colonial Drain process to prove the colonial land profits based on the theoretical framework. The Surplus Colonial Profit is conceptualized through the term ""colonial drain"". The study uses historical economics based on the theories of Lenin Imperialism and Gramsci's Hegemony. Methodology/Technique - This research will draw upon both primary and secondary sources. The primary sources include official and organizational publications including The Netherlands-Indies. The secondary sources include all relevant published and unpublished materials collected from diverse sources. Finding - The calculation of the surplus of colonial profits is scrutinized using historical causality by Gramsci's Hegemony theory to strengthen the data where the profits are obtained from public and private companies, and beyond predictions, ""private profits"" became the biggest commodity. Research Limitations / Implications - This research provides a basis for determining the direction of Indonesia's future economic development, and can also be a consideration of recent Indonesian lawsuits regarding Dutch debt, and can be a useful for reference material for further research. Novelty - Royal Dutch wealth was obtained from international trade and shipping of goods to Europe and ranges from 5.29 billion in 1878-1939 in the trade, services, international shipping sectors for and from Indonesia. This means that about 1 billion guilders missed from the recording of previous research that was around 4.12 billion."
N00|The Past’s Long Shadow. A Systematic Review and Network Analysis of Cliometrics or the New Economic History|During the interwar years, Japanese industrialisation accelerated alongside the expansion of industrial exports to regional markets. Trade blocs in the interwar years were used as an instrument of imperial power to foster exports and as a substitute for productivity to encourage industrial production. The historiography on Japanese industrialisation in the interwar years describes heavy industries’ interests in obtaining access to wider markets to increase economies of scale and reduce unit costs. However, this literature provides no quantitative evidence that proves the success of those mechanisms in expanding exports. In this paper we scrutinise how Japan—a relatively poor country—used colonial as well as informal power interventions to expand regional markets for its exports, especially for the most intensive human capital sector of the industrializing economy.

N00|Folklore|Folklore is the collection of traditional beliefs, customs, and stories of a community, passed through the generations by word of mouth. This vast expressive body, studied by the corresponding discipline of folklore, has evaded the attention of economists. In this study we do four things that reveal the tremendous potential of this corpus for understanding comparative development and culture. First, we introduce and describe a unique catalogue of folklore that codes the presence of thousands of motifs for roughly 1,000 pre-industrial societies. Second, we use a dictionary-based approach to elicit group-specific measures of various traits related to the natural environment, institutional framework, and mode of subsistence. We establish that these proxies are in accordance with the ethnographic record, and illustrate how to use a group's oral tradition to quantify non-extant characteristics of preindustrial societies. Third, we use folklore to uncover the historical cultural values of a group. Doing so allows us to test various influential conjectures among social scientists including the original affluent society, the culture of honor among pastoralists, the role of family in extended kinship systems and the intensity of trade and rule-following norms in politically centralized group. Finally, we explore how cultural norms inferred via text analysis of oral traditions predict contemporary attitudes and beliefs.
N00|Technological Progress and Health Convergence: The Case of Penicillin in Post-War Italy|"Throughout history, technological progress has transformed population health, but the distributional effects of these gains are unclear. New substitutes for older, more expensive health technologies can produce convergence in population health outcomes, but may also be prone to ""elite capture"" leading to divergence. This paper studies the case of penicillin using detailed mortality statistics and exploiting its sharply-timed introduction in Italy after World War II. We find penicillin reduced both the mean and standard deviation of infectious diseases mortality, leading to substantial convergence across disparate regions of Italy. Our results do not appear to be confounded by competing risks or mortality patterns associated with World War II."

We argue that China’s extraordinary economic growth comes from these special deals. Local political leaders do so because they derive personal benefits, either political or monetary, from providing special deals. Competition between local governments limits the predatory effects of special deals.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N00|From financial crisis to revolution: Russia 1899-1905|What are the channels by which financial crises lead to social unrest? This paper examines the period between the major Russian financial crisis of 1899-1902 and the Russian Revolution of 1905. Using newly-constructed aggregate-level data and narrative evidence, this paper finds that in response to the crisis, the Russian government and industry transferred income and wealth from ordinary workers to industrialists and investors. The recipients of transfers weathered the crisis well and profited during the recovery, while employees’ wages and wealth fell behind. The evidence also suggests that businesses required their staff to work more intensively. Ultimately, the distributional effect of the response to the crisis seems to have contributed to the occurrence of labour strikes which culminated in the revolution.

N00|Sustainability and Wellbeing: A Text Analysis of New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, Official Yearbooks and Ministerial Documents|Recent advances in natural language processing and semantic analysis methods are enabling scholars to analyse text extensively. These techniques have not only minimized the margins of error arising from missing data from a traditionally conducted discourse analysis but also permitted reproducibility of research results. In this paper, we use several text analysis methods to analyse the evolution of the terms ‘sustainability’ and ‘wellbeing’ (SaW) from parliamentary debates (Hansard), New Zealand Official Yearbooks (NZOYBs) and ministerial documents over 125 years. The term ‘welfare’ has existed in the NZOYBs and Hansard text since the start of our analysis (1893), with a steadily increasing trend until the mid-1980s. The term ‘wellbeing’ gained momentum in mid-1930s and has been linked strongly with ‘sustainability’ in the following decades. Our analysis re-emphasizes the importance of the Brundtland Report (‘Our Common Future’) which acted as a catalyst to the sustainable movement in late 1980s. ‘Sustainability’ and ‘wellbeing’ then began to appear in conjunction. Our analysis includes the finding that SaW differ significantly when political parties are considered.
N00|Demand-Led Growth Theory in a Classical Framework: Its Superiority, Its Limitations, and Its Explanatory Power|The main purpose of this paper is to show that the Keynesian-Kaleckian demand-led theory of growth proposed within the classical framework of prices and distribution as articulated by Sraffa (1960), is superior to the neoclassical supply-driven theory in explaining economic growth. After showing the fundamental theoretical problem with the neoclassical supply-driven approach to growth, we expound a demand-led model of growth that abandons ‘steady-state’ and, instead, adopts an ‘historical approach’ in which the data is specified for historical periods of time. The model incorporates the contribution of technical progress to demand-led growth and, thereby, provides the basis to identify the most important political, social, and institutional developments that historically explain growth and economic development since the advent of capitalism. Our historical analysis shows how demand-led growth theory can provide the foundation for a new and more coherent interpretation of the history of economic development.
N00|Managing a Century of Debt|This paper provides a consistent series for the Irish national debt since the foundation of the state in 1922. It also provides a continuous series for bond yields over the same period. The paper examines the factors behind the fluctuations in the debt burden over almost a century. The management of the debt burden by the Irish authorities has evolved over time, seeking to minimise both the burden on the economy and the risks which the debt represented to the state. The paper also examines how the cost of borrowing for the Irish government compared to that for the UK and, since the break with sterling, for Germany. This cost of borrowing was, in turn affected by developments in the domestic economy.
N00|The Next World and the New World: Relief, Migration, and the Great Irish Famine|Ireland on the eve of the Great Famine was a poor and backward economy. The Great Irish Famine of the 1840s is accordingly often considered the classic example of Malthusian population economics in action. However, unlike most historical famines, the Great Famine was not the product of a harvest shortfall, but of a major ecological disaster. Because there could be no return to the status quo ante, textbook famine relief in the form of public works or food aid was not enough. Fortunately, in an era of open borders mass emigration helped contain excess mortality, subject to the limitation that the very poorest could not afford to leave. In general, the authorities did not countenance publicly assisted migration. This paper discusses the lessons to be learned from two exceptional schemes for assisting destitute emigrants during and in the wake of the Famine.
N00|Regional prices in early twentieth-century Spain: a country-product-dummy approach|Abstract This paper explores regional price variation in early twentieth-century Spain. Using consumer price information from the bulletins published by the Instituto de Reformas Sociales between 1910 and 1920, we build a dataset with a total of 40,581 quotes covering 22 items for each of the 49 provinces. We then estimate provincial price levels following a country-product-dummy (CPD) approach. Our findings suggest that spatial price variation existed across Spanish provinces. In line with the Balassa–Samuelson conjecture, consumer prices and productivity levels were somewhat related. Additionally, it is shown that prices rose in all provinces after the outbreak of World War I. Even more, it appears that this demand-shock brought about spatial asymmetries in price growth.
N00|Exploitation, Human Nature, and Social Institutions|Exploitation exists where some gain advantage at others' expense. Its root force is found in human biology, the fact that as a socially-reproducing species, humans compete for mates and the exploitation of others can generate a competitive advantage. Social institutions direct and channel this competitiveness. Thus, during 97-98 percent of our species existence, competitiveness was not expressed by accumulating material wealth and political power, but by being good warriors and foragers, being cooperative, and being generous. However, with the rise of civilization and the state, elites gained ownership and control over the means of production, thereby subjugating all others and appropriating their surplus. Although violence stood behind this exploitation, ideology served as the principal political tool for its maintenance. It is the force of ideology that clarifies why, even with free speech, free press, free assembly, and the franchise, exploitation continues to exist.
N00|Spatial Patterns of Development: A Meso Approach|Over the past two decades, the literature on comparative development has moved from country-level to within-country analyses. The questions asked have expanded in scope as economists have used satellite images of light density at night and other big spatial data to proxy for development at the desired level. The focus has also shifted from uncovering correlations to identifying causal relations, using elaborate econometric techniques including spatial regression discontinuity designs. In this review, we show how the combination of geographic information systems with insights from disciplines ranging from the earth sciences to linguistics and history has transformed the research landscape on the roots of the spatial patterns of development. We discuss the limitations of the luminosity data and associated econometric techniques and conclude by offering some thoughts on future research.
N00|Traditional Agricultural Practices and the Sex Ratio Today|We study the historical origins of cross-country differences in the male-to-female sex ratio. Our analysis focuses on the use of the plough in traditional agriculture. In societies that did not use the plough, women tended to participate in agriculture as actively as men. By contrast, in societies that used the plough, men specialized in agricultural work, due to the physical strength needed to pull the plough or control the animal that pulls it. We hypothesize that this difference caused plough-using societies to value boys more than girls. Today, this belief is reflected in male-biased sex ratios, which arise due to sex-selective abortion or infanticide, or gender-differences in access to family resources, which results in higher mortality rates for girls. Testing this hypothesis, we show that descendants of societies that traditionally practiced plough agriculture today have higher average male-to-female sex ratios. We find that this effect systematically increases in magnitude and statistical significance as one looks at older cohorts. Estimates using instrumental variables confirm our findings from multivariate OLS analysis.
N00|Ancestral Characteristics of Modern Populations| We construct a database, with global coverage, that provides measures of the cultural and environmental characteristics of the pre-industrial ancestors of the world’s current populations. In this paper, we describe the construction of the database, including the underlying data, the procedure to produce the estimates, and the structure of the final data. We then provide illustrations of some of the variation in the data and provide an illustration of how the data can be used.
N00|Historical Legacies and African Development|"As Africa's role on the global stage is rising, so does the need to understand the shadow of history on the continent's economy and polity. We discuss recent works that shed light on Africa's colonial and precolonial legacies. The emerging corpus is remarkably interdisciplinary. Archives, ethnographic materials, georeferenced censuses, surveys, and satellite imagery are some of the sources often combined to test influential conjectures put forward in African historiography. Exploiting within-country variation and employing credible, albeit mostly local, identification techniques, this recent literature has uncovered strong evidence of historical continuity as well as instances of rupture in the evolution of the African economy. The exposition proceeds in reverse chronological order. Starting from the colonial period, which has been linked to almost all of Africa's post-independence maladies, we first review works that uncover the lasting legacies of colonial investments in infrastructure and human capital and quantify the role of various extractive institutions, such as indirect rule and oppression associated with concessionary agreements. Second, we discuss the long-lasting impact of the ""Scramble for Africa"" which led to ethnic partitioning and the creation of artificial modern states. Third, we cover studies on the multi-faceted legacy of the slave trades. Fourth, we analyze the contemporary role of various precolonial, ethnic-specific, institutional and social traits, such as political centralization. We conclude by offering some thoughts on what we view as open questions."

N00|Trade and foreign direct investment in the Baltic Sea Region, 1990-2015: lessons from attempts at regional integration in post-communist Europe|"""It has been suggested that regionalism is defined “as an economic process whereby economic flows grow more rapidly among a given group of states [in the same region] than between these states and those located elsewhere” [1]. In this paper we approach the economic underpinnings for the Baltic Sea Region by analysing the developments with regard to trade and investment in the quarter of a century that has passed since the fall of the communist regimes that divided the European continent. The paper offers a novel use and presentation of data on two potentially important factors for regional integration; that is, trade and foreign direct investment. It adds to our understanding by combining national data with insights offered from case studies. The main question asked is whether developments with regard to investments and trade are in congruence with the notion of the building of an integrated region? In short, does it make economic sense to talk about a Baltic Sea Region or is the east-west divide still omnipresent? The question of what drives integration is pertinent against the backdrop of current discourse where globalization and factor mobility are increasingly being questioned. In the light of this it is of interest to see what lessons can be drawn from this very recent experiment in (re)uniting a once divided continent. For example, to what extent have the developments with regard to foreign direct investments proved sustainable? What sectors are leading the way and which are lagging? What divisions remain to be tackled? The structure of the paper is such that it starts off with an introduction followed by an overview of the policy initiatives taken to (re)unite this particular part of Europe. In the section to follow, the starting point for potential integration is outlined as we look at the economic reforms that moved the region from Cold War isolation to a process of economic transformation. The main thrust of the paper then comes in a section where developments with regard to trade and foreign direct investment, in turn, are analysed through a novel use of existing sources. The concluding section summarizes the lessons learned from this episode of (attempted) regional integration. In particular we believe there are important insights with regard to the relevance of existing theories on foreign direct investments. Also, the post- communist developments cast new light on the (side) effects of the much heralded policies with regard to mass privatization."""

N00|A British merchant in Turkey: Freeman of the Levant Company and Consul Donald Sandison at Bursa, 1795-1868|"""Great Britain was effective in influencing the Ottoman Empire with commercial interests. Anglo- Ottoman commercial practices strengthened diplomatic relations and early British merchants carried diplomatic mission as well through the British Levant Company. This ended by the 1820s with the abolishing of the Levant Company. British merchants operating in the Ottoman dominions increased after the second decade of the nineteenth century and Anglo-Ottoman Commercial Agreement of 1838 made a positive contribution to this increase in coming decades. Moreover, diplomatic missions extended to the inland trade and production centres. Donald Sandison was one of the British/Scottish merchants settled in Constantinople, the capital of Ottoman Empire and operated his commercial activities from the early nineteenth century. He established business partnership and provided protection to some local Christian and Armenians through the British Embassy. He was initially a representative of the British East India Company and later admitted to be a member of the British Levant Company in 1817 and therefore, he was one of the privileged freemen of the company prior to his consular post. Sandison was appointed salaried consul for Bursa with the liberty to trade after operating as a merchant for more than two decades. He acted as the first consul to Bursa, one of the earliest industrial city, between 1838 and 1868. Sandison’s consular post were very significant as Bursa was a caravan terminal for the silk trade route and a silk cultivation centre that provided domestic and international demand of raw silk and silk fabric. British existence at Bursa was important during the period of Sandison as reeling silk industry developed due to the demand from European weavers and appreciation of British silk textile products in Ottoman market. Sandison also was one of the foreign merchants provided technology and for the industry to local weavers and carried out trade between British and Ottoman market. British foreign policy to the Ottoman Empire was largely economic within the Commercial Convention of 1838 after 1840s shaped by the information of consuls in a certain city or region, it aimed to keep the post for long years to have reliable and continuous information. The role of consuls in the Levant was mainly observing commercial potential and agricultural production of the region or the city. They were both diplomatic and commercial agents providing these information for shaping commercial strategy of Britain for a particular region. Therefore, reports were essential for British manufacturing seeking raw materials from the Ottoman market or aiming to penetrate the Ottoman market with semi-finished or finished goods. This bibliographic study focuses on an oversea British community member at Constantinople as a merchant by the first quarter of the nineteenth century and then a prestigious position, consul of Bursa for the commercial interest of Great Britain by the second quarter. Therefore, his life history and professional career is analysed in two periods; the first period covers Sandison’s commercial operations as a merchant of the Levant Company in Constantinople after the second decade of the nineteenth century. His business was closely related with the economic and political fluctuations of the Ottoman Empire as well as operations of the British Levant Company. Dissolution of the Levant Company in 1825 and uprising and later abolition of military units called Janissaries in 1826 necessitated him to reshape and re-establish his business at the end of 1820s."""
N00|Build it and they will come? Secondary railways and population density in French Algeria|"""By the end of the 19th century, the Algerian railway network played a crucial role as an instrument for settlement expansion and colonial control. A growing amount of research shows that railway expansion at this time allowed previously marginalized regions to participate in international trade and thereby boosting growth. Yet few studies point out that it also increased marginalization and reinforced dual economies in areas that did not experience access to the infrastructure or that did not have the required economies to profit from and engage in international markets. This paper looks into the effect of gaining railroad access on the indigenous and settler population density in French Algeria during this period. By taking advantage of unique territorial population data at a sub-municipal level and digitized historical colonization maps in the Constantine region, it measures the effect of gaining railway access in relatively isolated areas – areas in which the infrastructure arrived later – using a differences- in-differences methodology. Results show that the indigenous population responded positively to railroad infrastructure only in those regions where settlers were already located while the settler density did not respond to the infrastructure. To provide an explanation, it then analyzes freight and passenger transport at a more detailed level. In line with literature on Algerian railways, the results suggest that the potential gains were restricted by tariffs, which mirrored Constantine’s difficulty to engage in scale economies due to geographical restrictions, such as the limited fertile land and the vulnerability of agricultural production to climate."""
N00|Labour contract auctions in 19th-century Cornish tin mining|"""This paper considers the organisation of labour in the Cornish Tin mining industry in the 19 uses primary records of labour bargains made at Wheal Hearle mine near St Just in the early 1860s. One of the main points of interest is that these bargains were allocated by auction on a monthly basis. The work was of two types, “tutwork” and “tribute”, tutwork was work involved in digging levels, shafts etc within the mine whereas tribute was the payment for the raising of ore. Tutwork would usually be a rate per fathom dug, Tribute a sort of revenue share, were the group of miners would get so many shillings in the pound (value) of the tin ore. The paper will examine the relative variability of pay for the two types of work and the extent to which miners would switch between the two types of work. The paper will also consider further implications of these arrangements, using data to examine the extent to which miners were able to use knowledge (of geology) to make good decisions on which bargains to bid for. It will do this by examining the structure of the distribution of earnings, and the extent to which groups of miners were able to earn persistently above the mean."""
N00|Income tax and war inflation: was the ‘blood tax’ compensated by taxing the rich?|"""Major warfare and mass mobilization during the two World Wars have been associated to increasing top rates in income taxes in most Western countries, which points towards increases in their progressivity. We argue, however, that this war‐ related effect is less clear‐cut than previously thought. Wartime inflation could have exerted a counteracting impact by pushing citizens into higher tax brackets or including new individuals from the bottom of the income distribution into being taxpayers. In order to address this possibility, we study the developments in the marginal and effective tax rates over the income distribution of a sample of developed countries, both involved and neutral during World War I and World War II. Our preliminary results provide initial support to the hypothesis that inflation partially counteracted the progressive effect of increases in top marginal tax rates."""
N00|Transatlantic technology transfer: Coal mine ventilation, 1870-1910|"""The Great Divergence debate emphasized the “geographic good luck” of European proximity to coal deposits. We consider the role, not of luck, but of the development and diffusion of coal production technology. Mechanical ventilation began as a response to methane risks in Belgian mines and soon spread to the Ruhr valley, Great Britain and Pennsylvania, all places considered in this paper. Engineers tested different machines and publicized the results, which were translated in the mining press elsewhere. Property rights to innovation proved flexible when necessary. Mechanical mine ventilation exemplified the best of Western industrial science: inquisitive, open, flexible, and responsive to empirical results whether good or bad. It was not luck but the Western approach to new technology that enabled coal exploitation."""

N00|The Crown's ecclesiastical creditors: State loans from the English Church, 1307-77|"""As the Crown pursued an expansionist foreign policy in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, so its traditional sources of income were unable to meet the costs of its wars. The three Edwards thus resorted to borrowing money from native and alien creditors to finance the defence of the kingdom. When the Italian banks collapsed in the 1340s, Edward III turned to his subjects for state loans to fund the Hundred Years War. These loans were a substitute form of parliamentary taxation, which the Crown requested from its subjects when the realm was under attack. By basing its pleas on necessitas, the Crown imposed an obligation upon the subject to meet the royal request. State loans were advanced with the subject’s full consent; of a value in accordance to their standing in society; and interest-free. This paper traces the origins of state loans from the clergy; explores when and why they became a regular demand; how they were negotiated and repaid; and reveals the identities of the Crown’s main ecclesiastical creditors. In financial terms, state loans were a minor source of Crown revenue. Their combined value equated to around 10% of the total royal expenditure on the defence of the kingdom during the reign of Edward III, and even less under his father. When viewed in isolation, the clergy lent around £50,000 between 1307 and 1377, a sum equivalent to 1-2% of the total costs of the military campaigns. But to judge clerical loans simply in terms of their negligible monetary value fundamentally misinterprets their significance, which can be measured by their impact on the political relationship between the Crown and the clergy. State loans afforded ecclesiastics the opportunity of wielding greater political influence; acquiring new charters; resolving grievances; and protecting the interests of their abbey. For many ecclesiastics, the short-term financial risks associated with lending were substantially outweighed by these potential rewards."""
N00|London Fog: A Century of Pollution and Mortality, 1866-1965|This study provides new evidence on the impact of air pollution in a high-pollution high-mortality setting: London over the century from 1866-1965. I identify pollution effects by comparing detailed new weekly mortality data to the timing of London's famous fog events, which trapped emissions in the city. My results show that acute pollution exposure due to fog events accounted for at least one out of every 200 deaths in London during this century. I also provide the first well-identified evidence that the presence of two infectious diseases of the respiratory system, measles and tuberculosis, increased the mortality effects of pollution. As a result, success in reducing the disease burden in London in the 20th century lowered the impact of pollution exposure and shifted the distribution of pollution effects across age groups. These interactions have implications for developing countries, where both diseases remain important.
N00|Evolving Central Bank thinking: the Irish Central Bank, 1943-69|"""The lens through which a Central Bank views the economy and macroeconomic policy affects their analysis of economic performance, their assessment of government policies, their role as policymakers and ultimately economic growth and performance. Economic ideas matter. In keeping with this idea, this paper examines how the thinking of the Irish Central Bank, evolved over a period of major transformation (1943-1969) in the Irish economy and intellectual developments in monetary theory and policy. In doing so, the paper seeks to address the gaps identified by Brownlow (2010) in our understanding of “the precise intellectual influences on the development of the Bank’s economic thinking” and to evaluate whether or not “Ireland’s monetary authorities merely copied British policy practice rather than considered the implications for Ireland of the emerging academic research within monetary economics” (Brownlow 2010, p. 320) This paper adopts an interpretivist approach to the Bank’s Annual Reports from their introduction in 1943 until 1969 to uncover the Bank’s evolving thinking. In this regard, it extends the narrative work completed by Moynihan (1975). We adopt the view that the annual reports, in terms of the data that the Bank collected and published, the evidence it used, its analysis and its commentary on the Irish economy and international events reveal evolving thinking and understanding of how monetary factors affect the economy, how government policy interacts with monetary matters and the role of the Bank and monetary policy in a small but open economy. Where relevant, we also support our analysis with archival research. Our preliminary analysis points to an evolution in the level of analysis, critique and the application of economic ideas. Although the Bank’s governors were initially influenced by UK Treasury thinking, they were also guided by international economists. We note that over time the Central Bank became progressively shaped and influenced by international academic developments in monetary theory and policy, which repositioned them away from UK monetary thinking. While the Central Bank Act 1942 required the Bank to “publish informative material” regarding monetary and credit problems, we find that the content of the reports evolved very rapidly. The Governor (and subsequent governors) began to publish an annual report immediately and by the second report, the Bank had started to comment on macroeconomic conditions. By 1947 the Bank’s Report began to comment on government policy. In this regard they provide clear evidence that the Irish Central Bank differed significantly in how it perceived itself and its role, from the Bank of England at this time. The latter’s reports did not include either analysis or commentary as it wished to ensure that its interpretation of events and their exposition of current problems, would not cause embarrassment to the government.

N00|Institutional shocks and competition in Portuguese commercial banking in the long run, 1960-2015|"""The Portuguese economy passed through two massive institutional shocks in the period from 1960 to 2015: in 1975, with one of the largest nationalisation programmes ever in the Western world; and in the late-1980s, with one of the largest privatisation programmes ever in the world. We assess how these shocks affected competition in commercial banking through statistical tests of the Panzar-Rosse type. Interesting conclusions result, namely that the nationalisation period did not imply a reduction in competition and that the privatisation period might have meant a reduction in competition. We provide a few hypotheses to understand these counterintuitive results."""
N00|The Saint-Simonians and the birth of social justice in France|This paper concerns the birth of the idea of social justice, which in France dates to the 19th century. It argues that the idea of social justice was able to emerge in France due to particular conditions, which were met for the first time by the Saint-Simonians. We first shed light on the transition in France from a commercial system to one marked by increasing industrialization, which raised new questions regarding economic justice and the composition of ownership. The Saint-Simonians were among the first to criticize this new composition, and to seek a means to organize society on a fair basis. We then explain how the Saint-Simonians came to theorize this new organization: according to them, the value of things lies in work. The difference from the classical framework, which is also utilitarian, is that they posit an opposition between workers and idlers: each and every individual must be useful to society. Finally, we analyse how the Saint-Simonians identify this opposition as existing throughout history, on which basis they not only justify their innovative views on social justice, but legitimize their project as a whole.
N00|On commercial gluts, or when the Saint-Simonians adopted Jean-Baptiste Say’s view|A standard reading in the history of economic thought sets the classical stream of economists drawing upon the influence of Adam Smith (Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo, etc.) in opposition to a “black box” of social thinkers (Louis Blanc, Fourierism, Saint-Simonianism, Sismondi, Robert Owen). This article, however, argues that, in the first quarter of the 19th century, the Saint-Simonians and the liberal economist Jean-Baptiste Say can be seen to adopt convergent views during the famous controversy about commercial gluts. First, we show that the Saint-Simonians and Say both see undersupply and lack of industry as causes of gluts. Next, we assert that their intellectual affinities are also visible in their belief that increasing production remains an appropriate solution for gluts. Finally, this convergence is explained by their common belief in industrialism: Saint-Simonianism is embedded in a French industrialist tradition for which Say can be taken as representative. We argue that their common belief in industry explains their convergence.

N00|Expenditures and food consumption of a patrician family in nineteenth-century Trentino: the Bossi Fedrigotti|This paper aims to analyse the expenditure and consumption of a noble family from Trentino, the Bossi Fedrigotti, in the nineteenth century. The origin and evolution of the family assets are traced from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century as they shifted from transport to trade, from trade to finance, and finally from finance to agriculture. The research is based on the household budgets and investigates the type, composition and variations in expenditures during two benchmark decades, 1835-44 and 1855-64. The relatively small share of expenses for food as compared to leisure, cultural activities, charity and conspicuous consumption reflects the family’s quest for social status and reputation, leading to the obtainment of a noble title in the eighteenth century. The Bossi Fedrigotti represented a pillar in the economic system of Rovereto, which they actively supported through a variety of economic and non-economic actions, helping the city to prosper and advance.
N00|Managing a Century of Debt|This paper provides a consistent series for the Irish national debt since the foundation of the state. It also provides a continuous series for bond yields over the same period. The paper examines the factors behind the fluctuations in the debt burden over almost a century. The management of the debt burden by the Irish authorities has evolved over time, seeking to minimise both the burden on the economy and the risks which the debt represented to the state. The paper also examines how the cost of borrowing for the Irish government compared to that for the UK and, since the break with sterling, for Germany. This cost of borrowing was, in turn affected by developments in the domestic economy.
N00|The wealth of the Swedish peasant farmer class 1750–1900: Composition and distribution|Using about 1,730 probate inventories, this paper studies the wealth of peasant farmers in Sweden for the years 1750, 1800, 1850 and 1900. The Gini coefficient for the farmers’ wealth grew from 0.46 in 1750 to 0.73 in 1900. Average wealth grew rapidly, tripling over the nineteenth century. Looking in greater depth at four local areas (Kullings, Sjuhundra, Lagunda, and Bara hundreds), we show that over the period the diversity of farmers’ wealth grew, as did their financial sophistication; borrowing and lending patterns became more complex and the use of banks and other institutions grew while personal financial transactions became rarer. Farmers who lived close to the major grain markets in Stockholm and the mining district Bergslagen were wealthier than others, as were farmers on fertile plains and, in 1900, those living in coastal areas. Increased market access by 1900 – in terms of cities and foreign demand – meant that farmers well-placed in terms of geography and infrastructure benefited much more than farmers on what became the periphery, as regional inequality within the farmer class increased. Over the nineteenth century land prices increased much more in some areas than in others, but in the country as a whole they rose steeply.
N00|A Workers’ Revolution in Sweden? Exploring Economic Growth and Distributional Change with Detailed Data on Construction Workers’ Wages, 1831–1900|The impact of the transition to modern economic growth on the distribution of income is widely debated. The experience of early industrializers like Britain and the US has informed much of the debate, lending support to the idea embedded in the models of Kuznets and Lewis that real wages of laborers tend to lag behind the growth of GDP per capita in the early stages of economic development. We examine the impact growth on workers in Sweden using a new dataset on daily wages for helpers, carpenters, masons, and teamsters over the 1831–1900 period. The data has a uniquely detailed geographical coverage, including a broad set of places in the countryside as well as towns. Our new series shows that real wage growth began in the mid-1850s, that the average yearly increase was substantial and superseding GDP per capita growth after 1880, that it was larger for unskilled helpers than higher-skilled groups, and was present in the countryside and urban areas alike. A comparison with Northern Europe shows that unskilled workers in Sweden benefited to a much greater extent from economic growth, highlighting the importance of paying careful attention to distributional issues when comparing living standards across countries.
N00|Traditional agricultural practices and the sex ratio today|We study the historical origins of cross-country differences in the male-to-female sex ratio. Our analysis focuses on the use of the plough in traditional agriculture. In societies that did not use the plough, women tended to participate in agriculture as actively as men. By contrast, in societies that used the plough, men specialized in agricultural work, due to the physical strength needed to pull the plough or control the animal that pulls it. We hypothesize that this difference caused plough-using societies to value boys more than girls. Today, this belief is reflected in male-biased sex ratios, which arise due to sex-selective abortion or infanticide, or gender-differences in access to family resources, which results in higher mortality rates for girls. Testing this hypothesis, we show that descendants of societies that traditionally practiced plough agriculture today have higher average male-to-female sex ratios. We find that this effect systematically increases in magnitude and statistical significance as one looks at older cohorts.

N00|Linking Individuals Across Historical Sources: a Fully Automated Approach|Linking individuals across historical datasets relies on information such as name and age that is both non-unique and prone to enumeration and transcription errors. These errors make it impossible to find the correct match with certainty. In the first part of the paper, we suggest a fully automated probabilistic method for linking historical datasets that enables researchers to create samples at the frontier of minimizing type I (false positives) and type II (false negatives) errors. The first step guides researchers in the choice of which variables to use for linking. The second step uses the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, a standard tool in statistics, to compute the probability that each two records correspond to the same individual. The third step suggests how to use these estimated probabilities to choose which records to use in the analysis. In the second part of the paper, we apply the method to link historical population censuses in the US and Norway, and use these samples to estimate measures of intergenerational occupational mobility. The estimates using our method are remarkably similar to the ones using IPUMS’, which relies on hand linking to create a training sample. We created an R code and a Stata command that implement this method.

N00|The Municipal Treasury of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1936-1958)|The Canary Islands were not outside to the deep and prolonged crisis of autarchy, and the departure of thousands of islanders across the Atlantic was perhaps the most visible sign. To the difficult circumstances of the Civil War and Second World War, was added an autocratic policy that in the case of the island's economy had its own aspect, because it cut the link that had been essential piece in its historical becoming, its free access to the international market. In addition, the vulnerability of the islands to the outside pressure, its possible occupation by Allied forces and the demand of commodities (food, energy), determined that during much of the period the economy was ruled by the military authority, based in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, ancient capital in times of the single province (until 1927). This paper studies the treasury of this city with the purpose of pondering the meaning of this process
N00|The Dynamics of Inequality in the Human Story: A Brief Sketch|Teaching contemporary inequality can be significantly enriched by being nested in its dynamics over the course of human history. This essay is intended to provide those teaching inequality with a brief sketch of: a) the original human condition of a high degree of equality that endured for 97 to 98 percent of our species' existence as foragers and early agriculturalists; b) the origin of extreme inequality that accompanied the rise of states and civilization about 5,500 years ago as weapons technology enabled a few to subjugate the producers; and c) why, despite political democracy, extreme inequality persists.
N00|Shocking Racial Attitudes: Black G.I.s in Europe|Can attitudes towards minorities, an important cultural trait, be changed? We show that the presence of African American soldiers in the UK during World War II reduced anti-minority prejudice, a result of the positive interactions which took place between soldiers and the local population. The change has been persistent: in locations in which more African American soldiers were posted there are fewer members of the UK’s leading far-right party, less implicit bias against blacks and fewer individuals professing racial prejudice, all measured around 2010. We show that persistence has been higher in rural areas and areas with less subsequent in-migration.
N00|Historical Roots of Political Extremism: The Effects of Nazi Occupation of Italy|"The Italian civil war and the Nazi occupation of Italy occurred at a critical juncture, just before the birth of a new democracy and when, for the first time in a generation, Italians were choosing political affiliations and forming political identities. In this paper we study how these traumatic events shaped the new political system. We exploit geographic heterogeneity in the intensity and duration of the civil war, and the persistence of the battlefront along the ""Gothic line"" cutting through Northern-Central Italy. We find that the Communist Party gained votes in the post-war elections where the Nazi occupation and the civil war lasted longer, mainly at the expense of the centrist and catholic parties. This effect persists until the early 1990s. Evidence also suggests that this is due to an effect on political attitudes. Thus, the foreign occupation and the civil war left a lasting legacy of political extremism and polarization on the newborn Italian democracy."

N00|The Fall of Capital Punishment and the Rise of Prisons: How Punishment Severity Affects Jury Verdicts|This paper studies the effect of punishment severity on jury decision-making using a large archival data set from the Old Bailey Criminal Court in London from 1715 to 1900. We take advantage of three natural experiments in English history, which result in sharp decreases in punishment severity: The offense specific abolition of capital punishment in the 1800s, the temporary halt of penal transportation during the American Revolution, and the abolition of transportation in 1853. Using a difference-in-differences design to study the abolition of the death penalty and pre-post designs to study the temporary and permanent halts to transportation, we find that decreasing expected punishment (especially via the end of the death penalty), had a large and significant impact on jury behavior, generally leading to the jury being ‘harsher’. Moreover, we find that the size of the effect differs with defendants’ gender and criminal history. These results raise concerns about the impartiality of juries as well as the implicit assumption often made when designing and evaluating criminal justice policies today – that the chance of conviction is independent of the harshness of the penalty.
N00|"Silver, Murder, and Institutions: Did the ""Curse of Resources"" impact on Homicide Rates? Global evidence since 1890"|Does mining increase interpersonal violence? While the impact of natural resources on civil war and interstate conflict is well examined, its link to a second form of violence -namely the everyday, interpersonal form- is less explored. We assess the effect of silver mining on homicide rates, choosing silver because it was an important mining product for many countries over a substantial time span. We use a newly collected, global sample of countries for more than 100 years from 1890 to 1990 and find that high silver production leads to heightened violence. The effect is particularly pronounced in the interaction with autocratic governance systems. To rule out endogeneity, we use silver prices and silver deposit sites per area as instrumental variables. The takeaway message is that economies majorly dependent on mining resources are not only prone to get involved in violent conflict, but are also at risk to have a higher day-to-day violence level.
N00|The clan and the corporation: Sustaining cooperation in China and Europe|Over the last millennium, the clan and the corporation have been the loci of cooperation in China and Europe respectively. This paper examines – analytically and historically – the cultural and institutional co-evolution that led to this bifurcation. We highlight that groups with which individuals identify are basic units of cooperation. Such loyalty groups influence institutional development because intra-group moral commitment reduces enforcement cost implying a comparative advantage in pursuing collective actions. Loyalty groups perpetuate due to positive feedbacks between morality, institutions, and the implied pattern of cooperation.
N00|Strategies and public propositions in games of institutional change: Comparative historical cases|This paper argues that the game-theoretic approach is incomplete for institutional studies, because comparative institutions as well as institutional changes involve the possibility of multiple equilibria. In order to solve the common knowledge problem, this paper proposes to unify game theoretic thought with an analysis of public representations/propositions to summarize salient features of the recursive/emergent states of play. From this perspective the paper tries to reconcile differences in three accounts of institutions: endogenous outcome, exogenous rules and constitutive rules accounts. Then, the unified approach is applied to comparative and historical cases of Tokugawa Japan and Qing China. Specifically it sheds new light into the coalitional nature of the Tokugawa Baku-Han regime nesting the fundamental Samurai-village pact as well as the tendency toward decentralization of political violence and fiscal competence to the provincial level toward the end of Qing China. From these new historical interpretations, endogenous strategic forces and associated public propositions leading to institutional changes through the Meiji Restoration and the Xinhai Revolution are identified and compared.
N00|Design and evolution in institutional development: The insignificance of the English Bill of Rights|This paper challenges a belief that is deeply embedded in mainstream economics—that 1688–1701 saw a fundamental transformation in England that sprang from changes in the highest-level institutions designed by those who understood how to effect productive reform. This is the design hypothesis. The alternative is that change occurred in many features of society over a long period and that the 1688–1701 reforms were just one element in a deep ongoing evolutionary process. The paper presents evidence of two distinct types. First, legal history shows that the high-level institutional measures of 1688–1701 can be characterized primarily as either durable and endorsing the status quo or path-breaking and ephemeral. This is evolutionary trial and error. Second, patterns in structural breaks in myriad data sets reveal that widespread socioeconomic change was under way before 1688 and continued thereafter. Because England's early development provides a popular paradigmatic example for economists, the paper's verdict on the nature of English history is pertinent to debates on transition and development, on the importance of critical junctures, and on the relative roles of culture and institutions.
N00|The contributions of warfare with revolutionary and Napoleonic France to the consolidation and progress of the British industrial revolution: revised version of working paper 150|This revised and reconfigured essay surveys a range of printed secondary sources going back to publications of the day (as well as includes research in primary sources) in order to revive a traditional and unresolved debate on economic connexions between the French and Industrial Revolutions. It argues that the costs flowing from the reallocation of labour, capital and technical knowledge to wage warfare from 1793-1815 have been overstated in relation to a range of benefits that accrued from: crowding out a potential invasion by Napoleon’s armies; improvements to the skills and discipline of the workforce; the integration of Ireland into a national market; the accelerated diffusion of technologies associated with coal and iron; the circumvention of diminishing returns to agriculture and above all from a victory that provided the economy with a more efficient State, Navy and Merchant Marine that, for a century, retained most of the gains from trade and servicing the international economy obtained at the expense of rivals during these long wars with France. My conclusion is that the costs and benefits (derived from participation in a global war from 1793 to 1815, that was integral to the era’s geopolitical and mercantilist international economic order) cannot be measured. But in the context and history of that order it is difficult to represent their outcome as anything other than positive and significant for the consolidation and progress of Britain’s famous transition to become Europe’s First Industrial Nation.

N00|The London Stock Exchange and the British shadow banking system|"""Previously unknown basic statistics are obtained about the opera- tions of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in early Victorian times. Integration of data from the Bank of England Archive with price reports, press coverage, and other sources produces estimates for volume of transactions, distribution of earnings among dealers, efficiency of the market, and the coverage of avail- able price lists. For example, it is found that for some securities, prices were reported for under 20% of transactions. The LSE was surprisingly small and by some measures also surprisingly efficient. Much of its efficiency appears to have come from its deep involvement in the “shadow banking system” of that era, a connection that appears to have been misunderstood and almost com- pletely neglected in the past. The low levels of activity, the dominance of small investors, and low cost of the system show the very early stages of the “fi- nancialization” of the modern economy and provide interesting perspectives on modern developments."""
N00|Bengal silk industry and laisser-faire policies in the nineteenth century: Deindustrialisation revisited|"""In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries Bengal was, with over 40% share on total imports, quantitatively the most important exporter of raw silk into Britain. The English East India Company (EEIC) played an important role in Bengal’s dominance. During the period of 1760s-1830s the Company developed a value chain in raw silk manufacturing and integrated cocoon procurement, reeling, warehousing, transport, advertising and the organisation of sale among its business activities. The EEIC relied on economies of scale which gave it an advantage. Moreover, thanks to learning-by-doing the Company also developed an expertise in silk manufacturing. This expertise built on the adoption of ‘best practices’, on acquiring new knowledge through sending silk experts to Bengal, and on granting patents for innovations of silk technologies. The Company offered its knowledge and services such as warehousing, transportation, marketing, sales and guidance about new technologies, innovations and best practices also to private entrepreneurs. When the 1833 EEIC Charter forced the Company to withdraw from raw silk manufacturing, the sector lost entrepreneurial guidance. In comparison to the EEIC, private entrepreneurs had little access to specialised knowledge and skills, and could not take advantage of economies of scale. In the post-1833 period innovative activities were not successful, no major innovation was adopted and the share of Bengal raw silk on the total imports of raw silk to Britain decreased to around 13%.

N00|British papermaking engineering, its growth and the origins of its decline, 1800-1939: a comparative approach|"""British industrial and economic pre-eminence during Industrial Revolution was over, at least partially, in the late nineteenth century. The reasons of this, often called controversially British climacteric, underlined in the literature are many. Mokyr has pointed out that the United Kingdom was defined by a highly skilled stock of human capital which was able to translate ideas from home or abroad (the papermaking case) to innovations that could have commercial use. These “Glorious Times”, the United Kingdom was world’s leader in technological matters. The falling behind process from late nineteenth century has a complex explanation with multiple factors to be accounted (economic and business structure of the British economy, markets, education, etc.) and it has been the origin of a controversy. Literature underlines the British technological lead at least up to the 1860s. Kison and Michie have called the period between 1870 and 1913 as “the age of maturity” and “the age of uncertainty” that between wars. Tom Nicholas has underlined how some factors were inevitable, such as the characteristics of the advancing countries with larger markets, but other are directly linked with structural factors “such as the lack of competition in product markets and the relative absence of creative destruction as disciplinary mechanisms to promote the efficiency of firms”. British papermaking engineering was the main supplier of machines in the World markets during an important part of the nineteenth century. Besides that, the domestic market was really huge and in continuous expansion for decades, mainly linked with more standardized types of paper (newsprint). British workshops began to lose ground in the late nineteenth century. Global markets were increasingly supplied by US and German works. The main reasons of that were the stagnation of the British papermaking industry. Lost the domestic market dynamism, the exports fell down, but not completely. From this point of view, papermaking engineering is a good example of the British industrial decline. However, this scenario fits with the explanation by Saul, according to whom the British engineering industry had a performance which cannot be described as a poor as a whole"""
N00|The Labour Injunction and Peonage: How changes in labour laws increased inequality during the Gilded Age|"""In this paper, I seek to fill a gap in the literature by analyzing how central changes in labor laws shaped increasing income inequality during the Gild Age and Progressive and New Eras. For the North, I look at the increasing activation of courts, to the detriment of many state and local legislatures, in creating and expanding the use of the labor injunction. For the South, I look at how the states, supported by the courts, created a system of peonage that directly affect large portions of southern labor and lasted well into the twentieth century. """
N00|Buy British campaigns after 1945: why 'soft' preference didn't work|"""There has been a substantial debate on the causes of Britain’s poor economic performance after 1945. Weaknesses in government policy, particularly with respect to supply-side improvements, have featured prominently in explanations for this decline. Broadberry and Crafts, for example, have argued that successive governments in the post-war period accepted a social contract with trade unions to maintain high levels of employment but the adverse consequences of this were that it increased the bargaining power of trade unions, lowered the costs to firms of accepting restrictive practices and generally encouraged high levels of ‘X’ inefficiency, especially over-manning and low effort. A corollary of this was the growth of employment in the public sector, which Thirlwall claimed led to a Balance of Payments constraint: the expansion of the non-market sector was a symptom of the inability of the market sector to grow as fast as productivity growth without the economy coming up against a Balance of Payments Constraint. This constraint operated because Britain’s income elasticity of demand for imports was 1.6 per cent, whereas world income demand for UK exports was 1 per cent. Between 1965-74 for example, industrial productivity in the UK grew at 4%p.a while output increased by only 1.7%. Thirlwall argued that the industrial sector could not have grown at 4% and thereby have retained more of its resources because of the consequences such an expansion would have had on the Balance of Payments. A 4% rate of growth of national output would mean that imports would have increased at 6.4% pa but exports at only 4% This, of course, was not sustainable. In this article we do not intend to revisit these debates. Rather, we examine an aspect of demand management policy which has been largely neglected: ‘Buy British’ campaigns in the mid 1960s and early 1980s. In theory, an aggressive marketing policy by government, extolling the virtues of British-made products, could have alleviated the Balance of Payments constraint. Moreover, such a policy could have prompted a supply-side response from British manufacturers. For example, an advertising campaign which reinforced consumer preferences for British products would have provided some insulation from foreign competition and this would have facilitated investment and innovation. Despite the potential appeal of these benefits we argue that there were a number of major impediments to ‘Buy British’ campaigns. It is useful to divide our analysis into two distinct subperiods: the 1960s, when Britain did not belong to the EU, and the 1980s, when it did. For both periods, British governments were hesitant to endorse a full-scale marketing campaign. Part of the explanation for this was surveys indicated that British consumers at best had only limited preference for domestic manufactures. A further problem was that successive British governments were at best reluctant and at worst hostile to launching a BB campaign. Nonetheless, there were also more mundane reasons for reluctance to become engaged. For example, which non-governmental bodies should be asked to participate? The CBI, for example, did not countenance involvement in the 1960s, but was more collaborative in the 1980s."""
N00|Church building and the economy during Europe’s ‘Age of the Cathedrals’, 700-1500|"""This paper presents new data on the construction history of about 1,100 major churches in Western Europe between 700 and 1500 CE. The idea is that church building can be seen as an index of economic activity, reflecting confidence in the future, command of substantial ecclesiastical revenues, mobilisation of large teams of construction workers, and an ability to assemble impressive quantities of building materials at a single site, with the wider economic multiplier effects that this entailed. In a pious age, Church reform, monastic foundation and advancing architectural technology helped kick-start and then lend momentum to the process. Whether so much conspicuous construction activity was beneficial to or a burden upon Christendom’s relatively poor and under-developed economy can be debated. What is clear is that churches, like the books and manuscripts produced in the same period, are artefacts that can be quantified. Whereas hard data are lacking for many other aspects of economic activity, at least before 1250, research by generations of architectural historians means that much is known about the construction history of individual churches, commencing with their original foundation. Putting this information together provides estimates of the ecclesiastical building industry for a number of European countries, currently Switzerland, Germany, France, the Low Countries and England but potentially extending to the whole of Latin Christendom. The results shed fresh light on the onset, scale, spatial dimensions and duration of the great economic boom that got under way sometime after 1000 and corresponding features of the long contraction then set in train during the fourteenth century."""
N00|The impact of the New Poor Law on livelihoods of the poor in north Wales|"""By the 1830s, parishes in north-west Wales had developed a low-cost system of poor relief that suited the area’s largely informal economy. Poor relief was mainly used to top up the inadequate earnings of the elderly, single women adversely affected by declining proto-industrial earnings, and agricultural labourers with large families, while non-resident relief was widely paid to encourage migration. These practices were challenged by the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act, which sought to draw a clear distinction between the able-bodied and the aged and infirm, and to curtail poor relief for able-bodied men except through a workhouse. Previous research has revealed considerable regional and local variation in the way the New Poor Law was implemented in England. However the detailed deconstruction of outdoor relief practice remains relatively rare and the impact of the Act in Wales has been little studied. This paper examines the impact of the New Poor Law on the livelihoods of the poor in north Wales through a case study of the Llanrwst Poor Law Union. It analyses over 1,400 poor relief cases in the union’s first year of operation to build up a picture of the ages, occupations and family situation of paupers, and how relief practice changed after the implementation of the New Poor Law. Three key factors are identified in shaping outcomes: whether elected union guardians saw the New Poor Law aims as cost-effective and relevant to local needs; the ability of the area’s Assistant Poor Law Commissioner to convince the board of the legal requirement for change; and the increased agency of the poor themselves."""

N00|The impact of demand for labour and economic structure on Dutch unmarried women’s labour force participation, 1812-1929|"""Extensive research has demonstrated that female labour force participation (FLFP) in Western Europe decreased during the second half of the nineteenth century. During this period, in the Netherlands, FLFP was even lower than in surrounding countries such as England and Belgium. Until now, most scholars have argued that social norms were driving this development. This study argues that social norms were merely one side of the coin and it combines factors of supply as well as demand in a logistic regression based on nearly 2 million marriage records from the period 1812-1929. Our results show that sectoral shifts in the Dutch economy explain almost half of the decline of FLFP over the entire period. We exploit regional variation to demonstrate the importance of considering local labour markets when investigating FLFP. Furthermore, we support our results from the logistic regression with qualitative information from nineteenth-century labour surveys. As such, this research is a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods."""
N00|The stratification of the Swedish peasant farmer class, 1750-1900|"""Pre-industrial Sweden is famous for its self-owning and independent peasant farmer class and the peasant farmers have often been considered as carriers of equality and a particular brand of Scandinavian road to modernity. Moreover, it has been argued that rising income and wealth within this large segment of the population resulted in increased demand for non-agrarian products and thus that this provided the start of a domestic industrial expansion. However, quantitative studies of the wealth and inequality of Swedish farmers have been limited to studies on smaller localities. This paper contributes with the first comprehensive study of the wealth of the Swedish farmers, using a national sample of almost 5 000 probate inventories for the benchmark years 1750, 1800, 1850 and 1900, of which about 1 730 inventories are for farmers. The paper maps the farmers’ wealth positions in relation to other social groups as well as the wealth stratification within the farmer class. We show that in 1750 and 1800 Swedish farmers were relatively equal, comparable to for example free farmers in the US North, but that inequality increased gradually and that in 1900 the Gini coefficient for the farmer class has risen to 0.74, as compared to 0.46 in 1750. The equality – at least in economic terms – of Swedish farmers has thus been overstated. Importantly though, average wealth increased within the group although also here regional differences, arising from differences in soil quality as well as transportation and proximity to urban markets, are discernible."""

N00|The Effect of Fertility on Mothers’ Labor Supply over the Last Two Centuries|This paper documents the evolving impact of childbearing on the work activity of mothers between 1787 and 2014. It is based on a compiled data set of 429 censuses and surveys, representing 101 countries and 46.9 million mothers, using the International and U.S. IPUMS, the North Atlantic Population Project, and the Demographic and Health Surveys. Using twin births (Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1980) and same gendered children (Angrist and Evans 1998) as instrumental variables, we show three main findings: (1) the effect of fertility on labor supply is small and often indistinguishable from zero at low levels of income and large and negative at higher levels of income; (2) these effects are remarkably consistent both across time looking at the historical time series of currently developed countries and at a contemporary cross section of developing countries; and (3) the results are robust to other instrument variation, different demographic and educational groups, rescaling to account for changes in the base level of labor force participation, and a variety of specification and data decisions. We show that the negative gradient in female labor supply is consistent with a standard labor-leisure model augmented to include a taste for children. In particular, our results appear to be driven by a declining substitution effect to increasing wages that arises from changes in the sectoral and occupational structure of female jobs into formal nonagricultural wage employment as countries develop.
N00|Au-delà des affaires, de la corruption et de la spéculation. Analyse de la fuite de capitaux vers le nord au temps de la décolonisation au travers des sources diplomatiques suisses|Au travers d’une étude de cas sur les fuites de capitaux des pays extra-occidentaux en direction de la Suisse, le paradis fiscal par excellence au cours du XXe siècle, le présent article tente de démontrer comment il est possible de contourner au moins partiellement les difficultés liées à la recherche scientifique sur l'évasion fiscale internationale. Le papier exemplifie dans un premier temps l’intérêt des sources diplomatiques pour la problématique. Etant donné la proximité et la coopération entre le gouvernement, les diplomates et les banquiers helvétiques, les documents préservés aux Archives fédérales suisses (AF) fournissent un apport non-négligeable à l’établissement de l’ampleur et des formes des fuites illégales des fortunes avant l’éclatement du système de Bretton Woods, une période encore peu abordée y compris dans les études économétriques. L’article passe dans un second temps à l’analyse de la politique économique. Il démontre combien la nécessité pour les hauts fonctionnaires de se positionner face à la question récurrente des fuites illégales de capitaux des pays du Sud a participé en Suisse à l’établissement de stratégies nouvelles de défense pour préserver le secret bancaire dans l’après-guerre. La conclusion réintègre dans un troisième temps cette problématique au sein d’une discussion plus générale sur la nature et la particularité de l’impérialisme suisse.
N00|Le havre fiscal et la globalisation de l'offshore|Le présent article analyse l'histoire du paradis fiscal suisse durant les années 1970 et 1980. Pendant cette période, la dérégulation des transactions financières internationales, qui fait suite à l’éclatement du système de Bretton Woods, s’accompagne d’un accroissement très sensible des activités bancaires liées à la finance offshore. Pour le paradis fiscal suisse, bien que l’accélération des mouvements de capitaux accentue dans un premier temps les afflux d’avoirs étrangers illicites en sa direction, la généralisation des pratiques offshore comporte à terme une double menace pour sa position acquise à la fin de la Première Guerre mondiale comme premier gestionnaire de fortune sur le marché de l'évasion fiscale. D’une part, l’adoption de pratiques d’attraction fiscale sur les autres places financières similaires à celles en vigueur en Suisse amoindrit un atout essentiel dont bénéficiaient les banques suisses pour capter les avoirs étrangers en fuite. D’autre part, tandis qu’aussi bien les pays occidentaux que les pays en développement font face à une explosion de leurs dettes publiques, les pressions politiques contre l’accueil par le paradis fiscal suisse de capitaux qui éludent les impôts, restées relativement faibles depuis la sortie de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, redoublent à partir de la fin des années 1970. En se basant sur un large panel d’archives inédites, l’article analyse les différentes initiatives déployées entre 1971 et 1984 contre le havre fiscal helvétique et démontre comment les dirigeants suisses sont parvenus à assurer dans le nouvel environnement économique la position de proue de la place financière suisse sur le marché de l’évasion fiscale internationale.

Faisant le constat des limites de l’endowment perspective - qui prédomine dans la littérature, et qui envisage les institutions comme des dotations produisant leurs effets, bons ou mauvais, de manière nécessaire - nous nous appuyons sur des outils théoriques forgés dans d’autres disciplines des sciences sociales pour proposer une perspective alternative sur les institutions. Fondamentalement, il s’agit de mettre la compréhension que les acteurs ont effectivement des institutions au centre de l’analyse. En nous appuyant sur le cas du droit de la société anonyme française au XIXe siècle, nous montrons qu’une même forme institutionnelle peut donner lieu à plusieurs interprétations (et ainsi engendrer des pratiques et des résultats différents) ou, au contraire, que des formes institutionnelles différentes peuvent donner lieu à des pratiques similaires, en fonction de la compréhension qu’en ont les acteurs. Cet article invite ainsi à nuancer la pertinence des approches postulant une valeur intrinsèque, bonne ou mauvaise, des institutions, pour mettre au coeur de l’analyse ce que les acteurs en font effectivement.

N00|‘Till Debt Do Us Part’:Financial Implications of the Divorce of the Irish Free State from the UK, 1922-6|In this paper, we discuss the unresolved apportionment of national debt when Ireland exited the UK in 1922. Using archival sources and contemporary accounts, we estimate that the British claim on Ireland in 1925 amounted to between 80 and 100 per cent of GNP at a time when the political stability of Ireland was already fragile. We describe the process of how this contingent liability, arising from the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, was ultimately waived in a Financial Agreement in 1925 at the expense of an unchanged border with Northern Ireland. The Irish government also sought, but failed, to secure protection against discrimination for Catholics in Northern Ireland as part of the agreement. While for the Irish Government, this settlement may have represented a political failure, the economic outcome of the agreement transformed the economic position of the new Irish State from one of potential insolvency into one of viability.
N00|Irrigation, Collectivism and Long-Run Technological Divergence|This paper explores the historical origins of collectivist cultural norms and their longterm economic consequences. In its first part, I test the hypothesis that collectivism emerged historically in pre-industrial agricultural economies in which group effort was crucial for subsistence. I find a positive and significant association between the traditional use of irrigation - a production mode that required extensive collaboration and coordination within groups of farmers - and collectivist norms today. Instrumenting traditional irrigation by the environmental suitability for irrigated agriculture lead to similar results that point at a causal interpretation of the findings. I find that the effects persist in migrants, and investigate factors that hinder the transmission of collectivism. The second part of the paper shows that by affecting culture, past irrigated agriculture continues to influence contemporaneous innovation at the national and individual level. While irrigated agriculture is associated with greater technological progress in pre-modern societies, this relationship is reversed in the long-run. In addition, by favoring attitudes towards obedience, past irrigation also predicts patterns of job specialization and selection into routine-intensive jobs of countries and individuals.
N00|Keeping It in the Family: Lineage Organization and the Scope of Trust in Sub-Saharan Africa|We present evidence that the traditional structure of society is an important determinant of the scope of trust today. Within Africa, individuals belonging to ethnic groups that organized society using segmentary lineages exhibit a more limited scope of trust, measured by the gap between trust in relatives and trust in non-relatives. This trust gap arises because of lower levels of trust in non-relatives and not higher levels of trust in relatives. A causal interpretation of these correlations is supported by the fact that the effects are primarily found in rural areas where these forms of organization are still prevalent.
N00|What Was the Industrial Revolution?|At some point in the first half of the 19th century per capita GDP in the United Kingdom and the United States began to grow at something like one to two percent per year and have continued to do so up to the present. Now incomes in many economies routinely grow at 2 percent per year and some grow at much higher “catch-up” rates. These events surely represent a historical watershed, separating a traditional world in which incomes of ordinary working people remained low and fairly stable over the centuries from a modern world where incomes increase for every new generation. This paper uses Gary Becker’s theory of a “quantity/quality trade-off,” consistent both with Malthusian population dynamics (quantity) and with demographic transition (quality), to identify a limited set of forces that were central to this revolution.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N00|Choosing the optimal public choice scenario through a democratic educational procedure: A history from ancient Athens|In the present essay we argue that the Athenians were well aware that for a smooth functioning of democracy the citizens, who voted in the Assembly under direct democracy procedures, had to be educated. We argue that they had to find good solutions in the decision process of the Assembly. We analyse a public choice issue: the case of shipbuilding of the Athenian fleet that played a crucial defeat of the Persians in 480 BCE. The Athenians actually had to decide on a public choice set issue: sacrifice personal consumption in favour of the public good defence. We argue that the Athenians finally reached to the optimal choice, after having received at first undergone a process of democratic education.
N00|Differences in wealth, education, and history|An understanding of the freedoms (or the lack of freedoms) and their economic consequences on early black Americans provides an informative understanding to the freedoms (or the lack of freedoms), and their economic consequences on other, modern ethnic groups. Curtis (2017) investigates the link between the social asymmetry and economic asymmetry among early blacks and whites in the United States of America. For the empirical study, Curtis (2017) uses cross-sectional variables from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Sample (IPUMS), developed informative conditional ratios, and employed least squares statistical analyses. This study finds that economic differences among ethnic groups, as measured by differences between early blacks and whites, are intertwined with asymmetrical freedoms, leading to statistically insignificant returns to education, as measured by literacy. One might conclude that the individual’s basic protection of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness must proceed any expectations of measured returns to schooling, particularly among individuals in disenfranchised groups. Furthermore, one might propose education policy such that modern higher education investment programs prioritize education entrepreneurs and/or state/social planners with academic research familiarity of differences in wealth.

FINDINGS This study finds that economic differences among ethnic groups, as measured by differences between early blacks and whites, are intertwined with asymmetrical freedoms, leading to statistically insignificant returns to education, as measured by literacy. One might conclude that the individual’s basic protection of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness must proceed any expectations of measured returns to schooling, particularly among individuals in disenfranchised groups. Furthermore, one might propose education policy such that modern higher education investment programs prioritize education entrepreneurs and/or state/social planners with academic research familiarity of differences in wealth. This research is a revision of November 2002, November 2010 and January 2012 working papers. Copyright 2017.

N00|Measurement and Analysis of the Evolution of Institutions in Nigeria|â€œInstitutions matterâ€ has become a generally accepted premise in development economics. The growth and development problems in Nigeria are also common knowledge. To better understand these problems a proper characterization of institutions in Nigeria is essential. Conducting empirical test of the role of institutions in Nigeriaâ€™s growth and development can prove challenging due to lack of institutional data set that span over a long time. In the event that short span data set is available, Glaeser et al. (2004) highlight the many flaws implicit in such measures constructed by political scientists in literature. In this paper, we construct an index of institution quality for the period 1862 through to 2011 for Nigeria, in doing so, we adopt a new method of measuring institutions, which makes use of pre-existing (de jure) legislations, ordinances and constitutions in constructing three institutional indicators; civil and political liberties, freehold property rights, and non-freehold (customary) property rights. These constructed indicators provide a platform for characterization and comprehensive analysis of how institutions haveevolved in Nigeria.
N00|Putting The Cart Before The Horse? Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act (Vapp) In Context|On 2nd May 2015, the (now former) president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan signed into law the Violence Against Persons (prohibition) Bill. The law in effect prohibits all forms of violence against persons and particularly for the purpose of women and child rights, criminalizes the practice popularly known as female genital mutilation (FGM). Unsurprisingly, many human rights activists regard this development as a step in the right direction as far as human rights protection in Nigeria is concerned. There are however some issues, especially in relation to the constitutional and cultural outlook of the Nigerian society which the author of this article regards as highly significant as far as implementation of the law is concerned. The article aims to consider these issues in line with a predominant argument that there should be an increased focus on developing a ?rights protection culture? in the Nigerian society through other measures outside legislative enactments.
N00|'Till Debt Do Us Part': Financial Implications of the Divorce of the Irish Free State from the UK, 1922-6|In this paper, we discuss the unresolved apportionment of national debt when Ireland exited the UK in 1922. Using archival sources and contemporary accounts, we estimate that the British claim on Ireland in 1925 amounted to between 80 and 100 per cent of GNP at a time when the political stability of Ireland was already fragile. We describe the process of how this contingent liability, arising from the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, was ultimately waived in a Financial Agreement in 1925 at the expense of an unchanged border with Northern Ireland. The Irish government also sought, but failed, to secure protection against discrimination for Catholics in Northern Ireland as part of the agreement. While for the Irish Government, this settlement may have represented a political failure, the economic outcome of the agreement transformed the economic position of the new Irish State from one of potential insolvency into one of viability.

N00|"The Interaction of Cybernetics and Contemporary Economic Graphic Art as ""Interactive Graphics"""|According to the thesis, which is related to the interaction between cybernetics and contemporary graphic art (Interactive graphics), at first a brief explanation about the meaning of interaction is defined and then tried to determine the relationship between science and art and also their impacts to each other are analyzed. The interaction terms implicitly defined as the relationship between the individual and artificially intelligent system and try to convey emotions and ideas of the artist to the audience. Origin of the work is the essence of art and the artists is the interfaces between holiness and the people of his Contemporary time. Indeed, the interactive art is the arrangement artistic which use the presence and audience interaction to achieve its purpose. Internet and electronic art are the two kinds of this art. To sum up, the activities of the audience play a very significant role in this kind of art. Although both science and art reflect reality, Science is basically the concept and entities, while art is the aesthetic images. Scientific concepts and artistic images both generalized perceptions of reality. But due to the rational nature of science, the overall dialectical difference of science is more than art. Cybernetics (the science of animal-human and physical information and control systems) is a new important science which is produced by the combinations of other science such as Psychological Science, biology, economics, engineering, linguistics, etc. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects and consequences of new technologies and modes of communication which causes to increase the interaction between scientists and artists in the best possible way which is useful for both groups. This is mainly because, the cybernetics represent an ideal medium for such interaction. The mentality and Artistic thinking are the most important part of creation which the digital technology alone does not have this feature. Always, the interaction, communication and the creation of a mutual cultural is considered as one of the most important concerns of artists. On the other hand, simultaneously with electronic advance in the field of satellite communications and computer, art is also having an impressive progress.
N00|Позитивное Сотрудничество: Факторы И Механизмы Эволюции<BR>[Positive Collaboration: Factors and Mechanisms of Evolution]|It is proposed to distinguish between two types of collaboration: a positive (not directed against third parties) and a negative one. I consider the hypothesis that in the process of social development, transaction costs ratio of the three main types of coordination - competition, power, and collaboration - is changing in favor of the latter. The mechanisms responsible for the implementation of this tendency are studied, and an attempt to explain its nonmonotonicity is made. It is shown that the strengthening role of positive collaboration is largely explained by cultural changes: the increase of tolerance culture, the spread of cosmopolitanism and altruism, increasing planning horizon as well as trust radius. I demonstrate the importance of the institutions of positive collaboration in the process of catching-up development; it is shown that shock reforms could lead to the formation of negative collaboration mechanisms. For the further development of these ideas, a program of interdisciplinary researches is outlined. Рассматривается гипотеза о том, что в процессе общественного развития соотношение трансакционных издержек трех основных типов координации – конкуренции, власти и сотрудничества – меняется в пользу последнего. Исследуются механизмы, ответственные за реализацию этой тенденции.
N00|On the Dispensability of New Transportation Technologies : Evidence from Colonial Railroads in Nigeria|We examine Fogel’s influential hypothesis that new transportation technologies may be dispensable if pre-existing technologies are viable or can simply be improved. Exploiting the construction of colonial railroads in Nigeria, we find that the railway has large long-lasting impacts on individual and local development in the North, but virtually no impact in the South neither in the short run nor in the long run. This heterogeneous impact of the railway can be accounted for by the level of pre-railway access to ports of export. Consistent with Fogel’s argument, the railway did not transform areas that had viable transportation alternatives for exporting purposes. Using information on changes in shipping costs and quantities, we highlight the importance of opportunity costs to the adoption and impact of new transportation investments.
N00|The Discourse on Islam and Development: Western and Muslim Scholars’ Opinions|There is ongoing debate among scholars concerning the relation between Islam and development. The focus of the debate is particularly about the compatibility issue. Western and Muslim scholars have their own stance and argumentation. While the former have accused Islam as an obstacle to development, the latter have assured that Islam is essentially compatible to development. Based on the Qur’anic point of view, it is obvious that religion and development are essentially related in a positive, direct and causal manner.
N00|Path Dependence and Interdependence Between Institutions and Development|Path dependence theory, within the institutions context, means that the path of institutions promulgated within a system historically determines the nature of institutions that will ensue within the same system in the present and in the future. The paper makes use of a newly constructed index of institutions quality, and addresses three related questions; the existence of path dependence in institutions, the interdependence and causality between political and economic institutions, and lastly the interdependence between economic development and institutions. In addressing the first question, I use unit root tests to test the hypothesis that institutions promulgated during colonial times still influence institutions promulgated during the post colonial era. I also test for interdependence between institutions in Nigeria using an error correction model in analysing the extent of interdependence between political and economic institutions. Lastly, I test the critical juncture hypothesisâ€”which argues that better institutions lead to economic development and the modernisation hypothesesâ€”which argues that economic development leads to better institutions. The results show support for early path dependence in both political and economic institutions. I also find evidence in support of interdependence running from economic to political institutions. Lastly, there is evidence of a long-run association between institutions and economic development, with the evidence supporting the critical juncture hypothesis, more than the modernisation hypothesis.
N00|Dealing with the Complexity of Causes of Societal Innovativeness: Social Enabling and Disabling Mechanisms and the Case of China|Societies progress by the influence of two forces: innovativeness and cooperativeness. A capacity for enabling these forces constitutes a societyâ€™s transformative capacity. The article proposes a vocabulary for certain universal requirements for use in comparing the various societal trajectories aiming towards shared prosperity. Progress to date has in consequence normally seen the growth of empowerment and of more benevolent forms of domination over time. Economic action fosters the sharing of prosperity when systems encourage competition to cooperate. Studies that stress the heritage of ecological context in shaping relevant responses in the present-day social psychology are considered. The specific field of innovativeness is considered by an analysis of Silicon Valley. From this, and from other studies, seven features are identified for an ideal type of societal system high on innovativeness. These are capacity to scale up, worker creativity, individual autonomy, property rights and incentive, open society, stable institutional order and rationality. China is assessed against these criteria, and found to have certain inadequacies that are currently the subject of policy attention. JEL: Z1, N00, O01, P5
N00|General purpose technologies in theory, application and controversy: a review|Abstract Distinguishing characteristics of General Purpose Technologies (GPTs) are identified and definitions discussed. Our definition includes multipurpose and single-purpose technologies, defining them according to their micro-technological characteristics, not their macro-economic effects. Identifying technologies as GPTs requires recognizing their evolutionary nature, and accepting possible uncertainties concerning marginal cases. Many of the existing ‘tests’ of whether particular technologies are GPTs are based on misunderstandings either of what GPT theory predicts or what such tests can establish. The development of formal GPT theories is outlined, showing that only the early theories predicted the inevitability of GPT-induced showdown and surges. More recent GPT theories, designed to model the characteristics of GPTs, do not imply the necessity of specific macro effects. We show that GPTs can rejuvenate the growth process without causing slowdowns or surges. We conclude that existing criticisms of GPT theory can be resolved and that the concept remains useful for economic theory.

N00|The Bank of England and the genesis of modern management|"In 1965 Sidney Pollard published The Genesis of Modern Management, an extended discussion of the problems, during Britain's initial period of industrialisation, of the 'internal management' of the firm. But, in his focus on industry, Pollard ignored one of the largest, most significant and most innovative of the enterprises of the late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth centuries: The Bank of England. This paper focuses on the Bank as a site of precocious managerial development. It first establishes that the Bank, by the latter part of the eighteenth century, encompassed the complexities of a large-scale industrial enterprise. It employed a workforce of several hundred. Its workers operated in specialised and coordinated capacities. Its managerial hierarchy was diffuse and dependent on employed men, rather than the elected directorate. The Bank, therefore, warrants comparison with the types of enterprises identified by Pollard. Focusing on the 1780s, the paper then explores the Bank's organisational and management structure against Pollard's four aspects of management: 'the creation and training of a class of managers; 'the recruitment, training, disciplining and acculturation of labour'; the use of 'accountancy, and other information ... in the rational determination of their decisions' and finally the question of whether there emerged a 'theory and practice of ""management""'. It will demonstrate that, although not always applied effectively, the Bank's senior men did show managerial innovation and skill in training and organising the workforce and were able to make informed decisions which had the potential to improve some of the Bank's processes."
N00|On the Origins and Consequences of Racism|We use a novel method to measure racism at both the individual and the country level. We show that our measure of racism has a strong negative and significant impact on economic development, quality of institutions and education. We then test different hypotheses concerning the origin of racism and its channels of impact in order to establish causality. We find that racism is not correlated with any possible measure of coexistence of different racial or ethnic groups, like ethno-linguistic fragmentation, share of migrants, or ethnically-motivated conflicts among others. Racism has a negative effect on social capital measured as generalized trust and voice and accountability. More importantly, we show that for former colonies, racism is strongly correlated with the presence of extractive institutions during the colonial time, even when we control for current institutions, current GDP per capita or current education. We argue that extractive colonial institutions not only had a negative impact on the political and economic institutions of the colonized countries, but also shaped the cultural values of the population. We claim that colonial powers instilled racism among the population of their colonies in order to weaken their ability for collective action, justify their own role as extractive elite in the eyes of the ruled and facilitate the internal cohesion of the elite. We also show that, at the individual level and using country fixed effects, racism is negatively correlated with those cultural values that one would expect if an extractive elite would be able to decide the cultural values of the society they control: lower trust, higher obedience, lower respect for others, lower feeling of control of one's live, lower preference for democracy, higher support for military intervention of the government, lower preference for political participation, lower valuation of civil rights, higher preference for state intervention in the economy, lower support for economic competition, and higher acceptance of dishonest behavior. We finally show that racism still has a significant impact on our outcome variables even when we control for these potential cultural correlates.
N00|Patents and Innovation in Economic History|A strong tradition in economic history, which relies primarily on qualitative evidence and statistical correlations, has emphasized the importance of patents as a primary driver of innovation. Recent improvements in empirical methodology—through the creation of new datasets and advances in identification—have produced research that challenges this traditional view. The findings of this literature provide a more nuanced view of the effects of intellectual property and suggest that when patent rights have been too broad or too strong, they have actually discouraged innovation. This review summarizes the major results from this research and presents open questions.
N00|The Economic History of Alexander the Great Expedition|The philosophy of Economics and economic policy were developed by Xenophon in Ancient Greece. Alexander the Great was living a little later in the 4th century B.C. and we know him as a great Hellen king, civilizer, and “forerunner”; but, he was, an excellent economist because he had to manage the economy of his enormous campaign from Greece to India and to exercise an efficient and effective public policy for his vast Empire. Also, “he desired not pleasure or wealth, but only excellence and glory”, which was the moral and ethical Greek philosophy of his time. Alexander had said that “…I am grateful to gods that I was borne Hellen…” and had all these Hellenic values, which made him one of the most important person in human history. He had shown outstanding management capabilities, with rates of salaries, health and welfare, building projects, supplies, transports, reforms of the tax system, indirect taxes and donations, loans, minting of coins, even controlling financial scandals and other information useful for our policy makers, today. We measure his budgets by using the weights of gold and silver coins and determine and compare prices by taking these information from different historians of his time. Alexander economic policy with its surpluses is very useful for our current leaders and scholars. Also, the history and the role of this extraordinary man and the contribution of the Greek civilization and language in God’s plan, for His revolted and deluded creation and humanity to be in a position to understand and accept His revelation, which Greeks were expecting since the Golden Century of Athens, is discussed.
N00|A Historical Reconstruction of Capital and Labour in Italy, 1861-2013|In this paper we spell out in detail the methodology underlying the construction of a new labour and capital stock dataset for Italy from 1861 through 2013. The existing seminal paper (Rossi, Sorgato and Toniolo 1993), much referred to in the literature, only covered the period 1911- 1990 for the former and 1890-1990 for the latter; moreover, it displayed little sectoral disaggregation. The labour dataset here presented includes both headcount (HC) and full-time equivalent (FTE) annual estimates of labour and is presented at a ten-sector level of disaggregation. Net capital stock annual estimates are instead broken down by asset type (means of transport; machinery and equipment; construction, in turn divided into residential and non-residential). Elaborations are conducted on the labour and capital series in order to gauge key features of the development and structural change of Italy's economy over more than 150 years of its unified history. The transparency and detail with which we here describe our methods and assumptions in our historical reconstruction open up the possibility of improvements and updates also by other scholars willing to take up the task. Meanwhile this dataset, combined with the new historical national accounts framework set up by a project coordinated by the Bank of Italy, finally makes a sectoral analysis of Italy's long-run development possible.
N00|Sovereign Debt Relief and Its Aftermath|This paper studies sovereign debt relief in a long-term perspective. We quantify the relief achieved through default and restructuring in two distinct samples: 1920–1939, focusing on the defaults on official (government to government) debt in advanced economies after World War I; and 1978–2010, focusing on emerging market debt crises with private external creditors. Debt relief was substantial in both eras, averaging 21% of GDP in the 1930s and 16% of GDP in recent decades. We then analyze the aftermath of debt relief and conduct a difference-in-differences analysis around the synchronous war debt defaults of 1934 and the Baker and Brady initiatives of the 1980s/1990s. The economic landscape of debtor countries improves significantly after debt relief operations, but only if these involve debt write-offs. Softer forms of debt relief, such as maturity extensions and interest rate reductions, are not generally followed by higher economic growth or improved credit ratings.

N00|Rumors and Runs in Opaque Markets: Evidence from the Panic of 1907|Using a new daily dataset for all stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange, we study the impact of information asymmetry during the liquidity freeze and market run of October 1907 - one of the most severe financial crises of the 20th century. We estimate that the run on the market increased spreads from 0.5% to 3% during the peak of the crisis and, using a spread decomposition, we also demonstrate that fears of informed trading account for most of that deterioration of liquidity. Information costs rose most in the mining sector - the origin of the panic rumors - and in other sectors with poor track records of corporate reporting. In addition to wider spreads and tight money markets, we find other hallmarks of information-based illiquidity: trading volume dropped and price impact rose. Importantly, despite short-term cash infusions into the market, we find that the market remained relatively illiquid for several months following the panic. We go on to show that rising illiquidity enters positively in the cross section of stock returns. Thus, our findings demonstrate how opaque markets can easily transmit an idiosyncratic rumor into a long-lasting, market-wide crisis. Our results also demonstrate the usefulness of illiquidity measures to alert market participants to impending market runs.

N00|A Jury of Her Peers: The Impact of the First Female Jurors on Criminal Convictions|This article uses an original data set of more than 3,000 cases from 1918 to 1926 in the Central Criminal Courts of London to study the effect of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act of 1919. Implemented in 1921, this Act made women eligible to serve on English juries. Results based on a pre-post research design imply that the inclusion of women had little effect on overall conviction rates but significantly impacted conviction rates on particularly female salient cases: sex offences, violent offences with female versus male victims and female defendants charged with ‘other’ (largely abortion related) offences.
N00|Anomalous Trading Prior to Lehman Brothers' Failure|We study price discovery during the liquidity freeze of September 2008, when fundamental values were difficult to be assessed. We find that trading volume and trade size significantly increased two days before the public announcement of Lehman's lethal quarter loss. Nevertheless, informational risk as perceived by liquidity suppliers increased only after the public disclosure of this loss. The price impact of trades was minimal and stock markets kept on working efficiently for Lehman stocks until the insolvency announcement. Price efficiency is on average established after half a second, which could have been exploited by low-latency traders.
N00|A Culture of Kinship: Chinese Genealogies as a Souce for Research in Demographic Economics|This paper discusses the use of Chinese genealogies for research on economic demography. I focus both on what is known about the genealogy as a data source, and what are the open questions for future research. Chinese genealogies contain records at the individual level. With the publication of new catalogs and efforts to collect genealogies, the number of genealogies is even larger than previously thought, with most dating to the late Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) Dynasties. These records contain a rich source of information about the Chinese population history, over a period for which there is no alternative source of information. Yet, the source still remains largely unexploited. Although the work of transcribing the data is significant, and selection biases need to be carefully considered, preliminary analysis of the data for a sample of married men for Tongcheng County in Anhui Province suggests these data are a rich source of information for demographic and economics research.
N00|The Home Front: Rent Control and the Rapid Wartime Increase in Home Ownership|The US home ownership rate rose by 10 percentage points between 1940 and 1945, about half the size of the net change over the 20th century, despite severe restrictions on construction during World War II. I present evidence that wartime rent control which covered over 80 percent of the 1940 U.S. rental housing stock played an important role in this shift, as suggested by Friedman and Stigler (1946). The empirical test exploits features of the central authority's method of imposing rent control, which generated variation in the size of rent reductions for cities that had seen similar increases in rents prior to control. Greater rent reductions were associated with greater increases in home ownership over the rst half of the 1940's. This relationship does not appear to be driven by di erential trends in housing demand or other unobserved factors potentially correlated with variation in rent reductions. The estimates suggest that rent control may explain 65 percent of the urban increase in home ownership over the rst half of the 1940's.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N00|Who was colonized and when? A cross-country analysis of determinants|The process of colonization has shaped the economic and demographic contours of the modern world. In this paper, we study the determinants of the occurrence and timing of colonization of non-European countries by Western European powers. Of particular interest is the role of early development measures that are known to be strong correlates of present-day levels of income. We show that non-European societies with longer histories of agriculture and statehood and higher levels of technology adoption in 1500 were less likely to be colonized, and tended to be colonized later if at all. We also find that proximity to the colonizing powers, disease environment, and latitude are significant predictors of the occurrence and timing of colonization, although their impacts are less robust to choice of country sample. Our models have high explanatory power, and their support for the significance of early development is robust to the use of alternative indicators of early development and disease, to the use of instruments to focus on the exogenous component of early development, and to the joint estimation of the colonization and timing equations to correct for potential selection bias.
N00|China’s GDP per capita from the Han Dynasty to communist times|Our article is a critical survey of the concepts and data utilized by economists and economic historians that purport to measure relative levels and long term trends in GDP per capita from the Han Dynasty to Communist times. We favour attempts to extend macro-economic analysis and its associated quantification to China’s long imperial history, but have concluded that estimates calibrated in international dollars for 1900, or 2005 or 2011 are not fit for that purpose. Furthermore, and after surveying recent endeavours to reconstruct the published secondary and official statistical sources available for the measurement of primary production for Ming and Qing China (1368-1911), we reluctantly suggest that Kuznetian paradigms for empirical economics are probably not viable, either for the measurement of the empire’s growth over time or for reciprocal comparisons with European economies. This is because on both conceptual and statistical grounds the concept and associated metric for GDP per capita does not travel easily and securely between the fiscal systems of China and the West (Yun-Casallila and O’Brien 2012).
N00|The first Sterling Area|"""Between the eleventh century and mid-thirteenth century a Sterling Area evolved in the British Isles, with a common currency based upon the English silver penny and equivalents of it produced in Scotland and Ireland. This Sterling Area began to contract in the second half of the fourteenth century, when reductions in the bullion content of Scottish coins ended the equivalence of the English and Scottish currencies, and in the fifteenth century Ireland developed its own coinage. Estimates of the currency of the Sterling Area are provided, taking the chronology of its growth and contraction into account. Estimates of the sterling currency are not estimates of the currency of England, and they cannot be combined with data relating exclusively to England in economic modelling, without qualification. Per capita currency estimates and values of coin hoards and single coin finds are at a high level around 1400, falling in the second half of the fifteenth century, indicating that the European ‘bullion famine’ of the 1390s to c. 1415 had less effect on the currency than the second late medieval bullion crisis, from the 1430s to the 1460s."""

N00|Tracing the Evolution of Agglomeration Economies: Spain, 1860–1991|"""This article attempts to quantify how the effect of agglomeration economies on population growth has evolved over time. Using district population in Spain between 1860 and 1991, recorded approximately every decade, this article examines whether initial population affects subsequent population growth. Our results show that, while the relationship between these two variables hardly existed during the second half of the 19th century, this link increased significantly between 1910 and 1970, although this trend was abruptly interrupted by the Civil War and the autarkic period that followed. The intensity of this relationship debilitated in the 1970s, a process that continued during the 1980s as rural out-migration diminished and de-industrialisation hit traditional manufacturing sectors. Our findings also stress that agglomeration economies were stronger in medium-size districts, especially from 1960 onwards, thus suggesting that congestion costs began to mitigate the benefits arising from agglomeration economies in the largest locations.""<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"

N00|Who should own and control urban water systems? Disease and the municipalisation of private waterworks in nineteenth-century England|"""Nearly one third of England’s more than 300 privately built waterworks became publicly owned by 1910. In this paper, we study the extent to which public acquisition affected deaths from typhoid fever, a waterborne disease. We collect annual district-level typhoid fatality rates from 1869 to 1910, which are then paired with detailed waterworks information. By exploiting the variation in municipalization across time, we find that deaths from typhoid fever fell by approximately 19 percent in the years following municipalization. The effect is even larger for older waterworks. Although a large body of previous research has explored how the switch between public and private ownership affects waterborne disease rates, that research yields conflicting results and is limited to the United States and Argentina.

Exploring dynamics of mutual cooperative formation in Swedish health insurance at the turn of the twentieth century|"""In this paper we explore the dynamics of mutual cooperative formation in Swedish health insurance during the period 1901 to 1910 ‐ a period where health insurance was in the making and organized along voluntary, ‘fraternal’ principles and compulsory, ‘factory scheme’ principles. Most previous studies on health insurance have addressed information asymmetry issues on either voluntary fraternal based societies or compulsory factory based societies, while few studies has compared the two forms of health insurance and their implications. By comparing the outcome in terms of sickness for the two forms of organization, this paper traces the efficiency in controlling for moral hazard and adverse selection across a large panel of voluntary and compulsory health insurance societies. We find that voluntary societies were equal to, or even more efficient, than compulsory societies suggesting that voluntary principles help mitigate moral hazard and select risk."""

N00|Does liberalisation promote international trade? An empirical analysis of the Kennedy Round GATT negotiations, 1964-67|"""As reported in the literature, studies on the effectiveness of GATT/WTO in enhancing the growth of world trade have produced remarkably different results. Rose (2004a and 2004b), whose work paved the way for an empirical analysis of the impact of GATT/WTO, reported no positive effects. Subsequently, other scholars (Tomz, Goldstein, Rivers 2007a and 2007b; Subramanian and Wei, 2007; Eicher and Henn, 2011, among others) tried to confirm or overturn Rose’s result by refining the analysis on econometric or economic grounds but produced ambiguous results. The work described herein contributes to this debate by providing an empirical analysis of the effects of the GATT Kennedy Round (1964-1967) on world trade. Our research question was whether the 1968-1972 multilateral tariff reductions implemented as a result of the Round enhanced trade growth. To address this question, we refined the method with which the effectiveness of GATT/WTO could be measured by accounting for asymmetries across countries and products in the GATT-liberalizing path. We first considered the different levels of GATT-activity participation of its members, and, secondly, after disaggregating imports by products, we measured the effects of tariff reduction on these products for the twenty-nine countries that attended the Round. This preliminary version of our paper focused on asymmetries across countries, and our findings indicated that the Kennedy Round had a positive effect on the imports of those countries that reduced tariffs significantly. We further demonstrated GATT’s negative or insignificant effect on average GATT members and showed that non-GATT members traded less than members. Our preliminary results are consistent with the history and design of GATT and are exactly in line with the path of liberalization."""
N00|The value of craftwork in a nineteenth-century industrialised economy: The Scottish case|"""My research into the craft economy starts with the premise that far from disappearing with the rise of machine production, handwork survived, evolved creatively and thrived in various ways throughout the period under consideration and beyond. The project from which this presentation is derived considers Scotland, putting the country in a broader British and European context. It explores sectoral and business case studies and includes a survey of craft design, exhibition and retail. This paper examines the character and value of craft production in a modernized industrial economy, focussing on two sectors producing luxury goods for personal consumption – glass and silverware - where handwork and machine work co-existed in a complex relationship. The approach that underpins the research embraces the materiality of manufactured goods relative to craft skill, considering, for instance, the haptic and visual contemporary meaning of hand-made goods. It is also founded on a consideration of the cultural and market value that craft skill represented. By ‘craft value’ what I mean is a consideration of financial value as a function of material costs and labour input (both design and production); but also the aesthetic and cultural value that is accorded to various forms of manufacture where there was a complex interaction between the evidence contained in goods and made apparent to consumers, that they were a product of the ‘hand’ or of the ‘machine’, or of both, and that manufacturers could choose to highlight one over the other to meet market expectations."""
N00|Palm oil industry 1970-2010: Do we see a flying geese pattern emerging?|"""Palm oil has been one of the fastest growing agricultural sectors the past half a century. Today palm oil is the most traded and produced vegetable oil in the world, and is used in a large number of products.1 Its legacy would at first glance seem mixed. On the one hand, it has been criticized for leading to the destruction of rainforests in Indonesia and Malaysia. On the other hand, palm oil has lifted many out of poverty in these two countries.2 Despite this mixed legacy, the palm oil sector is likely to expand in the future. The nature of its future expansion is crucially dependent on the direction of technological progress and innovation. For instance, a new technology, which allows for more palm oil extraction per tree, could lead to less land being required to meet demand thereby limiting the impact on the environment. In addition, such improvements could lead to a more profitable industry, which could lead to increased welfare for countries producing palm oil. The level of technology largely determines a country’s comparative advantage, as seemingly is also the case in the palm oil industry. Malaysia has since the 1960s moved from mainly exporting crude palm oil to exporting the higher value added processed palm oil in the 1970s and eventually created more forward linkages to food processing, chemicals and biodiesel since the 1980s. This gradual increase in value-added has made Malaysia the technological leader within the industry. Indonesia, however, has recently overtaken Malaysia in both production and exports of palm oil. The high growth of the Indonesian palm oil sector has been driven primarily by increased exports of crude palm oil. The paper uses a flying-geese framework to analyse the nature of dynamic comparative advantage in the palm oil sector. The literature on the palm oil sector has thus far focused mainly on revealed comparative advantage and the linkages of palm oil in the two countries by themselves. This paper instead focuses on the interdependency of Indonesia and Malaysia and analyses the comparative advantage in both countries over time. This paper first introduces the international palm oil market and its ascendency. The second and third parts give a brief overview of the history of the palm oil sector in the two largest producers, Indonesia and Malaysia. In the fourth part the flying-geese framework is explained and attempted to fit the palm oil sector. In the fifth part the comparative advantage of Indonesia and Malaysia are compared to analyse whether these fit with the prediction of the flying geese theory."""

N00|Measuring the rise of the parish welfare state in England, c.1600-1800|"""In the late sixteenth century, the famed Elizabethan poor laws commanded every parish in the kingdom to relieve their poor residents though local taxation. By around 1800, England’s parishes were spending more than £4 million per year on poor relief. This paper examines the long-term rise of the so-called ‘parish welfare state’ in this period through a new dataset based on annual expenditures on relief from a sample of more than 150 parishes, created by myself and Jonathan Healey. This paper will introduce the new dataset, outlining the process by which it was assembled and the methodology used to calculate annual relief totals at the national level. Its strengths and weaknesses, including coverage and representativeness, will be assessed. The preliminary results of this project can be compared to previous 'snapshot' estimates, showing - for example - that spending on relief in the mid-seventeenth-century was likely significantly higher than previously thought. The new series can also be compared to other indices such as population, inflation and GDP to shows how the growth of poor relief related to wider demographic and economic changes. Finally, the new series indicates that poor relief did not grow slowly and steadily across the period, but rather experienced alternating phases of expansion and retrenchment. These periods of stability were interspersed with bursts of rapid growth during crisis moments."""
N00|Does centralisation foster human capital accumulation? Quasi-experimental evidence from Italy’s Liberal Age|"""The impact of educational reforms on inputs into schooling and educational outcomes remains under researched in economics and economic history. This gap is filled by the present paper, which offers a framework to explore the impact of a move towards centralized education that was introduced in Italy in 1911. Our analysis is based on a stratified sample of 1074 Italian municipalities observed between 1911 and 1931, and on a clear identification strategy based on the peculiar features of the norms aimed to centralize Italy’s school system. The evidence that we present shows that centralization fostered the growth of primary education at the country level by accelerating the pace of human capital convergence in the most disadvantaged areas of the country – especially in southern regions.

N00|Law and economic efficiency: English private property law and Muslim family endowments (awqāf) in British India|"""The transformation of indigenous legal norms into state service under colonialism is a well-told story. Relatively lesser attention is paid to the response of natives who were subjected to the transformed law. This paper measures the response of Indian Muslims to the private property law regime for land introduced by the British in India in the late nineteenth century. It is based on the cases decided between 1800 and 1950 by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council—the highest court of appeal in the British Empire. I argue that not only Indian Muslims played an important role in the operation of the legal system, laymen also adjusted their modes of disposal of landed property by taking into account legal developments. This paper analyses the origins of various types of Muslim endowments (awqāf, singular waqf) in the social and political context of various Indian provinces. These provinces were subjected to different property law regime. It challenges the traditional view proposed by Kozlowski that the family waqf originated in British India as a result of the strict application of Islamic inheritance law and the introduction of private property regime under the English legal system. Rather, it shows that the pattern of the creation of endowments was affected by multiple factors which included politics, history and law. The land policy of the East India Company and confiscation of properties after the 1857 uprising were important political factors which affected the establishment of endowments. This study contributes to the debates on law and development, colonialism and law, and legal transplants."""
N00|Women and economic growth: the European marriage pattern in the context of modern day countries|"""In recent years, the European Marriage Pattern (EMP) has received renewed attention. De Moor and Van Zanden (2010) and Voigtländer and Voth (2006, 2013) have argued that a high age of female first marriage in pre-industrial Europe had a strong hand in explaining why certain parts of Europe, notably England and the Netherlands, were successfully able to advance, and, by inference, why Europe was ultimately able to overtake the East, leading to the West’s economic dominance up to the modern day. Underlying this story is a more general hypothesis of female empowerment, particularly in the years which followed the Black Death in the middle of the fourteenth century. At a time of growing interest in feminism, and when global bodies such as the World Bank and United Nations are placing emphasis on gender equality as a means to economic development, this type of explanation of European success has significant appeal in the wider public domain. With this modern day agenda in mind, a small number of economic historians have begun to contrast the EMP with conditions in today’s developing countries (see, for example, Engelen and Puschman, 2011, Carmichael, 2011 and Carmichael and van Zanden, 2015). However, the future contribution of economic historians to the question of how poor countries can become rich comes with an important caveat: a question mark over the impact of the relatively high age at marriage on fertility and, more generally, a debate as to the real extent of female empowerment in Europe in the pre-modern period (Clark, 2007, chapter 4; Lee and Wang, 1999; Dennison and Ogilvie, 2014; Humphries and Weisdorf, 2015). Further exploration is clearly required and there is a particular need to bring together the type of work conducted by economic historians with that of economic growth theorists and development economists. As such, this paper uses data on modern day countries to explore whether factors such as the female first age of marriage and the fertility rate can deliver economic success, as measured in terms of economic growth and poverty reduction. Econometric analysis is carried out on a sample of over 150 modern day countries, whilst a comparison of China and India provides a more detailed case-study. The results provide support for the notion that female empowerment, through its effect on fertility, is an important contributor to economic performance and that it can help account for the difference in performance between China and India over the last three decades. In particular, this paper finds that one less child per woman raises the economic growth rate of an economy by around 0.5% a year (in per capita terms) and lowers the poverty rate by 7%- points. Applying these results suggests that had the birth rate in China not fallen over the last forty years, the poverty rate in the country today would now be 37% instead of the current 11%. Furthermore, we find that the greater success that China has experienced in terms of decreasing fertility compared with India explains 70% of difference in poverty between the two countries. Moreover, not only would reducing fertility help in South Asia, this paper also finds that it would have a dramatic effect in Sub-Saharan Africa, with the results of the data analysis suggesting that reducing fertility to 2.1 births per woman (the level required for a stable population) would cut the poverty rate in the region by half."""

N00|International trade and the energy intensity in Europe, 1870-1935|"""Previous research suggests there is an inverted U-shape curve for energy intensity in the long-run for Western Europe with a peak in the early 20th century. The upswing of the curve in the phase of early industrialization in the second half of the 19th century was due to the performance of two large coal-based economies: Germany and Britain. Other European countries either had a flat or declining energy intensity curve in that period. This paper tests the hypothesis that the increase of German and British energy intensity was an effect from the concentration of heavy industrial production to these countries, although the consumption of a significant share of these goods took place elsewhere. Perhaps Germany and Britain, as the ‘workshops of the world’, were doing the dirty work for goods consumed by others, as is argued for China today. We use an entirely new database that we have constructed (TEG: Trade, Energy, Growth) to test if these countries exported more energy-demanding goods than they imported, thus providing other countries with means to industrialize and to consume cheap energy demanding goods. The analysis confirms our hypothesis. The pronounced German curve without trade adjustments entirely disappears when we account for energy embodied in the traded commodities. For Britain the EKC curve changes into a fluctuating pattern during the second half of the 19th century, before falling from WWI onwards. On balance for the total of our sample of seven European countries the upward slope of the curve also disappears when trade is taken into account. Still, for Europe as a whole it is not likely that the curve disappears, but rather becomes weaker, after trade adjustment."""
N00|Trade and overcoming land constraints in the British Industrial Revolution: the role of coal and cotton revisited|"""Land was an unambiguous constraint for growth in the preindustrial period. It was overcome through the transition from traditional land-based goods to coal, a punctiform energy resource. Pomeranz (2000) suggested that the British industrial revolution was also spurred by having access to overseas land, primarily from colonies. In this regard he claimed that cotton imports were quantitatively more important than coal in liberating Britain from its land constraint in its early industrialization. This paper takes this argument and analysis one step further by investigating not only the imports to Britain but also its exports of all significant land-using or –substituting products. This gives an entirely different picture of Britain’s role as a nexus of international exchange. Apart from in the early 19th century, when potash constituted a major land-demanding import, Britain was a net-exporter of land embodied in traded commodities. In other words, the core was not simply appropriating flows of land and resources from abroad but it provided trading partners with at least as many, if not more, land-expanding resources."""
N00|Financialisation of the early Victorian economy and the London Stock Exchange|"""Previously unknown basic statistics are obtained about the opera- tions of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in early Victorian times. Integration of data from the Bank of England Archive with price reports, press coverage, and other sources produces estimates for volume of transactions, distribution of earnings among dealers, efficiency of the market, and the coverage of avail- able price lists. For example, it is found that for some securities, prices were reported for under 20% of transactions. The LSE was surprisingly small and by some measures also surprisingly efficient. Much of its efficiency appears to have come from its deep involvement in the “shadow banking system” of that era, a connection that appears to have been misunderstood and almost com- pletely neglected in the past. The low levels of activity, the dominance of small investors, and low cost of the system show the very early stages of the “fi- nancialization” of the modern economy and provide interesting perspectives on modern developments."""
N00|Did Japan's high-growth success foster persistent stagnation?|This paper contends that there is a continuum in Japan's experience of growth and decline from the 1990s to the turn of the century and beyond. A lingering attachment to the bureaucratic, financial and political underpinnings of high-growth success affected Japan's response to critical shifts in national and international economic circumstance once economic catch-up had been achieved. The institutional and ideational matrix constructed to deliver catch-up growth subsequently affected the content and fate of economic policy in subsequent decades. In the tensions that emerged between shifting circumstance and established practice can be traced the origins and nature of the â€˜boom and bustâ€™ years of the 1990s, the lacklustre reform programme that ensued and the reasons for continued stagnation into the new millennium.
N00|Policies to overcome stagnation: the crisis, and the possible futures, of all things euro|This article argues that the Europe's continuing economic underperformance, particularly in the eurozone, is neither a function of insufficient information (policymakers do not know the right policies) nor ideology (policymakers are unable to recognize the right policies due to ideological priors). Rather, this article places the continuation of policies that cause stagnation in a longer historical context. Building upon the insights of Kalecki (1943) regarding the political limits of full employment policies, it is argued that the shift from a regime that generated inflation, low profitability, and a high degree of equality to one that generates deflation, high profitability, and inequality has hamstrung the ability of policymakers to respond positively to the situation at hand. This has generated structural pressures for political realignment across cases that compound the economic problems of stagnation while exacerbating tensions between different European â€˜Varieties of Capitalism.â€™ The result is a set of â€˜second-bestâ€™ strategies that lead to second-best outcomes in both politics and economics that further stress the already stressed economies and polities of Europe.
N00|The visible hand: the role of government in China’s long-awaited industrial revolution| China is undergoing its long-awaited industrial revolution. There is no shortage of commentary and opinion on this dramatic period, but few have attempted to provide a coherent, in-depth, political-economic framework that explains the fundamental mechanisms behind China’s rapid industrialization. This article reviews the Embryonic Economic Development theory put forth by Wen (2016a). This article reviews the Embryonic Economic Development theory put forth by Wen . It illuminates the critical sequence of developmental stages since the reforms enacted by Deng Xiaoping in 1978: namely, small-scale commercialized agricultural production, proto-industrialization in the countryside, a formal industrial revolution based on mass production of labor-intensive light consumer goods, a sustainable ‘industrial trinity’ boom in energy/motive power/infrastructure, and a second industrial revolution involving the mass production of heavy industrial goods. This developmental sequence follows essentially the same pattern as Great Britain’s Industrial Revolution, despite sharp differences in political and institutional conditions. One of the key conclusions exemplified by China’s economic rise is that the extent of industrialization is limited by the extent of the market. One of the key strategies behind the creation and nurturing of a continually growing market in China is based on this premise: The free market is a public good that is very costly for nations to create and support. Market creation requires a powerful ‘mercantilist’ state and the correct sequence of developmental stages; China has been successfully accomplishing its industrialization through these stages, backed by measured, targeted reforms and direct participation from its central and local governments.

N00|A Confusion of Capital in the United States|Thomas Piketty’s book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, reopens fundamental questions about the role and rewards of capital that economists have never resolved. It does so by exploring the history of capital and derives much of its credibility from the evidence it marshals in defence of its claims. In this paper, I evaluate the basis for Piketty’s arguments by considering them in light of the history of US capitalism. I argue that it is extremely difficult to make economic sense of Piketty’s historical analysis of capital in the US in the 19th and 20th centuries. That is true, only in part, due to the distinctive choices he makes, compared to mainstream economists, in defining and measuring capital. Much more problematic, in fact, are theoretical commitments he shares with them that preclude an understanding of capital’s historical role and rewards in the US economy. Based on a discussion of several important features of US economic history, I have argued that such an understanding demands an historical analysis of capital, both productive and financial capital, in relation to the evolving social organisation of capitalism in the US.
N00|Explaining the failure of international tax regulations throughout the 20th century. Offshore Markets, Swiss Tax Haven's Diplomacy and Fiscal Debates in International Organizations, From the League of Nations to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development|Based on original sources from national and international organizations archives, this paper offers a new perspective on debates on tax evasion in multilateral arenas during the whole 20th Century. A closer look at the cycles of emergence and disappearance of this topic enables to understand why these discussions were raised inside international organizations and why they constantly failed. This paper focuses in particular on the foundation of tax multilateralism at the League of Nations (1922-1928) and the early activities of the OEEC Fiscal Committee (1956-1963), as well as on OECD efforts to increase international cooperation against tax evasion practices from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. In three cases, multilateral initiatives against tax evasion faced unyielding opposition by business interests and tax haven countries such as Switzerland. However, in order to explain the failure of the regulations, we have also to take into account the interests of big countries in maintaining offshore activities. Ultimately, the paper demonstrates how international organizations served as multipliers for dominant power relations on issues of international taxation.
N00|Change for continuity: the making of the société anonyme in 19th century france|The corporation (société anonyme) first appeared in French law in the code de commerce promulgated in 1807. Until 1863-1867, a special authorization granted by the government was needed for any creation of a SA. The literature generally emphasizes the importance of these two dates: the first one as the birth of a fundamental institution for the development of industrial capitalism; the second one as the triumph of private capitalism over the state and the liberalization of the SA. This paper challenges this narrative and shows that these changes in formal law were in reality vehicles for the continuity of practices. On the contrary, the stability of the law between 1807 and 1867 disguises radical change in the meaning of the SA. More generally, this paper highlights the importance of the actors' interpretation of the institutions they activate and, consequently, the limits of the approaches that are limited to observing the formal characteristics of the institutions.
N00|Historical patterns of economic growth in Africa: A review|The study of long term growth in Africa has recently been invigorated by the work of economists. To date, this literature has been motivated by explaining a divergence of income and has focussed on finding persistent factors that can explain a chronic failure of growth in Africa. This chapter reviews some periods of economic growth in the past two centuries, and suggest that there must be more to learn from studying these periods of economic change and accumulation, particularly because they were accompanied by significant changes in institutions, or how the economy and the society was organized. The African economic history literature does emphasise dynamism - as opposed to persistence, and diversity in outcomes across time and space - in contrast to the average stagnation that has prompted the economic literature. In sum, there is more to learn from studying the history of economic growth in the African past, than what can be gauged from a search for a root cause of African economic underdevelopment.
N00|What are production, work and consumption? Trans-historical re-conceptualisations|This paper argues for trans-historical reformulations of the basic economic concepts of production, work and consumption. The definition of the production boundary by System of National Accounts (SNA) is inconsistent from a scientific point of view. For example, while some non-market and illegal services are viewed as productive, others are not, and services and goods are treated differently. The definition proposed by feminist economics, the so-called third person criterion, is consistent, but in need for further development; furthermore, it is a definition of work and not of production. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether it is possible to formulate a non-eclectic set of logically consistent definitions that could be considered variations of a common underlying understanding across various theoretical traditions – mainly Classical, Neoclassical, Institutional, Marxist, Feminist and Keynesian Economics – of how humans consciously change external nature in order satisfy human needs. Important issues concern how to deal with violence, double counting of transaction costs, human capital formation, non-market activities and causation of final consumption. Production, work and consumption are defined as relations between events, the subject matter and the agent, and in the main definitions reduced to non-economic sentences. Even the utility concept is avoided. First-order logic is used, complemented with modal operators for some of the sentences. In this study, it is shown that production, work and consumption all share the common feature of intentional physical transformation of the intrinsic properties of the subject matter. The object transformed during the productive activity and work must at some point in time be external to the agent. For work, the purpose of transforming an external object must not lie in the transformation of the agent. A productive activity must potentially be able to cause the satisfaction of human needs, or final consumption, which is not a condition for work or required by the third-person criterion. Final consumption involves the transformation of the subject matter that is a final purpose for the consumer or serves as a purpose for transforming the consumer. Using a criterion applied by the institutional economist Cheung to identify transaction costs, this study defines social reproduction as an activity that would not occur in a Robinson Crusoe economy. Social reproduction occurs under an institutional setting. We can further differentiate between coercive and non-coercive social reproduction. In this study, eight different definitions of production are presented. The definition of agent external production is close to the third person criterion, but the possible causation of future final consumption is included as a condition for a productive activity. It is also related to the basic neoclassical model with its assumptions of no transaction costs. The definition of agent external non-coercive production entails that transformations of persons against their own will, whether legally or illegally performed, are unproductive activities. The definition of agent external non-social production entails that all socially reproductive activities are unproductive, and comes close to the distinction made by Classical and Marxist economists of productive and unproductive work. Humanity external production only includes the transformation of non-persons. The three definitions of time scale invariant production entails that human capital formation could be considered productive activities. Market production comes close to Keynesian theory and the present definition of SNA, with the difference that it excludes non-market goods production. The present study also opens for the possibility of unproductive work, for example failed production or professional murder, and productive final consumption that does not involve any work, for example hobby-hunting, play with children or research activity for own pleasure. Which definition of production is applied greatly affects the modelling and empirical application of growth theory and the analysis of the driving forces in economic history. For example, assume trade causes labour productivity outside of trade to increase four-fold due to specialisation, while the share of GDP in total working time increases from nil to half. With the same value added per productive hour and with total hours worked kept constant, the value added of agent external production then records a four-fold increase, while that of non-social production only a doubling. Similarly, during wars the SNA GDP often increases substantially, while the concept of agent external non-coercive production entails that all war expenses are treated as unproductive. Time frame invariant production grows faster than agent external production during expansions of the education system. Market production could serve important analytical purposes, for example to investigate the relation between money supply and inflation, but should be rid of inconsistencies such as the inclusion of non-market goods production.
N00|A Narrative Account of Legislated Social Security Changes for Germany|Exploiting official historical records of the German Bundestag and Bundesrat, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the German statutory pension insurance scheme, we construct a narrative of legislated social security changes for Germany between 1970 and 2013 in order to identify important discretionary shocks to the social security system. The historical account covers major changes in transfers and social security benefits and contributions for pensions, health care, long-term care and unemployment insurance on the German federal level and thus complements the tax narrative of Uhl (2013). Based on the provided information we are able to code a rich bottom-up time-series of fiscal policy shocks for empirical macroeconomic analysis, addressing the identification problem. Therefore, we collect information regarding the underlying motivation, the dates of the legislative process and the prospective financial impact, closely following the methodology of Romer and Romer (2010) and Uhl (2013).
N00|Decision Making And Saint Petersburg Paradox: Focusing On Heuristic Parameters, Considering The Non-Ergodic Context And The Gambling Risks|The Saint Petersburg Paradox is still a contemporary issue because of the great impact on the probabilistic theory and decision-making. This article proposes some hints on avoiding the trap of the infinite expected value (EV). The highly stochastic mechanism and its EV have always to be contextualized in the limited period where we take our choices taking into account all possible limitations deriving from the theory (including the non-ergodic features and some inappropriate consequences we may attribute to the EV). This contextualisation is one of the most important factors to consider especially when we deal with infinite quantity coming from models that may misrepresent our field of application and therefore generate paradoxes.
N00|The Political Economy of Free Trade, WTO and the Developing Countries|This paper examines the existing literature on trade liberalisation and itseffect on the economies of developing countries. It will also briefly examine the theory of comparative advantage which is seen as justification for global trade liberalisation under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation. This process is also associated with greater openness, economic interdependence and deepening economic integration with the world economy. The study is important because once again the international institutions strongly advocate trade and financial liberalisation in developing countries. The proponents of trade liberalisation argue that multilateral trade negotiations would achieve these goals, and poor countries particularly would benefit from it. However, such policies may increase vulnerability and make developing countries further hostages of international finance capital. Adoption of open market policies in agriculture would also mean the abandoning of self-reliance and food sovereignty, which may have wider consequences in terms of food shortages, food prices and rural employment.

N00|The Postulate of the Three Regimes of Economic Growth Contradicted by Data|Economic growth in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, countries of the former USSR, Africa and Latin America were analysed. It is demonstrated that the fundamental postulate of the Unified Growth Theory about the existence of the three regimes of growth (Malthusian regime, post-Malthusian regime and sustained-growth regime) is contradicted by data. These regimes did not exist. In particular, there was no escape from the Malthusian trap because there was no trap. Economic growth in all these regions was not stagnant but hyperbolic. Unified Growth Theory is fundamentally incorrect. However, this theory is also dangerously misleading because it claimsa transition from the endless epoch of stagnation to the new era of sustained economic growth, the interpretation creating the sense of security and a promise of prosperity. The data show that the opposite is true. Economic growth in the past was sustained and secure. Now, it is supportedby the increasing ecological deficit. The long-term sustained and secure economic growth has yet to be created. It did not happen automatically, as suggested incorrectly by the Unified Growth Theory.
N00|The Unresolved Mystery of the Great Divergence is Solved|The so-called great divergence in the income per capita is described in the Unified Growth Theory as the mind-boggling and unresolved mystery about the growth process. This mystery has now been solved: the great divergence never happened. It was created by the manipulation of data. Economic growth in various regions is at different levels of development but it follows similar, non-divergent trajectories. Unified Growth Theory is shown yet again to be incorrect and scientifically unacceptable. It promotes incorrect and even potentially dangerous concepts. The distorted presentation of data supporting the concept of the great divergence shows that economic growth is now developing along moderately-increasing trajectories but mathematical analysis of the same data and even their undistorted presentation shows that these trajectories are now increasing approximately vertically with time. So, while the distorted presentation of data used in the Unified Growth Theory and the spuriously-created great divergence suggest the generally sustainable and secure economic growth, the undistorted presentation of data demonstrates that the growth is unsustainable and insecure. Similar dangerously incorrect concept promoted by the Unified Growth Theory is the repeated doctrine of takeoffs from the hypothetical but non-existent stagnation to growth. They also suggest prosperous and secure future. Such takeoffs never happened but even without them the current economic growth is insecure.
N00|Bollywood, Iindia and Economic Growth: A Hundred Years History|The main content of the following article is to describe the economic growth of an indigenous economy and the factors of its internalization. Bollywood can be used as a paradigmatic showcase for the improvement of ideas in the development of industries of emerging economies. This paper, via an extensive analysis, describes Bollywood as an economic factor for Indian’s growth. The reasons that led to this growth are described in an extended way, as well as the role of globalization and Indian’s Diaspora on this development.
N00|Growth of the World Population in the Past 12,000 Years and Its Link to the Economic Growth|Data describing the growth of the world population in the past 12,000 yearsare analysed. It is shown that,if unchecked, population does not increase exponentially but hyperbolically. This analysis reveals three approximately-determined episodes of hyperbolic growth: 10,000-500 BC, AD 500-1200 and AD 1400-1950, representing a total of about 89% of the past 12,000 years. It also reveals three demographic transitions: 500 BC-AD 500, AD 1200-1400 and AD 1950-present, representing the remaining 11% of the past 12,000 years. The first two transitions were between sustained hyperbolic trajectories. The current transition is to an unknown trajectory. There was never any form of dramatic transition from stagnation to growth, described often as a takeoff, because there was no stagnation in the growth of the world population. Correct understanding of the historical growth of human population is essential in the correct interpretation of the historical growth of income per capita.
N00|In the Labyrinth. State, Governments, and the Growth of the Public Debt in Italy in the Middle of 1980s|The ambition of this work is to rethink and present a possible path of historical-institutional investigation in relation to and with a critical comparison of solid economic, political and sociological research into the political causes of rapid increase of public debt and its ‘instrumentalization’ by coalition governments for the purposes of consensus, in the blocked political-institutional system, as the first Executives in the Italian Republic’s history not led by Christian Democrats (DC) Prime Minister. The reason for the decision to concentrate the analysis on a reduced portion of that decade – and therefore chronologically not going past 1988-89, the year of a passage to a different phase for many aspects – responds to the intention of concentrating the analysis and delving into the sources (archival and institutional sources, but also archives of political parties). Italian State has always lived above its means, with a constant imbalance between income and expenditure and at the same time expanding its distance with respect to society (but the debt was paid by social groups that took advantage of it), a process that triggered off a perennial crisis of representation and strengthened the instability of relations between political institutions and society. Moreover, public debt crises, as historical research suggests, are always crises of institutional legitimization and require a redefinition of the ways in which sovereignty and political power are exercised.Thus, the article investigates the impact of the ‘political use’ of public debt by italian governments on the relationship between the State and society.

N00|Long-Term Trends in Income Distribution|Income and wealth inequalities in most countries - in the West, the former communist economies and in many developing states - have been growing in the last three decades. Inequalities in the late XIX century were much higher than before the rise of workers' movements in the West and the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, the strong inequalities of the previous century declined for over half a century until the 1980s as the threat of communism spreading inspired welfare redistributive reforms, giving capitalism 'a more human face'. But these checks and balances have greatly weakened in recent decades, especially after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the growth of inequalities resumed in most developed and many developing countries with some notable exceptions (Latin America). This article discusses long term past and possible future trends in inequality. High inequalities are associated with an array of negative consequences, which lower the competitiveness of societies and countries, especially at higher stages of development. Inequalities cannot grow endlessly, there is probably a critical level of inequality, and if it is exceeded, national states descend into turmoil of social conflicts and fall apart. If the growth of income inequalities continues, then countries can get into the bad stable equilibrium trap that reproduces itself: poor quality of state institutions, low growth, low social mobility, high social tensions. Gradual reforms could help overcoming the trap, but if they are delayed, the further growth of inequalities could lead to social revolution.
N00|Decomposition of Income Inequality in Contemporary Russia|Over the last 25 years, Russia has passed from the group of countries distinguished by low levels of income inequality to the group distinguished by high ones. The macroeconomic analysis shows that this process is due to the differences in salaries, the weak equalizing effect of social transfers and new sources of income such as the income from property and of business activity. We have a poor understanding of the factors determining this inequality at the household level so far. Decomposition of equivalised household expenditure inequality into inter- and intra-groups using cross-sectional data (RLMS-HSE, 1994-2014) shows that during the whole research period one of the most significant factors of intergroup inequality is region of residence. During periods of high economic growth the significance of education and intensity of employment increased in intergroup inequality; however, during the period of economic stagnation the intergroup differentiation of educational potential began to decrease. Despite the important population policy aimed to increase the birth rate, children in families have become the most significant factor of intergroup inequality for the last years. A regression analysis of the determinants of inequality, which allows us to estimate the contribution of each factor to the model dispersion of per capita expenditure allows us to draw the conclusion that meritocratic factors explain a majority of observed inequality. The contribution of the child-burden factor to total inequality did not change during the past ten years, and at the same time, the inequality-decreasing effect of the presence of pensioners in households has continuously increased.
N00|Positive collaboration: Factors and mechanisms of evolution|This article proposes that two types of collaboration can be distinguished: a positive collaboration (not directed against third parties) and negative collaboration. I consider the hypothesis that in the process of social development, the transaction costs ratio of the three main types of coordination — competition, power, and collaboration — is changing in favor of the latter. The article examines the mechanisms that are responsible for the implementation of this tendency and attempts to explain its nonmonotonicity. It is shown that the strengthening role of positive collaboration is largely explained by cultural changes, including the enhancement of tolerance culture, spread of cosmopolitanism and altruism, and increase in the planning horizon as well as trust radius. I demonstrate the importance of the institutions that support positive collaboration in the process of catching-up development; it is shown that shock reforms could lead to the formation of negative collaboration mechanisms. A program of interdisciplinary research is outlined for the further development of these ideas.

N00|Corporate Psychology. How does Italian Entrepreneurship Change?|The analysis on the entrepreneurial system development in the world involves inevitably the question: why in some countries businesses made a specific evolutionary process unlike others? Certainly specific and social conditions as well as economic legacies or regulatory issues promoted by political systems involve. However, these factors are mainly relevant when comparing companies from countries with clear socio-economic disparities. In the presence of a homogeneous economic development, however, other significant factors seem to intervene. Corporate psychology therefore aims to identify the causes conditioning the entrepreneurial choices in developed economies. In Italy, the evolutionary behaviour of enterprises has been clearly conditioned from the entrepreneurs’ conception of doing business. This principle involves the choice of the entrepreneurial initiative, the subsequent managerial decisions, and more generally the entrepreneurial fabric development. This paper aims to introduce the topic of the corporate psychology related to new entrepreneurial initiatives in Italy and to propose it as a useful tool for a stable corporate development.
N00|"The Cambridge History of ""Capitalism"""|This review essay of the two-volume Cambridge History of Capitalism (2014), edited by Larry Neal and Jeffrey G. Williamson, is divided into three parts. First, I describe three chapters from the second volume that I recommend for all economists to add depth to their understanding of the world economy today. Robert C. Allen analyzes the world distribution of income; Randall Morck and Bernard Yeung discuss the history of business groups; and Peter Lindert surveys private and public programs to help the poor. In each case, they analyze historical backgrounds that illuminate current issues. Second, I criticize the definition of capitalism used in these volumes as too expansive to be useful. I argue that this definition mars the essays in first volume by stimulating a fruitless search for capitalism in the millennium before the Industrial Revolution. Third, I describe the essays in this reference work starting from the most recent and ending with those about antiquity. (JEL N00, P10)
N00|Rent Extraction, Population Growth and Economic Development: Development Despite Malthus’ Theory and Precursors to the Industrial Revolution|Several contemporary economists claim that ‘real' economic development only occurred following the Industrial Revolution. We contend that this is only so if a narrow view is taken of what constitutes economic development, namely increasing per capita income. Given a wider perspective, we argue that economic development occurred in hunter-gatherer societies and eventually accelerated in the second stage of the Agricultural Revolution. During this stage, a small dominant class (the elite) were able to extract rent (the economic surplus) from the mass of the population (the dominated) which they could use for development purposes. As a result of this rent extraction, the bulk of the population remained at subsistence level. Nevertheless, dissipation of the rent as a result of population increase was prevented. Consequently, the Malthusian trap could be avoided and the economic surplus could be used by the elite for development or other purposes. Whether or not economic development occurred depended on how the elite allocated the economic surplus. In the second stage of the Agricultural Revolution, the economic surplus was extracted primarily in the form of staples and the exchange of commodities was mostly directly controlled by the elite. This situation changed as states became larger in size and commodities became more diverse. In the few centuries preceding the Industrial Revolution in Europe, monarchs exerted decreasing direct control over the exchange, production and use of commodities. This was particularly noticeable in England. Also devolution of increased political power to nobles and local areas added to principal-and-agent problems. Sovereigns, instead of concentrating on the extraction of the economic surplus in the form of staples, increasingly relied on its extraction and storage in the form of treasures, precious metals and gems. Monarchs (in order to maximize their net extraction) focused on increasing the number of different markets and the extent of these but at the same time, extracted rent from them in the form of levies. Consequently, this Age of Mercantilism was marked by a substantial expansion in marketing even though this was combined with royal imposts on markets. This increase in marketing activities helped to pave the way for the Industrial Revolution by altering the balance of political power and facilitating sales of the products of the Industrial Revolution. Despite this, it seems likely that the Industrial Revolution only happened as a result of the chance occurrence of a combination of events. It was not inevitable.
N00|The Role of Palatial Economic Organization in Creating Wealth in Minoan and Mycenaean States|During the Late Bronze Age, Aegean societies (Minoan and Mycenaean) exhibited strong economic development. This resulted from the implementation by the elite of a centralized and hierarchical administrative and social system in order to manage most economic activities. In these palatial economies, the elite organized the extraction of the surplus, therefore avoiding the Malthusian trap. They also organized the division of labor and the specialization in production and the distribution of the collected surplus by means of staple and wealth finance systems, the latter being based on the production of luxury items controlled by the palace. Trade was also encouraged in order to strengthen palatial power.
N00|The Malthusian Trap and Development in Pre-Industrial Societies: A View Differing from the Standard One|Presents a simple economic theory explaining how some agriculturally based preindustrial societies (for example, in the Neolithic period) developed despite most of their population being subject to Malthusian dynamics. Their development depended on a dominant class (limited in size) extracting the economic surplus which could be used (among other things) to accumulate capital and advance knowledge and thereby, add to this surplus. Cities facilitated this process. Extraction of the surplus prevented increased population from dissipating it and curtailing development. Several early extractive and non-inclusive societies were long lasting. This is at odds with the theories of some contemporary development economists.
N00|Schooling, nation building and industrialization: a Gellnerian approach|"We model a two-region country where value is created through bilateral production between masses and elites (bourgeois and landowners). Industrialization requires the elites to finance schools and the masses to attend them. Schooling raises productivity, particularly for matches between masses and bourgeois. At the same time, only country-wide education (""unified schooling"") renders the masses mobile across regions. Alternatively, schools can be implemented in one region alone (""regional education"") or the regionally dominant group can choose to implement schooling in its own region but refuse to share the costs/proceeds within the wider country-level group (.secession.). We show that schools are more likely to be set-up when the bourgeoisie dominates, but that this is not necessarily socially efficient. Unified schooling is always chosen if the identity of the dominant elite at the regional and country level is the same and/or the industrialization shock is sufficiently high. If instead the bourgeoisie is dominant in one region and landowners are dominant countrywise, the bourgeoisie of that region may promote the secession of the region, and this can be socially efficient. The model is shown to be consistent with evidence for 19th century France and Spain."
N00|Independent invention in Italy during the Liberal Age, 1861–1913|" type=""main""> This article examines the phenomenon of independent invention in Italy during the Liberal Age (1861–1913). It makes use of a new dataset comprising all patents granted in Italy in five benchmark years: 1864–5, 1881, 1891, 1902, and 1911. The following exercises are carried out. First, an examination is undertaken of the shares of independent, corporate, and foreign inventions and their evolution over time and across industries. Second, by exploiting the peculiarities of Italian patent legislation, which was characterized by relatively cheap fees and a flexible renewal scheme, the relative quality of independent and corporate patents is assessed. The results indicate that in Italy independent inventors made an important contribution to technological change in terms of number of patents, but the quality of their patents was significantly lower than that of firms and of foreign patentees."
N00|The diffusion and impact of the corporation in 1910|" type=""main""> With new and comprehensive data on the international spread of listed and unlisted corporations before the First World War, this article shows the prominence of common law and Scandinavian civil law in the process. This association is interpreted as demonstrating the strong contribution of liberal (laissez-faire) industrial stances. The findings confirm an extended version of Rajan and Zingales's hypothesis that trade and capital openness are necessary for companies to flourish. Despite the possibilities that companies were created for fraud and exploitation, countries using the corporate form more extensively before 1914 had higher GDP per capita. Through this process, the benefit of imperialism extended to British dominions, but not much, if at all, to British dependent colonies."
N00|The effects of systemic banking crises in the inter-war period|This paper examines the time-profile of the impact of systemic banking crises on GDP and industrial production using a panel of 24 countries over the inter-war period and compares this to the post-war experience of these countries. We show that banking crises have effects that induce medium-term adjustments on economies. Focussing on an eight-year horizon, it is clear that the negative effects of systemic banking crises last over the entirety of this time-horizon. The effect has been identified for GDP and industrial production. The adverse effect on the industrial sector stands out as being substantially larger in magnitude relative to the macroeconomic effect. Comparing the results across long-run historical periods for the same selection of countries and variables identifies some differences that stand out: the short term macroeconomic impact effects are much larger in the post-war period, suggesting that the propagation channels of shocks operate at a faster pace in the more recent period. Moreover, the time-profile of effects differs, suggesting that modern policies may be modulating the temporal shape of the response to banking crises shocks. However, the broad magnitude of the adverse effect of banking crises remains comparable across these time periods.
N00|Mexican and Hispanic Net Nutrition in the 19th Century American West|When traditional methods for measuring economic welfare are scarce or unreliable, heights and BMIs are now well accepted measurements that represent biological conditions during economic development. Weight, after controlling for height, is an alternative measure to BMI for current net nutrition. Little is known about how weights varied among Mexicans living in the 19th century American West. Between 1870 and 1920, average Mexican weight decreased slightly. Mexican farmers had the heaviest weights, and unskilled worker weights were low. For combined characteristics, weight varied the most with height and age, two uncontrollable characteristics, indicating that 19th century Mexican current net nutrition varied the most with factors over which individuals of Mexican descent had no control.
N00|The International Monetary Fund: 70 Years of Reinvention|"A sketch of the International Monetary Fund's 70-year history reveals an institution that has reinvented itself over time along multiple dimensions. This history is primarily consistent with a ""demand driven"" theory of institutional change, as the needs of its clients and the type of crisis changed substantially over time. Some deceptively ""new"" IMF activities are not entirely new. Before emerging market economies dominated IMF programs, advanced economies were its earliest (and largest) clients through the 1970s. While currency problems were the dominant trigger of IMF involvement in the earlier decades, banking crises and sovereign defaults became the key focus after the 1980s. Around this time, the IMF shifted from providing relatively brief (and comparatively modest) balance-of-payments support in the era of fixed exchange rates to coping with more chronic debt sustainability problems that emerged with force in the developing economies and have now migrated to advanced economies. As a consequence, the IMF has engaged in ""serial lending,"" with programs often spanning decades. Moreover, the institution faces a growing risk of lending into insolvency; this has been most evident in Greece since 2010. We conclude with the observation that the IMF's role as an international lender of last resort is endangered."

Al final se sugieren similitudes entre el Gobierno Geisel y los gobiernos del Partido de los Trabajadores (PT), posibles ya que los últimos también adoptaran políticas favorables al sector productivo, sin enfrentamiento de los intereses financieros, aparte del breve tiempo en el que el Gobierno de Dilma intenta bajar los intereses bancarios.
N00|Crecimiento económico y desigualdad del ingreso en Venezuela: enfoque macro histórico en el contexto global-regional|A través de los años, la teoría económica ha señalado algunos determinantes de la relación positiva o negativa que pudiera existir entre crecimiento económico y desigualdad del ingreso. La integración de los mercados mediante la globalización también ofrece implicaciones sobre la desigualdad de los ingresos en todos los grupos poblacionales, siendo objeto de debate a nivel mundial. El siguiente trabajo trata de explicar, la relación entre crecimiento económico y la desigualdad del ingreso en Venezuela mediante un análisis macro histórico y tomando en consideración la globalización de los mercados. Para ello, se utiliza un modelo econométrico dinámico de rezagos distribuidos para el período 1970-2010. Los resultados muestran principalmente que la globalización comercial reduce la desigualdad del ingreso, mientras que la globalización financiera la incrementa, relación negativa en el corto plazo entre crecimiento económico y desigualdad, la cual tiende a desaparecer en el mediano plazo y en períodos de elevada inestabilidad macroeconómica.
N00|Rumors and Runs in Opaque Markets: Evidence from the Panic of 1907|Using a new daily dataset for all stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange from 1905 to 1910, we provide the first in-depth, microstructure analysis of the Panic of 1907 - one of the most severe financial crises of the 20th century - and quantify the critical role of asymmetric information in the generation of panic conditions. We first show that quoted equity bid-ask spreads rose six-fold, from 0.5% to 3%, during the peak weeks of the crisis. We then implement a spread decomposition procedure and pinpoint the source of the illiquidity spike in the adverse selection component; that is, the fear of informed trading. Moreover, we show that information costs rose most steeply in the mining sector - the origin of the panic rumors - and in other sectors with opaque corporate reporting standards. In addition to wider spreads and tight money markets, we find other hallmarks of information-based liquidity freezes: trading volume dropped and price impact rose. Importantly, despite shortterm cash infusions into the market, and abatement of the run, we find that the market remained relatively illiquid for several months following the panic. We go on to show that rising illiquidity enters positively in the cross section of stock returns. Thus, our findings demonstrate how opaque markets can easily transmit an idiosyncratic rumor into a long-lasting, market-wide crisis. Our results also demonstrate the usefulness of illiquidity measures to alert market participants to impending market runs.
N00|Political And Economic Relations Of Ancient Greek Temples|Religion and belief concepts accompanied human in the adventure that they lived throughout history. The religion phenomenon within the culture, which was transferred to future generations by developing and accumulating, is quite important. Humankind built their first religious buildings in coordination with the need to shelter. These sanctuaries, which were generally defined as temples until the emergence of divine religions, were turned into central economic Powers with the compensations granted. Their economic powers and oracles activities they applied based on prophecy enabled their political effects to emerge at the same time together with religion. This system was seen to settle especially in Western Anatolia. In the background of struggles between Persian-Lydia and Persian-Greek, effects of temples on politics attract the attention. However, Ancient Greek temples never transformed into institutions above politics. Temples were rather purported as an advisory council.

The model is shown to be consistent with evidence for 19th century France and Spain."
N00|An investigation of early modern Quakers’ business ethics|During the late seventeenth century, when the Atlantic trade experienced unprecedented growth, Quakers emerged as the region’s most prominent trading community. Economic Historians credit the group and its business ethics with shaping the economic environment of early modern England and, consequently, its long term economic growth. This paper, however, argues that Friends’ business ethics were identical to those of their non-Quaker contemporaries. Using a wide range of both Quaker and non-Quaker sources, including sermons and merchant advice literature, this paper constitutes the first in-depth study of Quaker and non-Quaker business ethics. Having refuted the claim that the community’s commercial achievements reflect a unique blend of honesty, reliability, and swift payment of debts, the paper suggests an alternative explanation for Friends’ business success.
