N77|Economic and Political Factors in Infrastructure Investment: Evidence from Railroads and Roads in Africa 1960--2015|Transport investment has played an important role in the economic development of many countries. Starting from a low base, African countries have recently initiated several massive transportation infrastructure projects. However, surprisingly little is known about the current levels, past evolution, and correlates of transportation infrastructure in Africa. In this paper, we introduce a new data set on the evolution of the stocks of railroads (1862-2015) and multiple types of roads (1960-2015) for 43 sub-Saharan African countries. First, we compare our estimates with those from other available data sets, such as the World Development Indicators of the World Bank. Second, we document the aggregate evolution of transportation investments over the past century in Africa. We confirm that railroads were a ``colonial'' transportation technology, whereas paved roads were a ``post-colonial'' technology. We also highlight how investment patterns have followed economic patterns. Third, we report conditional correlations between 5-year infrastructure growth and several geographic, economic and political factors during the period 1960-2015. We find strong correlations between transportation investments and economic development as well as more political factors including pre-colonial centralization, ethnic fractionalization, European settlement, natural resource dependence, and democracy.
N77|Serving God and Mammon: The ‘Minerals-Railway Complex’ and its effects on colonial public finances in the British Cape Colony, 1810-1910|The resource curse literature underscores the fact that extractive economies face challenges in diversifying their economies. What is less explored are the public finance challenges encountered in these economies when the extractive industries are completely privatized. Using a recently compiled dataset on public revenues, expenditures and debt, this paper explores the nexus between the privatized extractive sector operations and public finance policies of the Cape Colony between 1810 and 1910. The paper finds that despite the natural resource endowment, the Cape Colony became heavily indebted and had huge budget deficits by the time it joined the Union of South Africa in 1910. After the discovery of diamonds, competition for resource-rents caused a slowdown and in some instances reversed the progress made in consolidating state institutions. The drive towards a national program of development inherent in self-governing colonies was overpowered when the competition for resource-rents culminated in rent-seeking led by the interests in the monopolized extractive sector. Rather than being the main source of government revenues and a basis for inclusive economic progress, as expected in a selfgoverning settler colony, diamonds became a trap through the operations of what I call a ‘Minerals-Railway complex’. The insights from the study have important implications for our understanding of both settler colonialism in Sub-Sahara Africa as well as the management of natural resources in developing economies.
N77|The impact of Brexit on Francophone Africa|Whereas the impact of Brexit on Anglophone Africa was a major issue in the controversial British discussions on the pros and cons of Brexit, possible repercussions on French-speaking Africa have been rarely mentioned up to now. If at all, mostly indirect general effects were declared, both concerning the former British Empire in Africa and a fortifori for the former French colonies as well. Yet, the range of possible Brexit effect is impressive. It spreads from direct influence on farm-gate cocoa-prices in the CFA-currency regions and subsequent percussions on the state budget of these countries, over more indirect effects, e.g. on the cooperation between CEMAC, WAEMU and the EU concerning EDF-programs of which Great Britain has been a major contributor so far, as well as enforced re-negotiation of controversial EPAs, to the revival of progressive social networks in Francophone Africa. The latter are already demanding more political and economic sovereignty, for example with respect to the increasingly anachronistic F CFA currency. Yet, in view of the lack of countervailing power of Britain within the EU in the case of Brexit, the murky network of Françafrique could be re-vitalized and consolidated as well. Besides, there could develop also direct effects of the Brexit. For example, on coca-farmers in Francophone West Africa, because their product is traditionally traded in Pound Sterling. Thus, any fall in the value of the Pound Sterling against the Euro once Britain leaves the EU would have damaging consequences, not only for the producers but also for public finances, because cocoa is priced in Sterling and the CFA franc is linked to the Euro. This impacts also on the revival of the long-standing controversy on the ill-adapted and increasingly anachronistic F CFA. African activists already demand a genuine African debate and a referendum on these issues similar to the Brexit vote.
N77|Firm Performance Under Infrastructure Constraints: Evodence from Sub-sahara African Firms|The poor business environment mainly poor infrastructure is found to has paramount importance in explaining Africa's disadvantage relative to other similar countries. To cope with this poor supply of electricity, firms adopt different mechanisms to reduce the resulting effects. The commonly adopted coping strategy is an investment in self-generation of electricity. This study examined the role of investing in self-generation in mitigating the outage loss and evaluated the outage loss differential between �firms that invested in self-generation and those that did not, using World Bank Enterprise Survey data collected from �firms operating in 13 Sub-Saharan African countries. The result obtained shows that, though self-generation has reduced the amount of outage loss for fi�rms that invested in self-generation, these firms continue to face higher unmitigated outage loss compared to firms without such investment. In spite of this, �firms that invested in self-generation would have incurred 36%-99% more than the current amount of outage loss if they do not engaged in self-generation. Similarly, �firms that did not invest in self-generation would have reduced their outage loss by 2% - 24% if they had engaged in self-generation. The study thus, recommended a di�fferential supply interruption to be followed by public authorities based on �firms' degree of vulnerability to power interruptions.
N77|Sex and the Mission: The Conflicting Effects of Early Christian Investments on the HIV Epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa|This article investigates the long-term historical impact of missionary activity on the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. On the one hand, missionaries were the first to invest in modern medicine in a number of countries. On the other hand, the Christian influence on norms may have affected sexual beliefs and behaviors. We built a new geocoded dataset locating Protestant and Catholic missions in the early 20th century, as well as their health investments. We show that missionary presence has conflicting effects on HIV today. Regions close to historical mission stations exhibit higher HIV prevalence. This higher prevalence is robust to multiple specifications accounting for urbanization. Less knowledge about condom use is a likely channel. Moreover, among regions historically close to missionary settlements, proximity to a mission with a health investment is associated with lower HIV prevalence. Safer sexual behaviors around missions with health investments are a possible explanatory channel.
N77|The long-term impact of Italian colonial roads in the Horn of Africa, 1935-2000|Between 1935 and 1940 the Italians built an extensive road network to facilitate the occupation of Ethiopia and secure control over the Horn of Africa, but were expelled in 1941. This provides a unique case study to examine the long-run effect of cheap transport networks on the concentration of economic activity in developing countries. The results show that cells located next to Italian paved roads are significantly richer today and that the relationship is causal. Persistence is explained by a combination of direct and indirect mechanisms: colonial roads attracted economic activity through lower transport costs until 1960. After that date, the advantage of treated locations persisted only indirectly through increasing returns to scale.
N77|Power Outages, its Economic Cost and Firm Performance: Evidence from Ethiopia|Unreliable supply of electricity is the main constraints to doing business in Ethiopia. This paper examined how firms in Ethiopia respond to power outage employing the World Bank Enterprise Survey data. The result shows that, in response to power outages, firms in Ethiopia self-generate electricity. While there is no evidence suggesting outsourcing and improved energy hypothesis, power outages were found to affect the firms’ productivity negatively. From 2011 to 2015 firms’ cost of production rose by 15% due to power outage. This effect varies positively with output level suggesting that outage is costly particularly for large firms.
N77|Historical Legacies and African Development|"As Africa's role on the global stage is rising, so does the need to understand the shadow of history on the continent's economy and polity. We discuss recent works that shed light on Africa's colonial and precolonial legacies. The emerging corpus is remarkably interdisciplinary. Archives, ethnographic materials, georeferenced censuses, surveys, and satellite imagery are some of the sources often combined to test influential conjectures put forward in African historiography. Exploiting within-country variation and employing credible, albeit mostly local, identification techniques, this recent literature has uncovered strong evidence of historical continuity as well as instances of rupture in the evolution of the African economy. The exposition proceeds in reverse chronological order. Starting from the colonial period, which has been linked to almost all of Africa's post-independence maladies, we first review works that uncover the lasting legacies of colonial investments in infrastructure and human capital and quantify the role of various extractive institutions, such as indirect rule and oppression associated with concessionary agreements. Second, we discuss the long-lasting impact of the ""Scramble for Africa"" which led to ethnic partitioning and the creation of artificial modern states. Third, we cover studies on the multi-faceted legacy of the slave trades. Fourth, we analyze the contemporary role of various precolonial, ethnic-specific, institutional and social traits, such as political centralization. We conclude by offering some thoughts on what we view as open questions."
N77|Trump's tariff’s impact on Africa and the ambiguous role of African agency|"The international discussion of Trump's dispute over import tariffs for steel, aluminum and even cars are so far focused on the big global players. However, smaller African countries in particular suffer too from the planned punitive tariffs, similar to the famous African proverb, ""When elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers"". After years of talk on partnership for economic development (AGOA, Cotonou Agreement, EPAs, etc) Trump’s tariffs mean a severe blow to participatory foreign trade and sustainable industrialization in Africa. Egypt and South Africa for example, the potentially most affected African countries, face massive job losses and earning opportunities, with all the consequences that this entails for their already fragile economy and the population in dire poverty. Trump’s intervention thus joins the continued power politics of former colonial powers vis à vis Africa. Nevertheless, despite these asymmetric power relations, unfair trade relations and the desolate state of African infant industries are not necessarily due to externalities but often home-made. African agency plays an ambiguous role in enhancing participatory trade and indigenous industrialization."

N77|The Six Linkages Between Foreign Direct Investment, Domestic Investment, Exports, Imports, Labor Force And Economic Growth: New Empirical And Policy Analysis From Nigeria|The contribution of this study is to investigate the linkages between Foreign Direct Investment, Domestic Investment, Exports, Imports, Labor Force and Economic Growth in Nigeria by using the vector error correction model, for the period 1981 – 2015. The empirical results indicate that there is no relationship between the six variables in the long run. In the short run, imports cause economic growth and domestic investment; exports and FDI cause labor; and labor causes FDI. These findings present the critical situation of Nigeria, which requires an entry of urgent economic reforms.
N77|Britain & Africa: heading for the Brexit rocks|High-flying illusions on the part of the proponents and grim predictions of the sceptics characterize the controversy about Brexit. The article analyses five issues at stake for the Post-Brexit relationships between Britain, the EU and Africa with a focus on the Commonwealth Sub-Saharan Africa: market access, FDI, aid, security and partnership . The British government’s vision of a ‘Global Britain’ relies heavily on a reinforced co-operation with Commonwealth nations. However, most likely this would be possible only at the expense of the poor in Africa and elsewhere. Concerning security cooperation with Africa, London apparently exaggerated its defence input in order to enhance its bargaining position with the EU. It will be crucial for both the EU and UK to find post-Brexit agreements to stem irregular migration and the growth of jihadist groups and terrorism. In a nutshell, the analysis of these different policy field shows that expectations of Brexiteers and African politicians alike concerning an enhanced, partner-like Post-Brexit Commonwealth relationship are largely unfounded.

This negative impact is robust to multiple specifications accounting for urbanization, and we provide evidence that it is specific to STDs. Less knowledge about condom use is a likely channel. On the contrary, among regions historically close to missionary settlements, proximity to a mission with a health investment is associated with lower HIV prevalence nowadays. Safer sexual behaviors around these missions are a possible explanatory channel.
N77|Correlates of ICTS and employment in Sub-Saharan Africa|The potential for Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) to influence development have been widely documented, however the impact of ICTs on the employment prospects of those in SSA have been poorly recorded, with most studies focused on specific localised contexts. This paper models the impact of ICTs on the employment outcomes of individuals in 12 African countries, taking into account the varying nature of self-employment compared to other types of third party employment. The paper finds a correlation between mobile phone ownership, the intensity of mobile phone use, and employment in a selection of countries and contexts. Internet use in 2012 is largely unrelated to the employment outcome in these countries. The impact of ICT use differs by geolocation, sex and age. Older people, most likely with more established prior networks, are more likely to have ICTs impact their employment outcome. ICTs are more likely to influence the employment outcome of males, and those in urban areas.
N77|British capital and merchandise exports, 1870-1913: the bilateral case of New Zealand|The Ford thesis argued that there was a short-term causal relationship between British overseas investment and British merchandise exports in the late nineteenth century. However, economic historians since Ford have found little empirical evidence in support of this argument. Using data on bilateral British lending, this article finds that such a relationship did exist, with British ex ante lending preceding merchandise exports by 2 years. A case study of New Zealand, which had an extraordinarily high share of Britain in its imports, reveals that the relationship was conditional upon the lending being allocated to social overhead capital.
N77|The gun-slave hypothesis and the 18th century British slave trade|The Gun-Slave Hypothesis is the long-standing idea that European gunpowder technology played a key role in growing the transatlantic slave trade. I combine annual data from the Transatlantic Slave Trade Database and the Anglo–African Trade Statistics to estimate a Vector Error Correction Model of the 18th century British slave trade that captures four versions of the Gun-Slave Hypothesis: guns-for-slaves-in-exchange, guns-for-slaves-in-production, slaves-for-guns-derived and the gun-slave cycle. Three econometric results emerge. (1) Gunpowder imports and slave exports were co-integrated in a long-run equilibrium relationship. (2) Positive deviations from equilibrium gunpowder “produced” additional slave exports. This guns-for-slaves-in-production result survives 17 placebo tests that replace gunpowder with non-lethal commodities imports. It is also confirmed by an instrumental variables estimation that uses excess capacity in the British gunpowder industry as an instrument for gunpowder. (3) Additional slave exports attracted additional gunpowder imports for 2–3 more years. Together these dynamics formed a gun-slave cycle. Impulse-response functions generate large increases in slave export in response to increases in gunpowder imports. I use these results to explain the growth of slave exports along the Guinea Coast of Africa in the 18th century.
N77|Turkish and BRICS Engagement in Africa: Between humanitarian and economic interests|This paper studies the political economy of Turkey’s relations with Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) since 2002 while under the Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) rule. It argues that Turkey has focused its engagement in Africa mostly on humanitarian assistance and the economy. Contextualizing Turkey’s relations with SSA vis-à-vis other emerging market economies, especially the BRICS (Brazil/Russia/India/China/South Africa) bloc, provides ample insights into the nature of Turkey’s engagement in SSA. While Turkey’s involvement has some similarities to that of the BRICS, there are greater fundamental and structural differences from how the BRICS established their presence in SSA. These differences mostly find resonance in when we juxtapose the activism of non-governmental actors engaging in humanitarian missions and charity work with trade related economic investments and activism.

The article aims at summarizing the trade prospects of one such region – Sub-Saharan Africa, by analyzing the direction of international trade with the region. To achieve this firstly it analyses the trade flow dynamics for the 2003-2015 period, the share of Sub-Saharan Africa in Bulgarian international trade as well as its commodity structure. The main section of the article thoroughly discusses firstly the major trade products for the leading trade partners, then the dynamics of trade with these countries and finally analyses the significant cases of fluctuations. The conclusion summarizes the main findings which show the increasing importance of Sub-Saharan Africa for Bulgaria’s international trade relations and gives some recommendations on the possible policy measures to utilize the trade potential of the region.

N77|The Impact of Trade Liberalization in Africa|Africa is one of the most economic-integrated continents by a number of regional trade agreements in the continent. There are about 30 bilateral and multilateral trade agreements within the continents so that each African country is a member of at least one regional trade agreement. Trade between African countries, however, barely exceeds 10% of the total trade of Africa, which is much lower than other continents' intra-regional trade share. This discrepancy between many regional trade agreements and small intra-continent trade share tells that regional economic integrations in Africa are very unsuccessful trade liberalization policies to promote trade. This paper examines a reason why trade liberalization policies in Africa fail. In particular, we investigate the impact of trade agreements in Africa on trade conditional on financial market development and political instability. An empirical study finds that Africa countries' poor financial market accessibility and political instability are key barriers to trade integration in the region. These two factors can explain most disadvantage of African countries in their intra-regional trade. In a dynamic regression, the two factors depress the long-run growth of trade due to trade liberalization in the region significantly, while African continent dummy variable that captures other unobserved trade obstacles in the region has much less effect on trade compared to the literature on African regional economic integration.
N77|Trains, Trade, and Transaction Costs: How Does Domestic Trade by Rail Affect Market Prices of Malawi Agricultural Commodities?|We measure the impact of low-cost transport by rail in Malawi on the dispersion of agricultural commodity prices across markets by exploiting the quasi-experimental design of the nearly total collapse of domestic transport by rail in January 2003 due to the destruction of a railway bridge at Rivirivi, Balaka. Estimations are based on monthly market prices of four agricultural commodities (maize, groundnuts, rice, and beans) in 27 local markets for the period 1998–2006. Market pairs connected by rail when the railway line was operational are intervention observations. Railway transport services explain a 14 to 17 percent reduction in price dispersion across markets. Geographical reach of trade varies by crop, most likely related to storability and geographical spread of production. Perishability appears to increase impact, reflecting limited scope for arbitrage. Overall, impacts are remarkably similar in size across commodities.
N77|The Long-Term Effects of the Printing Press in Sub-Saharan Africa|This article investigates the long-term consequences of the printing press in the nineteenth century sub-Saharan Africa on social capital nowadays. Protestant missionaries were the first to import the printing press and to allow the indigenous population to use it. We build a new geocoded dataset locating Protestant missions in 1903. This dataset includes, for each mission station, the geographic location and its characteristics, as well as the printing-, educational-, and health-related investments undertaken by the mission. We show that, within regions close to missions, proximity to a printing press is associated with higher newspaper readership, trust, education, and political participation.
N77|Promoting Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in Africa: A Framework to Evaluate Employment Generation and Cost-effectiveness|The ongoing debate over the cost-effectiveness of renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE) deployment often hinges on the current cost of incumbent fossil-fuel technologies versus the long-term benefit of clean energy alternatives. This debate is often focused on mature or ‘industrialized’ economies and externalities such as job creation. In many ways, however, the situation in developing economies is at least as or even more interesting due to the generally faster current rate of economic growth and of infrastructure deployment. On the one hand, RE and EE could help decarbonize economies in developing countries, but on the other hand, higher upfront costs of RE and EE could hamper short-term growth. The methodology developed in this paper confirms the existence of this trade-off for some scenarios, yet at the same time provides considerable evidence about the positive impact of EE and RE from a job creation and employment perspective. By extending and adopting a methodology for Africa designed to calculate employment from electricity generation in the U.S., this study finds that energy savings and the conversion of the electricity supply mix to renewable energy generates employment compared to a reference scenario. It also concludes that the costs per additional job created tend to decrease with increasing levels of both EE adoption and RE shares.
N77|Economics of U.S. natural gas exports: Should regulators limit U.S. LNG exports?|This study assesses the level and destination of U.S. LNG exports, using a global natural market model under a wide range of EMF 31 scenarios. The scenarios reflect different U.S. natural gas resource outlooks, market conditions, changing U.S. environmental regulations, and possible changes in geopolitical conditions that affect the global natural gas demand and supply. U.S. LNG exports respond to market conditions under each scenario and are free from any artificial limits. In the near-term, U.S. LNG exports are uncompetitive in the Reference case and in the long-run U.S. LNG exports are significant when U.S. natural gas resources are plentiful. However under demand shocks (increase demand in Asia) or supply shocks (reduction in Russian supplies) or persistence of oil-indexed pricing cases, U.S. LNG exports become competitive to varying degrees. U.S. exports depend not only on U.S. economics but also on how U.S. prices change relative to price changes in other regions of the world. We conclude that limiting U.S. LNG exports is inconsistent with simulated uncertainties, and it should be left to the market to determine the levels and destination of exports.

N77|Radiography Of African Trade|In the last decades, trade performance of the African countries has seen significantimprovements. This is due, on the one hand, to enhanced bilateral trade with emerging economies,especially China, India and Brazil, whose “appetite” for resources was an important stimulus. On theother hand, it is the result of increased regional integration in the ”Dark Continent”, through theestablishment of the Tripartite Free Trade Area and the advanced talks on the creation of theContinental Free Trade Area. Nevertheless, according to trade in goods statistics by regions andcountries, Africa ranks last.This paper aims to give an analysis of the African countries’ commercial relations with therest of the world, based on UNCTAD statistics and literature provided by the IMF, WTO, OECD, andAfDB (African Development Bank).
N77|Current Trends in the Economic Development of the Participating in the Tripartite Free Trade Area Regional Economic Communities|The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the East African Community and the Southern Africa Development Community are three of the eight regional economic communities that are recognized by the African Union as building blocks of the African Economic Community. The three RECs recently concluded the negotiations to establish the Tripartite free trade area on a tariff-free, quota-free, exemption-free basis by simply combining their existing free trade areas. The multiplicity of trading arrangements in southern and eastern Africa, ranging from bilateral agreements between individual countries to free trade areas and customs unions, poses a huge implementation challenge to the deepening and development of the process of economic integration thus the creation of the Tripartite free trade area can be regarded as a step in the right direction. The paper aims at presenting the economic properties of the economies in the three RECs participating in the negotiations on the Tripartite FTA with a special focus on the analysis on intracommunity trade as an indicator for the current state-of-art and the perspective of the integration process in the three RECs. It presents the aims, principles and main challenges of the Tripartite FTA negotiations. Then it examines thoroughly the three participating RECs in terms of the economic properties of their member states and the trends in their international trade. Some conclusions are drawn on the integration potential of the participating RECs as well as on the possibilities presented by the creation of the Tripartite FTA.
N77|On the Dispensability of New Transportation Technologies : Evidence from Colonial Railroads in Nigeria|We examine Fogel’s influential hypothesis that new transportation technologies may be dispensable if pre-existing technologies are viable or can simply be improved. Exploiting the construction of colonial railroads in Nigeria, we find that the railway has large long-lasting impacts on individual and local development in the North, but virtually no impact in the South neither in the short run nor in the long run. This heterogeneous impact of the railway can be accounted for by the level of pre-railway access to ports of export. Consistent with Fogel’s argument, the railway did not transform areas that had viable transportation alternatives for exporting purposes. Using information on changes in shipping costs and quantities, we highlight the importance of opportunity costs to the adoption and impact of new transportation investments.
N77|Външнотърговски Отношения На България С Държавите От Субсахарска Африка: Нагласи На Българските Фирми<BR>[Bulgaria’s Trade Relations with Sub-Saharan Africa Countries: Bulgarian enterprises attitudes]|In recent years, Sub-Saharan Africa largely relegated from the priority areas of Bulgarian foreign policy. However, the importance of the region to Bulgaria is determined by its increasing role in both global economy and policy, as well as its immense economic potential and natural resources. The article presents briefly the current state of Bulgaria’s trade's relations with sub-Saharan Africa. Based on a representative survey of 1000 Bulgarian companies, the study analyzes the attitudes of Bulgarian business towards these relations, firstly presenting some general characteristics of the respondents, then analyzing the structure and attitudes of Bulgarian companies engaged or expressing interest in trade with Sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, the paper examines the opinion of Bulgarian enterprises on the reasons why Bulgaria has lost its influence and traditional trade partners in the region.
N77|L'agence sociale compte! - Des entrepreneurs migrants africains et chinois comme acteurs de changement<BR>[Social Agency matters! - African and Chinese migrant entrepreneurs as agents of change]|"English Abstract: [Social Agency matters! - African and Chinese entrepreneurs as agents of change] - The book reviewed, edited by Laurence Marfaing and Karsten Giese, documents a research project, on-going since six years, at the German Institute of Global and Area Studies (GIGA-Hamburg) which combines African and Sinologist perspectives. The publication in French, can be seen as advantage and disadvantage at the same time. Considering the lack of French edited publications on this subject and the deplorable language-divide between Anglophone and Francophone Africa, the chapters (some of them translated from English) are certainly most welcomed by French speaking African readers and scholars alike. Thus, they gain the unique possibility to become familiar with the results of painstaking studies by spearheading researchers in this field of study. Some of the contributions are revised papers, originally presented at a workshop at Dakar organised by the editors in January 2013 within the framework of the program Point Sud, an International Centre for Research on Local Knowledge in Bamako (Mali). The introduction by the editors, written jointly with their research collaborator, Alena Thiel, develops the Leitmotiv of the book. It aptly captures the essence of the research findings presented in its title: ""From rejecting the other to mutual involvement of both parties in the dynamics of social change"". In fact, the relations of Chinese and African petty traders and their mutual perception have changed fundamentally since the xenophobe manifestations against 'the Chinese' in several African towns as well as mutual incomprehension of both in Chinese towns (mostly in the urban districts Xiaobei and Sanyuanli of Guangzhou) where migrant African entrepreneurs arrived in the early 2000s. Many, if not most of them did not come to stay in the host country permanently, but they acted rather as sojourner, exploring the terrain in search of profitable trade, that is, Chinese imports of cheap consumer goods to Africa. Their mutual economic interest was based not so much on the general impact of political and economic globalisation but more specifically on the development of Chinese industrial production that facilitated Africans access to the desired Western products at an affordable price. Thus, these entrepreneurial migrants, who incorporated globalisation from below in their very transnational economic practices, became themselves carriers of social and economic transformations in their respective host countries. The realm of these transformations covered a remarkable range, from specific access strategies to resources and social mobility, changing consumer behaviour, new norms and practices up to modifications of taste and ways of life. French Abstract: [L'agence sociale compte! - Les entrepreneurs africains et chinois en tant qu'agents du changement] - Le livre revu, édité par Laurence Marfaing et Karsten Giese, documente un projet de recherche en cours depuis six ans à l'Institut allemand des études mondiales et régionales (GIGA-Hambourg). Les cultures africaines et chinoises sont analysé simultanément d'un point de vue africain et sinologique. La publication en français peut être considéré comme un avantage et un inconvénient en même temps. Considérant le manque de publications éditées en français sur ce sujet et le fossé linguistique déplorable entre l'Afrique anglophone et l'Afrique francophone, les chapitres (certains d'entre eux traduits de l'anglais) sont certainement les bienvenus parmi les lecteurs et chercheurs africains francophones. Ainsi, ils ont la possibilité unique de se familiariser avec les résultats d'études minutieuses des chercheurs specialisés dans ce domaine d'étude. Certaines des contributions sont des documents révisés, initialement présentés lors d'un atelier organisé à Dakar par les éditeurs en janvier 2013 dans le cadre du programme Point Sud, un Centre international de recherche sur les savoirs locaux à Bamako (Mali). L'introduction par les rédacteurs, écrite conjointement avec leur collaborateur de recherche, Alena Thiel, développe le Leitmotiv du livre. Il capture judicieusement l'essence des résultats de recherche présentés dans son titre: «De reject de l'autre à l'implication mutuelle des deux parties dans la dynamique du changement social». En fait, les relations des petits commerçants chinois et africains et leur perception mutuelle ont changé fondamentalement depuis les manifestations xénophobes contre les «Chinois» dans plusieurs villes africaines ainsi que l'incompréhension mutuelle des deux groupes dans les villes chinoises (principalement dans les districts urbains Xiaobei et Sanyuanli de Guangzhou) où les entrepreneurs africains migrants sont arrivés au début des années 2000. Beaucoup, sinon la plupart d'entre eux ne sont pas restés dans le pays d'accueil en permanence, mais ils ont plutôt agi en tant que agents, explorant le terrain à la recherche de commerce rentable, c'est-à-dire des importations chinoises de biens de consommation bon marché. Leur intérêt économique mutuel ne reposait pas tant sur l'impact général de la mondialisation politique et économique que sur le développement de la production industrielle chinoise qui facilitait l'accès des Africains aux produits occidentaux désirés à un prix abordable. Ainsi, ces migrants entrepreneurs, qui ont intégré la mondialisation d'en bas dans leurs pratiques économiques très transnationales, sont devenus eux-mêmes porteurs de transformations sociales et économiques dans leurs pays d'accueil respectifs. Le domaine de ces transformations couvrait une gamme remarquable allant des stratégies d'accès spécifiques aux ressources et à la mobilité sociale, en passant par le changement du comportement des consommateurs, de nouvelles normes et pratiques jusqu'aux modifications du goût et des modes de vie. German Abstract: [Gesellschaftliches Handeln zählt! - Afrikanische und chinesische Unternehmer als Motor des Wandels] - Das rezensierte Buch, herausgegeben von Laurence Marfaing und Karsten Giese, dokumentiert ein seit sechs Jahren laufendes Forschungsprojekt am German Institute of Global and Area Studies (GIGA-Hamburg), das afrikanische und afrikanische Kulturen simultan analysiert, sowohl aus afrikanischer als auch sinologischer Perspektive. Die Publikation in Französisch, kann sowohl als Vorteil, als auch als Nachteil zugleich gesehen werden. In Anbetracht des Mangels an französischen Publikationen zu diesem Thema und der beklagenswerten Kluft zwischen dem anglophonen und dem frankophonen Afrika, sind die Kapitel (von denen einige aus dem Englischen übersetzt wurden) sicherlich bei französischsprachigen afrikanischen Lesern und Wissenschaftlern sehr willkommen. Dadurch erhalten sie die einzigartige Möglichkeit, sich mit den Ergebnissen der fundierten Studien von führenden Forschern auf diesem Gebiet vertraut zu machen. Einige der Beiträge sind überarbeitete und aktualisierte Studien, die ursprünglich im Rahmen eines im Januar 2013 organisierten Workshops in Dakar im Rahmen des Programms Point Sud, einem internationalen Zentrum für lokale Wissensforschung in Bamako (Mali), vorgestellt wurden. Die Einführung des Buches, von den Herausgebern gemeinsam mit ihrer Forschungskollegin Alena Thiel geschrieben, entwickelt das Leitmotiv des Buches. Es fasst treffend die Essenz der Forschungsergebnisse zusammen, die in seinem Titel dargestellt sind: ""Von der Ablehnung des Anderen zur gegenseitigen Beteiligung beider Parteien an der Dynamik des sozialen Wandels"". In der Tat haben sich die Beziehungen zwischen chinesischen und afrikanischen Kleinhändlern und ihre gegenseitige Wahrnehmung seit den fremdenfeindlichen Kundgebungen gegen ""die Chinesen"" in mehreren afrikanischen sowie chinesischen Städten (hauptsächlich in den Stadtbezirken Xiaobei und Sanyuanli von Guangzhou), wo afrikanische Unternehmer zu Beginn der 2000er Jahre eintrafen, grundlegend verändert. Viele, wenn nicht die meisten von ihnen, blieben nicht dauerhaft im Gastland, sondern sie agierten eher als Reisende, die das Terrain auf der Suche nach profitablem Handel erkundeten, d.h. nach chinesischen Importen billiger Konsumgüter nach Afrika. Ihr beiderseitiges wirtschaftliches Interesse basierte nicht so sehr auf den allgemeinen Auswirkungen der politischen und wirtschaftlichen Globalisierung, sondern insbesondere auf der Entwicklung der chinesischen Industrieproduktion, die den Afrikanern den Zugang zu den (nachgebauten) gewünschten westlichen Produkten zu einem erschwinglichen Preis erleichterte. So wurden diese unternehmerischen Migranten, die die Globalisierung von unten in ihre transnationalen Wirtschaftspraktiken einbrachten, selbst Träger von sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Transformationen in ihren jeweiligen Gastländern. Die Bandbreite dieser Transformationen reichte von spezifischen Zugangsstrategien über Ressourcen und soziale Mobilität, wechselndes Konsumverhalten, neue Normen und Praktiken bis hin zu Geschmacks- und Lebensmodifikationen."
N77|Does New Zealand Economics Have a Useful Past? The Example of Trade Policy and Economic Development|We examine the history of economic thought on trade policy in New Zealand from the 1920s to the early 1980s. The focus is upon the different doctrinal perspectives taken by academic economists in New Zealand. Throughout the period under review policymakers supported an inward-looking trade and development regime buttressed by extensive interventionist trade policy. Appeals to the employment argument for industrialization through import substitution lent their policies a veneer of economic respectability. Most economists were not persuaded; they railed against quantitative import controls, discriminatory tariffs and cumbersome export incentive schemes and they offered, in vain, some constructive alternatives relying on price signals rather than administrative rules. One of our main findings is that most of the early work exposited here anticipated the rent seeking explanation for the configuration of trade policy.
N77|Intraregional trade as an indicator of the effect of integration processes – the case of African regional economic communities|The paper analyses the dynamics of trade flows and the trends in trade patterns of intraregional trade of African countries and regional economic communities. The study presents the main import and export destinations both in inter- and intraregional terms thus outlining the trends in African countries’ and Regional economic communities’ export and import for the period 2003-2012 and trying to draw some conclusions on the realization of potential benefits of integration.
N77|Dispersion and distortions in the trans-Atlantic slave trade|Market distortions can lead to resource misallocation, which can further lead to inefficiency. Throughout the history of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, qualitative evidence of various sources of distortion abounds. No study, however, has quantified the inefficiency in the slave trade due to these distortions. We use a structural approach to identify the dispersion of distortions in the slave trade from wedges in first order conditions. We then calculate the TFP gains had the dispersion of distortions disappeared. Two main results emerge. First, dispersion of distortions had the smallest damage to TFP in Great Britain, followed by Portugal, and then France. Second, dispersion of distortions in the product market had a bigger impact on TFP than that of the capital and labor markets.
N77|FDI, private investment and public investment in Nigeria: An unravelled dynamic relation|For decades, scholars have continually emphasized the importance of FDI in the less developed countries. Some believe that FDI can fill investment gaps, either private or public and mobilizes savings (Lee and Suruga, 2005; Todaro and Smith, 2003; Hayami, 2001). This study seeks to verify the interactions and transmission mechanism between FDI, private direct investment and public direct investment in Nigeria. Furthermore, these variables were examined to ascertain their direction of causality and whether or not they have long run linear relationship. Also, the impulse responses of these variables to shocks in the extraneous variables were verified; using the Multiple-Equation VAR models with time series data ranging from 1970-2012. The co-integration result indicates that there is no long run relationship between these variables. In addition, the variance decomposition result shows that 46 percent of innovations in FDI were explained by its own past values, while 21 percent of the innovations were due to shocks, to private domestic investment with 31 percent due to public investment. The response of public and private investment to shocks in FDI is positive and significant in the short run and so is consistent with the findings of Jansen (1995), Misun and Tomsik (2002). Efficient infrastructure in terms of public investment in basic infrastructure cannot be overemphasized amongst others.
N77|Развитие На Интеграционните Процеси В Африка – От Политически Към Икономически Цели<BR>[Developnemt of Integration Processes in Africa - from Political to Economic Goals]|The paper discusses the historic development and current trends in integration processes in Africa. Integration is seen as a means for ensuring competitiveness by better opportunities in international trade and as a factor supporting the resolution of the political and economic problems of the continent. Integration processes go through several stages of development, in which the focus gradually shifted from political to economic goals – the establishment of a functioning African Economic Community.
N77|Being Bad by Being Good: Owner and Captain Value-Added in the Slave Trade|We use slave voyage data from 18th century Great Britain and France to answer two questions: 1) How important was the managerial quality of owners and captains in slave trading? and 2) What explains the substantial variation in managerial quality? Utilizing the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, in which we observe the performance of owners and captains in each of their voyages, we follow the teacher evaluation literature to estimate the value-added of owners and captains to slave voyage output, i.e. the number of slaves arriving in the Americas. Several results emerge. First, if we replace all owners with the 90th percentile owner in the country, slave voyage output would be 15% and 25% higher than if we replaced all owners with the 10th percentile owner in Great Britain and in France. This 90/10 ratio is 1.27 for British captains. Second, owner value-added is negatively associated with family businesses and positively associated with the level of competition. A comparison of owner value-added before and after the unexpected outbreak of the Seven Years' War, which historians suggest decreased (increased) competition in the French (British) slave trade, suggests competition's effect on owner value-added might be causal.

Within the study the overall economic situation of regional economic communities in Africa is assessed by examining the dynamics, commodity and geographical structure of international trade displaying the trends in their trade and economic relations and the challenges to their development. Summarising the various forms of EU’s influence an assessment of the potential and real effects of the Economic partnership agreements on trade relations between the EU and African regions is made, as well as on the regional integration processes on the continent,. The trends in trade and economic relations between the EU and African EPA regions and the prospects for their development are outlined by exploring the dynamics, commodity and geographical structure of foreign trade relations. Based on a detailed analysis of foreign trade relations for the period 2003-2013 some recommendations are made on the possible priority actions in the field of trade and economic cooperation through which to rebuild relationships between Bulgaria and the countries in Africa.
N77|Trade openness-financial development nexus: Bounds testing approach and causality tests for Tunisia|This paper addresses the issue of causal relationships between trade openness and financial development in Tunisia over the period 1973-2013. We used the Autoregressive Distributed Lag method considering the ratio of Liquid liabilities, Private credit and Stock market capitalization as financial development indicators (all per cent of GDP). The sum of export and import as a percentage of GDP is the measurement of trade openness. Our estimates imply that the long and short-run relationships are different. At long run, trade openness is stimulated by liquid liabilities level while it is negatively affected by the level of private credit and the stock market capitalization. In contrast, the main short-run responses of financial development and openness to international trade are not significant. Moreover, the results reveal a bi-directional causality between private credit and trade openness but a direct unidirectional causality running from financial intermediariesâ€™ ability to mobilize funds, the size of stock market and trade openness in Tunisia. The policy implications of this study appeared clear. The overcoming of the institutional weaknesses and the establishment of transparent rules are likely to improve the efficiency of the banking sector and the stock market and so to strengthen the foreign trade in Tunisia.
N77|Editor’s Overview|The 29th issue of the International Productivity Monitor features six articles on the following topics: the role of productivity in long-term economic projections for the Canadian provinces and territories; productivity trends in the residential care sector in Canada; agricultural productivity in Australia, Canada and the United States; a mathematical reconciliation of gross output-based total factor productivity (TFP) growth with value added-based TFP growth; an empirical illustration with Australian industry data of the relationship between the two TFP measures; and a review article on the OECD report The Future of Productivity.
N77|On the Relationship between Gross Output-based TFP Growth and Value Added-based TFP Growth: An Illustration Using Data from Australian Industries|Diewert (2015) develops simple expressions for the exact relationship between value added TFP growth and gross output TFP growth. These expressions suggest that the magnification factor relating the two TFP growth measures is approximately equal to the share of primary inputs in total costs. We apply these simple approximations to data on Australian industries, finding that they tend to provide very close approximations over short time periods, but are less reliable over longer time horizons. We find that magnification factors vary significantly across industries so that the results of comparative studies can be quite sensitive to the choice of output measure chosen to construct TFP. In particular, industries in which intermediate inputs account for a large share of total inputs exhibit much smaller TFP growth (in absolute value) compared to industries where intermediate inputs are relatively unimportant when gross output is used to construct TFP measures rather than value added.
N77|Does trade cause long-run development? Theory and evidence from countries behind the Suez channel|Does trade improve institutions and contribute to long run growth? I develop a theory of trade, in which trade liberalization provides incentive to change institutions in two ways. On the one hand, trade leads to specialization according to comparative advantage, expanding the industries that do not rely on contracting institutions in less developed countries. The Heckscher-Ohlin-type effect lowers the demand for contract enforcement, as documented in earlier literature. On the other hand, if firms are imperfectly competitive, they have an interest in minimizing their marginal costs. As institutional frictions in the factor markets are costly, they raise output prices and cause losses of sales for imperfectly competitive firms. When the economy opens up, the sales-reducing effects of poor institutions are aggravated, because the effective market size increases. As a result, increased market acces through trade liberalization can increase the demand for contract. Thus, trade liberalization may also increase the demand for good institutions. That idea underlies much of the debates on globalization and 'aid for trade', and this is one of the first papers to provide an economic rationale. I exploit the 1967-1975 war-induced closing of the Suez channel as a quasi-natural experiment. The war between Israel and Egypt was not anticipated, let alone caused by countries on the Eastern coast of Africa. During the closing of the channel, countries in the east of Africa had substantially larger trade costs towards Europe than countries on the western coast, which led to significant declines in trade volume. When the Suez channel was closed, countries with increased trade costs specialized in industries that relied less on institutions (less fixed costs, less differentiated products, less contract-intensive inputs). The opening up of the Suez channel in 1975 caused the opposite effect. The trade cost shock is arguably exogenous and I use a dif-in-dif-in-dif (country - industry - trade cost) estimator to control for the effects of trade costs at the country and industry level. The increase in trade costs held exclusively for shipping, thus making access to information, capital or people a less likely explanation for the results. The results persist even though comparative advantage determines trade patterns - capital-intensive industries benefitted from increased trade costs to Europe. The results therefore suggest that trade liberalization does not deteriorate institutions in less developed countries.
N77|International Trade Geographic Structure of African Regional Economic Communities|African countries and their regional economic communities are trying to achieve integration through free trade, creation of customs unions and organization of common markets. International trade is a means for acquisition of fixed assets, equipment, materials and processed goods that are critical to economic growth. In this regard, African countries and the institutions of their integration entities must work to expand the volume of total trade, as well as the trade flows between each other, using the means of trade liberalization. The paper analyses the dynamics of trade flows and the trends in trade patterns of African countries and regional economic communities, with special focus on intra-regional and intra-continental trade. The study presents the main import and export destinations both in continental and global terms and makes an attempt to outline the trends of African countries’ and regional economic communities’ direction of international trade for the period 2003-2012.
N77|The Birth of a Democracy: Homegrown Bicameralism in Somaliland|Somaliland has recently developed an unexpected democracy after seceding from chaos-ridden Somalia, while turning its port of Berbera into a success story, competing successfully with the long established ones in the Horn of Africa. A simple game-theoretic model is used to explain why the home-grown bicameral democratic system that emerged in Somaliland is a key factor in controlling violence and providing the required security along the transport infrastructure linking Berbera to neighboring landlocked Ethiopia. The model shows that redistributing some of the fiscal resources levied on this trade is necessary for sustaining this efficient political equilibrium.
N77|Des rencontres dans la mondialisation : réseaux et apprentissages dans un salon de distribution de programmes de télévision en Afrique sub-saharienne|In this dissertation, we analyze the social construction of a market of TV programs in Sub-Saharan Africa. Based on the study of a trade fair where buyers (TV channels, distribution intermediaries) and sellers of TV programs (studios, distributors and independent producers) can meet, negotiate, discuss, and close deals, we try to understand how this event participates in the transformation of the ways in which TV programs were “exchanged” in Africa and in the integration of the African TV programs market into the global one. TV programs distribution at the global level has long been considered to be a market. But until recently in Sub-Saharan Africa, TV channels used to acquire programs “for free” through diverse ways. Political, economic and technical evolutions have slowly transformed this sector into a market. The trade fair under examination in this research plays a central role in this evolution because it is the first to bring together the microcosm of this industry. We studied this event for three years and ran three surveys in order to collect social network data and analyze informal information exchange networks between attendees of the events. We study how trade fairs attendees learn from each other and define, select and share market values, norms and rules.
N77|The History of African Integration â€“ A Gradual Shift from Political to Economic Goals|The process of political integration in Africa is progressing slowly, even though it was a priority stated by the African leaders ever since the early days of independence in the mid-20th century. In the field of economic integration, which has a much shorter history, the achievements, albeit insufficient compared to the stated objectives, are significantly more. The paper discusses the historic development of the ideas of regional integration in Africa and their implementation, presenting the defined by the author five phases in the integration process. Special attention is paid on the multi-layer approach towards economic integration adopted for the creation of the African economic community.

N77|Регионална Икономическа Интеграция В Африка (Дисертация)<BR>[Regional Economic Integration in Africa (Ph.D. Thesis, full text)]|The dissertation is dedicated to specific processes of regional economic integration in Africa. The main goal is to assess systematically the development and potential of regional economic communities in Africa through: - systematization of factors that influence the motivation of developing countries to participate in integration, as well as its specific impact on them; - laying out the possibilities and challenges in the processes of regional economic integration in Africa through an analysis of the direction and structure of international trade of African countries and regional blocks; - assessing the different channels of impact of the EU on the integration processes in Africa. The Introduction sets out the importance of the topic and the goal of the paper and outlines the structure, methodology and the limitations of the research. The first chapter discusses the definition and typology of economic integration, traditional and new theories on its effects (static and dynamic analysis) while the main focus is on the determinants of integration among developing countries. The second chapter presents the development of integration processes in Africa, the economy of regional economic communities, the structure and dynamics of their international trade as well as the results and challenges to their integration. The third chapter systemizes the different channels of impact of the EU on the integration processes in Africa paying special attention on the new framework of trade relations – the Economic partnership agreements. The Conclusion summarizes the general conclusions of the research answering the imposed research hypotheses: - first, that traditional and new integration theories with the drawn in them effects and benefits of integration processes are weakly or not at all applicable to developing countries and in particular to regional economic integration in Africa; - second, that the impact of the EU on regional economic integration in Africa is twofold – it has the potential to give impetus to its development but on the other hand it poses some challenges to the already complicated integration processes.

N77|A Note on Nonlinear Cointegration, Misspecification, and Bimodality| We derive the asymptotic distribution of the ordinary least squares estimator in a regression with cointegrated variables under misspecification and/or nonlinearity in the regressors. We show that, under some circumstances, the order of convergence of the estimator changes and the asymptotic distribution is non-standard. The t -statistic might also diverge. A simple case arises when the intercept is erroneously omitted from the estimated model or in nonlinear-in-variables models with endogenous regressors. In the latter case, a solution is to use an instrumental variable estimator. The core results in this paper also generalise to more complicated nonlinear models involving integrated time series.
N77|Market And Trade Related Determinants Of Economic Integration Among Developing Countries|Regional integration is often viewed as a way to support development and economic growth in developing countries through the related with it benefits to trade and welfare. There is a clear distinction between the integration processes among developed countries where mainly the classic static and dynamic effects described by classic and new integration theory are sought, and those among developing and least developed countries – where the reasoning, the expected benefits and the clear constrains to the participation in integration arrangements are different. The current paper tries to come up with a conclusion on what parts of classic and new integration are applicable to the integration arrangement among developing countries and tries to summarize these theories in three main groups – general economic, market-related and trade-related factors and effects.
N77|Immigrant Skill Selection and Utilization: A Comparative Analysis of Australia, Canada, and the United States|We compare literacy test scores and relative wage and employment outcomes of Australian, Canadian and U.S. immigrants using the 2003/2006 Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey (ALLS). We find substantially higher immigrant skill levels at the lower end of the distribution in Australia, especially among recent arrivals, but little difference across countries at the top. In addition, we identify substantially larger wage returns to immigrant skill in the U.S., which we argue reflects language-skill complementarities, as opposed to more efficient skill utilization or unobserved productivity characteristics. Our results suggest that the benefit of a point system for the U.S. lies in its potential to limit unskilled immigration flows, rather than in raising skills at the top end of the distribution where the economic growth potential of immigration is likely greatest.
N77|Wirtschaftliche Partnerschaftsabkommen (EPAs) der EU mit Afrika: Dominanz der EU Exportinteressen statt Partnerschaft auf Augenhöhe|Angesichts des globalen Wettlaufs um Afrikas Ressourcen ist die EU darauf aus, Wirtschaftliche Partnerschaftsabkommen (EPAs) mit afrikanischen Staaten bis Oktober 2014 abzuschließen. Diese EPAs sind sollen nicht nur der Liberalisierung des Handels dienen, sondern auch die Wirtschaftsentwicklung in Afrika fördern und so eine win-win Situation in einer Partnerschaft auf Augenhöhe schaffen. Viele Afrikaner verdächtigen die EU jedoch mit doppelter Zunge zu reden und egoistisch eigene Exportinteressen zu Lasten eines inklusiven Wachstums in afrikanischen Ländern zu verfolgen. Die vorgeschlagenen EPAs der ECOWAS dienen als Beispiel um zu zeigen, dass die Spannungen zwischen afrikanischen Ländern und der EU im Wesentlichen auf der Diskrepanz zwischen dem Diskurs und der Praxis der EU Außenhandels- und Entwicklungshilfepolitik beruhen, ebenso wie auf versteckten Interessen der EU-Direktorate und Mitgliederstaaten. Die wachsende Bereitschaft afrikanischer Staaten, die EU-Außenhandelsinteressen in Frage zu stellen wird effektiv unterstützt durch nachhaltige pro-aktive Agitation von NRO und zivilgesellschaftlichen Gruppen innerhalb und außerhalb Afrikas.

N77|The Economic Costs of Unsupplied Electricity: Evidence from Backup Generation among African Firms|Public electricity provision in Africa has been marred by under investment and frequent power outages.One of the strategies often adopted by firms to cope with this poor public supply is investment in backup generation. This strategy is not without cost however. Extant literatures on outage cost estimation have shown that firms possessing certain characteristics have a higher tendency to invest in backup generation. What is less known, however, is whether those firms suffer lesser or higher unmitigated outage losses (costs). Using cross-sectional data from 6854 firms currently operating in 12 African countries, this study investigated the extent to which firmsâ€™ characteristics might create incentives for auto-generation and whether these incentives lead to lesser unmitigated outage costs.We used three different methods including marginal cost, incomplete backup and subjective evaluation techniques. The results reveal that large firms, firms engaging in exports, and those using the Internet for their operationstill suffer higher unmitigated outage costs despite having a higher propensity of investing in backup generation. The results further reveal that unmitigated costs still account for the larger proportion of the total outage costs despite high prevalence of backup ownership among the firms. This reflects the inefficiency in backup generation due to small backup capacity held by firms. Our estimates also indicate that ignoring firms'characteristics such as size and the nature of operation (e.g. export promotion, internet usage, etc.) may result in underestimation of outage losses. The analysis further suggests that firms can still benefit significantly even when the current subsidised tariffs are replaced by cost-reflective rates that ensure stable electricity supply. The net outage cost (having adjusted for a cost-reflective tariff) incurred by firms are large enough to expand their scope of operation and hire more workers, suggesting the macroeconomic effect <br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

Using cross-sectional data from 6854 firms currently operating in 12 African countries, this study investigated the extent to which firmsâ€™ characteristics might create incentives for auto-generation and whether these incentives lead to lesser unmitigated outage costs.We used three different methods including marginal cost, incomplete backup and subjective evaluation techniques. The results reveal that large firms, firms engaging in exports, and those using the Internet for their operationstill suffer higher unmitigated outage costs despite having a higher propensity of investing in backup generation. The results further reveal that unmitigated costs still account for the larger proportion of the total outage costs despite high prevalence of backup ownership among the firms. This reflects the inefficiency in backup generation due to small backup capacity held by firms. Our estimates also indicate that ignoring firms'characteristics such as size and the nature of operation (e.g. export promotion, internet usage, etc.) may result in underestimation of outage losses. The analysis further suggests that firms can still benefit significantly even when the current subsidised tariffs are replaced by cost-reflective rates that ensure stable electricity supply. The net outage cost (having adjusted for a cost-reflective tariff) incurred by firms are large enough to expand their scope of operation and hire more workers, suggesting the macroeconomic effect could be significant.
N77|Reinventing the Wheel: The Economic Benefits of Wheeled Transportation in Early British Colonial West Africa|One of the great puzzles of Sub-Saharan African economic history is that wheeled transportation was barely used prior to the colonial period. Instead, head porterage was the main method of transportation. The consensus among historians is that this was a rational adaption to the underlying conditions and factor endowments. In this paper we undertake the first systematic investigation of the relative costs of the different forms of wheeled transportation in Africa. We focus on calculating the social savings and social rate of return associated with the introduction of the railway into colonial British West Africa. We provide more speculative estimates of the social savings of other forms of wheeled transportation. We find that all forms of wheeled transportation were economically efficient in the sense that they increased national income, though the estimated social savings of railways were modest when compared to GDP. However, we also find that the social rate of return of railways was exceedingly high, with annual social returns being equivalent to the entire capital outlays in Nigeria, i.e., railways there had a social rate of return of around 100%. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, railways appear to have been a very good social investment in West Africa because they were cheap to build. We discuss some alternative hypotheses that may nevertheless account for why they were not adopted.
N77|Economic Partnership Agreements of the EU: Impact on Regional Integration in Africa|The development and dynamics of regional integration in Africa are severely influenced by the transformation of the trade relations between African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the EU, imposed by the Cotonou agreement. Economic relations now based on unilateral trade preferences provided by the EU are envisaged to be based on Economic partnership agreements (EPAs) that should regulate trade and cooperation establishing new trade regimes between the EU and ACP regions selected by clear criteria. They also promote regional integration efforts and impose measures to support developing partner regions. However a decade after the start of the negotiations for the EPAs in Africa, the impact on regional integration is still unclear. The EPA negotiations do not cover the existing regional economic communities (RECs) which complicates the already delicate situation of dispersed capacity. Although EPAs aim at the promotion of regional integration their immediate impact is even greater fragmentation of existing RECs. The report examines the principles, history, and current state of negotiations as well as the twofold effects of EPAs on regional integration efforts in Africa.

However, the ongoing debt crisis in the EU holed serious risks for the economic development of the continent. The paper focuses on the financial risks for the economies in Africa that are related to the sovereign debt crisis in the EU. Although such risks exist as well in the field of international trade – mainly due to the reduction of African countries export revenues, the specific risks that the paper discusses more thoroughly are directly related to financial flows – foreign direct investments, remittances, tax revenues, official development aid, credit costs, etc.

Nejprve podává historický exkurz do jejího vývoje po druhé světové válce a následně se zaměřuje na hlavní problematické okruhy, které způsobují pomalý postup integrace oproti jiným světovým regionům. Za hlavní problémové body jsou pokládány existence přílišného množství různých regionálních uskupení s překrývajícím se členstvím a podobnými cíli, slabá oddanost politických elit integračním projektům, důraz na mezivládní spolupráci a slabé nadnárodní instituce, přílišná konkurenčnost afrických ekonomik, stav makroekonomických politik a infrastruktury, velký podíl neoficiálního obchodu, přetrvávající netarifní bariéry a politická nestabilita. V poslední části se pak studie zabývá možným dalším vývojem africké integrace, mimo jiné i v souvislosti s aktuálními obchodními jednáními mezi EU a africkými státy.
N77|Wind energy in Egypt: Economic feasibility for Cairo|Motivated by the rise of the electricity tariffs applied on industrial customer and the frequent electricity cut offs recently experienced in Egypt, this paper assesses the economic feasibility of installing a stand alone wind energy technology by an industrial customer who seeks to reduce his dependency on the national grid. For this purpose, the wind energy potential at the wind regime of Cairo was chosen to be assessed using half an hour wind speed data for a full one-year period (2009). The Weibull parameters of the wind speed distribution function were estimated by employing the maximum likelihood approach. The estimation revealed that Cairo has poor wind resources. Despite the poor resources, the financial analysis has shown that under certain parameters the wind project can prove to be financially viable. Thus harnessing wind energy through stand alone systems can help in meeting the industries electric power needs.
N77|The Maghribi industrialists: contract enforcement in the Moroccan industry, 1956-82|Original oral history data shows that during the import-substituting industrialisation, state capitalist period delimited by the independence in 1956 and the structural adjustment program in 1982, Moroccan manufacturers were operating in an environment characterised by a high risk of contractual breach, and by long-term, face-to-face relationships with few trade partners. The judicial system was seldom used to enforce contracts, because it was dysfunctional, and would break up a valuable relationship. To avoid contractual problems, entrepreneurs were largely relying on their acquaintances: economic life was embedded in social life. Social capital was derived from the business network and social connections rather than from connections with the state, kin-based and ethno-geographic groups. Private enforcement does not work as the Maghribi traders suggest. It is a way of screening customers and suppliers based on on-demand, reciprocal exchange of imprecise information, rather than a way of inflicting collective punishment. Its efficiency depends on the structure of the business network and on the individual social capital that agents hold within this structure. The institutional environment deteriorated after the period, because an increased number of players disrupted the structure of the business network and decreased the efficiency of private enforcement.
N77|The rise of the patent department: a case study of Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company|The patent department of Westinghouse Electric Company was organised in 1888. When George Westinghouse invented and industrialized air brakes he applied for patents in his own name. Those patents were administered mainly by patent attorneys in Pittsburgh. After the formation of the Electric Company, in 1886, organisation of patent management progressed. For a while, the patents invented by engineers were assigned to George Westinghouse personally; however, almost all of the electrical patents were assigned to the company in 1888. Thus, the idea of corporate intellectual property was adopted. At the same time the patent department was formed in Pittsburgh. It was directed by Charles A. Terry, a patent attorney, who began administering patent applications internally. The internalisation of patent management was necessitated by the increase in the number of engineers and in their output. To support patent administration it was desirable for the company to conduct patent work by using in-house patent attorneys rather than external law firms. However, external attorneys continued to play decisive roles in acquisition, licensing and enforcement. On the other hand, the corporate intellectual property system within the Electric Company was somewhat limited by the paternalistic management style of George Westinghouse. Whereas the patent department was established in 1888, there was not a definite rule covering employee inventions until around 1910.

N77|Regional trade and economic networks in West Africa|To date, most of the literature on economic networks in West Africa has considered networks in a metaphorical way. The aim of this paper is to go one step further by showing how network analysis may be applied to the study of regional trade in West Africa. After a brief review of the literature, this exploratory paper investigates two main issues related to regional trade. We start by discussing how recent developments in regional trade in West Africa, brought on by urbanization, liberalization, and globalization, have contributed to challenging the social structure of traders. We then discuss the changes that have affected the spatiality of regional trade by looking at the influence of spatial location and geographic scale on traders? abilities to trade. In both cases, we argue that the value of social network analysis in exploring how traders have progressively adapted to social and spatial changes in economic activities has been greatly underestimated. Through the combination of social and spatial ties, we ultimately show that the structural position of economic actors can be used to reassess the centrality of places. By doing so, the relational approach developed in this paper invites scholarship to reconsider the geographic organization of West African societies.

N77|The national strategy of tourism development in Algeria: issues, opportunities and limitations|The tourism sector in Algeria is in a paradox situation; on one hand we notice a deficit in accommodation capacity, in marketing, a lack of know-how in hostelry and restaurant etc. On the other hand, we find an attractive image and a shining touristic potentials and capacities. This situation may explain the Algerian poor position in the list of the best targeted destinations for tourism in North Africa and more generally in the African continent. In both public and private sectors, the Algerian officials were slow to react to changes in tourism markets especially with the emergence of the Eastern Europe and transfers of technology. The involvement of professional bodies in the animation of this important economic niche is required to allow better coordination of actions at regional and local levels. Algeria, ill-placed in this particular area, has no choice. But it is opting for an effective partnership in order to rationally exploit its potential in tourism by adopting a new strategy. But the questions asked are: Are we ready to compete for our share of tourist migrations? Is Algeria really prepared and ready to work on sustainable tourism?

N77|The significance of the Cape trade route to economic activity in the Cape Colony: a medium-term business cycle analysis|Trade is a critical component of economic growth in newly settled societies. This article tests the impact of ship traffic on the Cape economy using a time-series smoothing technique borrowed from the business cycle literature and employing an econometric procedure to test for long-run relationships. The results suggest a strong systematic co-movement between wheat production and ship traffic, with less evidence for wine production and stock-herding activities. While ship traffic created demand for wheat exports, the size of the co-movement provides evidence that ship traffic also stimulated local demand through secondary and tertiary sector activities, supporting the hypothesis that ship traffic acted as a catalyst for growth in the Cape economy.
N77|Water and energy in South Africa – managing scarcity|In this paper we examine the nexus of water an energy scarcity in South Africa. The fresh water resources of the country are close to exhaustion (Business Day, 2009; Turton, 2008)⁠, yet safe drinking water is not yet universally available to all in the country – in spite of a government policy to provide water for basic needs, taken to be 25ℓ per person per day (Coovadia, Jewkes, Barron, Sanders, & McIntyre, 2009)⁠. A growing economy and a population now close to 50 million have also put considerable strain on the electricity supply and distribution system, including wide-spread residential power outages in the main economic centers and, since January 2008, mandatory cuts for industrial users (Patel, 2008)⁠. The paper provides an overview of the current system in South Africa for supplying and managing water and electricity – for residential, industrial and for agricultural use – with a special emphasis on the energy requirements for delivering water as well as the water required in generating electric power. Finally we consider the example of Australia, another country with severe water shortages and one with a comparable demand for electricity, and attempt to draw lessons for South Africa from Australia’s more market-driven approach to energy and water.
N77|What Are EU Trade Preferences Worth for Sub-Saharan Africa and Other Developing Countries?| This study shows that EU preferences to developing countries were fairly well utilised in 2001, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. For several sub-Saharan African countries, the value of EU tariff preferences, even without accounting for tariff rate quota rents, is worth a significant proportion of their world exports. For non-African Least Developed Countries, in contrast, we find that the EBA initiative was only half-utilised approximately, although it is the only preferential regime available to most of them. It is difficult to reach a firm conclusion since 2001 was the first year of enforcement of Everything But Arms (EBA), and figures for 2002 show utilisation is on the rise, but rules of origin appear to limit significantly the value of this scheme. This also likely explains why the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) scheme is significantly under-utilised in the manufacturing sector, even when the receiving country is not eligible to any other preferential regime.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract w<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N77|Evaluating Africa’s comparative advantage in travel service exports|This paper tests the hypothesis that African countries reveal a comparative advantage in travel service exports empirically. The UNCTAD 2007 Handbook of Statistics (2008) is used to calculate revealed comparative advantage for 186 countries over 10 tradable service sectors using three different measures of the Balassa index. The results indicate that many African countries reveal a strong comparative advantage in travel service exports. Particularly, a band of countries with a vertical axis from South Africa to Ethiopia and a band of countries with a horizontal axis in the Sahel reveal promising results. If African countries are to benefit from the growth in world service exports, researchers and policy makers should note the massive potential for African travel exports, especially in the smaller destinations. Policies – including regional initiatives – to promote sustained growth in travel service exports are therefore of critical importance.
N77|Re-inventing New Zealand: Institutions Output and Patents 1870-1939|New estimates of commodity output and patenting are used to explore New Zealandâ€™s transition from extensive to intensive growth. By investigating the cointegrating and causal relationships among the output of 25 industries we show that a small number of common trends shaped the contours of her economic development. In turn the leading industries were driven by knowledge growth as reflected in patents statistics. New Zealand's distinctive institutions and human capital fostered the knowledge which transformed the farming landscape, promoted wider land ownership, and created a production system which integrated farm and factory to promote intensive growth.
N77|Policy options of agricultural biotechnology R&D in Sub-Saharan Africa: key issues and aspects|This paper reviews the status of Agricultural Biotechnology in Sub-Saharan Africa. It addresses the potential economic benefits to Sub-Saharan Africa and the effect biotechnology policies may have on growth, production and poverty reduction. The extent to which agricultural biotechnology will compound or mitigate the constraints faced by smallholders/subsistence farmers is also discussed. The status of crop biotechnology research worldwide is reviewed and the influence of intellectual property rights (IPRs) and market concentration on the development and diffusion of biotechnology in Sub-Saharan Africa is analyzed. The paper also explores the potential of public-private partnerships and recommends policy measures and investments that could focus more biotechnology research on the problems of the poor and alleviate some of the concerns about the impacts of biotechnology.
N77|Explaining ship traffic fluctuations in the early Cape settlement: 1652–1793|The only reliable estimate of the number of ships that arrived in the Cape Colony was published by Beyers in 1929. Unfortunately, this data series has a number of restrictions. It only accounts for the number of ships arriving at the Cape during the period 1700–1793. It also does not distinguish between the types of ships used or compensate for the length of their stay. Using a new electronic data source detailing every ship that anchored in Table Bay during the existence of the Dutch East India Company, this paper provides new insights into the pattern of ship traffic fluctuations in the early Cape Colony. Historical evidence from this period supports the empirical results. While many gaps still remain, the new empirical evidence can be used in future research on this neglected period of South Africa’s economic history.

Une analyse cliométrique|Bien qu’une relation très étroite ait été établie entre le transport et la croissance dans de nombreuses approches théoriques, les mécanismes régissant les différentes causalités entre les deux sphères sont très peu étudiés de manière empirique. L’objet de cet article est, dès lors, de proposer une analyse cliométrique permettant d’étudier et de déterminer les différentes relations entre les variables du système de transport et la croissance économique et démographique, ici pour le cas de la Tunisie (1962-2005). Est-ce que les transports influencent la croissance économique ? Cette influence est-elle réciproque ? Si oui, existe-il un effet de « boucle rétroactive » entre les investissements dans le domaine de transport et la croissance économique et démographique ?
N77|Some policy proposals for future infrastructure investment in South Africa|The South African government has begun to ramp up economic infrastructure investment. This is an important policy shift and in line with the government’s aim of increasing economic growth to 6% and halving poverty by 2014. It follows that we are left with the question: What are the most important areas for infrastructure investment, both type and location? This paper provides a short review of the essential characteristics of infrastructure as well as a guide to the past and present features of South Africa’s infrastructure stock. Three main policy proposals are made: provide basic infrastructure to all, improve the quality of existing infrastructure, and provide transnational infrastructure. Since 1994, the government has increased the access to basic services of a large part of the population, although there is still room for improvement. However, a lack of institutional and managerial capacity at the local level seems to be a constraint on delivering basic infrastructure services. Furthermore, comparative analysis reveals that the country’s infrastructure quality lag those of other countries. However, politicians may prefer to provide new infrastructure rather than improving existing infrastructure, as it provides a wider support base. This could lead to significant inefficiencies, especially with the politically sensitive 2010 Soccer World Cup approaching. Regional integration is an important long-term requirement to ensure sustainable economic growth and prosperity for the countries of southern Africa. Currently, South Africa is poorly integrated into the rest of Africa. The current transnational institutions – SACU, SADC, NEPAD – do not have the institutional and financial capacity to provide such infrastructure. A strong emphasis on providing transnational infrastructure – specifically transport, energy and ICT infrastructure – is proposed.
N77|Corruption Et Sécurite Routière : Le Cas Des Transports Routiers D'Afrique Subsaharienne|Police corruption is widespread and may be important in explaining the high risk of road fatalities in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study examines the impact of this phenomenon on road safety in Sub-Saharan Africa. A theoretical model is presented where a representative carrier faces corruptible policemen responsible for the enforcement of safety standards. The analysis of this model shows that the effect of corruption on road safety is ambiguous. Using a multiplicatively separable technology of apprehension we find a set of conditions under which corruption may worsen road safety. Some of these conditions hold in Sub-Saharan African countries characterized by the inadequacy of resources and weak institutions. To reduce the economic costs of road accidents in Sub-Saharan Africa (1 %-2 % of the GNP) it is important to equip the police with rolling stock and materials such as radars and increase the probability of punishment, and the penalties for bribing and fines.
N77|Protectionist but globalised? Latin American custom duties and trade during the pre-1914 belle époque|While it is true that Latin American republics had no rival on maximising revenues from custom collection during the belle époque, this paper shows that Latin American countries were also generous importers, only behind the larger commercial countries of Western Europe in terms of imports per capita. Latin American citizens were much more linked to international trade than citizens of most regions of the world. Their relation to the world economy was tighter both via their imports and their exports relative to their population and income levels. This paper comes to show that there is no contradiction between the high custom collection by the Latin American republics and their high level of interaction with the global economy in the pre-1914 belle époque, although large country differences can be observed when descending from the regional to the national level.

N77|The Evolution of Enterprise Reform in Africa: From State-owned Enterprises to Private Participation in Infrastructure — and Back?|Many African state-owned enterprises (SOEs), particularly those in infrastructure, have a long history of poor performance. From the outset, SOE financial and economic performance generally failed to meet the expectations of their creators and funders. By the late 1970s, the situation was alarming, and by early 1980s, critical. The poor financial performance of SOEs became so burdensome to government budgets that it attracted the attention of the international financial institutions, or IFIs. In response, in the 1980s, the World Bank approved SOE reforms that could be summed up in the term “commercialization”. By the mid-1990s, however, the idea of making SOEs function efficiently and effectively under government management was largely abandoned by the IFIs and privatization and private participation in infrastructure, or PPI became the order of the day. Once more, however, the results were disappointing. PPI has not been as widely adopted as anticipated, nor has it generated the massive resources and changes hoped for, nor has it been widely accepted as beneficial by the African public. The findings of recent studies in Africa suggest that PPI should not be jettisoned, and that the more productive path is to recognize the limitations of the approach, and to work harder at creating the conditions needed to make it function effectively. This will entail, as many have recognized, an end to the view that public and private infrastructure provision is a dichotomy – a case of either-or, one or the other – and a better appreciation of the extent to which the performance of each is dependent on the competence of the other. In other words, for the private sector to perform well, public sector capacity must be enhanced. Moreover, proposed tactics of reform should fit more closely with the expectations and sentiments of the affected government, consumer base, and general population. This broader approach implies, probably, a reduction in the scope and, certainly, a reduction in the planned speed of operations. Improving infrastructure performance is a long-term matter.
N77|Privatization in Africa: What has happened? What is to be done?|Sub-Saharan African states urgently need expanded and more dynamic private sectors, more efficient and effective infrastructure/utility provision, and increased investment from both domestic and foreign sources. Privatization is one way to address these problems. But African states have generally been slow and reluctant privatizers; a good percentage of industrial/manufacturing and most infrastructure still remains in state hands. Given prevailing public hostility towards privatization, and widespread institutional weaknesses, such caution is defensible, but nonetheless very costly. The long-run and difficult solution is the creation and reinforcement of the institutions that underpin and guide proper market operations. In the interim, African governments and donors have little choice but to continue to experiment with the use of externally supplied substitutes for gaps in local regulatory and legal systems.
N77|The Relocation of the Market for Australian Wool, 1880-1939|Between the 1880s and 1930s the international wool auction market shifted decisively from Britain to Australia. A series of historical developments altered the efficiency criteria for the existing institutional arrangements, notably the growing international dominance of Australian wool production, the evolution of the small grazier, the geographical diversification of demand, and improved international transport and communications. Central to this market shift was the role of large pastoral agent firms based in Australia who employed their local knowledge, producer contacts, and trade specialisation to reduce costs. Australian graziers benefited from local market signals and quicker sale realisation. Overseas buyers increasingly came from outside Britain, and their contacts with Australia were aided by much improved long distance shipping and telegram communications.
N77|Union Success in Representation Elections: Why Does Unit Size Matter?|I establish four facts regarding the pattern of NLRB supervised representation election activity over the past 45 years: 1) the quantity of election activity has fallen sharply and discontinuously since the mid-70's after increasing between the mid-1950's and the mid-1970's; 2) union success in elections held has declined less sharply, though continuously, over the entire period; 3) it has always been the case that unions have been less likely to win NLRB-supervised representation elections in large units than in small units; and 4) the size-gap in union success-rates has widened substantially over the last forty years. I develop a simple optimizing model of the union decision to hold a representation election that can account for the first three facts. I provide a pair of competing explanations for the fourth fact: one based on differential behavior by employers of different sizes and one purely statistical. I then develop and estimate three empirical models of election outcomes using data on NLRB elections over the 1952-98 time period in order to determine whether the simple statistical model can account for the size pattern of union win rates over time. I conclude that systematic union-selection of targets for organization combined with the purely statistical factors can largely account for the observed patterns.

The same year, the Sydney Railway Company collapsed when the costs involved in constructing a railway line between Sydney's city center and outlying district of Parramatta escalated. In these circumstances, the select committess concluded that private enterprises could not succeed in ventures of this nature without government aid and it therefore recommended that 'these important works should be taken up by the Government'.
N77|Managerial Development in Retailing: The Department and the Chain Store, 1890-1940|"Alfred Chandler has advanced the notion that afetr the First World War successful diversifying concerns shifted from centralised (""U"" form) management structures to multi-divisional (""M"" form) product-based organisation. Precisely the opposite occured in the retail sector, where the rate of growth of department store turnover - a form of retailing based on the ""M"" form of organisation - slowed considerably form the second decade of this century and that of chain stores - as examplars of the ""U""form - expanded rapidly. Various factors contributed to this phenomenon. However, this paper argues that the distinctive forms of organisation of the two retailing concepts made a major contribution to the different experiences of the two forms of retailing in the interwar era."
