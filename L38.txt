L38|Battling Antibiotic Resistance: Can Machine Learning Improve Prescribing?|Antibiotic resistance constitutes a major health threat. Predicting bacterial causes of infections is key to reducing antibiotic misuse, a leading cause of antibiotic resistance. We combine administrative and microbiological laboratory data from Denmark to train a machine learning algorithm predicting bacterial causes of urinary tract infections. Based on predictions, we develop policies to improve prescribing in primary care, highlighting the relevance of physician expertise and time-variant patient distributions for policy implementation. The proposed policies delay prescriptions for some patients until test results are known and give them instantly to others. We find that machine learning can reduce antibiotic use by 7.42 percent without reducing the number of treated bacterial infections. As Denmark is one of the most conservative countries in terms of antibiotic use, targeting a 30 percent reduction in prescribing by 2020, this result is likely to be a lower bound of what can be achieved elsewhere.
L38|Assessment of the drafted German Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan|Germany is struggling to meet its 2020 greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and climate goals. Against this background, we analyze the current draft National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) that sets out how Germany aims to achieve its national and European climate goals by 2030. We introduce the current stage of the country’s climate policy and, by looking at the different emission reduction measures under discussion, examine why Germany will probably miss its CO2 emissions reduction goals. We conclude that, based on the climate package announced in September 2019, Germany will get closer to the achievement of its 2030 targets than was anticipated in the NECP draft; nevertheless, the new climate package leaves a significant gap between the new measures and the 2030 climate goals.
L38|Adecuación de tierras y el desarrollo de la agricultura colombiana: políticas e instituciones|La adecuación de tierras, en general, y el riego, en particular, desempeñan un papel muy importante en el crecimiento y el desarrollo de la agricultura. Por ejemplo, la irrigación impacta la mayor productividad de los cultivos, lo que repercute en un mayor nivel de ingresos de los agricultores y en la reducción de la pobreza rural. En Colombia, a pesar de que la política agropecuaria ha tenido como uno de sus principales instrumentos la adecuación de tierras, en la actualidad, la utilización del riego en las actividades agropecuarias se encuentra lejos de sus potenciales. Esto contrasta con los avances que en esta materia han tenido algunas naciones latinoamericanas (como Brasil, Chile, México y Perú). Dada la importancia que tienen la adecuación de tierras y el riego para el crecimiento y el desarrollo de la agricultura y el sector rural, así como el importante potencial de expansión que tiene el sector agropecuario del país, Fedesarrollo adelantó el presente estudio, cuyo objetivo es establecer la situación actual de la adecuación de tierras y el riego en Colombia y, con base en dicho análisis, proponer las medidas de política e institucionales necesarias para expandir el uso del riego en las actividades agropecuarias.

L38|Closing the Finance Gap by Nudging: Impact Assessment of Public Grants for Women Entrepreneurs|Several recent papers draw attention to a lack of rigorous research on public policies supporting women entrepreneurs' competitiveness. This paper evaluates the effect of small business development gender-specific matching grants using a quasi-experimental approach. The grants have a positive effect on firm survival, as well as positive effects on obtaining bank loans, turnover, value added, employment, and total factor productivity. Heterogeneous treatment effects show that the grants increase the chance of young women entrepreneurs' firm survival and are even more effective for firms owned by mature women. Cost-benefit analysis estimates an increase in value added, which outweighs scheme-induced costs by 80% in the short-run and 170% in the long run.
L38|Motivating Bureaucrats through Social Recognition: External Validity — A Tale of Two States|Bureaucratic performance is a crucial determinant of economic growth, but little real-world evidence exists on how to improve it, especially in resource-constrained settings. We conducted a field experiment of a social recognition intervention to improve record keeping in health facilities in two Nigerian states, replicating the intervention - implemented by a single organization - on bureaucrats performing identical tasks. Social recognition improved performance in one state but had no effect in the other, highlighting both the potential benefits and also the sometimes-limited generalizability of behavioral interventions. Furthermore, differences in facility-level observables did not explain cross-state differences in impacts, suggesting that it may often be difficult to predict external validity.
L38|The spending power of sub-national decision makers across five policy sectors|The paper develops new measures of spending power and performance across five key sectors of sub-national government service delivery –- education, long-term care, transport services, social housing and health care. The new indicators reveal unique insights about how responsibilities are assigned across levels of government, which enable the analysis of different arrangements on outcomes. Differences in characteristics across sectors and types of countries may have important consequences for intergovernmental fiscal relations.
L38|Enabling Civil Society: Select survey findings|Civil society and civil society organisations (CSOs) are important to development co-operation, both as implementing partners for members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), and as development actors in their own right. Agenda 2030 is clear on the necessity of mobilising CSOs to implement, and uphold accountability for, the Sustainable Development Goals. The Global Partnership for Effective Development Co operation has committed to ensuring effectiveness in relation to CSOs in development co-operation, inclusive of the provision of CSO enabling environments.Recognising that how DAC members work with CSOs is part of CSO enabling environments, in 2017 the OECD Development Co-operation Directorate (DCD) established a work stream on civil society to provide guidance on DAC member support for civil society and a strategy for engaging with civil society. Under the work stream, a study on how DAC members work with CSOs was launched to identify areas of DAC member support to and engagement with CSOs for which guidance is needed. This paper introduces a selection of key findings and recommendations from two 2018-2019 surveys complemented with DAC statistical data.The paper points to evidence of member effort to work with CSOs in ways that enable CSOs to maximise their contribution to development. However, evidence also shows that members need to continuously examine their practices to ensure coherence between objectives and the many advantages that CSOs are seen to bring to development, and the members’ means of support to and engagement with CSOs.
L38|The 2018 Indicators on the Governance of Sector Regulators - Part of the Product Market Regulation (PMR) Survey|Complementing the Product Market Regulation (PMR) survey, the Indicators on the Governance of Sector Regulators map the regulatory arrangements of 130 regulators across 38 countries and five network sectors: energy, e-communications, rail and air transport, and water. The indicators are structured along three components: independence, accountability and scope of action.For the 2018 update, the OECD Secretariat and delegates of the Network of Economic Regulators (NER) revised the structure and content of the survey based on new best practice principles, guidance documents and the growing body of work of the NER on the performance of regulators.The analysis shows that, while the governance arrangements of regulators vary considerably across countries and sectors, some key trends and correlations can be observed. These insights can support countries and regulators wishing to benchmark their governance practices and reform their governance arrangements.
L38|ASEAN Economic Development: Impacts and Adaptation for Thai Local Administrative Organizations|Economic development is influenced by domestic development and international obligations. Local administrative organizations may have to bear the effects of various aspects of economic development. Current fundamental problems concerning the role, power and duties of the Local administrative organizations result from the separation of governance to the central, the regional, and the local administrative organizations. Local administrative organizations are again divided into provincial administrative organizations, municipalities, and sub-district administrative organizations. The fundamental issues concerning Thai governance, especially in any specific province, is the separation of roles, powers, duties, budget, and personnel of organizations in a manner in which they are dispersed through the various governmental offices at the department level based on their missions and duties. Concurrently, the administration at local levels has overlapping jurisdiction between provincial administrative organizations and the municipality, and sub-district administrative organizations. The nature of these problematic issues is one that currently exists; however, another dimension is the state of global transformation which poses an additional challenge for the role, power, and duties of Local administrative organizations. This study aims at examining the impacts and adaptation for Thai local administrative organizations resulting from the economic development of ASEAN. The study is separated into three parts: 1) Thailand and economic development in ASEAN; 2) the impact of the local administrative organization toward economic development and 3) analysis and recommendations for Thai local administrative organizations.
L38|An Unfortunate Effect of Rising Tuition Costs: Soaring Debt for Vulnerable Students|The cost of college tuition has increased by over 300% since 2000, far outpacing rising prices of virtually all other goods and services in the US, including healthcare. Unfortunately for nearly 70% of undergraduates in the US, their student loan debt has increased even faster, outpacing both rising auto and credit card debt. A student with an average loan debt of over $35,000 typically carries this debt for more than 2 decades, is less likely to save for retirement or buy a home, and with disastrous financial consequences fully 25% default on their student loans. Significant media attention has highlighted the magnitude and some of the consequences of rising student debt, yet we know little about the characteristics that make students vulnerable to accumulating so much debt. This study provides new information about the characteristics and circumstances of students at risk for high loan debt. We estimate a selection bias corrected regression using a sample of more than 13,500 graduates from large public university in the United States. We find that the decision to take out student loans and the amount of debt accrued differs across income, ethnicity, support networks and chosen major. Interestingly, our results show new information about a billion dollar publicly funded program in Florida, Florida Bright Futures Scholarship (FBF). We find that FBF plays a key role in reducing recipient?s debt burdens. Whereas previous research has shown the merit-based FBF scholarships benefit higher income households disproportionately, our results show it is the lower income households that benefit most from FBF in terms or reduced loan burdens at graduation.
L38|Partisanship and local fiscal policy : evidence from Brazilian cities|We study the role of political parties in shaping local fiscal policy in the context of Brazilian cities in the 2004-2016 period. Using a regression-discontinuity design, we find no effect of left-wing mayors on the size of the city government nor on the allocation of spending across main budget categories (current spending, investment and personnel). We do find a modest, significant and robust positive effect on the share of social expenditures. The (close) election of a left-wing mayor tends to raise the share of social expenditures by around 0.6 percentage points in our preferred RD specification. We then explore possible mechanisms which could bring about substantial fiscal policy convergence between political parties in Brazilian cities. We exploit oil-related revenue windfalls to explore the role of institutional constraints, and build an index of Tiebout competition to measure the role of the latter. We find support for the institutional constraints hypothesis in explaining the limited extent of spending allocation effects, and little support for the Tiebout-competition hypothesis.

L38|Hiring from a pool of workers|"We consider the hiring of public sector workers through legislated rules and exam-based rankings, as is done in many countries and institutions around the world. In them, workers take tests and are ranked based on scores in exams and other pre-determined criteria, and those who satisfy some eligibility criteria are made available for hiring in a ""pool of workers."" In each of an ex-ante unknown number of rounds, vacancies are announced and workers are then hired from that pool. We show that when the scores are the only criterion for selection, the procedure satisfies desired fairness and independence properties. We show, with the aid of details of procedures used in Brazil, France and Australia, that when compositional objectives are introduced, such as affirmative action policies, both the procedures used in the field and in the literature fail to satisfy those properties. We then present a new rule, which we show to be the unique rule that satisfies those properties. Finally, we show that if multiple institutions hire workers from a single pool, even minor consistency requirements are incompatible with compositional objectives."
L38|The Competitive Market Value of Copyright in Music: A Digital Gordian Knot (The Working Paper Version – v2)|Pricing copyrighted works or assets so that creators are competitively compensated has always been a difficult task given the information good character of such works. Doing it in the digital era is even more challenging. I consider Hertzian radio, satellite radio, and interactive music streaming services and I argue that annual competitive royalties in Hertzian radio should be increased from $100 million to $450 million. I further argue that this gap should not be filled by primary users alone but by a broader set of beneficiaries, including the general public and their government. La tarification des œuvres protégées par le droit d'auteur assurant aux créateurs une rémunération concurrentielle a toujours été une tâche difficile étant donné le caractère biens d’information de ces œuvres. Le faire à l'ère du numérique est encore plus difficile. Je considère la radio hertzienne, la radio par satellite, et les services de musique interactive et je prétends que les royautés dans la radio hertzienne devraient être augmentées de $100 à $450 million. Je prétends en outre que cet écart devrait être comblé non pas uniquement par les utilisateurs primaires, mais par un ensemble plus large de bénéficiaires, y compris le grand public et leur gouvernement.
L38|The Three-Legged Stool of Value of Copyrighted Music: Hertzian Radio, SiriusXM, and Spotify (The Working Paper Version – v2)|Pricing copyrighted works or assets has always been a difficult task given the information good character of such works. Doing it in the digital era is even more challenging. This paper proposes an approach to infer the competitive market value of copyrights in music from choices made by users namely the operators of Hertzian radio (HR), satellite radio (SiriusXM), and interactive music streaming services (Spotify). The inferred competitive values, which are obtained independently, fall in the same ballpark, although they need not be equal or even close as business models and cost structures differ significantly between those music delivery technologies. Nevertheless the estimated competitive market values of music copyrights clearly indicate that rightsholders are significantly shortchanged and poorly served by the current copyright pricing framework. Appendix A presents the data from which one can infer the value of music in HR. Appendix B presents an overview of the debate before the Copyright Board of Canada following the presentation of the model from which the value of music in HR can be inferred. La tarification des œuvres ou actifs protégées par le droit d'auteur a toujours été une tâche difficile étant donné le caractère ‘biens d’information’ de ces œuvres. Le faire à l'ère du numérique est encore plus difficile. Ce cahier propose d’inférer la valeur de marché à partir du comportement et des choix des utilisateurs, principalement les opérateurs de radio Hertzienne, de radio par satellite (SiriusXM) et de services de musique en ligne (Spotify). Les valeurs ainsi inférées séparément sont de niveaux comparables bien qu’il ne soit pas nécessaire qu’il en soit ainsi étant donné les différences importantes entre leurs modèles d’affaire et leurs structures de coûts. Les valeurs estimées montrent clairement que les ayants-droits sont significativement sous-compensés et donc mal servis par le système actuel de tarification des droits d’auteur. Deux appendices sur les données et le modèle utilisés pour inférer la valeur de la musique dans la radio commerciale au Canada complètent le cahier.
L38|Mercado eléctrico en Colombia: transición hacia una arquitectura descentralizada|El sector eléctrico de Colombia se transformó profunda y positivamente con la reforma de las Leyes 142 y 143 de 1994. La liberalización del mercado, la introducción de formación de precios competitiva en generación, la regulación por incentivos en transmisión y distribución, los avances institucionales en regulación (creación de la CREG) y en supervisión de las firmas reguladas (SSPD) sirvieron de inspiración internacional por lo menos durante cinco años. Con el tiempo se han acumulado problemas y han aparecido oportunidades de mejora del mercado. Hay que aumentar la competencia, diversificar el portafolio de generación, ayudar a monetizar los recursos locales embebidos en las redes de distribución y modernizar la arquitectura de mercado y la regulación. El trabajo consta de cinco capítulos, además de este resumen. El capítulo 1 presenta las características de la electricidad como bien económico y compara la evolución del mercado eléctrico del Reino Unido (la experiencia original) con el de Colombia. El capítulo 2 discute los problemas centrales del modelo colombiano. El capítulo 3 identifica oportunidades. El capítulo 4 compila las propuestas. El capítulo 5 concluye. Los mensajes centrales del trabajo son: • Los precios de generación son crecientes y la competencia es baja. • El portafolio de generación está alejado de la frontera eficiente de costos y riesgos. • El mecanismo de entrada (cargo por confiabilidad) es ineficaz para tecnologías que pueden reducir el riesgo de suministro y los costos de generación. • La arquitectura de mercado y la regulación están desactualizadas. • Las energías renovables, los recursos energéticos descentralizados y el impulso a la generación con gas licuado solucionarán problemas y crearán opciones.
L38|Mercado eléctrico en Colombia: Transición hacia una arquitectura descentralizada|El sector eléctrico de Colombia avanzó notablemente con la reforma de las Leyes 142 y 143 de 1994. Se introdujeron mecanismos de mercado en generación, se regularon las actividades de transmisión y distribución, y se llegó a la solvencia económica de las empresas sectoriales. Por lo menos durante cinco años, el mercado eléctrico sirvió de modelo para reformas internacionales. Con el paso del tiempo, los mercados y la regulación eléctrica han avanzado en Colombia con menos velocidad que en muchos otros países y se han acumulado problemas. Se debe aumentar la competencia en generación, se debe promover la configuración de un portafolio de generación más diversificado, se deben promover con mayor vigor las energías renovables no convencionales y preparar el camino para una arquitectura de mercado en que convivan el sistema de potencia centralizado y descentralizados, sin restricciones a la comercialización de excedentes de recursos distribuidos. El trabajo consta de cinco capítulos, además de este resumen. El capítulo 1 presenta las características de la electricidad como bien económico y compara la evolución del mercado eléctrico del Reino Unido (la experiencia original) con el de Colombia. El capítulo 2 discute los problemas centrales del modelo colombiano. El capítulo 3 identifica oportunidades. El capítulo 4 compila las propuestas. El capítulo 5 concluye. Las medidas específicas más importantes que surgen del presente trabajo son: (i) la introducción de un mercado de contratos estandarizados y anónimos, (ii) la introducción de planificación integrada de recur-sos, con un enfoque de portafolio, (iii) la construcción de una planta regasificadora en la Costa Pacífica, (iv) introducción de medidas habilitantes para la adopción de recursos energéticos descentralizados, que incluye la introducción de medidores inteligentes, precios nodales, entre otras; y (v) realización de pilotos con operadores de distribución y con agregadores de recursos descentralizados.
L38|Offrir des biens publics et des communs et revitaliser l’action publique dans le cadre d’un processus de « destruction créatrice »|"Recent developments in the economic analysis about public goods and commons, initiated notably in relation to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and to the work of Elinor Ostrom, have highlighted the social utility of their production to meet societal expectations of democracy and of sustainable development. The production of public and social economy organisations is in this perspective of crucial importance for the future, as is the outline of public policies that help develop coproduction or joint production of public goods and services. Thus, Public and Social and Solidarity Economy Partnerships (PSSEP) are the subject of analyzes in the CIRIEC book Providing public goods and commons. Towards coproduction and new forms of governance for a revival of public action that highlights: the importance of these partnerships within the framework of the current paradigm of public action; the induced behavioral transformations of the organizations; the scope that these new forms of partnership can have in terms of co-construction of public action and of responses to expectations on the territories; and the place of these partnerships in a process called here ""creative destruction of public action""."
L38|Quota de logements sociaux et coûts liés à la scolarisation des jeunes enfants|Nous évaluons les coûts liés à la satisfaction du quota SRU lorsque la construction de logements sociaux nécessite aussi la construction d’écoles maternelles et primaires sur le territoire communal pour y accueillir les jeunes enfants. Ces coûts sont évalués pour les 45 communes de Seine-et-Marne soumises à l’obligation de rattrapage en 2015. Nous trouvons qu’en moyenne, les coûts liés à la construction des écoles (foncier inclus) représentent 75 % de l’investissement à la charge des communes, les subventions aux logements sociaux comptant pour les 25 % restants. Pour certaines communes, les hausses d'impôts locaux nécessaires pour financer ces coûts sont non négligeables et peuvent atteindre jusqu'à 25 % tandis que pour d'autres, la contribution des nouveaux ménages du parc social à la taxe d'habitation (ou, de manière équivalente, le montant compensé par l'Etat au titre des dégrèvements) et les augmentations de la dotation globale de fonctionnement modèrent très fortement les hausses d’impôts locaux.

L38|The Emerging Civil Society-State Nexus in Putin’S Russia: A Case Study in Public Health|As of 2017, the main principles, values and goals of the Russian health care system are still under discussion, but the role of non-profit organisations in this sphere remains poorly defined and little understood, following the introduction of a controversial 2012 law restricting the role of foreign funding of Russian NGOs. We find that the evolution of civil society in Russia has given rise to a unique model of civil-state interaction, characterised as an uneasy union, in pursuit of scarce financial resources, between the most influential NGOs in the health sphere and the public authorities
L38|Firm Scope and Spillovers from New Product Innovation: Evidence from Medical Devices|When firms span related product categories, spillovers across categories become central to firm strategy and industrial policy, due to their potential to foreclose competition and affect innovation incentives. We exploit major new product innovations in one medical device category, and detailed sales data across related categories, to develop a causal research design for spillovers at the customer level. We find evidence of spillovers, primarily associated with complementarities in usage. These spillovers imply large benefits to multi- vs. single-category firms, accounting for nearly one quarter of sales in the complimentary category (equivalent to four percent of revenue in the focal category).
L38|Analysis of two public-private collaborative R & D support schemes|In 2005, two mechanisms were set up to support collaborative research and development (R & D) between companies and research organizations. One carried by the National Research Agency (ANR) subsidizes projects that are more oriented towards basic research. The other supported by the Interministerial Fund (FUI) supports R & D activities that are more applied. This study presents a first exploitation of a database concerning these two schemes over the 2007-2014 period. This analysis allows to describe the selected projects, to examine the determinant of the participation of companies, and to investigate the decision of the two organizations to finance or not a project. This work confirms that the ANR and FUI mechanisms pursued different objectives: on average, the projects supported by the ANR are smaller than those supported by the FUI, they involve relatively more public research organizations, and R & D spending per partner is almost three times lower. In addition, in line with the policy of the competitiveness clusters (‘‘Pôles de Compétitivité’’), the FUI program seems to have favored more projects involving partners of the same territory whereas the ANR has more financed distant collaborations and projects with partners located in Ile-de-France. However, the selection process decreases the difference between the two devices: the ANR selects rather large projects, while the FUI rather retains those granting more to research organizations. In addition, the two schemes are aimed at the same very specific population of companies: companies that are already innovative, that carry out more R & D than others, that are more frequently members of a competitiveness cluster, and that have a better knowledge of the public support system for innovation. This last point raises the question of the redundancy of the other devices supporting collaborative R & D created in 2010, which are addressed in principle to the same population of companies.
L38|The Role of Non-state Actors in the Integration of Refugees and Asylum Seekers|Significant variation across and within OECD countries reflects the diverse roles that non-state actors can play in the reception and integration of asylum seekers. This variation can be explained by the differences in the organisation of welfare service delivery, the various national schemes supporting employment and the specific legal frameworks allowing for the labour market access of asylum seekers, along with the inclination of local inhabitants to self-organise to face new challenges. Within the wide spectrum of non-state actors that provide assistance to refugees and asylum seekers, this paper focuses specifically on third sector organisations. Through a survey, it assesses the contribution of these organisations during the refugee crisis in Europe, from 2014 to 2016, in delivering reception and integration policies for refugees, protection holders and asylum seekers and in experimenting with innovative approaches. The paper concludes with a number of policy recommendations on the ways governments leverage the innovative capacity of third sector organisations in providing meaningful and effective initiatives to integrate refugees in the society, labour market and economy of host communities.
L38|Patient and impatient capital: time horizons as market boundaries|Since the 1980s privatisation and outsourcing have been promoted on grounds of efficiency and fiscal convenience. The argument here is that the appropriate choice between business and public enterprise is determined by the interaction between two time horizons, a financial time horizon and a project time horizon. The prevailing interest rate defines a credit time horizon. Among project appraisal methods, the payback period defines a unique temporal outer bound for private sector break-even. Net present value break-evens (and other forms of business credit) are always shorter. Any project which has a break-even longer than the payback period cannot be funded by business alone. Long-term projects encounter uncertainty and attempt to control it by means of rigid contracts, which also lead to inferior outcomes. This analysis accounts for historical patterns of enterprise. It also provides normative guidance. Public-private partnerships for infrastructure development intended to overcome credit time boundaries. They have given rise to inefficiency and corruption and are currently in decline. It is possible to overcome the temporal boundary with a â€˜franchiseâ€™ i.e. protection from uncertainty provided by social and government agencies. This allows longer credit break-evens, but at a cost in competitive efficiency. It is also prone to corruption. The time-horizon model undermines the standard argument for market superiority. It turns Hayek on his head: it is financial markets that require certainty, whereas social and public agencies manage in its absence.
L38|The Cost of Requiring Charities to Report Financial Information|Taxes and regulations, such as labor laws and reporting requirements, often exempt small firms, creating incentives to stay small or delay growth. Firms' responses to such size thresholds provide an opportunity to empirically assess consequences of regulations and firms' willingness to pay to avoid them. This paper provides a theoretical model for evaluating welfare effects of moving such thresholds. It then analyzes an income notch at which IRS reporting requirements for charitable organizations become more onerous. Standard bunching estimates imply that the average charity will reduce reported income by $750 to $1000 to avoid filing the more onerous information return. Panel data methods show that an even larger share of charities fail to appear when first required to report more information. There is some evidence of retiming of income to delay growing above the notch, but a long-run reduction in the share that grow above the notch provides evidence of real responses as well. Relatively low-expense and low-asset charities are most likely to reduce reported income to stay below the notch, while charities with past receipts above the notch do not manipulate income, suggesting the report imposes an adjustment cost on new filers.
L38|Price–quality competition in a mixed duopoly|We examine competition between a private and a public provider in markets for merit goods, such as education, healthcare, housing, recreation, or culture. The private firm provides a high‐price/high‐quality variety of the good and serves richer individuals, whereas the public firm provides a low‐price/low‐quality variety and serves poorer individuals. We first characterize the private competitor’s best response to changes in the public firm’s price and quality. This enables us to examine the distributional effects of policies that affect the price or quality of the public firm’s product. We then numerically characterize the public firm’s optimal provision policy, taking the private response into consideration. Our results have implications for the financing of publicly provided goods, and for whether additional resources, if available, should be spent on reducing the price or enhancing the quality of these goods.
L38|Reframing less conventional speech to disrupt conventions of ?compulsory fluency?: A conversation analysis approach|Our purpose is to illuminate compliances with, and resistances to, what we are calling ?compulsory fluency? which we define as conventions for what constitutes competent speech. We achieve our purpose through a study of day-to-day communication between a woman with less conventional speech and her support providing family members and friends. Drawing from McRuer?s (2006) compulsory ablebodiedness and Kafer?s (2013) compulsory able-mindedness, we use ?compulsory fluency? to refer to a form of articulation that is standardized and idealized and imposed on all speakers including those whose speech is less conventional. We see compulsory fluency as central to North American conceptions of personhood which are tied to individual ability to speak for one?s self (Brueggemann, 2005). In this paper, we trace some North American principles for linguistic competence to outline widely held ideals of receptive and expressive language use, namely, conventions for how language should be understood and expressed. Using critical disability studies (Goodley, 2013; McRuer, 2006) together with a feminist framework of relational autonomy (Nedelsky, 1989), our goal is to focus on experiences of people with less conventional speech and draw attention to power in communication as it flows in idiosyncratic and intersubjective fashion (Mackenzie & Stoljar, 2000; Westlund, 2009). In other words, we use a critical disability and feminist framing to call attention to less conventional forms of communication competence and, in this process, we challenge assumptions about what constitutes competent speech. As part of a larger qualitative study, we conduct a conversation analysis informed by Rapley and Antaki (1996) to examine day-to-day verbal, vocal and non-verbal communications of a young woman who self identifies as ?having autism? - pseudonym Addison - in interaction with her support-providing family members and friends. We illustrate a multitude of Addison?s compliances with, and resistances to, compulsory fluency to bring awareness to competence inherent in less conventional speech and we argue this illumination as a call for listening with greater care and more open expectations in efforts to understand, and participate in the expression of, meanings embedded in less conventional speech.

L38|Do economic regulatory agencies matter to private-sector involvement in water utilities in developing countries?|This paper suggests that, for developing countries, the creation of economic regulatory agencies, separate from the ministry in charge of water and sanitation, may not be a necessary or sufficient condition to stimulate large scale private involvement (PPPs) in the sector. The odds of an impact are higher for Latin American countries than other regions and for countries with higher income levels. They are also better when inflation is high. At the margin, the odds are unrelated to the contract type, except for greenfield projects, for which they may be contraindicated.
L38|Verfremdung der Genossenschaften im Nationalsozialismus: Gemeinnutzvorrang und Führerprinzip|[Schlussbemerkungen] Aus heutiger Sicht mag die Spanne überlieferter Einstellungen der Genossenschaften und ihrer Leiter zum nationalsozialistischen Umbruch nur schwer verständlich sein. Reichten doch die Verhaltensweisen von vorauseilender Zustimmung über passiv abwartende Duldung bis hin zu offener Ablehnung der NS-Herrschaft. Letztere trotz der sich recht bald abzeichnenden Gewissheit, dass der geballten Energie eines totalitären Systems nichts entgegenzusetzen sein würde. Der Wandel lässt sich in wenige Sätze fassen: Erstens wurde dem Genossenschaftsgedanken ein ganz neuer Sinn befohlen. Er wurde in eine größere Form gegossen, indem er eine Ausweitung von der Genossenschaft der Mit-glieder zur Genossenschaft der Gemeinschaft aller Volksgenossen erfuhr (Kroll 1940: 103), die auch, ja in erster Linie dem Gemeinnutz zu dienen hatte. Was darunter genau zu verstehen war, blieb im praktischen Wirtschaften für viele der unter staatliche Kontrolle geratenen Genossenschaftsleiter unbestimmt und musste insoweit als ein Schlagwort der nationalsozialistischen Propaganda empfunden werden, für dessen Umsetzung allerdings eine zweckdienliche Anleitung fehlte. Zweitens blieb im Zuge einer Neuausrichtung der Genossenschaftspolitik auf den Staat und seine Organisationen (z. B. Reichsnährstand, Deutsche Arbeitsfront, Wirtschafts- und Fachgruppen) die Selbstverwaltung auf der Strecke (Kroll 1940: 104). Auch die Handlungsfreiheit der Geschäftsführung von Genossenschaftsunternehmen war durch die Mitwirkung der von der Partei „Beauftragten“ und aufgrund der verlangten Berücksichtigung des öffentlichen Interesses bei Entscheidungen stark eingeengt. Das Ende des Führerstaats und das Ende des Weges Deutschlands mit Hitler ist bekannt und wurde uns besonders in „runden“ zeitlichen Abständen zu seiner Ernennung zum Reichskanzler, die eine Zäsur in der deutschen Geschichte markierte (Frei 2007: 7), von den Medien nachdrücklich vor Augen geführt: Untergang des Deutschen Reiches, ein Land in Trümmern und von den Siegermächten besetzt. Es folgte der Wiederaufbau, auch des Genossenschaftssektors - aber das ist nicht mehr Gegenstand unseres Themas.
L38|The Nature and Magnitude of the Effects of Asymmetric Regulation of Mobile Termination Rates on the Mexican Retail Prices|"In theory, network profits are independent of the reciprocal termination rates when operators charge nondiscriminatory call prices (Laffont, Rey and Tirole, 1998). Additionally, termination rates can be used to subsidize subscriber acquisition cost. This issue is typically known as a ""waterbed effect"", where a reduction (increase) in termination rates leads to corresponding increase (reduction) in subscription fees to consumers. We are using a practical case for testing the effects in the final prices for regulatory policy with several changes in mobile termination rates based on an asymmetric price access regulation. In our example, the termination rates have been part of a vertical restriction strategy. The observed network-base price discrimination implemented by the major network (Telcel) resulted in deadweight efficiencies lost and created barriers to new entrance and blocked growth for the small networks OECD (2012). Historically, profits margins and mobile prices comes down whenever regulator have reduced termination rates; following the income effects in subscription (Tangeras, 2014). Having in mind this fact, regulators would diminish termination rates in order to pushdown mobile prices and stimulate competition, rest on a cost-based asymmetric price regulation. The further research allows a statistical assessment of the asymmetric price regulation implemented by the Mexican regulatory authority during January 2013 to June 2017. This paper evaluates if asymmetric regulation brings a better impact in the Mexican consumer welfare, driving the retail prices of mobile services down, also the effectivity of this policy for the next years, taking in to account that there is not significant change in the market share among all mobile networks."
L38|Public Policy Targets in EU Broadband Markets: The Role of Technological Neutrality|The European Commission has recently sought to substantially revise how it regulates the telecommunication industry, with a key goal being to incentivise investment in high-speed broadband networks. Ambitious goals have been set regarding the availability and quality of broadband across the European Union, initially in the 'Digital Agenda for Europe' and more recently in its 'Gigabit strategy'. These goals reflect the view of many that there are widespread and significant socio-economic benefits associated with broadband. Our analysis explores the consequence of target setting at a European level, in terms of encouraging investment and picking which technology should be adopted within the context of technological neutrality. We demonstrate that while public policy targets favour specific technologies, especially when the target is defined with regards to fast broadband speeds, the technological choices that occur within a Member State are shaped by the complex and dynamic interaction between a series of path dependencies that may vary significantly across as well as within Member States. Furthermore, taking into account the ecosystem's tremendous evolution, the technological choices that are made within markets reflect both demand and supply uncertainties. To assist with understanding the interaction between those forces that shape, to lesser or greater extent, the choice of one technology over another, we propose a four-phase framework. This framework is not a definitive statement of the relationships that we have identified, but rather serves as a mechanism that illustrates the challenges associated with adopting and then sticking with technological neutrality in policy making.
L38|Der Einfluss sozioökonomischer Faktoren auf die Nutzung des digitalen Zugangs zu Finanzdienstleistungen: Risikopotenzial für eine informationelle Kluft in den Geschäftsgebieten der Sparkassen|Bisherige Studien haben den digitalen Zugang zu Finanzdienstleistungen untersucht und gut versorgte sowie unterversorgte Regionen in Deutschland identifiziert. Das Vorhandensein eines hinreichend guten digitalen Zugangs sagt aber nichts darüber aus, ob dieser auch genutzt wird, um damit Finanzdienstleistungen nachzufragen. Dieses Papier stellt die Kunden in den Mittelpunkt und untersucht, welche sozioökonomischen Faktoren Einfluss auf die Nutzung des digitalen Zugangs für die Nachfrage nach Finanzdienstleistungen haben. Als Ergebnis können auch jene Attribute benannt werden, die eine sogenannte informationelle Kluft befördern. Ein regionaler Vergleich ermöglicht schließlich eine Aussage dazu, in welchen Gebieten (hier Geschäftsgebiete der Sparkassen) Deutschlands die Gefahr einer informationellen Kluft besonders groß ist. Es zeigt sich, dass dieses Risiko in ländlichen, dünn besiedelten Gebieten, mit einem hohen Durchschnittsalter der Bevölkerung und in Regionen mit einem relativ geringen durchschnittlichen Ausbildungsgrad vergleichsweise hoch ist. Hier droht insofern ein besonders hohes Risiko, dass Menschen infolge der voranschreitenden Digitalisierung von Bankdienstleistungen abgehängt werden und den Zugang zu grundlegenden Finanzdienstleistungen als Basis gesellschaftlicher Teilhabe verlieren.
L38|Estado del arte sobre la corrupción en Colombia|En el Índice de Percepción de Corrupción elaborado por Transparencia Internacional para el año 2016, Colombia obtuvo una calificación de 37/100. ¿Cómo caracterizar el fenómeno de la corrupción en Colombia y qué estrategias académicas y de política pública se pueden adoptar para contrarrestarlo? Esta investigación sobre el “Estado del arte sobre la corrupción en Colombia” fue desarrollada por Dejusticia entre septiembre de 2016 y mayo de 2017, por solicitud de Fedesarrollo y con el apoyo financiero del Fondo Germán Botero de los Ríos de esa institución. Además de ofrecer un marco conceptual general sobre la corrupción, el estudio identifica las principales formas de corrupción en Colombia, así como las condiciones que favorecen y facilitan su reproducción. Con base en esto, preselecciona un conjunto de propuestas de política pública que traen los informes de recomendaciones que fueron producidos en Chile (2015) y en Perú (2016), y que a la luz del diagnóstico nacional podrían ser de aplicación en Colombia. Por último, sugiere un conjunto de líneas de investigación que deben ser abordadas en un futuro para entender mejor algunas problemáticas culturales, socio-normativos e institucionales que son propios del caso colombiano. Se incluye: Anexo V –Propuestas del Informe del Consejo Asesor Presidencial Contra los Conflictos de Interés, el Tráfico de Influencias, y la Corrupción de Chile que ya han sido aplicadas en la normatividad colombiana.

L38|Oligopoly Equilibrium with differentiated commodities: a computation of two models|In this paper, we define the concept of symmetric Cournot-Walras equilibrium (SCWE thereafter) in a pure exchange economy with differentiated commodities based on Julien and Tricou (2005). We compute this concept of equilibrium to two economies where the oligopolists offer their differentiated goods on the market in order to obtain the competitive good. We obtain three main results. First, we find that, under certain conditions, SCWE-DP allocations and price converge to Walrasian ones. Second, we also find that whether the SCWE-DP is Pareto-dominated or not by Walrasian equilibrium depends on the type of economic agent (oligopolist or competitive). Third, the two economies are linked.
L38|Do Private Water Utilities Operators Care about Regulatory Agencies in Developing Countries ?|This paper shows that the creation of an independent regulatory agency (IRA) is often not a necessary or sufficient condition to help countries attract private participation in the operation and financing of the water and sanitation sector of developing countries. The odds of an impact are, however, significantly higher for Latin American and Caribbean countries and to a lesser extent Eastern European countries, than for any other region. Higher income levels and higher prices are also correlated with a higher effectiveness of IRAs in attracting private sector financing. The analysis of the impact on the various types of PPP contracts shows that, at the margin, IRAs are irrelevant in general, to the contract choice, except for greenfield projects for which IRAs may be counterproductive at the margin.
L38|Does enhanced mobility of young people improve employment and housing outcomes? Evidence from a large and controlled experiment in France|For disadvantaged young people, access to a means of transportation, whether in the form of a personal vehicle or reliable public transportation, can play an important role in determining school-to-work transitions. In order to find a clean source of identification to assess the impact of reducing commuting costs for such individuals, we conducted a large and controlled experiment to study the impact of the intervention of subsidizing driving lessons in France by randomly assigning young candidates to one of two groups made up of treated and untreated individuals. We assessed the impact of improving their degree of mobility through this intervention on several outcomes, including drivers’ testing results, housing, and employment status. We found that young people are less mobile during their training period, and therefore less involved in actively seeking employment or improving on their current position. Once they have passed the driving test, however, these findings are reversed. Finally, we do not discern any significant impact on the important outcome of access to permanent jobs, but we do find a positive yet weak effect on access to temporary jobs.
L38|Is Occupational Licensing a Barrier to Interstate Migration?|Occupational licensure, one of the most significant labor market regulations in the United States, may restrict the interstate movement of workers. We analyze the interstate migration of 22 licensed occupations. Using an empirical strategy that controls for unobservable characteristics that drive long-distance moves, we find that the between-state migration rate for individuals in occupations with state-specific licensing exam requirements is 36 percent lower relative to members of other occupations. Members of licensed occupations with national licensing exams show no evidence of limited interstate migration. The size of this effect varies across occupations and appears to be tied to the state specificity of licensing requirements. We also provide evidence that the adoption of reciprocity agreements, which lower re-licensure costs, increases the interstate migration rate of lawyers. Based on our results, we estimate that the rise in occupational licensing can explain part of the documented decline in interstate migration and job transitions in the United States.
L38|Can Community Driven Care be integrated in the European Welfare System? Institutional Challenges and Historical Lessons|Parallel to the formal (health) care organizations in Europe, private or public, a number of community driven care projects have emerged. They may supplement the formal organizations by reducing costs or provide care to groups that for some reason do not have access to the formal sector. Drawing on Ostromian theory of commons, and on the previous theory and research on open software development (which share some of the characteristics of “open care”) we use cases of historical cases of community driven care to examine the prospects for such project to help remedy the cost crisis in the care sector. We explore under which institutional settings “open care” is likely to emerge and when open care projects have potential to scale. It is found that open care is more likely to emerge and prosper when they build on existing organizational structures; where the participants do not need to create new hierarchies or governance structures and where they share common values. The paper may serve policy makers aiming to design institutions or regulation, that facilitate, or at least not impede, the emergence of community based care.
L38|The European Railway Sectors: Understanding and Assessing Change|This paper aims at explaining and assessing the process of change that European railway sectors have experienced over the last decades. It has been organized in two parts: the first part (section 2) explains change and the second part (section 3) empirically assesses change. In the first part we argue that the roots of this change process date back to the 1950s when, because of competitiveness reasons, the market share of most European railways began to decrease compared to other transport modes. Since national reformers ascribed these performance shortcomings to the traditional organization of the railway sector which was that of vertically-integrated state- owned monopoly. Therefore, between the 1970s and 1980s many governments in Europe adopted reforms that tried to inject competition in national railway sectors by supporting liberalization policies. Then, since early-1990s the European Commission has released a number of regulatory instruments aimed at pursuing three main goals: 1) liberalization of the rail services; 2) unbundling of infrastructure and service level, and 3) creation of the common transport market. The empirical analysis conducted in the second part of this paper suggests that state-controlled structures still play a crucial role in the management and performance of national railway industries as lower service prices are associated with greater presence of the state in the sector. Results show that liberalization-friendly regulation does not necessarily benefit railway service consumers since increased levels of market access, unbundling and privatization are not necessarily associated with lower prices. Our analysis shows that the long-lasting transition from state-owned monopolies to competitive market arrangements in the railway sectors provided mitigated results. We conclude this paper by launching a reflection on the future developments of railways in Europe.
L38|Market Structure and State Involvement: Passenger Railways in Europe|Over the past 25 years railways in Europe have experienced substantial changes in terms of legislative measures to strengthen the competitiveness of the sector. This chapter will provide an overview of the different reform measures and the outcomes to date with particular emphasis on the issues linked to passenger transportation. In particular, the chapter will be structured as follows. Firstly, the background to the reform initiatives will be outlined. Secondly, the specific reform elements will be described. Thirdly, the implementation of the reform measures at country level will be examined in order to identify variation between EU Member States. Subsequently, the outcomes will be examined in terms of market structure, competition and state involvement as well as how the reforms have impacted the overall performance of the railway sector. Finally, the chapter will put forward future perspectives in terms of how the railways in Europe will develop over the coming years.
L38|The Economics of Scale-Up|Most randomized controlled trials (RCT) of social programs test interventions at modest scale. While the hope is that promising programs will be scaled up, we have few successful examples of this scale-up process in practice. Ideally we would like to know which programs will work at large scale before we invest the resources to take them to scale. But it would seem that the only way to tell whether a program works at scale is to test it at scale. Our goal in this paper is to propose a way out of this Catch-22. We first develop a simple model that helps clarify the type of scale-up challenge for which our method is most relevant. Most social programs rely on labor as a key input (teachers, nurses, social workers, etc.). We know people vary greatly in their skill at these jobs. So social programs, like firms, confront a search problem in the labor market that can lead to inelastically-supplied human capital. The result is that as programs scale, either average costs must increase if program quality is to be held constant, or else program quality will decline if average costs are held fixed. Our proposed method for reducing the costs of estimating program impacts at large scale combines the fact that hiring inherently involves ranking inputs with the most powerful element of the social science toolkit: randomization. We show that it is possible to operate a program at modest scale n but learn about the input supply curves facing the firm at much larger scale (S × n) by randomly sampling the inputs the provider would have hired if they operated at scale (S × n). We build a simple two-period model of social-program decision making and use a model of Bayesian learning to develop heuristics for when scale-up experiments of the sort we propose are likely to be particularly valuable. We also present a series of results to illustrate the method, including one application to a real-world tutoring program that highlights an interesting observation: The noisier the program provider’s prediction of input quality, the less pronounced is the scale-up problem.

L38|Responding to Refugee Crises in Developing Countries: What Can We Learn From Evaluations?|Displacement is at a historic high, with over 65 million individuals currently displaced. The world is facing a refugee crisis that is unprecedented in scale. A large number of evaluations look at different aspects of programming in response to refugee crises in developing countries. This paper covers the key areas and priority topics related to forced displacement identified by the Development Assisstance Committee Temporary Working Group on Refugees and Migration. It draws from evaluation findings to highlight key lessons and recommendations for positive change going forward.Key topics covered in the paper include: lessons on bridging the gap between humanitarian and development programming; efforts to strengthen international response to protracted crises; lessons on whole-of-government approaches in refugee contexts; learning from work in urban settings; improving access to employment and quality education; new financing mechanisms for refugee crises in middle income countries; and lessons on financing in response to the Syria crisis. The paper highlights the evaluation work of DAC members and aims to help strengthen the evidence base to improve response to situations of displacement in developing countries.

The case study looks at the approaches adopted in Ethiopia and Uganda to promote refugee self-reliance and enable refugees to work to earn income. It compares outcomes in the countries, with a specific focus on access to employment and business creation, including legal and socio-economic barriers. The case study draws from a number of evaluations of efforts by the international community to support Ethiopian and Ugandan initiatives. The case study was undertaken as part of a wider research project on learning from evaluations to improve responses to refugee crises in developing countries and supports the synthesis paper ""Responding to Refugee Crises in Developing Countries: What Can We Learn From Evaluations?"""

The case study also examines efforts by the international community to promote stability and state building objectives. The case study was undertaken as part of a wider research project on learning from evaluations to improve responses to situations of forced displacement and supports the synthesis paper ""Responding to Refugee Crises in Developing Countries: What Can We Learn From Evaluations?"""
L38|Public Private Competition|"We examine competition between a private and a public provider in markets for ""merit goods"" such as education, healthcare, housing, recreation, or culture. The private firm provides a high-price/high-quality variety of the good and serves richer individuals, while the public firm provides a low-price/low-quality variety and serves poorer individuals. We derive the private competitor's best response to changes in the public firm's price and quality level. This enables us to examine the distributional effects of government policies aimed at making publicly provided goods more affordable or increase their quality, and of changes to the government budget constraint that make publicly provided goods more expensive or decrease their quality. Our results have implications for the financing of the public supply of such goods, and for whether additional resources, if available, should be spent on reducing the price or enhancing the quality of publicly provided goods."
L38|Policy Review on Employment of Disabled Persons|Our attitude toward persons with disabilities has changed over time. From considering them as being inferior, disgrace, unfit and so much more, we have come a long way to acknowledging their contributions as productive members of the society. They were once considered as outcasts to a point where we reject them as members of the society. As we grow as human beings, we have learned to embrace diversity, we have come to accept the reality, and we keep on making ways in order to create an environment equal and accessible to all. Instead of removing, contesting or stigmatizing, we acknowledged the existence of persons with disabilities and the limitations of this group in terms of participation in all sectors of our society. Laws were created in order to preserve and maintain equality amongst members of the society. Special interests were given on issues concerning people with disabilities. In the context of human resource and management, a huge amount of progress can be observed in terms of employment of persons with disabilities. The goal of this paper is to examine the policy on human resource management in relations to persons with disabilities. The focus will be on the issues regarding the inadequacy of the policies constructed concerning persons with disabilities specifically the blinds and deaf-mutes. Despite the overwhelming laws on promotion of equality and accessibility on employment with regards to persons with disability, there is still an observable inequality within the workplace and an obvious disparity between the disabled persons and those that are not. There are noticeable problems within these laws passed by the government. The laws are theoretically good; however, certain aspects of the laws or policies are inadequate in achieving their goals. There is a need to review the policies regarding employment of persons with disabilities and to reassess the competence of the unit implementing the policies.
L38|The Fiscal Effectiveness of the Provision of Investment Incentives|Foreign direct investments undoubtedly have a significant impact on the national economy. They contribute to economic growth, to reducing the unemployment rate and they also positively affect other macroeconomic indicators. Foreign companies bring with them not only foreign capital that they invest in the host country, but also new technology, modern and more effective production and management methods, classic standards of business conduct, new jobs as well as opportunities for domestic suppliers.Host countries then attempt to attract foreign investors via active policies through investment incentives and various preferential conditions for investing. Investment incentives for foreign investors are thus among the important public spending programs. Basic investment incentives in countries with transitive economies within the European Union include income tax credits, respectively tax holidays, the transfer of land for a subsidized price, one-time financial support for the creation of new jobs and financial support for retraining employees. The provision of investment incentives means not only an increase on the expenditure side of the public budget or a decrease of the income side of the public budget (due to tax credits), but it usually leads ? as our research demonstrated ? to a start of the influx of revenue sources for public budgets, already in the short or medium term horizon. The aim of the research was to develop a methodology for measuring the fiscal effectiveness of provided investment incentives in the process of their implementation, to determine what the effects are on the income side of the national budget, and for this purpose construct an indicator of fiscal effectiveness whose functional and explanatory power would need to be tested in practice among the recipients of investment incentives.The fiscal effectiveness of investment incentives was constructed as the share of outputs (in the form of revenues from taxes, social and health insurance, fees, savings on the expenditure side of the budget) on a unit of inputs (income tax credit, financial support for a created job, subsidy to cover the costs of employee retraining, administrative costs of collecting taxes, subsidies on the technical equipment of an area on which production is to be located, subsidy on the price of land). With regard for business plans, fiscal effectiveness was assessed for a period of 5 years from the approval and receipt of the investment incentive in a set of industrial enterprises in the Czech Republic. The research also covered results that were attained in Slovakia.
L38|What to Buy When Forum Shopping? Analyzing Court Selection in Patent Litigation|This paper examines court selection by plaintiffs in patent litigation. We build a forum shopping model that provides a set of predictions regarding plaintiffs' court preferences, and the way these preferences depend on the market proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant. Then, using a rich dataset of patent litigation at German regional courts between 2003 and 2008, we estimate the determinants of court selection with alternative-specific conditional logit models. In line with our theoretical predictions, our empirical results show that plaintiffs prefer courts that have shorter proceedings, especially when they compete against the defendants they face. Further, we find negative effects of the plaintiff's, as well as the defendant's, distance to court on the plaintiff's court selection. Our empirical analysis also allows us to infer whether plaintiffs perceive a given court as more or less pro-patentee than another one.
L38|The development of a corporate governance assessment model for the Romanian public sector|Corporate governance is an essential component of business management, and has acquired a particularly important momentum in the private sector, in the context of the economic crisis and financial maneuvers which are questionable in terms of legality. The same imperative need to develop corporate governance is also identified in the public sector, given the large number of stakeholders and their heterogeneity, the need for accountability, efficiency, performance, transparency and sustainability. By using a qualitative research approach, a set of ideas on corporate governance was presented, as published in the specialized literature; also, a model was proposed for the assessment of corporate governance in the Romanian public sector. In the current context, the development of such a model complements the informational valences in the literature regarding the corporate governance, allows the identification of the deficiencies in the governance of Romanian public institutions, and creates the potential for the development and implementation of a governance code dedicated to the public sector.
L38|In Medio Stat Virtus: Does A Mixed Economy Increase Welfare?|Over the past few decades, social enterprises have grown remarkably. This paper investigates how social enterprises affect access to social services (e.g., education and health-care) and utilitarian welfare. To this end, two economic systems are compared: a market economy system, where all firms are profit maximizers, and a mixed economy system, where both for-profit businesses and social enterprises are present. Findings show that individuals are more likely to have access to social services within mixed economy. Moreover, conditions are derived under which utilitarian welfare is larger within mixed economy. Public policies in support of social enterprises (e.g., subsidies) are shown to result in the following trade-off: access to social services is further enhanced but utilitarian welfare is more likely to be lower than that within market economy.
L38|Consumers’ Misevaluation and Public Promotion|I analyze markets in which consumers may misestimate the true value of goods and the government can affect the valuation through public promotion. When entry of firms is not allowed, the government makes consumers overvalue the goods to mitigate welfare loss from underproduction in an oligopolistic market, provided that the promotion cost is sufficiently low. On the contrary, in a free-entry market, no matter how low the promotion cost is, the government may make consumers undervalue them in order not to induce wasteful entries despite the remaining underproduction problem. In addition, my result in a free-entry market suggests that the main finding of Glaeser and Ujhelyi (J Public Econ 94: 247-257, 2010)crucially depends on the barriers to entry and the opposite result may be obtained under free entry.
L38|"""Now that you mention it"": A Survey Experiment on Information, Salience and Online Privacy"|Personal data lie at the forefront of different business models and constitute the main source of revenue of several online companies. In many cases, consumers have incomplete information about the digital transactions of their data. This paper investigates whether highlighting positive or negative aspects of online privacy, thereby mitigating the informational problem, can affect consumers’ privacy actions and attitudes. Results of two online survey experiments indicate that participants adopt a more conservative stance on disclosing identifiable information, such as name and email, even when they are informed about positive attitudes of companies towards their privacy. On the other hand, they do not change their attitudes and social actions towards privacy. These findings suggest that privacy concerns are dormant and may manifest when consumers are asked to think about privacy; and that privacy behavior is not necessarily sensitive to exposure to objective threats or benefits of disclosing personal information.
L38|What’s happening to our universities?| In recent decades, many universities have been moving in the direction of a more hierarchical and centralised structure, with top-down planning and reduced local autonomy for departments. Yet, the management literature over this period has stressed the numerous benefits of flatter organisational structures, decentralisation and local autonomy for sections or departments. What might explain this paradox? And why have academics remained strangely quiet about this, meekly accepting their fate? This proposition paper critically examines the dangers of centralised top-down management, increasingly bureaucratic procedures, teaching to a prescribed formula, and research driven by assessment and performance targets, illustrating these with a number of specific examples. It discusses a number of possible forces driving these worrying developments, and concludes by asking whether academics may be in danger of suffering the fate of the boiled frog.

L38|The Importance of School Systems: Evidence from International Differences in Student Achievement|Students in some countries do far better on international achievement tests than students in other countries. Is this all due to differences in what students bring with them to school--socioeconomic background, cultural factors, and the like? Or do school systems make a difference? This essay argues that differences in features of countries' school systems, and in particular their institutional structures, account for a substantial part of the cross-country variation in student achievement. It first documents the size and cross-test consistency of international differences in student achievement. Next, it uses the framework of an education production function to provide descriptive analysis of the extent to which different factors of the school system, as well as factors beyond the school system, account for cross-country achievement differences. Finally, it covers research that goes beyond descriptive associations by addressing leading concerns of bias in cross-country analysis. The available evidence suggests that differences in expenditures and class size play a limited role in explaining cross-country achievement differences, but that differences in teacher quality and instruction time do matter. This suggests that what matters is not so much the amount of inputs that school systems are endowed with, but rather how they use them. Correspondingly, international differences in institutional structures of school systems such as external exams, school autonomy, private competition, and tracking have been found to be important sources of international differences in student achievement.
L38|Nearly-efficient tuitions and subsidies in American public higher education|A two-stage setting for determining subsidies and tuitions in a public university context is developed where fixed costs introduce an efficiency-enhancing role for taxpayer-financed appropriations. The optimal subsidy per enrollment is shown to be proportional to students’ maximum net willingness to pay. This result extends a well-known result associated with Ramsey pricing to include endogenous appropriations to public higher education. Realistic restrictions are imposed on the subsidy structure, and scenarios for determining tuitions are addressed and illustrated numerically, using budget data for the University of Iowa and the University of Michigan.
L38|Gasto público, crecimiento económico y bienestar social bajo el efecto moderador del ahorro externo: la experiencia Mexicana|The aim of this paper is to evaluate the public spending effects on economic growth and social welfare in Mexico by means of a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. It is used two alternative closure rules for foreign saving: 1) foreign saving is exogenous and restricted: saving determines investment, and 2) foreign saving is endogenous and unrestricted, investment determines saving. The results suggest that behavior of foreign saving (by two alternative closure rules) moderates the relationship between public spending and economic growth and social welfare with different effects (asymmetric) for various instruments of public spending. An increase in public spending –with unrestricted foreign saving--generates higher economic growth and greater social welfare, although fiscal balance and current account deficit become worse (postkeynesian approach). In absence of variations of foreign savings, government spending affects neither economic growth nor social welfare, only there is an imbalance fiscal stance (neoclassical stance).
L38|The Establishment of Social Entrepreneurship Movements as A Response to The Transformation of Governments’ Social Policies (The Case of Four EAEU Countries)|"""Objective – This article summarizes research into the social entrepreneurship movement based on databases which include respondents from the following countries: the Kyrgyz Republic, Republic of Belarus, Republic of Kazakhstan and Russian Federation. This article tries to relate the efficiency of social policy to social issues. Methodology/Technique – We selected 180 acting social enterprises and 36 from 4 post-soviet countries and conducted interviews and observations to create a database. Based on defined key criteria, different types of social actors were classified and grouped. Findings – The findings indicate that state funding for social services and social protection has fallen dramatically due to a sharp decline in GDP and in the residual shares of GDP allocated for social policy. Our analysis indicates that countries which experienced a transformation of government social policy have a greater variety of social actors. Through the database, we were able to define and classify 8 typical groups of social actors. Two of them - social activists and social reformers - can help a nation to create a new stable system for target social groups. Novelty – Originality of the findings of this article."""
L38|Care, Commons and Entrepreneurship|Health care costs has increased significantly during the last decades, and despite rapid development in medical practices, little has been achieved compared to other sectors when it comes to cost cutting innovations. The entrepreneurship that flourish in retail, technology and logistics seems to be virtually absent from the care sector. In this pa-per we explore the state of research on health economics, collaborative (“open source”) development and on entrepreneurship and it applications to the care sector. We show that both the concept of evasive entrepreneurship and the Ostromian “commons” are useful tools when looking for solutions to mitigate escalating cost in this sector.
L38|Beschäftigungseffekte von Ein-Euro-Jobs in den Einsatzbetrieben|"""This study examines the impact of One-Euro-Jobs on the employment development and staff structure in public, non-profit and private establishments. The data source is the IAB Establishment Panel 2005 to 2013, which is linked to regional indicators at district level (unemployment rate, share of One-Euro-Jobs in the total population, local debts per inhabitant, population density, regional density of public employment). We use linear and non-linear static panel models as well as dynamic panel methods. The results do not reveal an overall effect of One-Euro-Jobs on total employment. However, we identify a positive - complementary - effect on high skilled workers and a negative - substitutive - effect on low-skilled workers. Our interpretation is as follows: The implementation of measures like One-Euro-Jobs partly requires high skilled staff for management, instruction, qualification and support. The decline of One-Euro-Jobs during the past years led to a decreasing demand for these positions. In contrast, the substitutive relationship between One-Euro-Jobs and low-skilled workers indicates that the decrease of One-Euro-Jobs in recent years led to an increasing demand for low-skilled workers.""

L38|Catalog Of Cooperatives Units Its Formation In Quintana Roo, Mexico, Creacion Del Padron De Entidades Cooperativas Del Estado De Quintana Roo, Mexico|The organization of the current economy is represented by the model of modern enterprise that allows large volumes of production and profits for the owners, but deteriorating working conditions for people who only contribute their work. In this model, other forms of organization are trying to alternate and compete within the same market system, through free workers called an association. The most recognized practice in Mexico and Quintana Roo, are cooperatives which are the research object in this study. Despite being backed by an international movement, he left to encourage their training at national and State levels, reflected in aspects such as lack of information and activity log. So, the purpose is to present a database of cooperative units from the analysis of basic Information on National Statistical Directory of economic units 2015 and the Ministry of the Economy, supported by documentary research and interviews with key players. This creation served to encourage, facilitate and enable future study of these entities that could impact development of the State. The main contribution is a register of entities that is functional and legal and which the Constitution defines as cooperatives
L38|Learning from Productive Development Agencies in Brazil: Policies for Technological Innovation|This paper presents and comparatively analyzes three case studies of productive development agencies (PDAs) in Brazil: Embrapa, Finep, and ABC Foundation. Following a discussion of the main hypotheses and the methodology employed, the paper describes each case, the related counterfactual and an analysis of each PDA's capabilities. A subsequent section presents a comparative analysis of the PDAs, studying: i) the use of hybrid forms to assemble complementary capabilities: short-run effects on technological policy; ii) the effect of strategic alliances on building capabilities and dynamic effects; and iii) how industry structure and innovation should affect PDAs' strategies. Finally, the paper presents conclusions, summarizing results, methodological shortcomings and policy implications.
L38|The Importance of School Systems|Students in some countries do far better on international achievement tests than students in other countries. Is this all due to differences in what students bring with them to school--socioeconomic background, cultural factors, and the like? Or do school systems make a difference? This essay argues that differences in features of countries' school systems, and in particular their institutional structures, account for a substantial part of the cross-country variation in student achievement. It first documents the size and cross-test consistency of international differences in student achievement. Next, it uses the framework of an education production function to provide descriptive analysis of the extent to which different factors of the school system, as well as factors beyond the school system, account for cross-country achievement differences. Finally, it covers research that goes beyond descriptive associations by addressing leading concerns of bias in cross-country analysis. The available evidence suggests that differences in expenditures and class size play a limited role in explaining cross-country achievement differences, but that differences in teacher quality and instruction time do matter. This suggests that what matters is not so much the amount of inputs that school systems are endowed with, but rather how they use them. Correspondingly, international differences in institutional structures of school systems such as external exams, school autonomy, private competition, and tracking have been found to be important sources of international differences in student achievement.
L38|Designing Nonlinear Price Schedules for Urban Water Utilities to Balance Revenue and Conservation Goals|This paper formulates and estimates a household-level, billing-cycle water demand model under increasing block prices that accounts for the impact of monthly weather variation, the amount of vegetation on the household’s property, and customer-level heterogeneity in demand due to household demographics. The model utilizes US Census data on the distribution of household demographics in the utility’s service territory to recover the impact of these factors on water demand. An index of the amount of vegetation on the household’s property is obtained from NASA satellite data. The household-level demand models are used to compute the distribution of utility-level water demand and revenues for any possible price schedule. Knowledge of the structure of customer-level demand can be used by the utility to design nonlinear pricing plans that achieve competing revenue or water conservation goals, which is crucial for water utilities to manage increasingly uncertain water availability yet still remain financially viable. Knowledge of how these demands differ across customers based on observable household characteristics can allow the utility to reduce the utility-wide revenue or sales risk it faces for any pricing plan. Knowledge of how the structure of demand varies across customers can be used to design personalized (based on observable household demographic characteristics) increasing block price schedules to further reduce the risk the utility faces on a system-wide basis. For the utilities considered, knowledge of the customer-level demographics that predict demand differences across households reduces the uncertainty in the utility’s system-wide revenues from 70 to 96 percent. Further reductions in the uncertainty in the utility’s system-wide revenues in the, range of 5 to 15 percent, are possible by re-designing the utility’s nonlinear price schedules to minimize the revenue risk it faces given the distribution of household-level demand in its service territory.
L38|Analyzing the Influence of Occupational Licensing Duration and Grandfathering on Labor Market Outcomes|The length of time from the implementation of an occupational licensing statute (i.e., licensing duration) may matter in influencing labor market outcomes. Adding to or raising the entry barriers are likely easier once an occupation is established and has gained influence in a political jurisdiction. States often enact grandfather clauses and ratchet up requirements that protect existing workers and increase entry costs to new entrants. We analyze the labor market influence of the duration of occupational licensing statutes for 13 major universally licensed occupations over a 75-year period. These occupations comprise the vast majority of workers in these regulated occupations in the United States. We provide among the first estimates of potential economic rents to grandfathering. We find that duration years of occupational licensure are positively associated with wages for continuing and grandfathered workers. The estimates show a positive relationship of duration with hours worked, but we find moderately negative results for participation in the labor market. The universally licensed occupations, however, exhibit heterogeneity in outcomes. Consequently, unlike some other labor market public policies, such as minimum wages or direct unemployment insurance benefits, occupational licensing would likely influence labor market outcomes when measured over a longer period of time.
L38|Organization and system|"(On the book ""Empirical analysis of public procurement system in Russia"") In the paper, on the basis of the monograph of Higher School of Economics researchers, devoted to the study of the effect of Federal Law 94-FZ on the formation of the public procurement system of the Russian Federation, the author expresses his views on issues of strategic planning of research in the modern university, the relationship of scientific research and the development of public policy in general and in the field of public procurement in particular. The paper identifies the contributions of research, included in the monograph, to economic theory and effectiveness of public procurement in the Russian Federation."
L38|UIDAI's Public Policy Innovations|The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) was mandated to issue unique identification numbers to every resident of India. The Authority has largely accomplished this mandate in a short time and within budget because it took many innovative and bold decisions. The first innovative decision we consider, in this paper, is the UIDAI's decision to add iris images to the set of biometrics collected by it. Another innovation of the UIDAI was its practice of conducting on-field trials. The last innovation we consider relates to how the UIDAI promoted competition and standardisation. The success of the UIDAI offers lessons for other government projects. Government processes need not prevent it from taking innovative decisions. High-quality procurement and project management skills can help the government outsource many functions that are currently housed within it. Testing major hypotheses through field trials before launching projects at scale can help ensure best use of public resources.
L38|The Fiscal Council in the Hungarian Fundamental Law|In the first decade of the 2000s it became evident that in order to prevent the overspending of Hungarian budget management – which was quite detached from actual performance – executing the current budgets in a more disciplined manner was not enough. Regaining and maintaining financial stability became a strategic issue that required constitutional rules and high level legal norms relying on these rules to consistently regulate public finances. The initiatives directed at changing the situation became more and more valuable as indebtedness continued to intensify, and consolidation programmes failed. The consequences of the financial crisis that erupted in 2008 – leading to a situation bordering on sovereign default – also contributed to the making of a law on the rules of fiscal responsibility and its institutional guardian. Eventually public finances were given a worthy place in 2011 in the Fundamental Law, then the regulation was supported by the Stability Act enacted later at the year-end. The consistent enforcement of the Fundamental Law – enacted five years ago – has become a key guarantee of Hungarian financial stability. This study briefly summarises the antecedents of the regulation of public finances in the Fundamental Law, and describes the major considerations of Hungarian constitutional regulation and the related Stability Act, and the main characteristics of the work of the Fiscal Council. It briefly compares the conditions prevailing in Hungary with the similar regulations of other EU countries and the ways that tasks and institutions are interpreted by their independent fiscal institutions.
L38|Human capital and strategic persistence: An examination of underperforming workers in two emerging economies|Despite the considerable research on strategic persistence, there remains a lack of understanding as to why companies persist with underperforming workers. Our study seeks to fill this gap in the literature by integrating the concepts of the paradox of success, external legitimacy, nepotism and the escalation of commitment perspectives to develop an integrated explanation for persistence with underperforming workers. Drawing on insights from two emerging economies in Africa: Ghana and Nigeria, we uncovered that persistence with underperforming workers stem from information hoarding, favouritism through tribalism and externally imposed constraints. Our study also articulates the underlying processes inherent in such persistence. The wider implications for theory and public policy are examined.
L38|Crescimento Econômico Brasileiro e seus Obstáculos – 1930-2015: uma análise histórico-estrutural<BR>[The Brazilian Economic Growth and its Constraints - 1930-2015: a historic-structural analysis]|In a period of harsh political-economic crisis, in Brazil, and in which several interpretations of their causes emerge, this paper tries to explain these turbulences considering their deeper long run roots and developments, presenting a retrospective of the associated and subordinated evolution essential to the conduction of many of the main events which the Brazilian economy encountered, in the time range analyzed. This range is divided in shorter periods which we consider clear, in terms of some inflexions that explain, in a general and fundamental framework – emphasizing the behavior of the primary, secondary and tertiary macro-sectors – the evolution and important changes of the national economy. We begin explaining the period 1930-60, of high economic and industrial growth without any major interruption. In the third section, we analyze the period 1961-80, also of high growth, but with a mild inflexion in the beginning of the 1960’s, followed by the so-called Brazilian miracle and the II PND. In the fourth section, we present the evolution of the Brazilian economy and industry, from 1981 to 1992, under the scourge of the external debt crisis and, in the last years of this period, under the hardships generated by the Collor Plan. Finally, the last section shows the almost continuous anti-industrial trend that emerge and remain in Brazil, since the 1990’s, stirred up or at least not disturbed by the two political parties which ruled the nation in this period (PSDB, 1993-2002, and PT, 2003-2015).
L38|Organization And Governance In Social Economy Enterprises: An Introduction|In this introduction, we briefly overview the topics covered by the contributions included in this special issue which, from different angles, deal with the organization and governance of social economy enterprises. Three different approaches are taken by the contributions to the special issue: one is theoretical, another is empirical and the last one is a case- based, qualitative perspective.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L38|Role of government spending on economic growth: an endogenous potential model for Bolivia|The purpose of this paper is to contribute with an endogenous potential growth model (EPGM) for Bolivia from 1993 to 2012. The empirical evidence suggests that government consumption is the main exogenous determinant on potential growth (EPGM) with differentiated time effects: it accelerates contemporaneously economic growth but it affects negative and dynamically on long-term growth rate. Public and private investments have significant and dynamical degree of substitution (crowding out effect). As complementary analysis, effects of public spending on real effective growth are evaluated.
L38|The Role of Nongovernmental Organizations in the Public Decision Making Process|The purpose of this paper is to analyse the role of NGOs in the public decision-making process in European countries as well as Romania and the extent to which their involvement passes beyond the formal stage. The first part of the paper describes the current relationship between NGOs and government and how it influences the public decision-making process in Romania. The second part of the paper comparatively analyzes the experience of some European countries regarding NGOs involvement in the public decision making process and identifies the theoretical and practical aspects that can be implemented in Romania. The end of the paper presents the final conclusions on the subject under discussion.
L38|European Strategy 2020: what about the carrot?|This paper aims at testing the incitative role of past structural funds on the achievement of targets of Europe 2020 strategy. The methodology used is a quantitative analysis aiming at explaining a dependant variable “difference to target” for each dimension of Europe 2020 (employment rate, R&D expenditures, greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, early leaving from education, tertiary education, people at risk of poverty) by several independent variables, namely structural funds consumption (inputs), structural funds outputs over the period 2007-2013, cumulated structural funds for the previous period 2000- 2006. These independent variables will be used among other variables classically considered by scholars and/or by the European Commission.
L38|Economic Governance of Northern European Countries by the European Union 2010- 2015: The Cases of Finland, Germany, Lithuania and Sweden|Four European countries have been selected from the northern part of Europe to carry out cross-case comparisons of their strategic state capabilities. They are Finland, Germany, Lithuania and Sweden. Each of the cases has some distinctive features in terms of their recent developments or their strategic reputations. Finland’s national government has been frequently identified as taking a strategic approach to governance. The government has made reports on the future to parliament and the parliament had its Committee for the Future. Germany, in contrast, has a reputation for being more strategic at local and regional government level and the national level of government is portrayed as much less strategic. It is plausible to argue that the strength of the constitution is a major influence on how public governance works in Germany, and it maybe for this reason that strategic-state capabilities appear to be emerging quite slowly. Lithuania is an interesting case because of its apparently well-institutionalized system of strategic planning that was introduced in 2000. There is now a long-term Lithuania 2030 strategy. Central capacity for strategic planning is partly established through ministry units and a governmental Strategic Planning Committee dating from 2013. Finally, Sweden’s system of public governance is interesting in part because of the 1997 reforms that created a more integrated approach, a whole of government approach, in which the ministers were appointed by the prime minister and worked collaboratively, which has been termed as ministerial decision making according to a collegiality norm. This implies quite a step change in strategicstate capabilities in the sense of moving away from ministerial silos.
L38|Do Tax Credits Increase Charitable Giving? Evidence from Arizona and Iowa|The majority of U.S. states have implemented tax credits that encourage donating to specific classes of nonprofits. However, the effect on the nonprofits themselves is unknown. This paper estimates the causal effect of two of the costliest programs. Arizona's Working Poor Tax Credit (WPTC) and the Endow Iowa Tax Credit (Endow Iowa) provide stark contrast for analysis. The WPTC, the largest tax credit for charitable giving in terms of tax expenditure, provides a broadly targeted 100 percent credit with a cap of $200 per person. Endow Iowa provides a sharply targeted 25 percent credit with a cap of $300,000 per tax-payer. A model of donor budget constraints and preferences suggests that Endow Iowa has greater potential to induce large increases in contributions to its targeted charities than does the WPTC. Using synthetic control methods to construct counterfactuals, I estimate a 125 percent increase in contributions to community foundations in Iowa. In contrast, I find no evidence that the WPTC increased contributions to the targeted Arizona nonprofits. Evidence suggests that the growth in contribution levels in Iowa included increases in both the number of community foundations and the level of contributions per foundation.
L38|How to Fill the Digital Gap? The (Limited) Role of Regulation|This paper provides evidence on the migration from an “old” technology to a “new” technology, taking into account the impact that regulatory interventions on the old one might have on the incentives to invest and adopt the new one. This analysis has been applied to a sample of EU27 countries using panel data from 2004 to 2014 on the adoption, coverage and take-up rate of ultra-fast broadband infrastructures, whose development is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 programmes. Results show that a 1% increase in the regulated price to access the old technology increases the adoption and the investment on the new broadband technology by ~0.45% and ~0.47%. These effects are not homogeneous across countries and are weakened in Eastern European countries, where the existing old broadband infrastructures are less developed than in the rest of Europe. It has also been shown that the access price to old networks negatively affects the take-up rate of the new technology-based services, thus calling for the need of more specific and complementary demand side policy incentives to enhance service adoption.
L38|Population and Economic Growth: A Review Essay|For centuries, scientists from various scientific fields have been leading lively discussions on the (bidirectional) relationship between population growth and economic growth. Particular attention was given to the nature of the population growth variable, i.e. whether it is an endogenous or exogenous variable. The goal of this paper is to position this discussion into a historical, empirical and institutional perspective in order to establish population as an important factor for socio-economic prosperity, mostly measured in terms of economic growth. Regardless of ambiguous empirical conclusions about the influence of population growth on economic growth, the political aspect is crucial. Population effect should not be measured only in terms of population growth, measured by the increase in the number of inhabitants. Population is an endogenous variable which is under the influence of culture, values, political processes and industrial structure.
L38|Matching profit and Non-profit Needs: How NPOs and Cooperative Contribute to Growth in Time of Crisis. A Quantitative Approach|We propose a microeconomic model aimed at describing, in a dual production process, the interaction between the formal and the informal sector. The adopted framework is characterized by the absence of information asymmetries. The latter assumption is motivated by the focus of the paper, which chooses a cooperative rather than a competitive interaction between the for-profit and not for profit sectors, as the non-profit sector offers services which enable and increase the labour productivity of the workers employed in the for profit sector. Specifically, the non-profit industry can lower the monetary costs of labour by paying a share of wages and dividends in real terms. As a result, at aggregate level, consumption expenditure decreases proportionally to the share of goods and services that are not bought on the market. In this scenario the non-profit sector can play an important role in elaborating a way out of the crisis, by: i) reducing the income inequality between the employed and the unemployed, ii) lowering labour costs, and iii) endowing workers with an alternative source of employment. The theoretical analysis, complemented by empirical evidence built on Italian data collected for the period 2005–2012, shows that the model is not yet applicable in the Italian context as the non-profit industry is growing, but it is still inadequate in size to complement the activities of the for profit sector. However, we claim that Italy should elaborate a way out of the crisis by empowering the Third Sector, and, more in general, a good informal economy made of non-profit institutions.
L38|The Determinants of Outreach Performance of Social Business: an Inquiry on Italian Social Cooperatives|We analyze factors affecting outreach performance of a large sample of (type A) social cooperatives in Italy taking into account their heterogeneity with a multi-output stochastic distance function frontier. We find that cooperative age, innovation leading to new products/customer segments, managerial turnover, target programming and shareholder variety are positively and significantly (while shareholder meetings, the number of volunteers and of contracts negatively and significantly) correlated with outreach performance, measured as the capacity of serving more beneficiaries given labour and capital inputs. Outreach is also significantly and positively affected by local GDP and human capital.
L38|Exploring Board Interlocking Behaviour between Nonprofit Organizations|Directors on boards of nonprofit organizations can have additional director positions in other nonprofit organizations. When several of these interlocking directors exist for a group of nonprofit organizations, a board network is formed. We investigate to what extent similarity between organizations in terms of size, funding structure and operational activities relates to the presence of shared board members between organizations. For a network of 610 organizations we test and confirm that board networks are not formed at random, but that similarity of organizational characteristics explains interlocking behaviour, and that clusters of similar organizations exist within the overall nonprofit sector. Given this observation we propose three areas for further research. In particular we discuss opportunities regarding potential effects of network clustering, the causal direction of the relationship found, and the complementarity of the board network to other social networks in the nonprofit sector.
L38|Why Pay NGOs to Involve the Community?|We examine the case for donors providing financial incentives to, i.e. subsidizing, NGOs to increase community participation. We show that the introduction of such a participation subsidy may reduce beneficiary welfare. Thus, eliminating community participation from the set of conditions for funding an NGO may in fact benefit target communities. We show how our theoretical analysis may be operationalized by applying it to data from the NGO sector in Uganda. Our empirical findings appear to reject the case for providing a participation subsidy in that context.
L38|Who Had the Idea to Build Up a Village Organization? Some Evidence from Senegal and Burkina Faso|In this paper we deal with the relationship between external donors and village organizations (VOs) in Western Sub-Saharan Africa. We utilize a large dataset of village organizations in rural areas of Senegal and Burkina Faso. We argue that the kind of relationship established with northern donors may have effects on the governance mechanisms of the village organization. We investigate to what extent differences in the foundation of the VO and of the partnership with the external donor can partially explain outcomes and membership structures of the VO itself. Our results go in the direction of possible diverging effects of a donor intervention in the village organization, according to the degree of proactivity and initiative that the VO displays.
L38|Governance Mechanisms, Social Performance Disclosure and Performance in Microfinance: Does Legal Status Matter?|In this paper we examine diverse governance mechanisms implemented by microfinance institutions, as well as their relationships with both social and financial performance, using a database obtained from the MIX, consisting of MFIs reporting data both on financial and social performance. We find that some governance mechanisms are significantly different among MFIs depending on their legal status. MFIs with NGO status have more diversity in their boards, adhere more to fair practices related to their human resources, and pay more attention to training in social performance management. Furthermore, we find that NGOs perform better at a social level (serve more clients; reach more poor clients; a large fraction of their borrowers are women). We find that external governance mechanisms have little or no effect, while board characteristics consistently and significantly affect social performance.
L38|Self-Regulation Systems for NPO Coordination: Strenghts and Weaknesses of Label and Umbrella Mechanisms|The rise of the non-profit sector and the increasing competition for funds among its members has increased the need for more transparency, accountability and coordination in fundraising activities. In some countries, self-regulation has appeared to be the most effective way of meeting these demands and two types of systems have emerged: the labels and the umbrella organizations. This paper analyses their emergence as well as their functioning through four cases studies and highlights their strengths and weaknesses. It shows that despite its willingness, there still remain some gaps that might prevent this sector from achieving those goals.
L38|State Aid to Infrastructure: Do Competitively Selected Operators Obtain an Undue Advantage?|This paper reviews several cases where the Commission presumed that competitively selected operators of large infrastructure projects derived an undue advantage from state aid. The aid was granted to the owners of the infrastructure to supported investment in construction or upgrading. The practice of the Commission is not consistent or clear. The paper also shows that under reasonable assumptions,competitive selection of operators is indeed capable of eliminating any advantage above market rates of return or market rates of cost of capital. The paper demonstrates, both theoretically and with the use of numerical examples, that concession fees take into account any aid that is granted to the owners of infrastructure for its construction or upgrading.
L38|Análisis y documentación de los resultados de diez instrumentos de iNNpulsa Colombia|La evaluación de resultados desarrollada para diez instrumentos de iNNpulsa permitió derivar lecciones importantes, tanto para el diseño de política pública como para el ajuste de algunos instrumentos que continúan dentro del portafolio que ofrece iNNpulsa en la actualidad. La evaluación tiene por objetivo procesar, sistematizar, documentar y elaborar piezas comunicativas de los resultados y efectos producidos por 10 programas entre 2012 y 2014. A partir de este objetivo general se plantearon dos objetivos específicos. En primer lugar, se busca identificar los productos esperados por cada instrumento analizado para contrastar con los resultados efectivamente alcanzados. El segundo objetivo es el de proveer un medio de difusión de las características y principales hallazgos de los instrumentos estudiados. Para lograr el primer objetivo se recopiló información de fuentes secundarias y de fuentes primarias, con instrumentos de tipo cuantitativo y cualitativo.

Adicionalmente, se incluye una breve descripción de cada instrumento así como las cifras más relevantes.
L38|Major Public Enterprises in Turkey: 2005-2013|This paper presents an analysis of the roles and performances of the major public enterprises (MPEs) from the energy, transportation, communication and construction sectors in Turkey between 2005 and 2013. The recent governmental policy towards the PEs presents differences based on sectors. The state is intentionally quitting agriculture, service and non-strategic manufacturing businesses, passing production to private sector. On the other hand, energy, transportation, communication and construction sectors are of great importance to the state: MPEs in these sectors are growing and among the biggest corporations in Turkey. This paper analyzes all PEs in these critical sectors, especially pays more attention to energy sector PEs due to sector’s rising importance over the economic development. The sectors to be quitted by the state are kept out of this study. There are common reasons assigning importance to energy, transportation, telecommunication, and energy sector MPEs. First, volatility in energy prices makes energy and transportation MPEs highly risky. Since energy sector is highly strategic and MPEs are exposed to exchange rate risk, there are problems in privatizing activities. Transportation and communication sectors are other important ones for the government, mostly because of strategic reasons: railways, airlines, coastal security services, broadcasting, governmental news agency, posting, satellite communications and cable TV systems, state TV and radio are operated by MPEs. The fraction of these MPEs contribution in GDP is increasing in the last years. Lastly, construction is a very special sector for Turkey: high growth rates are caught up by the growth in construction sector. Therefore, it is a strategic sector and government supports PEs in order to both expand the sector and also to provide lowbudget housing for lower income groups.
L38|Le rôle de la syndication des capital-investisseurs dans le financement de l’innovation, The Role of Venture Capitalists Syndication in the Financing of Innovation|(VF) La pratique de la syndication est notablement développée dans le métier du capital-investissement, quels que soient le stade de développement, le secteur d’activité et la nationalité de l’entreprise financée. La syndication s’explique autant par des arguments financiers (partage des risques entre capital-investisseurs ; gouvernance du management de l’entreprise financée...) que par la nécessité d’une part, d’accéder à des ressources (informations, compétences) en matière de sélection et de surveillance des investissements et, d’autre part, de partager, voire créer, des connaissances. L’objectif de cette synthèse de la littérature est d’étudier dans quelle mesure cette pratique favorise ou contraint l’innovation et son financement dans les firmes entrepreneuriales.(VA) Syndication is a highly developed practice in the venture capital industry, whatever are the stage of development, the industry sector and the nationality of the financed company. It can be explained by financial arguments (sharing of risks between venture capitalists; governance of managemers of the financed firm) as well as by the necessity, on the one hand, to reach resources (information, skills) regarding selection and control of the investments and, on the other hand, to share or create knowledge. The objective of this survey is to study to what extent this practice favor or limit innovation and its financing within entrepreneurial firms.
L38|Privatization, financial development, property rights and growth|This study analyzes how prevailing institutional arrangements i.e., property rights, contracting rights, political institutions, and corporate governance practices affect privatized firms’ performance, capital markets development, and economic growth. Most of the studies surveyed show that privatization enhances privatized firms performance, efficiency, and profitability, which percolates to economic growth. Privatized firms performed better in countries with better regulatory and legal frameworks. Partial privatization may be beneficial in countries with weak institutions, namely, the French civil law countries. The stronger the economic and the governing institutions, the easier it is for privatized firms to thrive and contribute to economic growth. Overall, privatization allows firms to achieve improved efficiency while driving the development of the financial sector.
L38|Public Procurement of Innovation: Proposal of a New Model|Public procurement, which is a considerable part of the local demand, may have favorable effects on the national innovative capacity. But traditional public procurement model is quite far from encouraging innovative procurement. In this sense, this article mainly aims to discuss elements of a new model for public procurement which stimulates and facilitates procuring innovative goods and services. In the paper, we initially argue the importance of demand for innovation. Subsequently, we examine the public procurement process and put forth the rationales for applying innovative public procurement. Then, we compare the current point of views about the issue between EU and Turkey. At last, we propose a new model for public procurement process by considering the shortcomings of current model and conclude the paper with policy recommendations for future.
L38|Impact of Allowing Sunday Alcohol Sales in Georgia on Employment and Hours|Differential timing across counties of the removal of restrictions on Sunday alcohol sales in the state of Georgia is used to determine whether the change had an impact on employment and hours in the beer, wine, and liquor retail sales industry. A triple‐difference (DDD) analysis finds significant relative increases in average weekly hours in the treated industry, but no significant impact on employment. We speculate regarding the forces behind the positive DDD result and conclude that the change in regulation likely lowered profits for affected liquor stores. This would explain why store owners were vocal opponents to restriction removal.
L38|Public Policy for Stimulating Scientific and Industrial Cooperation|This paper deals with assessment of the experience in industrial policy implementation in Russia, and a determination of the key lessons including an analysis of two examples of industrial policy – the nano-industry and the automotive industry.
L38|Clusters and collective learning networks: the case of the Competitiveness Cluster ‘Secure Communicating Solutions’ in the French Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur Region|Since the development of the knowledge based economies, clusters and clusters policies have been the subject of increased interest, as sources of knowledge, innovation, and competitiveness. The paper focuses on a case study drawn from the French cluster policy, the pole of competitiveness ‘Secure Communicating Solutions’ in the French Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur Region, based on two high tech clusters, Rousset – Gémenos and Sophia-Antipolis. The policy aims to provide the firms incentives to build network relations of heterogeneous actors to trigger innovative processes. The analysis of the collaborative R&D projects of the pole provides insights on the nature of the collective learning networks working in the clusters as well as the prevailing organizational forms resulting from the firms strategies. It show that knowledge spillovers are not simply “in the air” but very specific of the learning networks and clusters from which they belong. Clusters thus need to be analyzed jointly with networks in order to understand the processes underlying their innovation capacity
L38|Rol del gasto público en el crecimiento económico: un modelo endógeno potencial para Bolivia|El propósito de este trabajo es contribuir con un modelo de crecimiento endógeno potencial (MCEP) para Bolivia con información desde 1993 al 2012. La evidencia empírica sugiere que el consumo del gobierno es el principal determinante exógeno sobre el crecimiento potencial (EPGM) con efectos diferenciados en el tiempo: acelera contemporáneamente el crecimiento económico y afecta de forma negativa en mecanismo dinámico sobre la tasa de crecimiento a largo plazo. La inversión pública y privada tienen un grado significativo de sustitución dinámica (efecto crowding-out). Como análisis complementario, se evalúan los efectos del gasto público sobre el crecimiento real efectivo.

The analysis of the collaborative R&D projects of the pole provides insights on the nature of the collective learning networks working in the clusters as well as the prevailing organizational forms resulting from the firms strategies. It show that knowledge spillovers are not simply ""in the air"" but very specific of the learning networks and clusters from which they belong. Clusters thus need to be analyzed jointly with networks in order to understand the processes underlying their innovation capacity."
L38|Political Entrepreneurship, Cluster Policies and Regional Growth|In recent years and not least after the latest financial and economic crisis, we have seen a strongly renewed interest for industrial policy to get the developed economies growing again. The political entrepreneurs, i.e. the politicians and their experts and advisers have been hunting desperately for new approaches to industrial policy. With political entrepreneurs, we here understand politicians/bureaucrats/civil servants/authorities within publically financed activities that with different methods try to stimulate entrepreneurship and self-employment with the overall goal to increase employment and economic growth. The renewed interest for industrial policy and the increased importance of political entrepreneurs motivate that we once again ask the fundamental question about what shall be the proper focus, measures and extent of industrial policy. Shall the industrial policy be vertical and focus at specific industries and even specific companies or shall it be horizontal and focus at improving the general conditions for all industries and firms? However, there is a related and partly more controversial question, namely, what is the proper spatial scale for the policy interventions by the political entrepreneurs? Shall the industrial policy focus at certain places and possibly focus at existing and/or emerging industrial clusters or shall it be spatially neutral and not try to discriminate between different regions and places? The purpose of this paper is to throw some light over all above questions but with some extra focus at the questions concerning the spatial aspects. The above questions are by no means new but there are today very good reasons to throw new light at them not least against the back¬ground of EU´s new industrial and regional policy that aims at achieving ‘smart specialization’, what that now may be.
L38|How EU sector-specific regulations and competition affect migration from old to new communications infrastructure: recent evidence from EU27 member states|In a time of rapidly increasing global digitalization, providers of communications networks find themselves confronted with huge growth in broadband-intense demand and hence must address the need to expand high-performance fiber optic networks. However, since deployment of fiber access networks is subject to high risk for operators, a core question faced by regulatory institutions is how to optimally design the regulatory framework to incentivize investment. This work employs recent EU27 panel data and examines the role of regulatory policies and competition controlling for relevant supply and demand side factors and the investment dynamics. The results indicate that relevant forms of previous broadband access regulation have a negative impact on investment in new fiber infrastructure. Furthermore, infrastructure-based competition from mobile operators and the replacement effect stemming from the incumbents’ existing infrastructure exert a negative impact on investment incentives. Finally, there is clear evidence of adjustment costs underlying the fiber deployment process. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
L38|Sarmila Banerjee & Anjan Chakrabarti (Eds), Development and Sustainability: India in A Global Perspective|The edited volume presents an engaging cartography of Indian economy following two decades of liberalization on the backdrop of globalization and problem of sustainability - two defining moments of post-reforms reorganization of the economy. A wide variety of sector-specific and economy-wide studies in the collection, examine the central tenets of market-centric reforms representing globalization. The research works dealing with micro- and macro-aspects of development help us form an idea of important issues, emerging debates, dominant institutions and changes required for attainment/restoration of efficiency. Most of these writings indicate the limitations of current developmental logic in their specific settings. These studies also propose measures to tackle the problems faced while presuming growth-sustainability disconnect to be temporary in nature. A number of studies introduced new analytical categories and empirical frameworks to capture current reality in better and more meaningful ways. A third strand of writings portrays conflict between the project of globalization and issue of sustainability as a distinguishing characteristic of global capitalism although the present policy framework accord highest priority to capitalist expansion. This conflict however, has put the Indian state in a perpetual act of balancing the growth objective of global capital and welfare objective meant for those experiencing exclusion in the development process.

L38|Major Public Enterprises in Turkey: 2005-2013|This paper presents an analysis of the roles and performances of the major public enterprises (MPEs) from energy, transportation, communication and construction sectors in Turkey between 2005 and 2013. The recent governmental policy towards the PEs presents differences based on sectors. The state is intentionally quitting agriculture, service and non- strategic manufacturing businesses, passing production to private sector. On the other hand, energy, transportation, communication and construction sectors are of great importance to the state: MPEs in these sectors are growing and among the biggest corporations in Turkey. This paper analyzes all PEs in these critical sectors, especially pays more attention to energy sector PEs due to sector’s rising importance over the economic development. The sectors to be quitted by the state are kept out of this study. There are common reasons assigning importance to energy, transportation, telecommunication, and energy sector MPEs. First, volatility in energy prices makes energy and transportation MPEs highly risky. Since energy sector is highly strategic and MPEs are exposed to exchange rate risk, there are problems in privatization activities. Transportation and communication sectors are other important ones for the government, mostly because of strategic reasons: Railways, airlines, coastal security services, and energy industry, broadcasting, governmental news agency, posting, satellite communications and cable TV systems, state TV and radio are operated by MPEs. The fraction of these MPEs contribution in GDP is increasing in the last years. Lastly, construction is a very special sector for Turkey: High growth rates are caught up by the growth in construction sector. Therefore, it is a strategic sector and government supports PEs in order to both expand the sector and also to provide low- budget housing for lower income groups.
L38|Deficits in the Media Labyrinth in a Period of Social and Political Transition|The study examines the ambivalent role of media as instruments of power and power control levers. Accordingly, the study evolves around questioning the power of media, on the one hand; and the power over media, on the other. The object of the study is the post-1989 period of political transition of Bulgarian media. The subject matter of the study on the deficits of European appearance of Bulgarian „fourth power“, according to established media index, in terms of the evolving media industry, civil society and political and economic power exercised over them. The aim of the study is to indicate where the lost Bulgarian media in transition and suggest ways out of the media maze is the capacity of the „fourth estate“ to realize political media projects, as well as the political and economic power applied over media. The study aims to demonstrate that media’s social role is increasing; to reveal media’s power; and to show how political and business organisations control media in order to realize functions of political power. These points of intersection are examined theoretically and in the context of the transition years of Bulgarian media. The study outlines various dependencies and drawbacks, examines Bulgaria’s progress towards European media standards, and discusses the possible future of Bulgarian media space. In this regard, the study’s main objective is to shed further light on the specific nature of media and to differentiate the concrete parameters of their being an instrument of political power.
L38|Real Structure Of The Non-Profit Institutions’ Funding Resources: Market Or Government?|According to the theory, there are reasons to assume that non-profit institutions (NPI) behave specifically, in the way that is significantly different from the behaviour typical for both for-profit and public service providers. Paper investigates NPIs´ reactions to the distinctive changes of the economic environment in the 2008–2013 when Czech NPIs were relatively strongly affected by the crisis, although this affection probably haven’t been as heavy as in some other European countries. Non-profit institutions (NPI) are characterized by their multi-source funding when payments from end-consumers are relatively low. The most reliable data sources are Annual National Accounts and the Satellite Account of NPIs, presenting macroeconomic data. In this article, we focus on structure of NPI funding resources changes in tough times of economic crisis. The paper derives from the preliminary results of our extensive research project focused on the impact of public financing on the structure of resources and production of non-profit institutions. This project utilizes a quantitative representative questionnaire survey of non-profit institutions. In this article we focus on a specific area of public social services only. The proposed paper seeks to prove that existing data sources do not capture the real/complex structure of NPI funding resources and will identify the shortcomings of the macroeconomic data and their scope.

L38|Health Care Systems’ Evolvement and the Changing Role of the State in Selected CEEC|Despite common heritage, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia (hereinafter Central and Eastern European Countries – CEEC) opted for different models while reforming their health care systems. A common (and important) component of these reforms was privatization and introduction of various market mechanisms in health care systems. The objective of the paper is to identify main challenges resulting from the health care reforms in CEEC. Review of the literature (using EBSCO and ScienceDirect databases) on the results of the health care reforms in CEEC will be followed by an analysis of the changes in health care financing in CEEC between 1995-2012 with a special emphasis on the role of the state in this process. WHO statistics (data) on national health care expenditures divided further into: total health expenditure, general government expenditure, private expenditure, and out of pocket expenditure (with various configurations) will be used. It is argued that health care reforms led (among others) to shifting the financial risk to patients and the state is slowly (and continually) withdrawing from financing health care in CEEC. This diminishing share of state financing of health care is not compensated by tax deductions and/or other forms of allowances. Also the issue of restricted access to health care is indicated here as a by-product of the health care reforms undertaken in CEEC.
L38|Equitable Distribution of Income with Growth in an Islamic Economy|In classical and neoclassical growth theory, it is argued that inequality is necessary to kick-start economic growth. In the Lewis model (1954), the capitalist class is expected to instigate economic growth through production in modern manufacturing sector. Kuznets (1955) argues that economic growth will trickle down to the masses once economic growth is sustained and allowed to mature. Solow (1956), Romer (1986), Lucas (1988) and Romer (1990) had emphasized on capital formation, technical progress, human capital, ideas and strong public and social infrastructure to achieve economic growth. Later on, economists like Meadows et al (1974) cautioned on the limits to growth amidst finite resources. However, since the policy direction did not take much notice of these concerns, the rapid growth in monetization and international trade has now put the future economic growth in serious jeopardy. An even bigger challenge is to ameliorate the great gap between rich and poor countries that has happened in the course of twentieth century economic growth program. In this study, we identify specific institutions in Islam that can help in achieving egalitarian distribution of income along with continued growth. We discuss that the principle of risk based productive enterprise can foster capital formation and entrepreneurship in an Islamic economy that disallows fixed return on money capital in the form of interest. We discuss that interest free financial intermediation can stabilize the economy from credit default shocks by ensuring broad risk sharing and linking monetary payments to factors of production with the result of productive enterprise. We discuss that a uniform Zakat levy on wealth and produce can result in tax rate smoothing, automatic stabilization of business cycle and encourage long term investments and decision making without leaving the long term planner in private sector to worry about fiscal policy reversals (i.e. Ricardian equivalence). In this paper, we also highlight the effects of inheritance laws of Islam on intergenerational redistribution of endowments. We argue that endowment redistribution in every generation in each family unit will automatically keep the inequitable distribution of resources in check without depending on the pace, nature and distribution of economic growth. We use mathematical modeling to show the effects of these institutions on economic outcomes.
L38|Developing an Index of Socio-Economic Development Consistent with Maqasid Al-Shari’ah|In the economic development literature, both the definition and scope of economic development has gone through significant changes. Initially, economic growth and economic development were synonymous terms and per capita income was a sufficient enough barometer for informing about the level of economic development. Then, focus has shifted to human development and now towards sustainable development. Human Development Index (HDI) is the most widely used index for assessing level of economic development; however, it does not account explicitly for environmental degradation, resource depletion, income distribution and poverty. This study strives to assist in building a comprehensive index that covers these elements which are considered important for ensuring sustainable development and that are also reflective of Maqasid Al-Shari’ah. Our findings represent striking differences between HDI and Islamic HDI (I-HDI) rankings. Oil rich Muslim countries go several places down in I-HDI as compared to their HDI rankings. Similarly, countries with political unrest do much worse in I-HDI than in HDI. Several rich countries of Latin America and Europe due to high debt burden, unemployment rate and income inequality rank low in I-HDI as compared to their standing in HDI. Overall, the results indicate that Muslim countries are themselves far behind in meeting the ideals of Maqasid-e-Shari’ah and ensuring sustaining development.
L38|Overview of Social Enterprises and Impact Investment in Finland|Abstract The aim of this report has been to produce an analysis of the state of the social enterprises in Finland. Based on a comprehensive survey, there are roughly 19 000 social enterprises in Finland that employ around 125 000 persons. These estimates produced in this report multiply the views on the magnitude of the phenomenon. Self-identified Finnish social enterprises produce social value though their products or services and mostly in the field of social services and welfare. The main hindrances on the way of the growth of the sector are the lack of an unambiguous definition of a social enterprise and the shortages in measuring the most important outcome, social impact. Measuring and valuing the impact is a key element in attracting funding for social enterprises. New means of impact investment attract not only attention but also capital that seeks for targets, especially in Europe. This additional funding is a much needed in the sector that attracts it’s outside financing currently mostly from public sector and struggles to find financing critical for future growth.
L38|The Impact of Decentralization on the Efficiency of Municipal Services. Case study|The decentralization process represents an important component of the administrative reform, which allows an ample manifestation of the local initiative, but which, in the context of the great phenomena such as globalization, European integration, regionalization, proves to be insufficient, due to the increased competitiveness in different important economic sectors, such as education, health, transport, utility supply public services, the emerging needs, interests and necessities becoming increasingly difficult to be directly solved by the local administrations. At present, there is no national or local model of efficient administration, the optimum decentralization or deconcentration limits being difficult to establish in the public sector; still, the experiences of different states in the matter vary from models falling into the optimum parameters (states in western Europe),to classical semi-failure examples (Argentina, Brazil).On public services decentralization policy there is, in general, a vast literature, but insufficient analyses of the impact of local public services reorganizing on their efficiency and performance. In this sense, starting from the hypothesis that decentralization determined significant differences at the level of organizing, functioning and objectives of the local administrations and its public services in different states, the paper presents a nonexhaustive comparative analysis of the process of decentralization and deconcentration of these services, and at the level of the Romanian local administrative space, a case study regarding the impact of decentralization on the increased efficiency of a municipal public service (Bucharest Thermal Energy Distribution Autonomous Regie – in original, Regia Autonomã de Distribu?ie a Energiei Termice Bucure?ti - RADET).
L38|The Future Of Peace Process In Turkey: Threats And Opportunities|The peace process aiming to end violent and long lasting Kurdish Problem in Turkey, has been continuing peacefully for more than two years. When comparing Turkey's peace process to the equivalent cases of Northern Ireland, the Basque and South Africa, it has been much more peaceful despite minor escalations. In spite of some existing problematic issues in the process, there has progress. The literature has so far been dealt with many aspects of the Kurdish peace process in Turkey, but few has analyzed the threats to and opportunities of the process. Thus, this paper, aims to replenish the missing part of the literature. The peace process arose out of the opportunity provided by a proper environment of both domestic and global political climate. Yet, by the time the process was underway, it faced new threats and opportunities. Peace processes can face structural, cyclical, and contextual threats, such as lack of a mediator, usage of conflict language, absence of mechanism that deals with transitional justice, change in the international environment, problems of transparency and participation. Therefore, it is critical for a sustainable peace process that the structural necessities, procedural developments and contextual requirements are carefully dealt with. As of now, Turkey does not appear to be well-protected from these threats. However, this paper identifies a number of potential opportunities to strengthen the peace process to better cope with these threats, one of which includes the existence of a strong political will on both sides. With the recent geo-political and strategic developments in the region, it has denoted the need for cooperation of both parties and the transformation of the negotiation process into a new and comprehensive stage. So while the future of the peace process in Turkey remains vulnerable to both real and perceived threats, it also entails some opportunities, all of which this paper explores.
L38|Formalizing the Romanian informal waste sector: how interested are informal recyclers?|The problem of informal sector formalization is a real challenge for any national economy, mostly if it is from a South-East European country like Romania. The formalization of waste management informal activities involves a pragmatic assessment of wide social, cultural and behavioral issues, especially since the majority of waste pickers, scavengers or informal recyclers belong to various categories of vulnerable groups. But how satisfied are these people in their activity? Does informal recyclers intent to formalize their work? How are these people concerned to formalize their activities? How receptive are informal recyclers if they would provide the opportunity to work with an official employment contract? How willing are informal waste recyclers to quit social benefits? Do informal recyclers want to be part of officially waste management system? The author tries to find answers to all these questions by assessing the informal recyclers interest about the existing possibilities of formalization, mostly for vulnerable persons involved in informal collection and recycling of waste recoverable materials. Studying the behavior and expectations of informal recyclers is made through formal and informal research tools like questionnaire-based survey, semi-structured interviews, informal discussions with waste pickers and analysis of relevant documents in the field. The final purpose of the study is to identify the real perception of informal waste recyclers related to opportunity of their informal work integration in the officially waste management system and evaluate their believes regarding formalizing process advantages and limits.
L38|Status Quo in Crisis: Public Policy regarding Israel's Ultra-Orthodox Population in Israel|Virtually all democracies around the world deal with national, religious and social rifts. This lecture deals with policy-making surrounding such rifts. My case study will be the policy that was shaped for Israel's Ultra-Orthodox population. Arend Lijphart established the consociationalism model, arguing that political elites succeed in handling social rifts in four different ways: mutual veto, autonomy, wide coalition and proportional allocation of resources (Jarstad, 2001; Lijphart, 1969; 1977; O?Leary & McGarry, 2004). Lijphart's critics argue that the power of consociationalism is restricted to routine situations (Deschouwer, 1994; Hanf, 1993; Horovitz, 2008). The critique demonstrates the need to adapt Lijphart's classical consociationalism model to changing realities.The rapid growth of the Ultra-Orthodox society in Israel challenged the status quo in various matters such as the Ultra-Orthodox exemption from military service. The lecture deals with two different policy strategies: (1) The Incremental Change attitude mainly used by bureaucrats (2) The Great Reform option, commonly preferred by politicians. The case studies about policies regarding the Ultra-Orthodox in Israel allow us to construct a new model of consociationalism. When consociationalism reaches a crisis, the political elites tend to deepen the divide between the groups, leading to an impasse. Conversely, non-political elites serve as moderating forces that have the power to generate new norms and bypass the old status quo.?New consociationalism? is dynamic and aims to generate change that will yield renewed stability while seeking maximum agreement between the fragmented parties. The new model is universal, and the paths proposed in the model are derived from present-day society and politics.
L38|Function Of Public Relations In Corporate Perception Management|In this study, the purpose is to define the concepts of perception management and corporate perception management and to explain for what functions public relations are responsible within these concepts. These functions are classified under two main areas as internal and external functions. In addition to this, the components of perception management that have a significant importance for corporations are expressed and necessary applications are pointed out for an effective use. It is also stated that public relations play an important role in understanding, interpreting and addressing individuals and groups of people within this understanding of perception management. It is also emphasized that public relations must be permanent in the understanding of perception management and it is important to determine and provide the demands, expectations and needs of individuals that establish the internal and external corporates. It is pointed out that public relations with perception management are interrelated and complementary processes. It is also described what basic rules are required when building corporate perception management and which application principles there are. It is also pointed out that target populations have cultural characteristics and value judgments. The characteristics of public relations messages are described when building the understanding of perception management. It is important to get feedback of these applications and to measure them in this process. It is necessary to prevent any negative perception either in internal or in external corporations by using the real examples. Visual elements of a corporation that constitute an important source for perception must be designed effectively, it should reflect the corporate identity and it should also support the perception to be created in this way.
L38|Measuring tourist satisfacction in Los Cabos|To see the view of tourist after having interacted with the various tourist services, is important. This allows you to improve the performance of the localities and receiving as well to attract future an increased influx of visitors. That is why the private sector and the public they are interested to know the opinion of the tourist and his rating of the destination.In this sense, the aim of this work was to analyze the level of qualification and satisfaction of the tourists in the destination of the ends during the second half of 2013. Analyzing its characterisation and potential future through the methodology used by Center for Tourist Studies (CESTUR). It is important to note that the results indicated that Los Cabos has competitive advantages in infrastructure, customer service and the natural environment. As well as challenges to resolve how to increase the range of tourist activities and the change of image in the historical center of the destination.
L38|Green tradable certificates versus feed-in tariffs in the promotion of renewable energy shares|The paper analyzes the relationship between CO 2 mitigation policy and promotion policies designed to deploy renewable energy sources for electricity production (RES-E). If an emission cap is the only policy target, an optimal mix consisting of high and low carbon use of fossil fuels, deployment of RES-E, and energy savings can best be achieved by either setting a uniform carbon tax or by implementing a cap-and-trade system covering all CO 2 sources. An additional RES-E share target causes higher costs in achieving the cap. Conversely, a more ambitious emission target automatically increases the RES-E share. In a second step, we investigate different policies for inducing an RES-E quota. Such a quota can be efficiently achieved either by a system of tradable green certificates, budget-balanced FIT system, or budget-balancing premium system. We also show that differentiated, technology-specific FITs are not efficient. Copyright Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies and Springer Japan 2015
L38|Going Beyond Instrument Interactions: Towards a More Comprehensive Policy Mix Conceptualization for Environmental Technological Change|Reaching a better understanding of the policies and politics of transitions presents a main agenda item in the emerging field of sustainability transitions. One important require- ment for these transitions, such as the move towards a decarbonized energy system, is the redirection and acceleration of technological change, for which policies play a key role. Several studies of policies supporting environmental technological change have ar- gued for the need to combine different policy instruments in so-called policy mixes. However, existing policy mix studies often fall short of reflecting the complexity and dy- namics of actual policy mixes and the underlying politics of (re)designing them. In this paper we take a first step towards a more comprehensive, interdisciplinary policy mix concept for environmental technological change based on a review of the bodies of lit- erature on innovation studies, environmental economics and policy analysis. The concept introduces a clear terminology and consists of the three building blocks elements, proc- esses and characteristics, which can be delineated by several dimensions. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the concept using the example of the policy mix for fostering the transition of the German energy system to renewable power generation technologies. We argue that the proposed concept provides an integrating analytical framework for empirical studies analyzing the impact of the policy mix on environmental technological change and sustainability transitions more broadly. Finally, we derive policy implications and suggest avenues for future research.
L38|The Cooperative Advantage for Social Inclusion Meets Uncooperative Government Regulation: International Cooperative Principles and Cooperative Housing Regulation in the Province of Ontario, Canada|Canadian housing cooperatives are a tool for building an inclusive society, bringing together people diverse in income, race, age, and ability/disability. This six-year case study of an Ottawa, Ontario, Canada housing co-op found that co-op housing provided benefits for its members: reducing the depth of poverty; increasing physical, material and emotional help; and catalyzing social integration, greater social capital, safer communities, organizational experience, skills-building, networking, and political mobilization. However, the legal framework in which co-ops operate and a lack of resources prevent Ontario housing co-ops from fully adhering to International Co-operative Alliance principles and ensuring that all members benefit equally from co-op housing.
L38|The Evolving Geography Of China'S Industrial Production: Implications For Pollution Dynamics And Urban Quality Of Life| China's rapid economic growth has been fueled by industrialization and urbanization. Given its export focus, this industrialization was spatially concentrated in the coastal eastern cities. Over the last decade, a spatial transformation has taken place leading to a deindustrialization of the rich coastal cities and sharp industrial growth in the inland cities. This survey examines recent work that studies the economic geography of industrial production, pollution, and quality of life in China's cities. We focus on the interaction between firms, local governments, and the central government that together determine the new economic geography of industry and pollution within China.
L38|El servicio de internet móvil en Colombia ¿Tiene las capacidades tecnológicas y normativas para soportar la creciente demanda?|Este documento se enfoca en la prestación del servicio de internet móvil, concentrando su interés en los cambios de la calidad y cobertura debido a la creciente demanda de este. Toma como argumentos los principales elementos de la regulación: una cobertura del cien por ciento (100%) y una calidad óptima a un bajo costo, además de las diferentes críticas a las resoluciones de la CRC[2] en los últimos años. De esta manera se buscara dar respuesta a las preguntas ¿Qué trabajos se han realizado para incrementar la oferta del servicio y suplir la demanda?, ¿Cuáles han sido las resoluciones que pretenden mejorar la calidad y cobertura del servicio? Estas interrogantes se abordaran por medio de los organismos reguladores y los operadores del mercado. Este texto se divide en tres partes. La primera nos da una aproximación y contextualización del servicio de internet móvil en Colombia, junto a los organismos reguladores del servicio. La segunda expone cómo ha sido el crecimiento de la demanda durante los últimos (4) cuatro años. La tercera examina las distintas resoluciones y su aplicabilidad en el sector.
L38|Gestión y participación ciudadana: caso juntas de acción comunal|Gestionar efectivamente las organizaciones, no importa su naturaleza, es una exigencia. Solo a través de una buena gestión se logra su supervivencia y seguir satisfaciendo las demandas de sus grupos de interés. Este artículo da cuenta del estado de la gestión en las juntas de acción comunal y su relación con el entorno, en especial con la comunidad que representan. La metodología se aborda desde un estudio descriptivo con diseño de campo no experimental; la muestra objeto de estudio es de 15 juntas de acción comunal, ubicadas en la localidad suroriente de la ciudad de Barranquilla; se diseñó cuestionario y entrevista dirigida a directivos y miembros de las organizaciones. Las evidencias muestran que las juntas de acción comunal tienen deficiencias en la gestión de lo interno y de lo externo, lo cual limita la participación ciudadana y el desarrollo de las comunidades. Se resalta la necesidad de reflexionar sobre la gestión y las competencias de los directivos y miembros de estas organizaciones para impactar de manera real en el desarrollo local.
L38|Aid and Support for the Social Economy in Poland – The Case of Social Cooperatives|The aim of this paper is to describe the aid and support provided for social economy in Poland, especially with respect to social cooperatives. In Poland idea of social economy spread after 1989. One example of social economy entity in Poland is new type of cooperative – social cooperative. Social cooperatives in the Polish legal order are the only type of a social enterprise entered in the legal system by a separate act in 2006. The Polish legislative body followed the model of social cooperatives type B, operating in Italy. Polish social cooperatives are an example not only of a social enterprise, but also a very good active social policy tool to actively counteract unemployment according to the principle “Jobs instead of benefits”. Due to this aspect, social cooperatives can also be interpreted in two ways – firstly, as a place of social employment (or supported employment) and secondly – simply as a subject of social economy. Those two ways of interpretation are connected with the possible aid and support for this kind of enterprises. These organizations may aid and support from different sources like: from authority/state – the governmental aid (e.g. special funding, special taxation rules), from European Union (EU) – EU funds, from others civil society organizations or non – governmental organizations (NGO’s) and at least from private sector. This paper starts with short description of polish model of social economy and the regulation about it. Author presents the information, regulation and data about actual position and situation of social economy in Poland. A key point of this part is the act of April 27th, 2006 on social cooperatives (Social Cooperatives Law Act of April 27th, 2006 – Journal of Laws of 2006 no. 94, item 651 as amended). Afterwards there are presented the dynamics of the aid and support and theirs influence on social cooperatives. Those analysis are at first more theoretical, but subsequently are also presented examples of the aid and support. In the summary author gives answers to four questions. Firstly, is the provision of aid and support rightful (in relation to fair/unfair competition)? Secondly, is the aid and support provided in the same manner in each Polish region? If there are any differences, how do they influence social cooperatives? Finally, is the aid and support delivered efficiently and, therefore, is the development of social cooperatives stimulated?
L38|Les déterminants de l’adoption et de la mise en œuvre d’un management par la performance : application aux collectivités locales françaises|(VF)Si les innovations managériales et les démarches de modernisation se multiplient au sein des collectivités territoriales, rares sont les études qui, non seulement, analysent de manière spécifique les facteurs favorisant l’appropriation de ces démarches aux différentes étapes de leur introduction et de leur implantation (décision d’adoption, adoption et mise en œuvre, institutionnalisation, abandon ou remplacement), mais aussi qui, plus généralement, étudient les dynamiques de changement des organisations publiques. L’objet de cet article est ainsi de formuler et de tester un certain nombre d’hypothèses et de propositions quant aux facteurs favorisant l’implantation et la mise en œuvre d’une gestion par la performance au sein des collectivités territoriales françaises. Des propositions relatives à l’influence respective de trois catégories génériques de facteurs (1. des facteurs contextuels et environnementaux, 2. des facteurs humains et 3. des facteurs organisationnels et managériaux) sur la décision d’adoption, puis d’utilisation effective, des démarches de performance par les collectivités locales sont formulées, testées et discutées. Nos résultats soulignent le rôle déterminant des leaders et des responsables internes dans la conduite du changement, ainsi que la faible influence des facteurs contextuels et environnementaux pour les collectivités françaises.(VA)While innovative management approaches strongly increase at local authorities and public organizations, research that analyzes the factors that facilitate the adoption of these approaches is rare. There is a lack of studies that investigate specifically the different stages of the adoption process (decision to adopt, adoption and implementation, institutionalization, abandon or substitution) and more generally, the dynamics of change in public organizations. The aim of this article is to formulate and test hypotheses concerning the factors that facilitate the implementation of performance-based management at local authorities. Three generic categories of factors are developed, tested and discussed: 1) the local context factors in economic, financial and political terms; 2) human factors 3) organizational and managerial factors. The results emphasize the role of leadership and internal agents of change as well as the weak influence of local context factors.

L38|From Chavismo to a democratic left in Venezuela|Venezuela’s political institutions have mutated from a subsidised coalition that almost privatised the oil industry to a populist nationalism that is polarising society to the brink of civil war. In this paper, I examine chavismo in Venezuela as a new and unusual revelatory phenomenon and the most extreme case of leftwing populism in Latin America. The within-case analysis addresses the extreme polarisation of the political landscape and the consolidation of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (United Socialist Political Party of Venezuela, or PSUV) as a united leftwing redistributive party. The conclusions suggest that the PSUV would need to evolve into an institutionalised phenomenon –beyond the nominal leader– with a clear division of power and strong internal debate, and the diverse opposition would need to unite under one political organisation with a defined ideology that is more relevant than the single bonding effect of removing Chávez.
L38|Corruption and decisions on opening up markets|We consider a mixed duopoly with a private firm, domestic or foreign-owned, competing with a public firm. We analyze the extent to which opening policy is affected by lobbying efforts and rent-seeking behaviors. We obtain the counterintuitive result that corruption may improve social welfare when the government neglects corruption and does not prevent it, as the scope for the entry of a foreign private firm is greater. Moreover, the government may prevent corrupt activities by policy-makers by requiring the entrant firm to buy a license to operate in the market. In this case, the scope for external opening up is greater than in the other cases and social welfare is further improved when the entrant firm is foreign-owned.
L38|Determinants of broadband access: Is platform competition always the key variable to success?|Previous studies have identified the rivalry among technological platforms as one of the main driving forces of broadband services penetration. This paper draws on data from the Spanish market between 2005 and 2011 to estimate the main determinants of broadband prices. Controlling for broadband tariffs features and network variables, we examine the impact of the different modes of competition on prices. We find that inter-platform competition has no significant effects over prices, while intra-platform competition is a key driver of the prices charged in the broadband market. Our analysis suggests that the impact of different types of competition on prices is critically affected by the levels of development of the broadband market achieved by the considered country.

L38|Open source software subsidies and network compatibility in a mixed duopoly|Open source software (OSS) generally offers a high-quality alternative to proprietary software (e.g. Linux, Apache, Android, etc.) for many applications. Although OSS is usually free of charge, its diffusion remains limited. Should government intervene to promote the diffusion of OSS, and offer potential adopters some learning or financial support? This paper examines whether public subsidies for OSS are socially desirable, and how the extent of compatibility between OSS and proprietary software (PS) might influence the optimal subsidy offered. We consider a mixed duopoly model in which a PS company competes with an OSS community. Users are heterogeneous in their ability to use OSS, and their utility depends on the number of users who adopt the same or compatible software (existence of network externalities). Four situations are distinguished: full compatibility between OSS and PS, full incompatibility, and one-way compatibility (either only OSS or PS is compatible). We show that if the government places more weight on consumer surplus, public subsidies are welfare-enhancing. But the optimal subsidy level is larger with full compatibility and PS compatibility than full incompatibility and OSS compatibility. These results suggest that government policy towards OSS should be conditional on the degree of compatibility between PS and OSS.
L38|Policies to avoid cost overruns: Critical evaluation and recommendations|Many infrastructural projects have cost overruns and there has been a lot of research both on why these cost overruns occur and what can be done to reduce cost overruns. Bent Flyvbjerg is the leading researcher in the area and in this article his proposals are also the starting point. Beside a literature review a questionnaire was also sent out to experienced Swedish project managers to find out what they thought could reduce cost overruns. This has been the foundation for the proposals formulated in this article. Proposals concerns three areas 1. Organizational macro-structure, e.g. using more PPPprojects but also decentralization of budgets where cost-overruns in one project in a region leads to less other projects in the specific region. 2. Organizational quality: It should be easy to see when and where cost overruns occur and who was responsible. There should be an well-developed knowledge management system in the organization and an organization culture of openness and a focus on improvements. 3. Organizational processes, e.g. a systematic use of external reviewers in different stages of a project.
L38|Efficiency of Research and Innovation Systems for Economic Growth and Employment|The concept of a holistic innovation policy is defined in this paper, and it is discussed what it is, why it is relevant and how it can be implemented. One of the main conclusions is that the innovation policies in European countries are still linear (and not holistic), in spite of the fact that the linear view has been completely abandoned by innovation researchers – and replaced by a systemic view on innovation processes. Why innovation policy is still linear is also discussed. Further it is noted that a considerable number of EU Member States have created public organizations (Councils) for innovation and/or research policy placed above ministries and usually chaired by the Prime Minister. The role and character of these bodies is discussed. The empirical results are based on a questionnaire sent to 23 EU Member States, out of which 19 (83%) responded. The work with this report was carried out for the European Research and Innovation Area Committee (ERAC) of the European Commission (DG RTD).
L38|Innovation Policy for Knowledge Production and R&D: the Investment Portfolio Approach|Who produces scientific and technical knowledge these days? What type of knowledge is being produced and for what purposes? Why are firms and governments funding research and development? This chapter studies the role of knowledge production (especially R&D activities) in the innovation process from an innovation system perspective. It examines how governments and public agencies in different countries and at different times have actually approached the issue of building, maintaining and using knowledge production in their innovation systems. It also examines the critical and most important issues at stake from the point of view of innovation policy, looking in particular at the unresolved tensions and systemic unbalances related to knowledge production and last but not least, it elaborates a set of overall criteria for the selection and design of relevant policy instruments and addresses those tensions and unbalances. This chapter suggests that innovation policy develops a portfolio approach to the public investment in R&D and knowledge production.
L38|Striving Towards a Holistic Innovation Policy in European Countries - But Linearity Still Prevails!|The concept of a holistic innovation policy is defined in this article, with discussions of what it is, why it is relevant, and how it can be implemented to enhance product innovation. It is shown that the innovation systems approach has diffused rapidly during the latest decades and has completely replaced the linear view in the field of innovation research. The majority of European countries are striving in the direction of developing a more holistic innovation policy. However, it is concluded that the innovation policies in European countries are still dominantly linear despite the fact that holistic policy seems to be the driving vision. Innovation policy is behindhand. Why innovation policy is still linear is also preliminarily discussed. Policymakers attending conferences on innovation are practically always in favor of holistic (systemic, broad-based, comprehensive, etc) innovation policies, have abandoned the linear view by learning from innovation research. The division between “linear” and “holistic” seems to be located within the community where innovation policies are designed and implemented, a community composed of policymakers (administrators/bureaucrats) and elected politicians. Perhaps the dividing line is between these two groups in that politicians, who actually make the decisions, may still reflexively believe in the linear view. Nevertheless, there seems to be a failure in communication between researchers and politicians in the field of innovation and there is therefore a strong need to involve innovation researchers in policy design and implementation to a much higher degree. Another way to increase the degree of holism could be to separate innovation policy from research policy, since their integration tends to cement the linear character of innovation policy. The empirical results are based on a questionnaire sent to twenty-three EU Member States, out of which nineteen (83%) responded. Part of the work for this article was carried out for the European Research and Innovation Area Committee (ERAC) of the European Commission (DG RTD).
L38|Institutions and Regulations in Innovation Systems: Effects, Problems and Innovation Policy Design|Institutions (including regulations) are constitutive elements of innovation systems, and therefore cornerstones of innovation policy. Focusing on (soft and hard) regulation, the paper identifies the most salient regulatory areas from the perspective of the innovation system. When asking about the effects of regulation on innovation, the paper argues that there are three key issues that need careful empirical analysis; namely, whether regulation is effective and efficient in terms of reducing uncertainty and generating incentives, whether it is able to generate ultimately wider social benefits for the innovativeness of the society at large; and the extent to which regulation is adapting to new (social, economic and technological) contexts and is socially legitimate and accepted. These are potentially the three problems that innovation policy needs to address in this area. This provides guidance for the design and re-design of innovation policy, so that policy makers may analyse empirically the social dynamics actually generated by regulation rather than simply assuming deductively their effects.
L38|"WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS: SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CITIES OF TORREON AND SALTILLO, COAHUILA"",MUJERES EMPRENDEDORAS: SIMILITUDES Y DIFERENCIAS ENTRE LAS CIUDADES DE TORREON Y SALTILLO, COAHUILA Abstract: Gender equality is a construction of spaces that involves breaking traditions of discrimination against women for its full realization in the personal and social environment. Recent decades have involved important studies on violence and to a lesser extent referrals to economic empowerment which are of great interest regionally to higher spheres. This research determines factors that most influence female entrepreneurship, contrasting the profile of women entrepreneurs in the cities of Torreon and Saltillo, in Coahuila, Mexico. The research is motivated by growth and participation of women in the working world. The dimensions analyzed were: demographic Emprendedoras-caracteristicas, environment and organization, indicators or economic performance and indicators and motivational aspects and social setting. The empirical inquiry encompassed a sample of 66 and 29 MSMES in Torreon and Saltillo, Coahuila, respectively. The comparison of women entrepreneur profiles in both cities show evidence of a predominance of conjunction of reasons such as the need and opportunity to engage in a business, higher concentration in the trade and services sectors, and a large number of women having economic dependents. However, in Saltillo average age and university studies (40 years and 48%) is lower than in TorreÃ³n (47 years and 68%). The evidence shows that women's work is crucial in the development of families"|No abstract is available for this item.
L38|Principal investigators as scientific entrepreneurs|Although principal investigators are key actors in scientific fields, there is little focus on what they actually do in shaping new scientific directions. This paper studies PIs practices to better understand their roles. Our central contribution is to identify the different ways in which PIs engage themselves in science, in implementing four main practices: ‘focusing in scientific discipline’, ‘innovating and problem solving’, ‘shaping new paradigms and models’ and ‘brokering science’. While ‘focusing’ and ‘innovating’ remain close to project management, ‘shaping’ and ‘brokering’ look more like entrepreneurial activities, shaping new horizons, reshaping boundaries between subfields and among organizations. External orientations to how they engage in different practices shapes PIs roles to articulate different worlds and to reshape the boundaries of organizations, knowledge and markets. Studying PIs’ practices and their combinations advances our knowledge about their roles in managing the interplay between science policies and scientific agendas more effectively highlighting their role as scientific entrepreneurs.

L38|The impact of regulation and competition on the adoption of fiber-based broadband services: recent evidence from the European union member states|Fiber deployment of next-generation high-speed broadband networks is considered to be a decisive development for any information-based society, yet investment activities and especially the adoption of fiber-based broadband services take place only very gradually in most countries. This work employs static and dynamic model specifications and identifies the most important determinants of the adoption of fiber-based broadband services with recent panel data from the European Union member states for the years from 2004 to 2012. The results show that the more effective previous broadband access regulation is, the more negative the impact on adoption, while competitive pressure from mobile networks affects adoption in a non-linear manner. Finally, we also find evidence for substantial network effects underlying the adoption process. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
L38|Yes, no, maybe: the ambiguous relationships between State-owned enterprises and States|In the process of liberalization and, with the introduction of sector-specific regulators, the position of State-owned enterprises (SOEs) of the network industries has changed not only within national economies, but also vis-à-vis their respective States. Reacting to this new environment, many SOEs started to pursue ambiguous non-market strategies, simultaneously seeking autonomy and State protection. In response to these strategies, States, in their various roles, particularly as both owners and regulators of SOEs, became especially interested in the control of strategically important SOEs. In this paper, we observe ambiguous relationships of SOEs with the French, German and Swiss State. We show that the positions of States vis-à-vis their enterprises is also ambiguous and the behavior, thus, may not always be effective, due mainly to role conflicts.
L38|Public funding of NPO in social services: Preliminary findings from Czech Republic|According to the theory, there are some reasonable reasons to assume that non-profit organizations behave specifically, in the way that is significantly different from the behaviour typical for both for-profit and public subjects. We believe that nonprofit organizations have several attributes predetermining them for publicly beneficial behaviour especially during the tough times of economic crisis; in such times they behave in a very different manner from their for-profit and public counterparts. And such specific “under pressure” behaviour represents the key topic of this paper. Paper investigates NPOs´ reactions to the distinctive change of the economic environment. We analyse the 2008 – 2012 period; Czech non-profit organizations have been relatively strongly affected by the crisis in this period, although this affection probably haven’t been as heavy as in some other European countries. Because of the complexity of the field, the paper does not explore changes of the amount and structure of the private philanthropy in detail, the strongest attention is being paid to the changes of the public finance support for the non-profit sector. This public support plays the major role in the resource portfolio of many Czech NPOs. During above mentioned period both the scope and structure of this public support have significantly changed. Government tried to substantially cut the public expenditures, unfortunately also in the field of social and health care, where many Czech NPOs operate. All this have influenced the strategies of the non-profit organizations. We analyse how those governmental activities influenced the scope and structure of the non-profit sector revenues, amount and structure of its assets, investments, production, and employment especially. Analysis of the above mentioned factors brings us valuable information concerning the “non-profit reflection” of economic changes. Our main contribution is to be in the proving that NPOs are able to adapt themselves to the changed conditions - essence of this ability consists of innovative behaviour and innovative strategies. We try to prove that accepting the non-distributing constraint has led Czech NPOs to specific behaviour patterns, different from the behaviour typical for companies or public subjects (public services providers). We come with the recognition of the long-term character the non-profit organizations´ strategies; this is particularly evident when examining the role of the non-profit sector employers with the clear preference of stable level of the employment. Generally speaking, we document the stabilizing potential of the non-profit sector. This analysis is being applied to the social care in the times of economic crisis. As the major sources we utilize the Satellite Account of the Non-profit Institutions and our own research of the Government Grant Policy towards Non-State Non-Profit Organisations, which delineates the support to non-state NPOs and preliminary finding from our research project “The Impact of public financing on the structure of resources and production of NPIs”.
L38|Should Hospitals Keep Their Patients Longer? The Role of Inpatient Care in Reducing Post-Discharge Mortality|The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Quality Forum have endorsed 30-day mortality rates as important indicators of hospital quality. Concerns have been raised, however, as to whether post-discharge mortality rates are reasonable measures of hospital quality as they consider the frequency of an event that occurs after a patient is discharged and no longer under the watch and care of the hospital. Using a large dataset comprised of all hospital encounters of every Medicare patient from 2000 to 2011 and an instrumental variables methodology to address the potential endogeneity bias in hospital length-of-stay, we find evidence that 30-day mortality rates are appropriate measures of hospital quality. For patients with diagnoses of Pneumonia or Acute Myocardial Infarction, an additional day in the hospital could decrease 30-day mortality rates by up to 12.8%. Moreover, we find that, from a social planner's perspective, the gains achieved in reducing mortality rates far exceed the cost of keeping these patients in the hospital for an additional day.
L38|Development Of E-Governance Instruments In Public Administration Local Institutions In Bihor County|The concept of marketing applied in education offers a lot of possibilities of social innovation. It is a tool helping educational organization to acquire resources and to provide value. In this article presented a model of seven metaphors to be used by a universities in order to acquire resources and to provide value to its stakeholders and applied it in the case of a Romanian university called The University. The aim of the paper is to identify sources of social innovations by using this model in the field of educational marketing.
L38|Fiscal Councils in the Countries of Eastern-Central Europe|Improving the efficiency of budgetary management and preventing overspending that with an adverse effect on performance are fundamental conditions of budget stability and issues of strategic importance. Rule-based budget means more than merely a stipulation that public finance managements shall observe the rules of budget planning and execution and that the real and budgetary sectors of the economy are characterised by the rule of law. Rule-based budget requires the employment of numerical and procedural regulations by institutionally ensuring their respective observance. Regarding the latter we can declare that in Eastern and Central Europe interest has grown recently in fiscal councils that have been shooting up like mushrooms and are believed to be virtually “the ultimate weapon” in fighting budgetary overspending. The demand for creating such new institutions at the same time undeniably represents criticism concerning the former processes of the planning mechanisms and their respective institutionalised solutions. This paper aspires to provide a picture as regards to what extent fiscal councils can be regarded as a new type of organisation within the family of independent fiscal institutions (IFIs) that reflect institutional development and, in the public law of the new democracies having accessed the EU following 2004, represent the best solution to be recommended, i.e. the best practice. This non-exhaustive overview deals with the course of the independent budgetary institutions of those Eastern-Central European countries that accessed the European Union in 2004, respectively their mission and concept of an institution, while it also refers to the role of these organisations in crisis management.
L38|Islam and Human Development|The paper aims to present the Islamic appraisal of established theories in academic literature of development economics, both in classical and neo-classical economics. The paper also explains the Islamic concept of human development and shows it to be more welfare maximizing to humans in their entire life span which includes afterlife. The paper extensively reviews the development literature in mainstream economics and Islamic economics. The paper also uses basic mathematical formulation to explain the concepts. The paper explains the Islamic concept of human development and shows it to be more welfare maximizing to humans and to society. It discusses how Islam is not the source of underdevelopment in Muslim countries and cites the external factors responsible for underdevelopment besides weak internal administration, commitment and management. The paper is one of the few attempts to cite and critically appraise specific development theories from Islamic perspective.
L38|NGOs, from the Promotion of Civic Participation to Public Problems Solving|In the contemporary world, NGOs are considered as important tool for motivating the community. So they committed their true mission and the promotion of civic participation and strengthen social identities. Functional characteristics of non-governmental organizations are the element to leverage the centers of political and social development of powerful governments since they are concrete and familiar with the problems of society and the operational strategies which would facilitate this process of mutual trust between the people and organizations. NGOs on the one hand offer reasonable solutions in line with approved organizations as agents to match between the facts and reality of society and on the other hand changes to a tool to have true political, social and economical behavior. However, the NGOs are active in the formulation of national relations and policy formulation in an organized and disciplined based on three main factors, ie, resources, policies, and institutions. Organizations are not restricted to state administration in centralized system bodies and this process in the democratic system limits the accumulation of desires and expectations and at the end reaches to the desired place. Hence, this research will attempt to emphasis on field research (questionnaire) and according to the development evolution and role of NGOs analyze the effects of this center on youth. Therefore, the hypothesis is that there is a direct relationship between the Enlightenment and the effectiveness of policy towards NGOs and solving social damages.

L38|RESULTADOS y consecuencias DE LAS PRIVATIZACIONES de Empresas Públicas: Una perspectiva internacional<BR>[THE PRIVATISATION OF STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES. RESULTS AND CONSEQUENCES:An international empirical review]|"El objetivo del presente informe es presentar los resultados de un análisis del impacto de las privatizaciones de empresas públicas, en base a la evidencia empírica acumulada hasta ahora por los estudios que comparan el antes y el después de las Empresas Públicas privatizadas, tomando para ello las investigaciones publicadas en revistas académicas a escala internacional. Como es lo más habitual al hablar de empresas públicas (EP) y de privatizaciones, por EP se entiende aquí las de propiedad pública en economías de mercado. Quedan pues fuera del presente trabajo las privatizaciones de las empresas estatales en los países de economía planificada en su proceso de transición a economías de mercado, pues se trata de una situación muy distinta. Respecto a los resultados y consecuencias de las privatizaciones parece razonable plantearse las siguientes preguntas: En primer lugar, ¿mejora la eficiencia de las EP después de su privatización? Una pregunta relevante, pues un tópico común en declaraciones gubernamentales al presentar planes de privatización, así como en argumentos académicos defendiendo la conveniencia o necesidad de éstas, es el de que “las EP son por naturaleza menos eficientes que las privadas, por lo que al privatizar una EP ésta mejorará su eficiencia”. Afirmación que se formula de forma axiomática (sin demostrarla con evidencias empíricas sino como algo que se supone evidente por si mismo), apoyada implícitamente en la principal proposición de la teoría de los derechos de propiedad, a su vez pieza destacada en la teoría micro-económica dominante. En segundo lugar, ¿que, qué se observa, en paralelo, respecto al comportamiento comercial de la EP después de privatizada: cambios en los precios efectivos a los usuarios o clientes, y en los parámetros de calidad? Una cuestión también central, pues muchos gobiernos declaran como uno de los objetivos principales que persiguen con la privatización que las EP a privatizar –especialmente las de servicios de transportes, comunicación, energéticos, sanitarios, educativos, ..etc.- pasaran a actuar con mayor eficiencia, y que ello a su vez redundará en beneficio de los consumidores, bien sea porque la empresa privatizada bajará sus precios, o aumentará la calidad del bien o servicio que provee, o bien por una cierta mezcla de ambas cosas. Y, desde la perspectiva más general de orientar las políticas públicas al respecto, parece igualmente relevante preguntarse ¿en qué casos o situaciones de EP las diferencias observadas, sean del signo que sean, han sido más (menos) significativas? ¿Qué nos dicen los estudios disponibles sobre el efecto de la privatización sobre el nivel de empleo, y/o sobre cambios en la estructura de la plantilla de personal, en el tipo de contratos a los trabajadores, y en los salarios reales? ¿Cuál ha sido el impacto de las privatizaciones sobre las relaciones socio-político-económicas internas y respecto al exterior? Existe sin embargo una seria limitación en cuanto a poder contestar esas preguntas. Como se verá, la mayoría de las investigaciones empíricas disponibles sobre post-privatización se limitan al impacto en el funcionamiento de la empresa en sí. Y más específicamente a los cambios después-vs-antes en cuanto al nivel de eficiencia, medido éste con indicadores como tasas de beneficios (margen, rentabilidad) y (en mucha menor medida) variaciones en el índice de productividad. En cualquier caso son ese tipo de investigaciones unidimensionales, limitadas a comparar el valor de uno o más indicadores de eficiencia para el periodo post-privatización con los valores para el periodo pre-privatización, las que constituyen la gran mayoría de los trabajos empíricos disponibles en la literatura sobre el tema. Y estos son los que se analizan aquí, en el apartado 2: un total de 30 artículos. Un resumen y las conclusiones derivadas de este análisis se presentan en el apartado 3, junto con los resultados derivados de otros tres ‘surveys’ (compilaciones del mismo tipo; es decir, trabajos que tratan de establecer el ‘estado de la cuestión’) también publicados en los últimos años. Así, para cada uno de los estudios empíricos de ese conjunto de cuatro compendios, se expone aquí cual es el resultado que se desprende del mismo: si la conclusión es que la eficiencia de la/s empresa/s privatizadas examinadas mejoró, si más bien no se observan diferencias significativas, o si empeoró. Como se verá, se observa que las diferentes opciones metodológicas de los respectivos autores condicionan en cierta medida los resultados de sus investigaciones; y por otra parte que las muestras de EP privatizadas que considera cada estudio pueden no considerarse satisfactoriamente significativas. El/a lector/a podrá hacer la interpretación/ valoración correspondiente sobre esto. En cualquier caso, puede anticiparse que en conjunto estas conclusiones de los diferentes estudios empíricos no apuntan precisamente en la línea del tópico al respecto de: ‘privatizar para ganar en eficiencia’. En alrededor de la mitad de las investigaciones referidas las conclusiones que se desprenden son que la eficiencia mejoró ligeramente, y en la otra mitad que lo contrario o que no se aprecian diferencias significativas. Para interpretar esto hay que tener en cuenta que si se efectúa un análisis ‘cross-time’ similar para una muestra arbitraria de empresas, privadas o públicas –tomando un año cualquiera como referencia- lo que es de esperar estadísticamente son unos resultados repartidos de forma parecida al comparar el periodo ‘previo’ con el ‘posterior’. Lo que significa que el conjunto de la evidencia empírica disponible no valida precisamente la predicción de la ‘teoría de los derechos de propiedad’ sobre que la privatización conllevará sistemáticamente un mayor nivel de eficiencia de la EP afectada. Este aparatado 3 se completa con la aportación de alguna evidencia sobre resultados positivos de la denominada ‘privatización organizativa’ (un cambio organizativo-jurídico, siguiendo la empresa como EP). En el apartado 4 se examinan de forma específica las escasas evidencias empíricas disponibles sobre algo más que indicadores de eficiencia, como cambios en los precios reales aplicados por la empresa a los usuarios, o en la calidad, después de la privatización. Finalmente, en el apartado 5 se amplia la perspectiva para la evaluación del impacto de la privatización de una EP más allá o además de ella, abarcando también el impacto sobre los consumidores (algo muy relevante especialmente en el caso de servicios públicos: nivel de precios y de calidad), los trabajadores (nivel de empleo, salario medio), las cuentas públicas, y sobre las cuentas de otras empresas. O dicho más brevemente, se extiende el alcance del análisis a la evaluación del impacto global de una privatización sobre el bienestar económico social (5.1). Siguiendo esa línea se examinan las posibilidades del sugerente enfoque del ‘escenario contrafactual’: “¿qué hubiese ocurrido (eficiencia, precios, …etc.) si la EP ‘X’ no se hubiese privatizado –en comparación a lo que realmente se observa que ha ocurrido?” (5.2). Y se cierra el apartado con una aproximación al impacto global de las privatizaciones en otro sentido: Las repercusiones socio-económicas y políticas observadas, en países en que las privatizaciones en conjunto han sido importantes (5.3). Esta perspectiva más amplia del apartado 5 está de hecho relacionada con el contenido del apartado 1, en las páginas que siguen, pues en éste se empieza por presentar el panorama de cuales son los posibles impactos relevantes de una privatización, mostrando así el mapa de cuales serían idealmente las variables relevantes a tener en cuenta en cada caso para evaluar efectivamente –y no de forma parcial- el impacto real de la privatización. // Abstract in English: The aim of this report is to present the results of an analysis on the impact of the privatization of publicly owned enterprises (PE). It is based on the empirical evidence accumulated so far by studies that compare the scenarios before vs. after regarding PE that have been privatised. And the sources are the empirical researches which have been published in academic journals internationally. As it is the most common when talking about privatization and public owned companies, by PE it is here meant those of public ownership in market economies. Therefore, privatisations of State enterprises carried out in formerly planned-economy countries when they were engaged in their transition process to market economies are not considered in the present work, since they imply a quite different reality. Some questions seem to come obliged as far as evaluating the results and consequences of privatisations: Firstly, does the efficiency of the PEs improve after their privatisation? This is a relevant question since a common topic in governmental declarations when presenting privatisation plans -as well as in academic statements regarding that- is that ""the PE are by nature less efficient than private ones, therefore if a PE is privatised it will improve its efficiency"". An statement that is usually formulated in axiomatic terms (not claiming for it empirical evidence but taken it as something that is supposed to be self-evident) and which comes related to the main proposition from the property rights theory, which in turn is a core piece in orthodox micro-economic theory. Then, as a second question: What is it observed, in parallel to efficiency, with respect to the commercial behaviour of the PE after being privatised: changes in the real prices charged to users/clients, and in service’s quality parameters? This is also a core question, since most Governments claim as one of the main objectives pursued with its privatisation policy -especially regarding transport, communication, energy, education, health services,...etc.- to get the corresponding public firm to increase its efficiency which in turn will result in a benefit for consumers because then the firm will either lower prices or increase quality parameters, or a given mix of both things. And taking a broader outlook, as for orienting public policies in this regard, it seems equally relevant to ask ourselves: In which cases or situations –regarding incumbent PEs- the observed differences after-vs-before, whichever their sign, tend to be more (less) significant? What do the available studies say to us regarding changes in employment, in the structure of the firms’ workforce, the type of job contracts they come to apply, and in the real wages paid? And, looking beyond firms’ behaviour, what has been the impact of privatisations on the country’s economy and on the overall socio-economic relationships –both internal and regarding abroad? There are however serious limitations as far as answering these questions. As we will see, most of the available empirical research on post-privatization is limited to the impact on the performance of the privatised firms. And, more specifically, on assessing the after-vs-before changes in the level of efficiency, measuring it by indicators such as rates of profits (margin, profitability) and (to a much lesser extent) rate of change of the ‘total factors productivity’ index. In any case, it is that kind of one-dimensional research works, limited to compare the value of one or more efficiency ratio for the post-privatization period with the value for the pre-privatisation period, which constitute the vast majority of empirical works available in the literature on the subject. And these are the ones that are analysed here, in section 2: a total of 30 articles. A summary with the conclusions drawn from this analysis are presented in section 3, together with the results derived from other three surveys on the same type (i.e., works that try also to establish the 'state of the art') also published in recent years. Thus, it is detailed –for each of the four compendiums- which is the conclusion that emerge from each of the research articles they take into account: If it is that the efficiency of the privatized firm/s the article refers to improved, if rather no significant differences are observed, or if the firm’s efficiency got worse. As we will see, it is observed that the different methodological options of the respective authors condition to some extent their results; and on the other hand that the samples of privatized PE which considers such and such study can not be considered as fairly representative samples. The reader will make the corresponding interpretation regarding these issues. In any case, it can be anticipate here that putting altogether the conclusions from all the different available empirical studies they do not precisely lend support to the topic on the matter, 'privatize to win in efficiency'. In around half of the available articles the findings that emerge are that efficiency improved slightly, and in the other half the contrary, or that no significant differences are observed. For interpreting this overall result it must be kept in mind that if we carry out a similar cross-time analysis regarding an arbitrary sample of companies, private or public -taking a given year as a reference- what is statistically expected are results distributed in a similar way when comparing ‘previous’ period with ‘post’ period. This means that overall the available empirical evidence not confirm the prediction of the 'theory of property rights' on that privatization will systematically lead to a higher level of efficiency of the affected PE. Section 3 includes also a short presentation of research contributions that offer some evidence of positive results from the so-called 'organisational privatisation' (or ‘corporatisation’: a legal-behavioural change of the firm, leaving it as PE). Section 4 is devoted to review the scarce available empirical evidence regarding comparisons after-vs-before of something beyond efficiency: specifically changes, after the privatization, in real prices applied by the firm to users, and in quality parameters. Finally, in section 5 the scope for evaluating the impact of the privatization of a PE is extended beyond the firm, including also the impact on consumers (something very important especially in the case of public utilities: prices and quality level), on workers (employment level, average salary), on public budgets, and on other companies performance. Or more in short: To wide the scope of the analysis by assessing the global impact of privatization on economic social welfare (5.1). Following this line the possibilities of the suggestive approach of the ‘counterfactual scenario’: ""what had happened (efficiency, prices,... etc.) if the PE 'X' had not been privatised- in comparison to what actually is observed that have happened?"" (5.2). And the section closes with an approach to the global impact of privatisations in another sense: The socio-economic and political impact observed in countries in which privatisations have been important (5.3). This broader perspective of section 5 is in fact related to the content of section 1, en the following pages, since it begins by presenting an overview regarding which are all the possible relevant impacts of a privatisation, thus showing the map of the variables that would ideally be relevant to determine in each case in order to actually assess the full –not partial- impact of a given privatisation decision."
L38|Towards a Sustainable Islamic Microfinance Model in Pakistan|According to SDPI estimates, poverty rate in Pakistan has roughly returned to the mid-thirties level of the 90s era. Some 58.7 million Pakistanis are classified as poor while Microfinance beneficiaries are only 2.35 million people. The progress and penetration of Islamic Microfinance is even more insignificant in relation to the enormous underdevelopment challenges faced by Pakistan. In this paper, we document the progress of Islamic Microfinance in Pakistan and build the case for its importance for Pakistan and for the Islamic finance industry. We also document the various business models and institutional structures in vogue in offering Islamic Microfinance products and services. We also document the regulatory environment under which Islamic Microfinance products can be offered in Pakistan. We explain the two basic models of Islamic Microfinance using a mathematical representation. The paper highlights the reasons why Islamic Microfinance in particular and Microfinance in general is not growing as rapidly as it should have given the level of underdevelopment and poverty in the country. Lastly, we propose how standardized screening and complimentary operations of NGOs and commercial IMFIs together with fiscal and monetary support can make Islamic Microfinance sustainable and commercially viable.

Naturally, with the present rates of economic growth and lots of crisis problems of economy it can't be reached, and the cause is not suddenly burst world crisis. The authors, investigating this matter, reveal the essence of the difficulties and omissions.
L38|Políticas Redistributivas en Chile. ¿Altruismo Fuerte o Altruismo Débil?|El objetivo del presente ensayo es dilucidar si las políticas redistributivas presentes en Chile desde la vuelta a la democracia están inundadas de una lógica altruista fuerte o altruista débil. Esto es relevante pues permite entender si las élites políticas abogan por una verdadera igualdad o, por el contrario, buscan beneficios anexos, como la perpetuación del poder político- económico. Mi hipótesis, en base a la recurrencia de la inequidad, está a favor de un altruismo débil por parte de la clase política. Para terminar esta introducción cabe destacar que la hipótesis es imposible de comprobar directamente pues da cuenta de sentimientos internos de los individuos, así, ésta se testeará tangencialmente mediante hechos que validen su posible veracidad.
L38|Integrative Enclave: When Israeli Policy Makers encounter Ultra-Orthodox Society|"This research examines the manners in which policy makers address deep rifts between various segments of a population. At the same time, it analyzes the policy shaped for Israel's Ultra-Orthodox population from the late 1990s. The study offers two primary contributions: first, it presents a theoretical model of ""new consociationalism,"" explaining the ways in which policy makers tackle crises between various social segments; second, the study offers case studies of policies shaped for Israel's Ultra-Orthodox population, according to the mentioned theoretical model and the efforts made by the policy makers to include it in the ""triangle"" of military service, education and employment.Arend Lijphart, and numerous scholars who followed in his footsteps, established the consociationalism model, arguing that political elites succeed in handling social rifts through four different manners: mutual veto, autonomy, wide coalition and proportional allocation of resources (Jarstad, 2001; Lijphart, 1969; 1977; O?Leary & McGarry, 2004). Primary political science researchers defined religion and state relationship in Israel as consociational (Don-yehiya, 1997; Sharkaski, 1996). Others have shown a crisis in these relations since the 1990's (Barak-Erez, 2010; Cohen & Susser, 2003, Etzioni-Halevi, 2000).My research, based on more than 60 interviews with prominent policy makers, shows that in Israel, governmental bureaucrats succeeded in developing new tools in order to integrate the Ultra-Orthodox society in the aforementioned triangle.In the lecture, I intend to focus on the establishment of an ""integrating enclave"" for the advancement of the Ultra-Orthodox sector's integration, even at the cost of creating separate frameworks. In all the examined frameworks (i.e., military service, higher education, employment), the designated programs were outlined particularly for the Ultra-Orthodox sector, and activated by Ultra-Orthodox themselves, separately from the general population. Thus, all programs were successful in preserving the Ultra-Orthodox enclave. However, the contents offered were professional/secular and the very exposure to them could shake the walls of the Ultra-Orthodox enclave. Furthermore, the programs aimed to advance the participants' success on the general labor market, and indeed, they did so. Thus, they were also successful in integrating this sector in the general society.Integrative enclave, therefore, is a powerful policy tool. Its use by Israel's policy makers regarding the Ultra-Orthodox society can shed light on further endeavors to deal with majority-minority conflictual relationship in other countries."
L38|Public Health and Intellectual Property|As a consequence of the growing life expectancy there is a growing cost for public health policy, since there is a growing number of degenerative diseases. There are new diseases appearing and also the necessity of new medicaments in order to grant a better life quality for the population. But the cost to acquire these new medicaments is increasing and that doesn?t happen to the income, especially in developing countries. In order to satisfy the necessities of the society, the pharmaceutical industry has been trying to develop researches. Under these conditions the public policies must be oriented, but not in order to hinder the technological development; and one of these possibilities is the patent system. It must also be considered that new diseases appear and that the immunological system must be strengthened as a consequence of an acquired resistance to virus and bacteria to the used medicaments. The constant evolution of the health condition and the need of security in the use of new medicaments, which also include its cost, consist in a frequent dilemma of the policy makers. It must be considered that the simple fact of importing technology does not mean the capacity to develop it, which has to be done by establishing adequate policies in order to fulfil the international completion. This question becomes delicate, when considering the case of pharmaceutical products, where the patent protection has the objective of market domination. We must also consider that technology transfer will be hindered if there is the possibility of losing markets, by the implementation made by the importer, in order to develop local technological procedures. Technology has its economic importance, which originated from its capacity to improve equilibrium between social and economical development. Technological policies are one of the most relevant bases for economical development. This analysis involves two questions: how can the legal system grant the improvement of the pharmaceutical industry, in order to implement the necessary innovation with the aim of assuring life quality? How assure that the State has the necessary means to implement health policies that assure the objective of the first question?
L38|Thailand vs. Egypt: reflections on the concept of ?electoral dictatorship?|Thailand and Egypt have seen some striking parallels in the past few years, culminating in military overthrows of elected governments, acts which were widely supported by the middle classes. This paper examines middle class thinking behind opposition to the governments, and subsequent support for the military takeovers.Both Pheu Thai and the Muslim Brotherhood won elections based on real support, including among middle class voters, although the margins of victory were smaller than sometimes portrayed. (The Muslim Brotherhood won slightly under 52% of the popular vote in 2012; Pheu Thai won just under 50% in 2011.) Once elected, they abused power, pursued their own narrow agendas, and seemed to be dismantling checks, balances, and liberties of truly democratic systems. Thailand?s middle class opposition labeled this ?parliamentary dictatorship?. Whether it is called this, ?electoral authoritarianism?, or ?majoritarianism?, the concept is well known in political science. Pheu Thai and Muslim Brotherhood supporters frequently pointed to their election wins to justify simply doing what they wanted without regard for other views, for law, courts, or constitutions. To the urban middle classes, this is a very narrow understanding of ?democracy?. They are more likely to agree with Yale law professor Robert Post: ?It is a grave mistake to confuse democracy with particular decision-making procedures and to fail to identify the core values that democracy as a form of government seeks to instantiate? (Post 2005, p. 25).The middle classes became disillusioned with electoral ?democracy? and shifted hopes to institutions that were supposed to provide checks on government authority, notably the courts. Pheu Thai and the Muslim Brotherhood then tried to control and/or sideline the courts and other independent agencies. ?The only remaining barrier (other than the military) to Islamist hegemony is the judiciary. If the Muslim Brotherhood and its FJP take control of courts and judges, this check will disappear, and Egypt could move from liberalized autocracy to electoral authoritarianism? (Brumberg 2013, p. 101).The urban middle classes in both Thailand and Egypt came out into massive street protests, polarization crystalized, and the situation rapidly degenerated. When the military stepped in, there was widespread middle class support for the moves, which is unlikely to dissipate quickly. Brumberg, Daniel. 2013.

L38|A Social Network Analysis of Conflict Structure after Great Disaster: A Case Study of Mt. Umyeon Landslide in South Korea|Social Network Analysis (SNA) has emerged as a major technique in the field of conflict resolution and disaster management over the last decade, and efforts are made to manage the conflicts that arise from great disasters. This study explores key actors that can be local or central governments or professionals, as well as their roles in successful conflict resolution in the context of disaster using SNA. A snowball sampling technique is employed and the stakeholders of the ongoing Mt. Umyeon landslide conflict in Seoul, South Korea are recruited for face-to-face interviews and surveys. This research is comprised of two parts; one is conflict assessment, which includes identifying stakeholders and recognizing conflict issues. The other is analysis of two conflict structures, among stakeholders and among conflict issues. Specifically, the conflict structures are analyzed by measuring density, centrality, cliques, and structural equivalence using NetMiner 4- an analytical tool recently developed in Korea. Finally, with the results from the analyses, the author presents five strategies and the roles to be played by key actors for successful conflict resolution of the Mt. Umyeon landslide case.
L38|The impact of science and technology parks on firms’ product innovation: empirical evidence from Spain|Science and Technology Parks (STP) have attracted considerable attention and public funds in recent years. However, the conclusions on their effectiveness remain mixed. This work evaluates the impact of STP on firm product innovation in the Spanish context, as an example of a less developed innovation system in which regional and national governments are prioritizing STP initiatives. This work draws on a large sample of firms provided by the Spanish Survey on Technological Innovation that is conducted annually by the National Statistical Institute. We explore alternative econometric methods to obtain average treatment effects for firms located in 22 Spanish STPs. Our results show that Spanish STPs have a strong and positive impact on the probability and amount of product innovation achieved by STP located firms. These results hold when the endogeneity of STP location is taken into account. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
L38|Europe in Transition: The Role of Social Cooperatives and Social Enterprises|The European social model has always been characterized by the active role played in the production of goods and services by a variety of organizations that differ both from private corporations and public institutions. These are private organizations that, while active on the market, typically pursue goals other than profit: their main purpose is not to generate financial gains for their owners or stakeholders but to provide goods and services either to their members or to the community at large. Traditionally, these organizations have been included in the concept of �social economy�. This paper describes the role of social enterprises and social cooperatives as a type of economic, non-profit organization that is assuming an increasingly central role in Europe (as shown for example by the Social Business Initiative, recently launched by the European Commission), by contributing to its economic and social growth. More generally, the paper intends to reflect on the economic and social impacts of social enterprises and social cooperatives in local economies, while some final remarks conclude by identifying some lessons supplied by Italian social cooperatives on a broader scale.
L38|The Role of Conferences on the Pathway to Academic Impact: Evidence from a Natural Experiment|This paper provides evidence for the role of conferences in generating visibility for academic work, using a 'natural experiment': the last-minute cancellation - due to 'Hurricane Isaac' - of the 2012 American Political Science Association (APSA) Annual Meeting. We assembled a dataset containing outcomes of 15,624 articles scheduled to be presented between 2009 and 2012 at the APSA meetings or at a comparator annual conference (that of the Midwest Political Science Association). Our estimates are quantified in difference-in-differences analyses: First using the comparator meetings as a control, then exploiting heterogeneity in a measure of session attendance, within the APSA meetings. We observe significant 'conference effects': on average, articles gain 17-26 downloads in the 15 months after being presented in a conference. The effects are larger for papers authored by scholars affiliated to lower tier universities and scholars in the early stages of their career. Our findings are robust to several tests.

L38|Means to improve access to justice and legally empower victims of domestic violence: An empirical legal study on legislation and legal offices in Buenos Aires, Argentina|The purpose of this study is to understand how recent legal reforms and the creation of legal offices in Argentina may improve access to justice and legally empower victims of domestic violence. The paper looks into the way the judicial system developed to provide suitable options for victims of domestic violence to gain access to justice and solve their conflicts. It uses a legal empowerment framework composed of three levels normative, institutional and individual. The paper bases the analysis on the existing regulations, and an empirical study conducted with those working for the public institution, and with victims of domestic violence that accessed to those institutions seeking for assistance. The paper gives a comprehensive approach and provides reflections on what aspects of the laws and institutions are actually being of benefit for victims of domestic violence.
L38|NGOs, from the Promotion of Civic Participation to Public Problems Solving|In the contemporary world, NGOs are considered as important tool for motivating the community. So they committed their true mission and the promotion of civic participation and strengthen social identities. Functional characteristics of non-governmental organizations are the element to leverage the centers of political and social development of powerful governments since they are concrete and familiar with the problems of society and the operational strategies which would facilitate this process of mutual trust between the people and organizations. NGOs on the one hand offer reasonable solutions in line with approved organizations as agents to match between the facts and reality of society and on the other hand changes to a tool to have true political, social and economical behavior. However, the NGOs are active in the formulation of national relations and policy formulation in an organized and disciplined based on three main factors, ie, resources, policies, and institutions. Organizations are not restricted to state administration in centralized system bodies and this process in the democratic system limits the accumulation of desires and expectations and at the end reaches to the desired place. Hence, this research will attempt to emphasis on field research (questionnaire) and according to the development evolution and role of NGOs analyze the effects of this center on youth. Therefore, the hypothesis is that there is a direct relationship between the Enlightenment and the effectiveness of policy towards NGOs and solving social damages.
L38|Wie das Hochschulfreiheitsgesetz Hochschulen noch freier machen könnte|Das Hochschulfreiheitsgesetz von Nordrhein-Westfalen aus dem Jahr 2006 ist immer noch in Kraft, auch wenn es demnächst durch ein viel restriktiveres Hochschulzukunftsgesetz ersetzt werden soll. Der wesentliche Anspruch war die Stärkung der Freiheit bzw. Autonomie von Hochschulen durch Änderungen des Hochschulgesetzes NRW. Hier werden konkrete Vorschläge präsentiert, wie dieser Anspruch noch besser hätte erfüllt werden können.
L38|Der Einfluss der Champions League auf die Wettbewerbsposition einzelner Vereine und die Competitive Balance der Bundesliga|Eine Teilnahme an der UEFA Champions League ermöglicht Vereinen, erhebliche finanzielle Zusatzeinnahmen zu generieren und ihre Kader so weiter zu verstärken. Gerade Vertreter schwächerer Bundesligaklubs beklagen sich daher über abnehmende Wettbewerbschancen und eine Schwächung der Competitve Balance und fordern entsprechende Gegenmaßnahmen. Vor diesem Hintergrund soll in diesem Diskussionspapier sowohl theoretisch als auch empirisch analysiert werden, wie die Champions League die Competitive Balance der Bundesliga beeinflusst.
L38|The impact of regulation and competition on the migration from old to new communications infrastructure: Recent evidence from EU27 member states|Fibre-deployment of next-generation communications networks is currently a major challenge for investing firms as well as for national regulators and is also subject to hot debates at EU level. This work examines the role of regulatory policies and competition controlling for relevant supply and demand side factors. Our econometric model employs dynamic panel data methods that take into account potential endogeneity due to omitted heterogeneity, reverse causality and the dynamic investment specification. Our results indicate that relevant forms of previous broadband access regulations have had a negative impact on investment in new infrastructure. Furthermore, infrastructure-based competition from mobile operators and the replacement effect stemming from the incumbents' existing infrastructure exert a negative impact on ex ante investment incentives. As regards the dynamics of the adjustment process, we find that there are both short-term and long-term effects towards the desired infrastructure level.
L38|The Risks and Tricks in Public-Private Partnerships|PPPs have been implemented broadly around the world in the infrastructure sector -water and sanitation, transports, energy, and telecommunications- and, more recently, in the provision of public services -education, health, prisons, and water and waste management. Key aspects of the contract design, such as risk allocation and payment mechanisms, significantly affect the PPP outcomes because they affect the incentives of the public and private parties to deliver a public service that satisfies user needs. Nevertheless, contractual provisions used in practice often do not implement the efficient risk allocation. In this paper, we discuss the crucial role of the public sector in designing and imposing standardized contracts, monitoring their compliance, disclosing contractual information to the general public, and transferring risks to the private sector in order to reduce the likelihood of PPP performance failure.
L38|The New European Union Cohesion Policy And Its Impact On The Romanian Economy|Considered to be a model of economic and social development worldwide a few decades ago, European edifice is currently very heterogeneous in this respect. European Union cohesion policy is based on financial solidarity and aims at reducing disparities between the levels of development of regions and member states. Also, promoting economic convergence in Europe is one of the main directions of this policy. However, the social and economic differences between countries remain substantial, in continuous growing after the expansions in 2004, 2007 and 2013. This paper aims to capture the new objectives of cohesion policy proposed by the European Commission, which will come into force in 2014, and their implications for our national economy.
L38|Governance and enterprise restructuring in Southeast Europe|Purpose - The purpose of this paper is examine governance and enterprise restructuring in Southeast Europe (SEE) (Western Balkans) transition economies. International organizations classify the following countries in SEE (Western Balkans): Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. Design/methodology/approach - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has governance and enterprise restructuring as a basic indicator of economic transition and defines it as effective corporate governance and corporate control exercised through domestic financial institutions and markets, fostering market-driven restructuring. The corporate governance is most often defined in terms of the roles, responsibilities, and interactions of top management and the board of directors. Using data of SEE economies, the interrelationships between governance and enterprise restructuring and set of policies that influence the governance patterns will be examined. Findings - Due to the analysis of the first assumption where a relation was made between governance and enterprise restructuring and imposed set of policies, the results have shown that there are mixed outcomes. The second hypothesis analyzed the importance and progress of corporate governance and enterprise restructuring. Originality/value - The paper shows that the overall outcome of SEE countries is mixed, as there are significant improvements in some countries and noteworthy lags in others. Indeed, needed considerable improvement is needed in corporate governance, institution-building controlling agency problems and in imposing already adopted regulation; as well as adopting new ways of enterprise restructuring policies within existing policies of overall transition economy restructuring.
L38|Competence Building: A Systemic Approach to Innovation Policy|The main question that guides this paper is how governments are focusing (and must focus) on competence building (education and training) when designing and implementing innovation policies. With this approach, the paper aims at filling the gap between the existing literature on competences on the one hand, and the real world of innovation policy-making on the other, typically not speaking to each other. With this purpose in mind, this paper discusses the role of competences and competence-building in the innovation process from a perspective of innovation systems; it examines how governments and public agencies in different countries and different times have actually approached the issue of building, maintaining and using competences in their innovation systems; it examines what are the critical and most important issues at stake from the point of view of innovation policy, looking particularly at the unresolved tensions and systemic unbalances related to competences in the system; and last but not least, it elaborates a set of overall criteria for the selection and design of relevant policy instruments addressing those tensions and unbalances.
L38|Healthcare Accreditation: A Game-Theoretic View|In India the demand for health care has been rising with increase in life expectancy, growing middle class affordability, recognition of the importance of preventive care, and overall consumer awareness. The government investment in the sector is meager given the size of the population and the needs of the citizens. Given the significant unmet needs of patients, private institutions have emerged to provide health care. This as well as the quality of healthcare offered by government hospitals, has led to the need for a national accreditation policy as a way to ensure quality and equity of care. As opposed to a government regulation, accreditation is on a voluntary basis. A hospital may or may not seek accreditation depending on direct and indirect costs and benefits. Direct expenses are the fees paid for accreditation, and indirect expenses are those required to attain and maintain the accreditation status. Specifically, indirect expenses refer to the cost of better practices, purchase of new equipment, recruitment of qualified staff in adequate numbers, and meeting customer needs. Presumably, a hospital would seek accreditation if improved quality generates additional business offsetting the cost of accreditation. This paper examines national accreditation policy for Indian hospitals based on a game theoretic perspective. The paper illustrates the role of game theory in (a) evaluation of national policy for hospital accreditation, and (b) management strategy formulation for the accreditation agency, with potential implication for millions of people. The paper provides the rationale for how an accreditation agency could influence the health care provider to improve the quality of care and add value to the society at large. It seems that the current accreditation standards, while serving the needs of “elite” hospitals for the relatively rich and medical tourists, may deter weaker hospitals from participating in the accreditation process.
L38|The New Political Economy of EU State Aid Policy|Despite its importance and singularity, the EU’s state aid policy has attracted less scholarly attention than other elements of EU competition policy. Introducing the themes addressed by the special issue, this article briefly reviews the development of EU policy and highlights why the control of state aid matters. The Commission’s response to the current economic crisis notably in banking and the car industry is a key concern, but the interests of the special issue go far beyond. They include: the role of the European Commission in the development of EU policy, the politics of state aid, and a clash between models of capitalism. The special issue also examines the impact of EU policy. It investigates how EU state aid decisions affect not only industrial policy at the national level (and therefore at the EU level), but the welfare state and territorial relations within federal member states, the external implications of EU action and the strategies pursued by the Commission to limit any potential disadvantage to European firms, and the conflict between the EU’s expanding legal order and national.

L38|Performance of technology transfer offices in Germany|The aim of this study is to empirically analyze the performance of technology transfer offices (TTO) in Germany. Although being one of the largest and innovative economies in the world, there is only scarce evidence about the role and performance of TTO in university–industry technology transfer. While policy makers and university managers are often quite optimistic about the impact of TTO in fostering technology transfer into the region, consulting firms and research institutes report such institutions in Germany as superfluous and counterproductive. Using the number of invention disclosures as a performance measure, we analyze how variance in performance can be explained by different organizational structures and variables of TTO. Controlling for regional endowment and university specific effects, our results reveal that TTO performance is mainly a function of the kind of labor division within the TTO and the research intensity of the university. Knowing the drivers of TTO performance may help policy makers and university managers to reflect their strategies, mitigate weak points and thus foster performance.

L38|What kind of state in our future? Fact and Conjecture in Vito Tanzi’s Government versus Markets|This is a review essay on Vito Tanzi’s Government versus Markets: The Changing Economic Role of the State. The bulk of this book looks backward on the relative growth of government from late in the 19th century until recent times when that growth seems to have stopped in many places. Tanzi also looks forward in speculating on possible qualitative changes in the character of state activity through substitution of regulation for taxation. Much wisdom is presented in these pages, and yet the book contains some significant conceptual shortcomings and lacunae due to its apparent embrace of the possibility of measurement without theory. All the same, the book poses significant challenges for scholarship in political economy and public economics. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013
L38|Supplier development programs and firm performance: evidence from Chile|This paper evaluates the impact of the Chilean Supplier Development Program, aimed at improving and stabilizing the commercial linkages between small and medium-sized suppliers and their large firm customers, during the period 2003–2008. We use the panel structure of our dataset to control for observables and time-invariant unobservable factors that affect the participation and performance of firms. We find that both small and medium enterprises and large firms benefited from the coordination efforts. The program increased sales, employment, and the sustainability of small and medium-sized suppliers; it also increased the sales of large firms and raised their ability to become exporters. In addition, we find that the timing of the effect is different for suppliers and large firms. While the effect on suppliers appeared 1 year after the firms enrolled in the program, the effect on large firms took 2 years to appear. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2013
L38|Understanding Media Markets in the Digital Age: Economics and Methodology|"Digitization raises a variety of important academic and managerial questions around firm strategies and public policies for the content industries, with many of these questions influenced by the erosion of copyright caused by Internet file-sharing. At the same time, digitization has created many new opportunities to empirically analyze these questions by leveraging new data sources and abundant natural experiments in media markets. In this chapter we describe the open ""big picture"" questions related to digitization and the copyright industries, and discuss methodological approaches to leverage the new data and natural experiments in digital markets to address these questions. We close our chapter with a specific proof of concept research study that analyzes an important academic and managerial question -- the impact of legitimate streaming services on the demand for piracy. We use ABC's decision to add its content to Hulu.com as a natural experiment and show that it resulted in an economically and statistically significant drop in piracy of that content.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
L38|Mergers When Prices Are Negotiated: Evidence from the Hospital Industry|We estimate a bargaining model of competition between hospitals and managed care organizations (MCOs) and use the estimates to evaluate the effects of hospital mergers. We find that MCO bargaining restrains hospital prices significantly. The model demonstrates the potential impact of coinsurance rates, which allow MCOs to partly steer patients toward cheaper hospitals. We show that increasing patient coinsurance tenfold would reduce prices by 16 percent. We find that a proposed hospital acquisition in Northern Virginia that was challenged by the Federal Trade Commission would have significantly raised hospital prices. Remedies based on separate bargaining do not alleviate the price increases. (JEL C78, G34, I11, I13, L13)
L38|Can amputation save the hospital? The impact of the Medicare Rural Flexibility Program on demand and welfare|This paper seeks to understand the impact of the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility (Flex) Program on hospital choice and consumer welfare for rural residents. The Flex Program created a new class of hospital, the Critical Access Hospital (CAH), which receives more generous Medicare reimbursements in return for limits on capacity and length of stay. We find that conversion to CAH status resulted in a 4.7 percent drop in inpatient admissions to participating hospitals, almost all of which was driven by factors other than capacity constraints. The Flex Program increased consumer welfare if it prevented the exit of at least 6.5 percent of randomly selected converting hospitals.
L38|The Power of Media and the Power over Media|The study examines the ambivalent role of media as instruments of power and power control levers. Accordingly, the study evolves around questioning the power of media, on the one hand; and the power over media, on the other. The object of the study is the post-1989 period of political transition of Bulgarian media. The subject matter of the study is the capacity of the “fourth estate” to realize political media projects, as well as the political and economic power applied over media. The study aims to demonstrate that media’s social role is increasing; to reveal media’s power; and to show how political and business organizations control media in order to realize functions of political power. These points of intersection are examined theoretically and in the context of the transition years of Bulgarian media. The study outlines various dependencies and drawbacks, examines Bulgaria’s progress towards European media standards, and discusses the possible future of Bulgarian media space. In this regard, the study’s main objective is to shed further light on the specific nature of media and to differentiate the concrete parameters of their being an instrument of political power.
L38|Crisis and Transformations in the Bulgarian National Consciousness|The study treats crisis, changes and transformations of the Bulgarian national consciousness, inspected through the prism of the essential stages of the political systems’ development in Bulgaria. The accent in the research is focused on the critical analysis of the evolution and exhausting of the patriotism, one of the oldest and significant achievement of the human civilization. The essential elements of the treated research problem are following: the progressive exhaustion of national energy; the permanent antagonism at each level: political, social, ethnic, economical; the transformation of the lack of a national identity on a tacit state policy; manipulation at the spiritual sphere. The study’s conception is based on two approaches – the political scientific and the cultural-historical, and the basic models are: the causal-consecutive and the comparative analysis.
L38|The Periodicals in Bulgaria – Contemporary Market Asymmetries (2010 – 2012)|The trends in the Bulgarian print media market from the previous decade continue during the period of 2010-2012. There is a lack of transparency of media ownership and financing, oligopolistic market structure, unfair competition, strong political dependency, limited pluralism, unification of media content, furthering of the position of tabloids and the mainstream press going gutter, withdrawal of the readers, decrease of the circulation, the advertisement revenues lessen year after year, the self-regulation is ineffective. According to unofficial sources, the process of ownership concentration in the newspaper business continues, so does the ownership of the distribution channels. The oligopolistic structure of both newspapers and magazines markets sharpens the competition among the publishing houses and the struggle for readers and advertisers grows bitter as supply exceeds demand. Those trends uncover market asymmetries that could be fatal to the traditional press. Creating a healthy environment for the development of the periodicals in Bulgaria is a responsibility of the publishers but also of some national institutions. The market logic has to overcome the political and economic dependency of the press in order to generate much more diverse content of high quality and to prevent the final transfer of the readership to the growing online media.
L38|Transformation Competences: Qualification Profile of Online Journalists|The development of professional competencies of journalists is a dynamic challenge. Journalistic work is done in a living communication medium, the Internet, which is a catalyst for changing the profession as a whole. Changes are observed both in the formal organization of work process as well as the implicit professional guiding principles. Internet and digital technologies put forward the need of “multi-professionalism.” The transforming wave which flooded media landscape and communications is especially interesting. The paper discusses the new qualification profile of online journalists and brings forward the set of specific new skills required in the field of high technology professional journalist.
L38|Sources of Journalism Theory. Milton’s Areopagitica in Bulgaria|Literary and journalism historians traditionally consider John Milton’s famous Areopagitica to be the first systematic defense of the liberty of the press. The Bulgarian reception of this important text is, however, only very scarce. This paper discusses the episodic contributions of Bulgarian scholars in this regard – starting from 1921, when a local political newspaper published the first Bulgarian translation of a minor section of Areopagitica, and ending with some contemporary studies of history and theory of journalism. As an appendix, the text offers a commented Bulgarian translation of a longer section of Areopagitica in which Milton examined in detail the historical evolution of licensed printing.
L38|Effective Communication in Negotiations|In the paper the nature and characteristics of effective communication during negotiations are examined. Thesis argues that successful negotiations are mostly a result of effective business communication, ability of the negotiators to communicate persuasively, fairly, clearly and understandable. Special emphasis is placed on negotiation cycle, vocabulary of negotiations, difficulties and the most common barriers, effective tactics and techniques for obtaining advantage, as well as relevant aspects of verbal and nonverbal communication in negotiations. Quality exchange of information during business discussions, ability for quick orientation in the opportunities, attitudes and intentions of the negotiating parties, and the ability to encode and read signals and messages transmitted in this process - all this shows how important is good communication in the situation of negotiations. Finally, the paper notes that negotiations are kind of business communication in which the main objective is to overcome differences, reach an agreement and a deal. Summary is displayed and the success of the negotiations depends to a large extent by application of appropriate tactics, by concentrating on the details of the negotiation and the use of techniques to achieve good intermediate results as a step towards the intended general goal.
L38|The Power of Media Message („The invisible hand“ of the media)|The study focuses on one of the most popular but also the most controversial issue in media knowledge: Is there a media power and what are the mechanisms for its operation? Explored the roots of power, seen through the prism of political science and the nature of the media message from the perspective of journalism theory. Used the method of transdisciplinary approach to the demand for total unification field between the two basic categories of political science and media knowledge. It was discovered and analyzed integrative function of two phenomena: power and media message. A comparative analysis with related concepts such as influence, suggestion, cognitive response, producing the intended results, understanding, agreement, etc. The paper presents several examples of journalistic practice that illustrate both the existence of the power of the media message and its unreality and conventionality. Followed major trends in journalistic work in the modern information society.
L38|The influence of science and technology park characteristics on firms' innovation results|The effectiveness of Science and Technology Parks (STPs) as instruments of innovation policy has generated thriving debate among academics, practitioners and policy makers. A gap in the existing literature on STPs is that research mostly does not consider STPs' heterogeneity. The present paper aims at filling this gap, analysing the influence of different STP characteristics on their tenants' performance. Using data on 849 firms and 25 STPs from the 2009 Community Innovation Survey for Spain and a survey of STP managers respectively and after controlling for a wide set of firms characteristics, we find that: (i) firms located in very new or longer established STPs show better innovative performance; (ii) the size of the STP and its management company positively affects the innovative performance of tenants while services provision has no effect on firms' achieving better results; and (iii) firms in less technologically developed regions benefit more from location in an STP. Theoretical, policy and managerial contributions of our research are discussed in the paper. La eficacia de los Parques Científicos y Tecnológicos (PCyT) como instrumentos políticos de innovación ha generado un debate floreciente entre académicos, profesionales y responsables políticos. Un vacío en la literatura existente sobre los PCyT es que la mayoría de las investigaciones no consideran la heterogeneidad de los PCyT. El objetivo del presente artículo es llenar este vacío, mediante el análisis de la influencia de las diferentes características de los PCyT en el rendimiento de sus inquilinos. Mediante el uso de datos de 849 empresas y 25 PCyT de la Encuesta de la Comunidad sobre la Innovación de 2009 para España y una encuesta a los gerentes de PCyT, respectivamente, y después de controlar un amplio conjunto de características de las empresas, se encontró que: (i) las empresas ubicadas en PCyT muy nuevos o bastante establecidos muestran un mejor rendimiento en innovación; (ii) el tamaño del PCyT y la compañía que lo gestiona afecta positivamente al rendimiento en innovación de los inquilinos, mientras que la provisión de servicios no tiene ningún efecto en que las empresas logren mejores resultados; y (iii) las empresas en regiones menos desarrolladas tecnológicamente se benefician más de la ubicación en un PCyT. En el documento se discuten las contribuciones teóricas, políticas y de gestión de nuestra investigación. イノベーション政策の実行手段としてのサイエンス&テクノロジーパーク(Science and Technology Park:STP)の有効性については、研究者、政策実行者、政策立案者の間で盛んに議論がなされてきた。STPに関する既存研究の欠点は、STPの異質性がほとんど考慮されていないことである。本稿では、STPの様々な特性がテナント企業の実績に及ぼす影響を分析して、この欠点を補うことを目指す。2009年のスペインのコミュニティ・イノベーション調査(Community Innovation Survey)から得られた849社の企業データとSTPの経営者の調査から得られた25のSTPに関するデータを使用して分析を行い、広範な企業の特性で補正すると以下のことが分かる。1)設立から間もないSPT、または長く成功しているSPT内に立地する企業は、イノベーション・パフォーマンスがより優れている。2)SPTの規模とそのSPTの経営会社はテナント企業のイノベーション・パフォーマンスに正の影響を及ぼすが、サービスの提供は企業がより優れた実績を収めることには何の影響も与えていない。3)技術的発展が遅れている地域の企業は、STP内に立地することからより多くの恩恵を受ける。理論的、政策的、経営的な面での本研究の貢献について考察する。
L38|О Неоиндустриальной Модели И Стратегии Развития Экономики<BR>[About the neoindustrial model and strategy of development economics]|The Russian Government remains committed to the resource model. Every year more and more difficult to meet the country's needs for material wealth at the expense of resource revenues. The biggest debate is to validate the measures and forms of government involvement in the economy. The results of analysis of official economic strategy of the «Strategy 2020» lead to the conclusion that based on the resource model of the problem of economic development of Russia is practically not solve. Meanwhile, other strategic approaches are fundamentally similar as to how to overcome the dependence on natural resources. They differ only in the forms and methods of the maneuver. Economic policy criticized by supporters of the two new paradigms of modern development. This is the paradigm of technological structures and the paradigm of the new industrialization. These paradigms are summarized, in fact, in one paradigm - neoindustrial structure. The strategy should include a set of priority measures. Analysis of the data allows to ascertain the achievement of a critical threshold of substitution of labor income in the federal budget of Russia and the country's GDP, revenues from natural resources. We believe that the first measures should be innovative reconstruction of the material and technical base of domestic enterprises. Our program is intended to strengthen the state's presence in important areas of development. The state should not be limited overall coordination of the economy, evolving under the influence of market forces. The program of reconstruction of the economy should include six interconnected blocks. Innovative renovation will increase the competitiveness of the economy, will ensure the sustainability of the state budget. Russia will come out on the path of excellence - neo-industrial, knowledge-based, innovation.
L38|Micro-foundations of God-Conscious Economic Agents in Islamic Economy|This paper discusses Islamic principles and how they can help in achieving efficiency along with equity in a market system. We start with the concept of ‘human welfare’ in Islam and show how it is distinct from the concept of welfare in western social sciences. The difference comes from the worldview. This difference is not trivial. It has important implications on human behavior and choices. Belief in perfect accountability and absolute justice will help in achieving ethical behavior even when it cannot be codified or made compulsory by law. After presenting the basic framework of welfare, we present how Islamic principles can systematically help to achieve equitable distribution of resources within a market system. We discuss the institution of Zakat and how it will incorporate diminishing marginal utility of wealth and also achieve the objective of circulation of wealth and utilization of idle resources. We also present labor market dynamics in an Islamic economy. We show how labor force participation, human capital development and technical progress will be achieved in an Islamic economy. Lastly, we discuss the effects of Zakat on bringing competition, efficiency, investment and employment.

L38|Analysis of the Transformation of Selected Theatres - Allowance Organisations of the City of Prague|"This paper deals with the transformation of theatres - allowance organisations of the City of Prague. The whole issue is placed in a wider context of economic policy. The paper aims to evaluate the transformation using the example of selected theatres that have been transformed; the analysis also considers allowance organisations (The Municipal Theatres of Prague). The Grant System of the City of Prague was modifi ed several times in the years 2007-2009; because of its importance for the functioning of (not only) the transformed organisations, the paper will shortly deal with its changes and successive forming too. The transformation was highly monitored by the mass media and the process was stopped after long disputes in September 2011. The goal of this paper is to summarise findings from the first (and currently last) phase of the transformation process, which could be used later in its potential completion. The ""KAMF"" model is used to analyse the financial situation of the theatres."
L38|Energy Access and Energy Security in Asia and the Pacific|Lack of access to electricity and modern cooking fuels constitutes energy poverty. Access to modern energy requires improved technologies and financing instruments and sources. The pro-poor public–private partnership model is one useful vehicle for raising capital to finance projects. Five factors appear to be necessary in combination for programs and partnerships to successfully promote energy access and eradicate energy poverty: selecting appropriate technology, promoting community participation, emphasizing maintenance and service, coupling service with incomes, and building local capacity.
L38|Evidence on the Accuracy of Merger Simulations| This paper evaluates the efficacy of a structural model of oligopoly used for merger review. Using premerger data, we estimate several demand systems and use a static Bertrand model to simulate the price effects of two mergers. Using pre- and postmerger data, we directly estimate the price effects. The direct estimates imply that one merger resulted in moderate price increases, while the second left prices essentially unchanged. While some simulations are similar to the directly estimated price effects, overall simulations overstate the price effects in one case and understate them in the other. Explanations for the discrepancies are explored. © 2013 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
L38|The Impact of Charitable Subsidies on Religious Giving and Attendance: Evidence from Panel Data| The literature documents that charitable giving is responsive to tax subsidies but often ignores the spillover effects of such policies. This paper investigates the spillover effects of charitable subsidies on religious participation using individual-level panel data. The results show that religious giving and participation are complements. The implied cross-price elasticity of religious participation with respect to the after-tax price of giving is −0.27. Furthermore, a 1% increase in the amount of religious contributions is associated with a 0.4% increase in religious attendance. These results are robust under several different specifications and highlight the positive externalities created by charitable subsidies. © 2013 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
L38|Econom�a cooperativa: un enfoque innovador para la sostenibilidad|Un primer balance del A�o Internacional del Cooperativismo evidencia como las formas de la econom�a cooperativa sean plurales, amplias y de larga duraci�n. A estos rasgos distintivos se debe la particular resiliencia y la amplitud de uso de este tipo de empresa, a la cual, sin embargo, la percepci�n publica tiende a atribuir escasa importancia y un car�cter de transitoriedad. El debate actual que la crisis ha provocado en torno a los l�mites del capitalismo financiero est� cuestionando la condici�n de marginalidad de la econom�a cooperativa. En el texto se comparan dos visiones econ�micas opuestas: la financiera, que se basa �nicamente en el crecimiento del capital, y la cooperativa que se propone la b�squeda de un equilibro a dimensiones m�ltiples, incluyendo la social y la ambiental. Una estrategia econ�mica que quiera responder a los problemas que enfrentaremos en los pr�ximos a�os � el crecimiento demogr�fico, la escasez de recursos naturales la nueva migraci�n urbana, la redistribuci�n y la inclusi�n social- no puede prescindir del cooperativismo, como parte de una nueva visi�n del desarrollo econ�mico y social. Esta oportunidad requiere que los actores de la econom�a cooperativa sean innovadores y piensen en su modelo no en t�rminos dogm�ticos, sino valorizando su adaptabilidad y su capacidad de gestionar la diversidad. En la empresa cooperativa, de hecho, se refleja la convicci�n de que las acciones humanas no son dictadas �nicamente por los principios del inter�s individual, ya que las personas act�an seg�n una pluralidad de motivaciones, y tambi�n se ven influenciadas por la orientaci�n hacia la reciprocidad y la b�squeda de justicia y equidad.
L38|Economia cooperativa: un approccio innovativo alla sostenibilit�|Da un primo bilancio dell�Anno Internazionale delle Cooperative emerge quanto le forme dell�economia cooperativa siano plurali, diffuse e longeve. Da qui la particolare resilienza e ampiezza di uso di questa forma di impresa, cui tuttavia corrisponde una percezione pubblica che tende a considerarla marginale o transitoria. L�attuale discussione che la crisi ha provocato attorno ai limiti del capitalismo finanziario sta mettendo in discussione questa condizione di minorit� dell�economia cooperativa. Il testo tratta di due visioni economiche che si oppongono: quella finanziaria in cui conta solo la crescita del capitale, e quella cooperativa nella quale conta invece la ricerca di un equilibrio tra pi� dimensioni, incluse quelle sociali e ambientali.
L38|La insuficiencia de las actuales políticas de fomento de cooperativas y sociedades laborales frente a la crisis en España<BR>[The insufficiency of current policies to foster cooperatives and labour companies against economic crisis in Spain]|El objeto del presente artículo es analizar las políticas de fomento de cooperativas y sociedades laborales durante este periodo de crisis, identificando los principales dispositivos existentes y los de nueva implantación, evaluando su alcance y valorando su nivel de eficacia. Se han distinguido tres grupos de políticas de fomento, las políticas tradicionales de fomento, las políticas de nuevo cuño, incluyendo en estas últimas las medidas urdidas por los gobiernos regionales y la nueva ley de economía social y finalmente las políticas de austeridad. Se concluye, en primer lugar, que las cooperativas y sociedades laborales no constituyen un sector muy subvencionado dado que el alcance de estas políticas ha sido muy reducido. En segundo lugar, contrariamente a lo que cabría esperar en un periodo de crisis, ni los dispositivos tradicionales ni los de nuevo cuño han conocido un mayor despliegue en estos últimos años, al objeto de combatir los problemas de desempleo y de fortalecimiento del sector de la economía social. Al contrario, las políticas de austeridad implantadas han afectado duramente a las políticas de economía social, las cuales han visto reducirse los presupuestos asignados de modo muy acusado.
L38|Analyzing the Extent and Influence of Occupational Licensing on the Labor Market|This study examines occupational licensing in the United States using a specially designed national labor force survey. Estimates from the survey indicated that 35% of employees were either licensed or certified by the government and that 29% were licensed. Another 3% stated that all who worked in their job would eventually be required to be certified or licensed, bringing the total that are or eventually must be licensed or certified by government to 38%. We find that licensing is associated with about 18% higher wages but that the effect of governmental certification on pay is much smaller.
