Z10|Human Development, Social Interactions, and Identity Formation|This paper presents a general theory of child development that incorporates interactive learning and identity formation in social interactions with caregivers. The model sheds light on many puzzling aspects of child development. Child learning responds nonmonotonically to caregivers' attention and approval in social interactions. I highlight key parental characteristics associated with child learning, and identity formation. The theory also explains why media devices widen human inequality. Lessons are finally drawn for the design of policies that alleviate human inequality.
Z10|The Out of Africa Hypothesis of Comparative Economic Development: Common Misconceptions|"""The importance of the prehistoric migration of anatomically modern humans from Africa for comparative economic development has been the focus of a vibrant research agenda in the past decade. This influential literature has attracted the attention of some scholars from other disciplines, and in light of existing methodological gaps across fields, has perhaps unsurprisingly generated some significant misconceptions. This article examines the critical views expressed by some scholars from other disciplines, and establishes that they are based on fundamental misunderstandings of the statistical methodology, the conceptual framework, and the scope of the analysis that characterize this influential literature.."
Z10|Multigenerational Transmission of Culture|This paper explores intergenerational transmission of culture and the consequences of a plausible assumption: that people care not only for their children’s culture but also for how their grand-children are raised. This departs from the previous literature which, without exception, assumes parents either do not care about, or fail to consider, the effect their actions have on all future generations. The current paper models a sequential game where parents take actions trading off being close to their own preferences and influencing their children, and where parents take into account that the children face a similar trade-off when raising their children. Predictions regarding endogenous extremism, the effect of societal socialization, parents. discounting, social pressure and interaction between groups are derived. In equilibrium, parents behave more extremely than their own preferences and this effect is intensified the more extreme preferences the parent has. There may be perpetual extremizing whereby an arbitrarily long sequence of generations will behave more extremely than the first ancestor’s preferences. Furthermore, interaction of groups implies more extreme initial behavior but also faster integration.
Z10|Individual Attitudes towards Immigration in Aging Populations|This research empirically establishes the hypothesis that the process of population aging in a society as a whole affects the attitudes of its members towards immigration. Hence, an aging social environment exerts an effect on the attitudes of individuals towards immigration after accounting for their age and other individual characteristics. We test this hypothesis in a multilevel analysis of individuals living in 25 European OECD countries over the period 2002-2017. Our measure of “societal population aging” is the old-age dependency ratio. “Attitudes” are taken from immigration related questions in eight consecutive rounds of the European Social Survey. For these attitudes we find non-linear, U-shaped relationships. Hence, the effect of societal population aging on individual attitudes towards immigration is negative in young societies and positive in old ones.
Z10|Identity, Beliefs, and Political Confl ict|We present a theory of identity politics that builds on two ideas. First, voters identify with the social group whose interests are closest to theirs and that features the strongest policy con ict with outgroups. Second, identification causes voters to slant their beliefs toward the group's distinctive opinion. The theory yields two main implications: i) voters' beliefs are polarized and distorted along group boundaries; ii) economic shocks that induce new cleavages to emerge also bring about large changes in beliefs and preferences across many policy issues. In particular, exposure to globalization or cultural changes may induce voters to switch identities, dampening their demand for redistribution and exacerbating con icts in other social dimensions. We show that survey evidence is consistent with these implications.
Z10|Commanding Nature by Obeying Her: A Review Essay on Joel Mokyr’s A Culture of Growth|Why is modern society capable of cumulative innovation? In A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy, Joel Mokyr persuasively argues that sustained technological progress stemmed from a change in cultural beliefs. The change occurred gradually during the seventeenth and eighteenth century and was fostered by an intellectual elite that formed a transnational community and adopted new attitudes toward the creation and diffusion of knowledge, setting the foundation for the ethos of modern science. The book is a significant contribution to the growing literature that links culture and economics. This review discusses Mokyr’s historical analysis in relation to the following questions: What is culture and how should we use it in economics? How can culture explain modern economic growth? Will the culture of growth that caused modern prosperity persist in the future?
Z10|Gendered language|Languages use different systems for classifying nouns. Gender languages assign many -- sometimes all -- nouns to distinct sex-based categories, masculine and feminine. Drawing on a broad range of historical and linguistic sources, this paper constructs a measure of the proportion of each country's population whose native language is a gender language. At the cross-country level, this paper documents a robust negative relationship between the prevalence of gender languages and women's labor force participation. It also shows that traditional views of gender roles are more common in countries with more native speakers of gender languages. In African countries where indigenous languages vary in terms of their gender structure, educational attainment and female labor force participation are lower among those whose native languages are gender languages. Cross-country and individual-level differences in labor force participation are large in both absolute and relative terms (when women are compared to men), suggesting that the observed patterns are not driven by development or some unobserved aspect of culture that affects men and women equally. Following the procedures proposed by Altonji, Elder, and Taber (2005) and Oster (2017), this paper shows that the observed correlations are unlikely to be driven by unobservables. Using a permutation test based on the structure of the language tree and the distribution of languages across countries, this paper demonstrates that the results are not driven by spurious correlations within language families. Gender languages appear to reduce women's labor force participation and perpetuate support for unequal treatment of women.
Z10|A General Panorama of the Import Substitution Industrialisation (ISI) Model for Colombia – A Comparative Case Study with Singapore|The document compares the Import Substitution Industrialisation (ISI) model for Colombia with the success of Singapore, to determine if there were failures in the implantation of the model in Colombia and if so, to identify them. It should be noted that an analysis of this type may present problems since the conditions of both territories differ considerably. To correct that problem the possible deficiencies found for the South American country are evaluated under the possibilities granted by its context and not by the conditions that could have been established in Singapore. The analysis of this work is limited only to the following three perspectives: historical, governmental and cultural, inasmuch as these dimensions, in the author's opinion, yield interesting results of the ISI phase of the Colombian economy and provide sufficient information for the reader to become familiar with the import substitution process in Colombia, its strengths, weaknesses and economic consequences. *** El documento compara el modelo de Industrialización por Sustitución de Importaciones (ISI) para Colombia con el éxito asiático de Singapur, con el propósito de determinar si existieron falencias en la implantación del modelo en Colombia y en caso afirmativo, determinarlas. Cabe resaltar que realizar un análisis de este tipo puede presentar problemas en tanto las condiciones de ambos territorios difieren de manera considerable. Con el fin de subsanar este problema, las posibles deficiencias encontradas para el país suramericano se evalúan bajo las posibilidades otorgadas por su propio contexto y no por las condiciones que pudieron ser establecidas en Singapur. El análisis de este trabajo se limita únicamente a las siguientes tres perspectivas: histórica, gubernamental y cultural, en tanto estas dimensiones, a juicio del autor, arrojan por sí mismas resultados interesantes de la fase ISI de la economía colombiana y proveen información suficiente para que el lector se familiarice con el proceso de sustitución de importaciones en Colombia, sus fortalezas, desaciertos y consecuencias en materia económica.
Z10|Folklore|Folklore is the collection of traditional beliefs, customs, and stories of a community, passed through the generations by word of mouth. This vast expressive body, studied by the corresponding discipline of folklore, has evaded the attention of economists. In this study we do four things that reveal the tremendous potential of this corpus for understanding comparative development and culture. First, we introduce and describe a unique catalogue of folklore that codes the presence of thousands of motifs for roughly 1,000 pre-industrial societies. Second, we use a dictionary-based approach to elicit group-specific measures of various traits related to the natural environment, institutional framework, and mode of subsistence. We establish that these proxies are in accordance with the ethnographic record, and illustrate how to use a group’s oral tradition to quantify non-extant characteristics of preindustrial societies. Third, we use folklore to uncover the historical cultural values of a group. Doing so allows us to test various influential conjectures among social scientists including the original affluent society, the culture of honor among pastoralists, the role of family in extended kinship systems and the intensity of trade and rule-following norms in politically centralized group. Finally, we explore how cultural norms inferred via text analysis of oral traditions predict contemporary attitudes and beliefs.
Z10|Bite and Divide: Malaria and Ethnolinguistic Diversity|We investigate the epidemiological origins of ethnic diversity and its persistence. First, we conceptualize the role of malaria for the incentives to voluntary isolation in a Malthusian environment. The theory predicts that interactions in multiple geographically clustered groups with high sexual endogamy allowed limiting disease prevalence and increasing group fitness in pre-modern populations exposed to malaria. Second, using disaggregate level data, we document the hitherto unexplored and robust role of malaria for pre-colonial, historical and contemporaneous ethnic diversity in Africa. Third, falsification tests based on malaria epidemiology and history further allow us to validate the specific predictions of the model. No effect can be detected for other placebo vector-borne diseases. Malaria is a main driver of pre-colonial ethnic diversity in Africa but not in the Americas, where the pathogen was absent before European colonization. Fourth, the effect of ancestral malaria on endogamic cultures is the main predicted channel for the persistence of African ethnicities. Exploiting within village variation across 18 African countries, we find that ancestral malaria, but not malaria today, still affects the differential persistence of ethnicities through its legacy of active endogamic cultures.
Z10|Cultural Transmission with Incomplete Information: Parental Perceived Efficacy and Group Misrepresentation|This paper introduces incomplete information in the standard model of cultural transmission (Bisin and Verdier, 2001). We allow parents to ignore own group size and the efficiency of their cultural transmission technology, while receiving a feedback from their children. Using the selfcon_rming equilibrium concept, parents may end up to sustain, and be confirmed about, wrong conjectures. We show that in equilibrium optimal socialization efforts display cultural complementarity with respect to own population share, while the standard substitution result holds with respect their own conjectured population shares. Considering the population dynamics, if conjectures about population shares are shaped by cultural leaders who want to maximize the presence of own traits in the next period, then conjectures are characterized by negative biases. Our main finding is that, depending on the magnitude of the bias, the dynamics can display stable or unstable polymorphic equilibria, or just a stable homomorphic equilibrium, potentially reverting standard predictions
Z10|On extreme perception bias|This preliminary note investigates perception bias: To what extent do individual opinions confound reality? We estimate the relative gap between self-declared estimates and real data. We asked a sample of Philippine respondents about the incidence of diabetes and smartphone usage in their country. We observed a trend of judgement miscalibration. Responses exhibit significant deviation from facts, e.g. inaccuracies can go as high as seven times the real value. Especially for estimates on smartphone ownership, bootstrapped quantile regression models show that perception bias is associated with age.
Z10|Country-specific preferences and employment rates in Europe|European countries exhibit significant differences in employment rates of adult males. Differences in average labor-leisure preferences, determined by cultural values that vary across countries, can be responsible for part of these differences. However, differences in labor market institutions, productivity, and skills of the labor force are also crucial factors and likely correlated with preferences. In this paper we use variation among first- and second-generation European migrants to isolate the effect of culturally determined labor-leisure preferences on individual employment rates. If migrants maintain some of their country of origin labor-leisure preferences as they move to different labor market conditions, we can separate the impact of these culturally determined preferences from the effect of other factors. We find that country-specific labor-leisure preferences explain about 24% of the top-bottom variation in employment rates across European countries.
Z10|Old Sins Cast Long Shadows: The Long-Term Impact of the Resettlement of the Sudetenland on Residential Migration|We analyze the long-term impact of the resettlement of the Sudetenland after World War II on residential migration. This event involved expulsion of ethnic Germans and almost complete depopulation of an area of a country and its rapid resettlement by 2 million Czech inhabitants. Results based on nearest neighbor matching and regression discontinuity design show a higher population churn in resettled areas that continues today. The populations in resettled areas and in the remainder of the country share similar values and do not differ statistically in terms of their propensity to give donations, attend social events, and participate in voluntary work. However, we observe that resettled settlements have fewer local club memberships, lower turnout in municipal elections, and less frequently organized social events. This finding indicates substantially lower local social capital in the resettled settlements that is likely to have caused higher residential migration. This explanation is consistent with theoretical models of the impact of social capital on migration decisions.
Z10|Conflicting Identities: Cosmopolitan or Anxious? Appreciating Concerns of Host Country Population Improves Attitudes Towards Immigrants|This paper connects insights from the literature on cosmopolitan values in political science, anxiety in social psychology, and identity economics in a vignette-style experiment. We asked German respondents about their attitudes towards a Syrian refugee, randomizing components of his description (N=662). The main treatment describes the refugee as being aware of and empathetic towards potential Germans' worries about cultural change, costs and violence associated with refugee inflows. This increases reported levels of sympathy and trust substantially, especially for risk averse people. We argue that acknowledging concerns of the host population relieves the tension between an anxious and a cosmopolitan part of peoples' identities. When one aspect of identity is already acknowledged (expressing anxieties) it has less influence on actual behavior (expressing sympathy). In addition, we find that previous contact with foreigners and a higher willingness to take risks are important factors to determine an individual's willingness to interact with refugees.
Z10|Those Who Stayed: Individualism, Self-Selection and Cultural Change during the Age of Mass Migration|This paper examines the joint evolution of emigration and individualism in Scandinavia during the Age of Mass Migration (1850-1920). A long-standing hypothesis holds that people of a stronger individualistic mindset are more likely to migrate as they suffer lower costs of abandoning existing social networks. Building on this hypothesis, I propose a theory of cultural change where migrant self-selection generates a relative push away from individualism, and towards collectivism, in migrantsending locations through a combination of initial distributional e¤ects and channels of intergenerational cultural transmission. Due to the interdependent relationship between emigration and individualism, emigration is furthermore associated with cultural convergence across subnational locations. I combine various sources of empirical data, including historical population census records and passenger lists of emigrants, and test the relevant elements of the proposed theory at the individual and subnational district level, and in the short and long run. Together, the empirical results suggest that individualists were more likely to migrate than collectivists, and that the Scandinavian countries would have been considerably more individualistic and culturally diverse, had emigration not taken place.
Z10|How Does UNESCO's Convention on Cultural Diversity Affect Trade in Cultural Goods?|The role of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)'s Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (or the Convention on Cultural Diversity (CCD) for short) has been debated by both experts in international trade law and economists. However, the empirical study presented herein is the first in this body of the literature to investigate the relationship between the CCD and trade in cultural goods. By using trade data for 2004-2010 and employing the first-differenced difference-in-differences method, we seek to clarify its relation with trade in cultural goods by conducting a medium-term assessment. Our estimation results provide no evidence that the CCD works as an instrument of disguised protectionism. Further, we find that CCD contracting countries tend to have increased the extensive margins of cultural imports for some subcategories of cultural goods more than CCD non-contracting countries. This implies that the CCD has contributed to the promotion of cultural diversity.
Z10|Old sins cast long shadows: The Long-term impact of the resettlement of the Sudetenland on residential|We analyze the long-term impact of the resettlement of the Sudetenland after World War~II on residential migration. This event involved expulsion of ethnic Germans and almost complete depopulation of an area of a country and its rapid resettlement by 2 million Czech inhabitants. Results based on nearest neighbor matching and regression discontinuity design show a higher population churn in resettled areas that continues today. The populations in resettled areas and in the remainder of the country share similar values and do not differ statistically in terms of their propensity to give donations, attend social events, and participate in voluntary work. However, we observe that resettled settlements have fewer local club memberships, lower turnout in municipal elections, and less frequently organized social events. This finding indicates substantially lower local social capital in the resettled settlements that is likely to have caused higher residential migration. This explanation is consistent with theoretical models of the impact of social capital on migration decisions.
Z10|Change and Persistence in the Age of Modernization: Saint-Germain-d'Anxure 1730-1895|Using a unique, comprehensive household-level dataset for a single French village from 1730 to 1895, we study the process of modernization during a period of rapid institutional and demographic transformation. We document changes in fertility, mortality, human capital and intergenerational mobility, looking for structural breaks associated with the French Revolution and paying close attention to the sequencing of changes associated with various aspects of modernization in the village. We find that the fall in fertility preceded the rise in education by several decades. Demographic change is plausibly associated with institutional and cultural change rather than with changes in the opportunity cost of children. The rise in education occurred mostly as the result of an increase in the supply of schooling due to the Guizot Law, rather than demand side forces. All these changes occurred in the absence of industrialization in and around the village. We conclude that institutional and cultural changes originating outside the village were likely the dominant forces explaining its modernization.
Z10|The Effects of Income Transparency on Well-Being: Evidence from a Natural Experiment|In 2001, Norwegian tax records became easily accessible online, allowing everyone in the country to observe the incomes of everyone else. According to the income comparisons model, this change in transparency can widen the gap in well-being between richer and poorer individuals. We test this hypothesis using survey data from 1985–2013. Using multiple identification strategies, we show that the higher transparency increased the gap in happiness between richer and poorer individuals by 29%, and it increased the life satisfaction gap by 21%. We provide suggestive evidence that some, although probably not all, of this effect relates to changes in self-perceptions of relative income. We provide back-of-the-envelope estimates of the importance of income comparisons, and discuss implications for the ongoing debate on transparency policies.
Z10|John Howard, constitutive politics and overlapping consensus|All political leaders in liberal democracies engage in â€œconstitutive politicsâ€ . However there is a qualitative difference between a constitutive politics centered on liberal values and one centered on conservative or populist commitments. This paper seeks to explore John Howardâ€™s political identity during his period as Australian Prime Minister by examining the extent to which his constitutive politics took on liberal, conservative or populist dimensions. The paper will show that although Howard embraced, at various times, all three ideologies, with all of the tensions and conflicts involved, his political identity cannot be reduced to any one of them, nor to an underlying electoral pragmatism. In this respect, John Howardâ€™s political identity is far more complex than has ordinarily been assumed.
Z10|John Gray, value pluralism and the limits of universalism|In a feitschrift celebrating the thought of the political philosopher John Gray, published in 2007, Gray is described as â€œone of the most challenging and controversial political theorists in the English-speaking world.â€ Perhaps this is due to his contrariness. Gray likes nothing better, it seems, than to swim against a philosophical tide.
Z10|Liberalism, conservatism and contested boundaries|Within contemporary liberal democracies, the relationship between liberalism and conservatism is a contested one. Some political parties, seeking to challenge a more egalitarian left-wing tradition, have sought to combine both within their political agenda. This article uses a debate between two professional politicians, George Brandis and John Howard, concerning the relationship between liberalism and conservatism, and the respective place of these political traditions within the Liberal Party of Australia, as the impetus for an investigation of both political traditions and the extent to which each are compatible as political philosophies. The discussion extends to an investigation of key liberal political philosophers - John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, Friedrich von Hayek and James Buchanan. We shall see that these thinkers split on the extent to which liberalism is capable of incorporating conservative principles, thereby revealing the contested boundaries of the liberal tradition. As a result of this investigation, we shall see that the liberal tradition is in fact far more plural, and at times less individualist, than some of its most rigorous proponents proclaim.
Z10|Keating, Howard and constitutive politics: splitting the difference|Paul Keating and John Howard, as Australian Prime Ministers, were architects of some of the most profound changes in the Australian polity of the last thirty years. This article engages with recent accounts of their terms of office which have insisted that the continuities between these two very different Prime Ministers are far more significant than their differences, one even going so far as to claim that they contributed to a single â€œAustralian projectâ€ . This paper insists that such a view misses what is most significant in any comparative perspective on Howard and Keating â€“ their â€œconstitutive politicsâ€ - and therefore misses what is essential to their immense impact on Australia. It also misses how each, via their â€œconstitutive politicsâ€ , contested Australiaâ€™s relationship to the United Kingdom in the most fundamental terms.
Z10|Howard, nation and identity: from overlapping consensus to citizenship test|The very longevity of John Howardâ€™s period in office means that we often forget to what extent his electoral success from 1996 to 2007 transformed the fortunes of the Liberal Party of Australia. We can regain a sense of this if we re-read the opening chapter of Gerard Hendersonâ€™s book, Menziesâ€™ Child, published in 1994, a year prior to John Howardâ€™s resumption of the Liberal leadership and two years prior to his electoral victory in 1996. When Henderson published this book, the Liberal Party had been out of national office for eleven years, and the very bleakness of their plight resonated in his prose. Henderson argued that the problem that beset the Liberal Party was one of leadership. Not that leadership was absent, but rather that it dominated the party â€“ that the Liberals had a â€œleadership fixationâ€ or a â€œMessiah complexâ€ .
Z10|Kant, providence, and the 'guarantee' of progress|Kantâ€™s conception of providence is often thought to occupy an anomalous position relative to his critical philosophy. Scholars have differed on whether it is consistent or inconsistent with his wider philosophical position. This article seeks to provide an explanation of Kantâ€™s desire to view human history in terms of providence â€“ and argues this arises both as a result of his Enlightenment commitments and his previous commitment to theodicy. It also considers the question of whether Kantâ€™s postulation of providence is consistent with his wider critical philosophy.
Z10|Paul Keating, John Howard and the 'crimson thread of kinship'|In 1890, the Australian colonial politician, Henry Parkes, referred to the 'crimson thread of kinship' which he believed bound Australians to the United Kingdom. Within an increasingly multicultural Australia, situated within the Asia-Pacific region, such ties to the United Kingdom might be thought an anachronistic aspect of Australia's past. Yet in the 1990s and 2000s, two Australian Prime Ministers, who shared sixteen years of office between them, placed Australia's relationship to the United Kingdom at the centre of their respective political agendas, and at the core of their engagement with each other. This article seeks to investigate why this aspect of Australia's past took on such a contemporary importance during the Prime Ministerships of Paul Keating and John Howard, and focuses on the discursive strategies each Prime Minister adopted to render the 'crimson thread' such a salient feature of the Australian political landscape.
Z10|Liberty, toleration and persecution: Locke, Mill and the liberal tradition|Although completing their major work over one hundred and fifty years apart, John Locke and John Stuart Mill are two seminal figures in the development of the liberal tradition. However some recent commentators have seen Mill as far more at home in this tradition than Locke, even presenting key aspects of Lockeâ€™s political philosophy as having distinctly anti-liberal implications centered on persecution. This paper challenges this view and, in fact, reverses it, insisting that it is the seventeenth century figure of Locke who is far more compatible with what we now understand as the liberal tradition than his illustrious Victorian successor.
Z10|Locke, church and state: Stanley Fish's impossible mission|Stanley Fishâ€™s critique of liberalism is a challenging one. This paper seeks to show how Fishâ€™s most comprehensive attempt to deconstruct the liberal tradition is subject to fundamental flaws due to Fishâ€™s failure to come to grips with the very foundations of liberalism itself. In particular, Fish places great emphasis on the seventeenth century English philosopher, John Locke, as the inaugurator of the basic â€œcontradictionâ€ to which, he believes, liberalism is beset. This paper shows that Fish has fundamentally misunderstood Locke and therefore has misunderstood the â€œcontradictionâ€ which he believes Lockeâ€™s political philosophy inaugurates for liberalism. Ultimately therefore, Fishâ€™s broad challenge to liberalism, which he has also pursued in other writings, is weakened by the fact that what he perceives to be the root of the liberal problem was not present within the roots of liberalism at all.
Z10|Universalism, liberalism and value pluralism|This paper seeks to deal with the challenges which non-liberal values and practices, particularly religious ones, raise for contemporary liberal democracies. As a means to this end, it focuses on the latest ramifications of the Danish Cartoons Affair and the capacity of various schools of thought within contemporary political philosophy to provide a way forward on this issue. One of the obvious features of the direct confrontation between faith-based outlooks and more secular positions within contemporary liberal democracies is the gulf of incommensurability that often divides the two, with neither side being able to advance arguments which are reasonable or understandable within the terms of the other. I define such a confrontation as a â€œclash of world viewsâ€ (it being a narrower, and slightly less contentious, concept than a â€œclash of civilizationsâ€ ). Such a â€œclashâ€ occurs when each side believes â€œultimateâ€ issues to be at stake, since in such contexts, neither can concede ground to the other without also conceding something definitive (and therefore non-negotiable) in their own world view. As JÃ¼rgen Habermas tells us: â€œUnlike theories, worldviews have the power to structure a whole life.â€ (Habermas 2003a, p. 227). Not everyone possesses such a â€œworld viewâ€ , but those that do are liable to see certain issues as being fundamental to the integrity of the world view itself, and so of the first and last importance, on which no concession can be given. It is around these issues that a â€œclashâ€ is possible, often in the most agonistic terms, endangering liberalismâ€™s basic rules of civil coexistence in the process.
Z10|Repeated shocks and preferences for redistribution| A society that believes wealth to be determined by random “luck” rather than by merit, demands more redistribution. The theoretical literature shows that any increase in the volatility of income caused by unpredictable adverse shocks implies a higher support for redistribution. We present evidence of this behavior by exploiting a natural experiment provided by the L’Aquila earthquake in 2009, which hit a large area of Central Italy through a series of destructive shakes over eight days. Matching detailed information on the ground acceleration registered during each shock with survey data about individual opinions on redistribution we show that the average intensity of the shakes is associated with subsequent stronger beliefs that, for a society to be fair, income inequalities should be levelled by redistribution. The shocks, however, are not all alike. We find that only the last three shakes - occurred on the fourth and the eighth day of the earthquake - have a statistically significant impact. Overall, we find that the timing and repetition of the shock play a role in shaping redistributive preferences. Revision posted January 24, 2019. A previous version of this paper circulated under the title “Natural disasters and demand for redistribution: lessons from an earthquake”.
Z10|Spatial spillovers of the cultural employment growth in Brazilian municipalities|The Brazilian cultural sector is rarely explored in the literature, especially considering all municipalities at the same time in an economic and spatial perspective. This paper aims to measure the level of specialization, urbanization and diversification externalities on the cultural employment growth rate in Brazilian municipalities between 2006 and 2016. To do so, spatial econometric models are used. The main results indicate there are no spatial associations regarding cultural employment growth in Brazil. The lack of complementarity of this sector, associate with the lack of incentives for its development, particularly in small municipalities, helps to explain our results.
Z10|Spatial dependence in museum services: An analysis of the Italian case|In this paper we investigate whether the services offered by museums are affected by the choices of neighbors, and we discuss whether the evidence can document that competition processes are at work. Specifically, we take into account the Italian case, where governmental and private museums co-exist. Resorting to Spatial Autoregressive Models, we show that a significant influence of neighbors’ choice concerning service supply does emerge. However, we cast several doubts that this piece of evidence can be solely due to sound competition among museums.
Z10|Диверсификсация Российской Экономики За Счет Углубления Переработки Углеводородов: Проблема Индикативного Планирования<BR>[Diversification of Russian Economy by Deepening Hydrocarbon Processing: a Problem of Indicative Planning]|Basing on the ideas of indicative planning, we propose an approach to the diversification of the Russian economy by deepening the hydrocarbon processing. We justify the expediency of forming a system of interrelated projects that ensure the improvement of technology and expansion of output in a set of productions, and analyze promising areas of development of such projects. The connection of the proposed approach with the concept of value chains is considered. The options of institutional organization of the processes of formation and implementation of a system of projects are discussed.
Z10|Love of Novelty: A Source of Innovation-Based Growth... or Underdevelopment Traps?|This study develops a new innovation-based growth model to explore the role of people's love of novelty in innovation and innovation-based growth. The model considers (a) an infinitely lived representative consumer who has the standard love-of-variety preferences for differentiated products and extra love-of-novelty preferences for new products and (b) technological progress driven by two costly and time-consuming innovation activities, new product development and existing product development. We demonstrate that if the consumer's love-of-novelty preference is moderate, new and existing product development alternately occur on an equilibrium path, whereby the economy achieves innovation and long-run growth, through cycles. However, if the love of novelty is too strong or too weak, the economy is caught in an underdevelopment trap with less innovation and no long-run growth. Our results suggest that the love of novelty is a source of innovation-based growth, but can become a cause of underdevelopment traps if too strong.
Z10|Festivals and destination marketing: An application from Izmir City|Festivals are among the growing global city and destination attraction factors and they are very trendy. Studies indicate that there is a direct relationship between the successful organizations of festivals and the number of visitors and tourism income of a city destination. Thus, festival marketing efforts usually have a direct impact on city marketing efforts. Due to this fact, the study tries to figure out the festival marketing potential of Izmir city that seems to lag behind the general tourism development pattern of Turkey contrary to the great potential it has. The study comprises of two main sections, first one being a literature review on festival marketing, followed by the second section on a qualitative research on Izmir’s festivals and their marketing potential. It tries to determine the positive impacts of Izmir’s festivals on destination marketing and by grouping and categorizing them under similar characteristics figuring out the most promising ones. The research consists of four open-ended interview questions on festivals held in Izmir city. As practical implications, Destination Management Organizations, Destination Marketing Organizations, destination and city marketers, festival managers and destination tourism developers may benefit from the findings of this study.
Z10|An attitude of complexity: thirteen essays on the nature and construction of reality under the challenge of Zeno's Paradox|This book is about the construction of reality. The central aim of this study is to understand how gravity works and how it may be focused and manipulated. While I do not have an answer to this question, the discoveries along the way have been worth collecting into a single volume for future reference.
Z10|On Trust Dynamics of Economic Growth|Trust among individuals in society may have various economic and social implications. Though, worldwide data on economic growth rarely consider trust as an ingredient in manipulating economic outcomes. Thus, we include trust instigating from individual, affecting community and state thus, forming trust-based economy. In order to explore the relationship of trust with growth and its benefits implications, this study suggests a model which is validated by Markov process. Consequently, results indicate significant impact of trust on economic growth by achieving convergence in very few iterations in the case of trust-based economy. On the other hand, economy with lowest trust level shows delayed convergence and takes around 4 times more iterations to attain equilibrium. Additionally, socio-economic benefits are more visible in a trust-based economy.
Z10|Economic development through halal tourism|Tourism is a potential sector in the world. The increasing number of tourist destinations and investments has encouraged this sector to become a major factor in foreign exchange earnings, employment, and business and infrastructure development. At present, halal tourism (halal tourism) is becoming a world trend. This is in line with the increase in the number of Muslim tourists from year to year. This article will review the concept of halal tourism, potential, and halal tourism as an alternative to economic development.
Z10|"""Gold Miss"" or ""Earthy Mom""? Evidence from Thailand"|"This paper investigates the impact of Thai women's education on their marriage behavior and fertility. It first uses the panel data set from the Socio-Economic Survey to estimate the effect of education on the marriage market. The result from applying the individual fixed effect estimation indicates that obtaining a university degree decreases the probability of women's marriage, emphasizing the rise of the ""Gold Miss"" phenomenon in Thailand. The cross-sectional data set from the Labor Force Survey examines the effect of education on fertility. By applying both the instrumental variable using the compulsory education reform as an instrument and pseudo-panel approaches to take into account the endogeneity of schooling, the result shows that education causally reduces fertility, which provides a convincing sequential explanation for the dramatic decline in fertility in Thailand."
Z10|Effects of Hofstede?s Cultural Factors and Commitment on IJV Performance in ASEAN Country of Thailand|This study focuses on the effect of Hofstede?s cultural characteristics and commitment on international joint ventures (IJVs) performance in the Southeast Asian country context. The study has been provided the unpublished database of international joint venture (IJV) firms operating in Thailand from Thailand Board of Investment. The mail survey via questionnaire has been used as data collection method to obtain data from 89 target respondents, IJV managers. OLS regression is the main data analysis method of the study. The results indicate that all Hofstede?s cultural characteristics of IJV managers have no direct significant effect on awareness of IJV importance, but individualism and power distance have been found the significant effect on commitment. Uncertainty avoidance and power distance directly and positively impact on team performance. Interestingly, power distance has negatively effect on the IJV performance. In addition, the study can find the partial mediating effect of awareness of IJV importance mediating the association between Hofstede?s cultural characteristics and commitment, however, the moderating role of team commonality cannot be found. These results suggest that effective IJV managers have to effectively and efficiently manage the relationships, attempt to boost the commitment and the awareness of IJV importance, and robustly synergize the strengths among managers that come from different cultural background in order to successfully create better coordination and performance for organization.
Z10|Voice at Work|In the first large-scale study on voice, audio data on lawyers at the top U.S. law firmsâ€“a male dominated work environmentâ€“show that female lawyers alternate between two voice frequency modes: a primary female mode at about 200 Hz as well as a secondary female mode at about 100 Hz that is coextensive with the primary (and only) male voice frequency mode. This tendency is stronger among female associates than among female partners, and does not replicate for male lawyers or female assistants. Evidence of differences driven by firm heterogeneity is comparatively insignificant, indicating market-wide trends in workplace behavior.
Z10|Non-Bayesian Social Learning and the Spread of Misinformation in Networks|People are exposed to a constant flow of information about economic, social and political phenomena; nevertheless, misinformation is ubiquitous in the society. This paper studies the spread of misinformation in a social environment where agents receive new information each period and update their opinions taking into account both their experience and neighborhood's ones. I consider two types of misinformation: permanent and temporary. Permanent misinformation is modeled with the presence of stubborn agents in the network and produces long-run effects on the agents learning process. The distortion induced by stubborn agents in social learning depends on the “updating centrality”, a novel centrality measure that identifies the key agents of a social learning process, and generalizes the Katz-Bonacich measure. Conversely, temporary misinformation, represented by shocks of rumors or fake news, has only short-run effects on the opinion dynamics. Results rely on spectral graph theory and show that the consensus among agents is not always a sign of successful learning. In particular, the consensus time is increasing with respect to the “bottleneckedness” of the underlying network, while the learning time is decreasing with respect to agents' reliance on their private signals.
Z10|Cultural Transmission with Incomplete Information: Parental Perceived Efficacy and Group Misrepresentation|This paper introduces incomplete information in the standard model of cultural transmission (Bisin and Verdier, 2001). We allow parents to ignore own group size and the efficiency of their cultural transmission technology, while receiving a feedback from their children. Using the selfconfirming equilibrium concept, parents may end up to sustain, and be confirmed about, wrong conjectures. We show that in equilibrium optimal socialization efforts display cultural complementarity with respect to own population share, while the standard substitution result holds with respect their own conjectured population shares. Considering the population dynamics, if conjectures about population shares are shaped by cultural leaders who want to maximize the presence of own traits in the next period, then conjectures are characterized by negative biases. Our main finding is that, depending on the magnitude of the bias, the dynamics can display stable or unstable polymorphic equilibria, or just a stable homomorphic equilibrium, potentially reverting standard predictions.
Z10|Economic preferences and trade outcomes|Utilizing the new Global Preference Survey (GPS) by Falk et al. (2018) and its data of unique scope on national preference structures in patience, risk attitude, reciprocity, trust and altruism, we are the first to explore a potential in uence on international trade outcomes of this broad set of economic and social preferences in a unified setting. Adding to the evidence on preferences' importance for aggregate outcomes, we find distinct relationships between national preference leanings and marked differences in trade ows and relationships, both on the country-level and between bilateral partners. Our main results suggest that countries differing in their willingness to behave negatively reciprocal tend to trade significantly less amongst each other, while countries that are patient or risk-averse tend to shift towards exporting more differentiated goods as opposed to homogeneous goods and vice versa.
Z10|Does music quality matter for audience voters in a music contest?|"There are numerous studies analyzing factors of success in media-broadcasted artistic contests, especially music competitions. However, one factor that is generally neglected in the literature is the quality of the artistic performances (i.e. ""music quality""). In this paper, we approach this research gap by developing two novel concepts of music quality and by employing unique measures during the empirical analysis of a popular German music television contest in order to analyze how different dimensions of the music and performance quality influences the final voting results. We use the complete historical voting dataset of the music contest from its inception in 2005 until its last broadcast in 2015, collecting 2,816 observations in total. First, we define dimensions of ""objective quality"" according to insights from musicological research/literature. Second, we conceptualize dimensions of ""subjective quality"" because music preferences may be subjective and are not necessarily based on how experts' define ""good"" music. We measure these subjective dimensions in an experimental setting with students from two German universities. Our analysis shows that different quality dimensions affect the outcome of voting results in different ways and not all quality dimensions reveal themselves as significant. In general, subjective quality dimensions turn out to be more relevant than objective ones. The differentiated results of our analysis support the value of our approach to deconstruct quality into different dimensions and test them individually."
Z10|Stars in social media: New light through old windows?|We review the economics of superstars, originally developed for stars in traditional media, and discuss whether they are applicable for the (allegedly) novel phenomenon of stars in social media (influencer, micro-celebrities). Moreover, we analyse potentially new factors for creating social media superstardom that may be special to the nature of social media. Our overall result is that the economics of superstars, like the role of talent, market concentration effects, MacDonald-style and Adler-style effects, remain applicable and relevant for social media stars. In line with this assessment, we find that several (allegedly) new star factors in social media, like user-generated content, prosumption, disappearance of gatekeepers and authenticity, turn out to be only partly applicable or just slightly different to traditional concepts. However, algorithm management and upload strategies represent novel success factors relevant for social media superstardom that are not captured by traditional superstar theories.
Z10|Do behaviours in cultural markets affect economic resilience? An analysis of Italian regions| The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relation between the economic resilience and cultural behaviour, resorting to the evidence provided by 20 Italian regions at the time of Great Recession. We consider specific cultural behaviours, which provide a specific meaning of culture; its relation with the economic resilience of regions is analysed. We document that higher levels of supplied and demanded quantity of cultural goods in a region are associated with higher regional economic resilience as measured by the ability of limiting employment drop; the relation with the considered cultural behaviours is weaker in the case of economic resilience as measured by the ability of limiting income drop. We propose possible explanations for this asymmetry.
Z10|Autocratic Rule and Social Capital: Evidence from Imperial China|This paper explores the impact of autocratic rule on social capital—defined as the beliefs, attitudes, norms and perceptions that support cooperation. Political repression is a distinguishing characteristic of autocratic regimes. Between 1660–1788, individuals in imperial China were persecuted if they were suspected of holding subversive attitudes towards the state. A difference-in-differences approach suggests that in an average prefecture, exposure to those literary inquisitions led to a decline of 38% in local charities—a key proxy of social capital. Consistent with the historical panel results, we find that in affected prefectures, individuals have lower levels of generalized trust in modern China. Taking advantage of institutional variation in 20th c. China, and two instrumental variables, we provide further evidence that political repression permanently reduced social capital. Furthermore, we find that individuals in prefectures with a legacy of literary inquisitions ar are more politically apathetic. These results indicate a potential vicious cycle in which autocratic rule becomes self-reinforcing through causing a permanent decline in social capital.
Z10|The Origins of the Division of Labor in Pre-modern Times|This research explores the historical roots of the division of labor in pre-modern societies. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that intra-ethnic diversity had a positive effect on the division of labor across ethnicities in the pre-modern era. Exploiting a variety of identification strategies and a novel ethnic level dataset combining geocoded ethnographic, linguistic and genetic data, it establishes that higher levels of intra-ethnic diversity were conducive to economic specialization in the pre-modern era. The findings are robust to a host of geographical, institutional, cultural and historical confounders, and suggest that variation in intra-ethnic diversity is the main predictor of the division of labor in pre-modern times.
Z10|Historical Conflict and Gender Disparities|This paper establishes the detrimental effect of historical conflict on contemporary gender disparities. Such effects appear to be absent when focusing on female labor participation, revealing that long-run determinants of women’s positioning do not opperate solely through labor outcomes. Further, a historical compilation of Mexican conflicts was digitized and geo-referenced to establish the persistence of such results at a subnational level. Causal estimates are achieved at this level by exploiting exogenous changes introduced by the Columbian exchange and by long-run reductions in precipitation. Finally, the document examines gender views of US respondents and of second-generation migrants in Europe to show that culture constiutes a mechanism through which gender biases emerge and consolidate.
Z10|Marcel Mauss und ökonomische Theorien: Die Institution Geld<BR>[Marcel Mauss and Economic Theories: The Institution of Money]|This paper puts Marcel Mauss’s concept on money in the context of economic theories. Mauss articulated his thoughts on money in the first decades of the 20th century. They are considerably less known and discussed than his famous essay on ‘the gift’. Nevertheless, his contributions on the origin and function of money are worth being examined in economics as well as in economic-anthropological discourse. This essay relates Mauss’s ideas to microeconomic theories. The argument pursued is that his concepts on money are both compatible with neoclassical, and with New Institutional Economic theories. For this purpose, the text addresses three parallels.
Z10|Simulation of Spar Type Floating Offshore Wind Turbine Subjected to Misaligned Wind-Wave Loading Using Conservation of Momentum Method|Floating wind turbines are subjected to stochastic wind and wave loadings. Wind and wave loadings are not essentially aligned. The misalignment between wind and wave loadings affects the dynamical response of the floating wind turbines which needs to be studied. For this purpose, the nonlinear equations of motion of the spar-type floating wind turbine is derived using the Newton’s second law and conservation of angular momentum theory. The aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, mooring and buoyancy forces are determined and coupled with the system. The dynamic responses of the system are calculated and compared for different wind-wave misalignment angles. The simulation results demonstrate the importance of consideration of wind-wave misalignment angle on the dynamic response for the floating offshore wind turbine.
Z10|Family Ties and Corruption|We construct a model to examine the relation between family ties and corruption. The overall effect of strong family ties on the incentive to be corrupt can be ambiguous due to the presence of conflicting mechanisms. The model also shows that the measure of family ties can be crucial in determining its observed effect on corruption, thus offering a theoretical foundation on why the empirical outcomes entailing cross-country comparisons can differ from the outcomes of micro-level empirical investigations. This aspect of the theoretical framework is verified by our empirical analysis: Using micro-level data, we show that, in contrast to conventional wisdom and cross-country comparisons, stronger family ties reduce the approval for a broad set of activities that measure corruption.
Z10|The causes of political misperceptions: Suggestions for research|The extent of misperceptions of political events and developments is assumed to be largely determined by the rate of press freedom characterizing each country (Reporters sans frontiers, RSF, 2018). Following that argument, only about one third of all countries worldwide would turn out to be in a good (Scandinavia, Germany) or satisfactory (the US, the UK, Canada and Australia) situation (see Appendix). Recent research on misperceptions suggests that the freedom of press may be a necessary but not necessarily a sufficient condition of measurement. More decisive than freedom of press are two further factors, namely deep-rooted ideological inclinations and worldviews as formed during primary (family) and subsequent (school) phases of socialization on the one hand, and the structure of media ownership on the other hand. In what follows, we present some recent evidence on how the ownership of the media (state/public/private) is influencing misperceptions. It is argued that state and private media distort public opinion more than the media under public control.
Z10|Measuring the effeciency of medical tourism industry in EU members states|Under the Directive 2011/24/EU, medical tourism and cross-border health are interrelated terms regarding the freedom to move to get the most accessible medical treatment into EU Member State within the defined procedures for reimbursement. Little known empirically regarding the efficiency of the cross-border health/medical tourism industry. This study aims to measure its efficiency in Europe for the years 2010-2014, by using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Data obtained from OECD and the European Core Health Indicators (ECHI), which is collecting the data through Eurostat. Eurostat collects data on health care activities and provides data on hospital discharges, including the hospital discharges of non-residents and these include hospital discharges of in-patients and day care patients. The analysis uses “DEA.P, 2.1 for windows” by Coelli (1996). The results show that the Members States health systems were very efficient in handling non-residents in-patients, however when managing day cases/outpatients the efficiency scores dropped. The findings would have significant associations affecting intentions to revisit clinics and the destination country. In addition, will be useful to those seeking a better understanding of the cross-border health and medical tourism industry efficiency. Extending the findings of the European Commission report (2015c) by examining how well medical tourists are informed about the decision they are making, would be of perceived value. These are important indicators at European level by helping each Member State to measure its medical tourism services.
Z10|Retrato de la pobreza económica en España diez años después del inicio de la crisis: Un análisis descriptivo, bivariante y logístico de la insuficiencia de ingresos en 2018<BR>[Economic poverty in Spain after a decade of crisis: A descriptive, bivariate and logistic analysis of the income insufficiency in 2018]|"Given the social and academic relevance recently aroused by the social stratification, this paper aims to carry out a synchronic analysis that will serve as a ""picture"" of the factors associated with economic poverty in Spain, after ten years have elapsed since beginning of the Great Depression. With this purpose, we start from a relative conception of poverty, which allows us to treat the relative income insufficiency in terms of “poor” and “non-poor”. Therefore, a profile of individuals with low income in Spain is obtained, to later expose the socioeconomic and demographic factors related to this phenomenon through a bivariate analysis and several logistic regression models. Ultimately, our results show that there is no direct relationship between poverty and residence in the north or in the south of Spain, although the data show an association between it and other individual factors such as age, educational level, professional and employment situation or productive sector."
Z10|Religious & Cultural Leaders| This paper surveys the existing literature on religious and cultural leaders. It discusses potential motivations of a leader and highlights that irrespective of his/her exact motivations, the presence of a leader is crucial for the cultural heterogeneity of a society. The impact of discrimination and government transfers on cultural integration is discussed. Last, the survey examines when religious and cultural leaders emerge.
Z10|Tat will tell: Tattoos and time preferences|Forty percent of Americans under the age of 40 have at least one tattoo. Yet survey and experimental evidence suggests that the tattooed are viewed negatively and may face discrimination in the labor market and in commercial transactions. In view of the potentially adverse economic consequences of a tattoo, the decision to get one may be regarded as shortsighted and impulsive. We collect numerous measures of time preferences and impulsivity of tattooed and non-tattooed subjects and find broad-ranging and robust evidence that those with tattoos, especially visible ones, are more short-sighted and impulsive than the non-tattooed. Almost nothing mitigates these results, neither the motive for the tattoo, nor the time contemplated before getting tattooed, nor the time elapsed since the most recent tattoo. Even the expressed intention to get a(nother) tattoo predicts increased short-sightedness and helps to pin down the direction of causality between tattoos and short-sightedness.
Z10|Bullying and harassment in sport: overview of management instruments|Relevance of research. An aspiration to manage bullying and harassment in sport is a part of wider international issues there are solved ethics and integration of such problems as usage of doping, manipulation of competition, safety of events and fair game organization (Mountjoy et al, 2015; Maffulli, 2007; Brackenridge et al, 2011; Kainz, 2015; etc.). The behavior of sport?s leaders and even athletes themselves, such as ignoring, not reacting, and resisting of bullying and harassment prevention, is a challenge while trying to implement bullying and harassment management instruments in sport. The refuse to recognize prevention of bullying and harassment supports the root causes of coercion (Mountjoy et al., 2016). This is an important reason primary concentrate on analyses of existing management instruments of bullying and harassment.Object of research is management instruments of bullying and harassment in sport.Purpose of the research is to make analyses of management instruments of bullying and harassment comparing application of prevention models in sport.Methods of research were scientific research analyses of bullying and harassment prevention programs and their application.Research results. Analyses and comparison of such prevention programs as Olweus Bullying Prevention, KiVa Anti-bullying, Positive behavior support (SW-PBS), Athletic coach-delivered (ARA/SV) prevention, harassment programs called ?Take care?, and ?Control program on study skills?, showed that just some of these programs are applied to sport. Research of prevention programs application showed that interactive prevention applying contemporary technologies such as internet, smart phone aps, etc., could be more effective prevention than personal prevention using personal meetings with participant of bullying and harassment prevention. Prevention programs of bullying and harassment should be adjusted separately to the bystanders, participants and victims including differences of gender perception. An important orientation is towards the perpetrator but not to the victim, since only the taken responsibility could help to stop the actions of antisocial behavior. The leaders of sport organizations must initiate and implement the management instruments of bullying and harassment. They supposed to provide training and constructive beliefs to take responsibility of the own behavior and harmoniously improve the changing culture of sport organization. Thus, the management instruments of bullying and harassment should include reviews of law enforcement strategies, culturally tailored training programs, and implement policy and procedures to sport community.Acknowledgement.

Z10|Geographical Origins of Language Structures |This research explores the geographical origins of the coevolution of cultural and linguistic traits in the course of human history, relating the geographical roots of long-term orientation to the structure of the future tense, the agricultural determinants of gender bias to the presence of sex-based grammatical gender, and the ecological origins of hierarchical orientation to the existence of politeness distinctions. The study advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that: (i) variations in geographical characteristics that were conducive to higher natural return to agricultural investment contributed to the existing cross-language variations in the structure of the future tense, (ii) the agricultural determinants of gender gap in agricultural productivity fostered the existence of sex-based grammatical gender, and (iii) the ecological origins of hierarchical societies triggered the emergence of politeness distinctions.

Z10|In God We Learn? The Universal Messages of Religions, their Context-Specific Effects, and the role of Minority Status|We test whether major religious denominations have a uniform impact on education across the world. Using individual data from the World Values Survey for 77 countries, we find that no denomination consistently influences education and, in fact, for each denomination we study there are countries where its impact is significantly positive, significantly negative, or statistically insignificant. To explain this unexpected result, we relate our first finding to minority status and find that denominations that are a minority in a country have a positive effect on the level of education of their followers in that country. Both findings uphold a series of robustness checks, including changing the definition of minority religions, excluding outliers, and changing the measure of education.
Z10|Using Ethical Dilemmas to predict Antisocial Choices with Real Payoff Consequences: an Experimental Study|Anti-social behaviours are costly to organizations, and the ability to identify predictors of such behaviours can be valuable. In this paper, we used a within-subjects laboratory design to study choices in the well-known (hypothetical) Trolley problem as well as in a real payoff moneyburning experiment that can inform our understanding of moral preferences and antisocial behavior. Choices in both environments respond to incentives (i.e., the relative price of the ethical decision). Trolley problem decisions are consistent with previously known results— individuals prefer no action over action, and they prefer to avoid direct over indirect responsibility when negative consequences would be similar in either instance. In analyzing the determinants of anti-social money burning, our data identify money burning due to inequality aversion, but we also find evidence of pure nastiness (burning money of others to increase one’s advantageous inequality). Importantly, we find that willingness to commit ethically dubious acts in the Trolley problem significantly predicts money burning and, more specifically, nastiness. We conclude that choices in hypothetical environments can predict consequential and inefficient antisocial behaviours. Also, utilitarian behaviour in the Trolley dilemma is not linked to antisocial money burning, which contrasts with conclusions in the literature. Key Words: experiments, money burning, ethical dilemmas, anti-social behavioral, trolley problem<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Z10|Genetic Diversity and Economic Development : Assessing the Key Findings in Ashraf and Galor (2013)|We replicate Ashraf and Galor (2013) and find that its conclusions concerning the association between human genetic diversity and economic development depend substantially on coding errors and sample selection. We correct the coding errors and add or update data on genetic diversity and population density from high-quality sources. We find little support for the hypothesis that variation in genetic diversity among subpopulations has a systematic relationship with economic development.
Z10|Personality traits, migration intentions, and cultural distance|Personality traits are influential in individual decision-making but have been overlooked in economic models of migration. This paper investigates the relation between Big Five personality traits and individuals’ migration intentions among alternative destinations that vary in their culture distance. We hypothesize that Big Five personality traits may alter individuals’ migration decision and destination choice through their influence on perceived psychic costs and benefits of migration. We test our hypotheses using the Fachkraft survey conducted among university students in Germany. We find that extraversion and openness are positively associated with migration intentions, while agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability negatively relate to migration intentions. We show that openness positively and extraversion negatively relate to the willingness to move to culturally distant countries even when we control for geographic distance and economic differences between countries. Using language as a cultural distance indicator provides evidence that extravert individuals are less likely to prefer linguistically distant countries while agreeable individuals are more inclined to consider such countries as alternative destinations.

Z10|Costly superstitious beliefs: Experimental evidence|Expectant parents experience a variety of emotions, including joy, anticipation as well as anxiety and fear related to the health of the fetus, the delivery and the newborn. These sources of uncertainty and stress render expectant mothers susceptible to the influence of popular beliefs. We design an experiment to evaluate the widespread Israeli belief that a baby’s room should remain unfurnished until after the baby is born. We test the impact of this belief on the economic decisions of pregnant Jewish women in Israel. Our findings show that many pregnant women, especially in the second half of pregnancy, prefer to avoid challenging popular beliefs – even at a financial cost. The negative affective consequences of “tempting fate” lead to a preference for a small monetary amount over new furniture for the newborn. The strength of popular beliefs and its influence on individual choice vary in accordance with ethnicity and degree of religiosity.
Z10|The truth about tattoos|Despite their ubiquity, tattoos continue to be associated with dishonesty. Notwithstanding, we find few differences in the reporting behavior of tattooed and non-tattooed individuals in either a low-stakes or a high-stakes honesty-detection task.
Z10|Long-lasting social capital and its impact on economic development: the legacy of the commons|This paper analyzes the historical determinants and long-term persistence of social capital, as well as its effect on economic development, by looking at the legacy of the commons in a Spanish region. In medieval times, common goods were granted to townships and were managed collectively by local citizens. This enabled the establishment of institutions for collective action and self-government. Common goods persisted until the second half of the nineteenth century. We argue that the experience of cooperation among villagers, repeated over the centuries, increased the social capital in each local community. In 1845, a law forced small villages to merge with others, a fact which generated exogenous variation in the number of mergers (i.e., cooperative networks) that each modern municipality was required to have. We exploit this change in an IV and RD setting and find that current municipalities formed by a greater number of old townships have a denser network of associations. We also find that higher social capital is associated with more economic development.
Z10|And Thou Shalt Honor: children’s caregiving, work and religion|In this paper we take a fresh look at the magnitude of the trade-off between caring informally for a parent and paid work. We adopt a simultaneous approach with a primary focus on how hours of care are influenced by hours of work rather than the other way round. We also investigate the role that filial obligations play in choices of caring versus working. Using the SHARE data (2004 and 2006) we find that the elasticity of informal care hours in response to working hours is around -0.18, small but not negligible. Moreover, we find that a one point decrease out of a seven point index measuring the strength of filial obligations reduces weekly hours of care by about one hour and half.
Z10|National identity under economic integration|Abstract This study empirically investigates how economic integration influences individuals’ national identity. Due to historical reasons and unique cross-strait politics, some people in Taiwan identify themselves as Chinese while others identify themselves as Taiwanese. Using individual survey data with the outward investment data at the industry level from 1992 to 2009, we find that the rising investment in China has strengthened Taiwanese identity and has reduced the probability of voting for the Pan-Blue parties. The effects are much stronger for unskilled workers than for skilled workers, suggesting that outward investment in China may not only have economic impact on the economy but may also deepen the political polarization in Taiwan.
Z10|Income inequality and saving in a class society: The role of ordinal status|This paper examines the impact of income growth and income inequality on household saving rates and payoffs in a non-cooperative game where each player's payoff depends on her present and future consumption and her rank in the present-consumption distribution. The setting is a pooling equilibrium with three clusters of successive income groups, each cluster having its own present-consumption standard and rank in the present-consumption distribution. In this way the analysis addresses the saving behaviour and welfare of three social classes: the lower, middle and upper class. The author finds explanations for the Easterlin paradox and the Kuznets consumption puzzle and concludes that rank concerns tend to weaken the standard effect of inequality on aggregate saving.
Z10|Community cohesion and assimilation equilibria|We study the assimilation behavior of a group of migrants who live in a city populated by native inhabitants. We conceptualize the group as a community, and the city as a social space. Assimilation increases the productivity of migrants and, consequently, their earnings. However, assimilation also brings the migrants closer in social space to the richer native inhabitants. This proximity subjects the migrants to relative deprivation. We consider a community of migrants whose members are at an equilibrium level of assimilation that was chosen as a result of the maximization of a utility function that has as its arguments income, the cost of assimilation effort, and a measure of relative deprivation. We ask how vulnerable this assimilation equilibrium is to the appearance of a “mutant” – a member of the community who is exogenously endowed with a superior capacity to assimilate. If the mutant were to act on his enhanced ability, his earnings would be higher than those of his fellow migrants, which will expose them to greater relative deprivation. We find that the stability of the pre-mutation assimilation equilibrium depends on the cohesion of the migrants' community, expressed as an ability to effectively sanction and discourage the mutant from deviating. The equilibrium level of assimilation of a tightly knit community is stable in the sense of not being vulnerable to the appearance of a member becoming better able to assimilate. However, if the community is loose-knit, the appearance of a mutant will destabilize the pre-mutation assimilation equilibrium, and will result in a higher equilibrium level of assimilation.
Z10|The economics of social media stars: An empirical investigation of stardom, popularity, and success on YouTube|The economic literature on the superstar phenomenon provides empirical evidence on different types of stars, above all athletes and musicians. A new and, to our best knowledge, unexplored area of this star theory arouse with the development of social media markets. In this paper, we analyse a unique sample of 200 YouTube stars out of four different video categories to address the research gap. By employing econometric methods from panel data analysis, we contribute to answering the following research questions: (i) Are the classic theoretical concepts of popularity and superstardom by Rosen, MacDonald and Adler applicable? (ii) Can social media stars actively influence their popularity by employing special upload strategies? We find empirical evidence that former success positively and significantly influences the current success of social media stars, as theoretically presumed by MacDonald. Furthermore, the results support Adler's assumptions that the most popular stars snowball into superstardom due to higher growth rates. Finally, our investigation shows that social media stars can actively influence their popularity with distinctive upload strategies and market behaviour.
Z10|The Reversal of Fortune, Extractive Institution and the Historical Roots of Racism|We show differences in levels of racism within a sample of former European colonies can be traced to historical institutions. Our identification strategy relies on the reversal of fortune, a historical shock capturing the exogenous establishment of different institutions during the onset of European colonization. Using both OLS and multilevel analysis, we find, extractive historical institutions to be a strong predictor of higher levels of racism independent of present and other explanatory factors at the individual and country levels. We argue and provide evidence this relationship is causal and operates through internal norms, beliefs and values.
Z10|The Role of Novelty-Seeking Traits in Contemporary Knowledge Creation|This paper hypothesizes and empirically establishes the persistent effects of novelty-seeking traits on crosscountry differences in scientifc knowledge creation. I use data on the prevalence of specifc allele variants of the human DRD4 exon III gene, which population geneticists have linked to the human phenotype of novelty-seeking behavior to examine its relationship to scientifc knowledge creation in society. The results suggest a positive and statistically signifcant linear relationship between both outcomes that is consistent with the hypothesis that the prevalence of novelty-seeking traits in society facilitates scientifc knowledge creation through benefcial human behaviors related to risk-taking and explorative behavior. The empirical fndings remain qualitatively unaffected when controlling for additional historical, biogeographical, and socioeconomic factors that appear as additional important determinants in the creation of scientifc knowledge in society.
Z10|Born to be an entrepreneur? How cultural origin affects entrepreneurship|Persistent differences in entrepreneurial activity between regions and countries remain unexplained. This paper argues that cultural heritage is an important determinant. We exploit a quasi-experimental setting comparing entrepreneurial activities of individuals with different cultural ancestry from within Switzerland but who live in the same municipality today and are hence exposed to the same economic and institutional environment. We find that individuals with cultural origin on the German-speaking side of the Swiss language border found 20% more firms than their counterparts with cultural origin on the French-speaking side ─ no matter if they currently live in the German-speaking or French-speaking region. These newly founded firms are identical in terms of survival rate, industry composition, legal form, and firm size, independent of the cultural origin of firm founders. A model of entrepreneurial choice suggests that the empirical patterns of firm entry and performance are more likely driven by differences in risk aversion or preferences for entrepreneurship rather than by skill.
Z10|Using Ethical Dilemmas to predict Antisocial Choices with Real Payoff Consequences: an Experimental Study|Anti-social behaviours are costly to organizations, and the ability to identify predictors of such behaviours can be valuable. In this paper, we used a within-subjects laboratory design to study choices in the well-known (hypothetical) Trolley problem as well as in a real payoff money-burning experiment that can inform our understanding of moral preferences and antisocial behavior. Choices in both environments respond to incentives (i.e., the relative price of the ethical decision). Trolley problem decisions are consistent with previously known results—individuals prefer no action over action, and they prefer to avoid direct over indirect responsibility when negative consequences would be similar in either instance. In analyzing the determinants of anti-social money burning, our data identify money burning due to inequality aversion, but we also find evidence of pure nastiness (burning money of others to increase one’s advantageous inequality). Importantly, we find that willingness to commit ethically dubious acts in the Trolley problem significantly predicts money burning and, more specifically, nastiness. We conclude that choices in hypothetical environments can predict consequential and inefficient antisocial behaviours. Also, utilitarian behaviour in the Trolley dilemma is not linked to antisocial money burning, which contrasts with conclusions in the literature.
Z10|Critical Review of Models, Containing Cultural Levels beyond the Organizational One|The current article traces back the scientific interest to cultural levels across the organization at the University of National and World Economy, and especially in the series of Economic Alternatives – an official scientific magazine, issued by this university. Furthermore, a wider and critical overview of international achievements in this field is made, which reveals the diverse analysis perspectives with respect to cultural levels. Also, a useful model of exploring and teaching the cultural levels beyond the organization is proposed.
Z10|Climatic Roots of Loss Aversion|This research explores the origins of loss aversion and the variation in its prevalence across regions, nations and ethnic group. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that the evolution of loss aversion in the course of human history can be traced to the adaptation of individuals to the asymmetric effects of climatic shocks on reproductive success during the Malthusian epoch. Exploiting variations in the degree of loss aversion among second generation migrants in Europe and the US, as well as across precolonial ethnic groups, the research establishes that consistent with the predictions of the theory, individuals and ethnic groups that are originated in regions in which climatic conditions tended to be spatially correlated, and thus shocks were aggregate in nature, are characterized by greater intensity of loss aversion, while descendants of regions marked by climatic volatility have greater propensity towards loss-neutrality.
Z10|Moral Nimby-ism? Understanding Societal Support for Monetary Compensation to Plasma Donors in Canada|The growing demand for plasma, especially for the manufacture of therapeutic products, creates an urgent need for a careful discussion on the relative merits of different procurement and allocation systems in a way that addresses the increasing demand while abiding by the prevailing moral values in a society. We conducted a randomized survey experiment with a representative sample of 826 Canadian residents to assess attitudes toward legalizing the compensation to plasma donors, a practice that is illegal in several Canadian provinces. We found no evidence of widespread societal opposition to payments to plasma donors, because over 70% of respondents reported that they would support compensation. The support was higher for paying plasma donors in Australia and the United States than in Canada, but the differences were small, suggesting a weak role for “moral NIMBY-ism” or moral relativism in explaining the findings. Moral concerns were the highest-rated reason that respondents gave for being against payment, together with concerns for the safety of plasma supplied by compensated donors, although most of the plasma in Canada does come from compensated American donors. Among those in favor of legalizing compensation for donors (in Canada as well as in Australia), the highest-rated motive was to guarantee a higher domestic supply. Finally, roughly half of those who declared to be against payments reported that they would reconsider their position if the domestic supply and imports were insufficient to meet domestic demand. Most Canadians, therefore, seem to espouse a consequentialist view to issues related to the procurement of plasma.
Z10|Registros de marcas na economia criativa: evolução temporal e setorial|Although the creative economy is prominent in the generation and diffusion of value in the international arena, and so is attracting the attention of actors in the public and private spheres, there still is a gap regarding the definition of variables that can be used as a measure of production and innovation in its segments. In this paper, the use of trademarks applications is proposed as a way to evaluate the production and introduction of new goods and services in segments related to this sector. It can be observed that USPTO trademarks in segments aligned with the creative economy showed a strong expansion, especially since the 1980s, which may be related to the technological and economic changes observed in the global market thereafter.
Z10|Cultural Change and the Migration Choice|Cultural differences play an important role in shaping migration patterns. The conventional proxies for cross country cultural differences – such as common language, ethnicity, genetic traits or religion – implicitly assume that cultural proximity between two countries is constant over time and symmetric, which is far from realistic. This paper proposes a tractable model for international migration which explicitly allows for the time varying and asymmetric dimensions of cultural proximity. Similarly to Disdier et al (2010) we assume that the evolution of bilateral cultural affinity over time is reflected in the intensity of bilateral trade in cultural goods. Our empirical framework includes a comprehensive set of high dimensional fixed effects which enables for the identification of the impact of cultural proximity on migration over and beyond the effect of pre-existing cultural and historical ties. The results are robust across different econometric techniques and suggest that positive changes in cultural relationships over time foster bilateral migration.
Z10|Culture, Diversity, and the Welfare State|We show that culture and diversity strongly influence welfare systems around the globe. To disentangle culture from institutions, we employ regional instruments as well as data on the prevalence of the pathogen Toxoplasma Gondii, linguistic differences, and the frequency of blood types. The generosity of the welfare system is higher in countries with loose family ties and individualistic attitudes, high prevalence of trust and tolerance, and low acceptance of unequally distributed power. Apart from their direct effects, these traits also exert indirect impact by influencing the transmission of inequality to redistribution. Finally, we show that redistribution and diversity are linked non-linearly: moderate levels of diversity impede redistribution, while higher levels offset the negative effect.
Z10|Moral Nimby-ism? Understanding Societal Support for Monetary Compensation to Plasma Donors in Canada|"The growing demand for plasma, especially for the manufacture of therapeutic products, prompts discussions on the merits of different procurement systems. We conducted a randomized survey experiment with a representative sample of 826 Canadian residents to assess attitudes toward legalizing payments to plasma donors, a practice that is illegal in several Canadian provinces. We found no evidence of widespread societal opposition to payments to plasma donors. On the contrary, over 70% of respondents reported that they would support compensation. Our Canadian respondents were more in favor of paying plasma donors elsewhere than in Canada, but the differences were small, suggesting a weak role for moral ""NIMBY-ism"" or relativism. Moral concerns were the respondents' main reason for opposing payments, together with concerns for the safety of plasma from compensated donors, although most of the plasma in Canada does come from paid U.S. donors. Among those in favor of legalizing payments to donors, the main rationale was to guarantee a higher domestic supply. Finally, roughly half of those who declared to be against payments reported that they would reconsider their position if domestic supply plus imports did not cover domestic demand. Most Canadians, therefore, seem to espouse a consequentialist view on issues related to the procurement of plasma."
Z10|Somatic distance, cultural affinities, trust and trade|Somatic distance, or differences in physical appearance, proves to be extremely important in the gravity model of bilateral trade in conformity with results in other areas of economics and outside of it in the social sciences. This is also true quite independently of survey evidence about bilateral trust. These findings are obtained in a sample of the 15 members of the European Economic Association in 1996. Robustness tests also show that somatic distance has a more reliable influence on bilateral trade than the other cultural variables. The article finally discusses the interpretation and the breadth of application of these results.
Z10|Justice Delayed is Assimilation Denied: Rightwing Terror, Fear and Social Assimilation of Turkish Immigrants in Germany|Using the German Socioeconomic Panel (SOEP) data, this paper offers the first evidence that the 2011 news revelations about crimes committed by National Socialist Underground (NSU) network in early the 2000s resulted in an increase in worries about xenophobic hostility among NSU’s targeted groups. This serves as an indication of the minority’s perceived maltreatment by German institutions while investigating the NSU crimes. The results further show that the revelations significantly reinforced a feeling of estrangement among Turks, who were now less likely to self-identify as Germans and more likely to see themselves as foreigners; they, therefore, tended to bond more strongly with the ethos of their country of origin. The results also demonstrate that Turks reported a substantial decrease in their health satisfaction and subjective wellbeing. In conclusion, the paper underlines the pertinence of judicial efficacy over rightwing crimes for assimilation and welfare of immigrants.
Z10|Comfort and Conformity: A Culture-based Theory of Migration|This paper proposes a theory of migration decisions in which cultural traits play a role. Individuals are assumed to value comfort (high wages) and conformity (interactions with individuals who share similar world views). Regions are assumed to differ economically (average wages) and culturally (average world views and their diversity). The model shows that self-selection of inter-regional migrants on world views is non-monotonic if one region is more diverse than the other, and it weakens with economic gaps between regions. This nonmonoticity can lead to a dichotomy of outcomes: culturally diverse regions become even more diverse because of migration, while culturally homogeneous regions become even more homogeneous. Consequently, Tieboutian sorting (people moving to the region in which world views are closer to theirs) only holds when regions have similar wages and diversity of world views.
Z10|Households’ Inflation Perceptions and Expectations: Survey Evidence from New Zealand|In this paper, we study how inflation is viewed by the general population of New Zealand. Based on unique representative survey data collected in 2016 and using descriptive statistics and multivariate regressions, we explore various aspects of how laypersons perceive inflation and form inflation expectations. We focus on how an individual’s economic situation, information search and interest in inflation, economic knowledge, and attitudes and values are related to inflation perception and expectation, as well as the individual’s reaction to them. We interpret our findings as a clear indication that laypersons’ knowledge about inflation is much better described by the imperfect information view prevailing in social psychology than by the rational actor view typically assumed in economics.
Z10|Fanning the Flames of Hate: Social Media and Hate Crime|This paper investigates the link between social media and hate crime using Facebook data. We study the case of Germany, where the recently emerged right-wing party Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) has developed a major social media presence. We show that right-wing anti-refugee sentiment on Facebook predicts violent crimes against refugees in otherwise similar municipalities with higher social media usage. To further establish causality, we exploit exogenous variation in major internet and Facebook outages, which fully undo the correlation between social media and hate crime. We further find that the effect decreases with distracting news events; increases with user network interactions; and does not hold for posts unrelated to refugees. Our results suggest that social media can act as a propagation mechanism between online hate speech and real-life violent crime.Keywords: social media, hate crime, minorities, Germany, AfD JEL Classification: D74, J15, Z10, D72, O35, N32, N34.
Z10|A Theory of Conservative Revivals|Why do some societies fail to adopt more efficient political and economic institutions in response to changing economic conditions? And why do such conditions sometimes generate conservative ideological backlashes and, at other times, progressive social and political movements? We propose an explanation that highlights the interplay - or lack thereof - between productivity, cultural beliefs and institutions. In our model, production shocks that benefit one sector of the economy may induce forward-looking elites to provide public goods associated with a different, more traditional sector that benefits their interests. This investment results in more agents generating cultural beliefs complementary to the provision of the traditional good, which in turn increases the political power of the traditional elite. Hence, productivity shocks in a more advanced sector of the economy can increase investment, political power, and cultural capital associated with the more traditional sector of the economy, in the process generating a revival of beliefs associated with an outdated economic environment.
Z10|Somatic distance, trust and trade|Somatic distance, or differences in physical appearance, proves to be extremely important in the gravity model of bilateral trade in conformity with results in other areas of economics and outside in the social sciences. This is also true independently of survey evidence about bilateral trust. These findings are obtained in a sample of the 15 members of the European Economic Area in 1996. Robustness tests also show that somatic distance, as well as co‐ancestry, has a more reliable influence on bilateral trade than the other customary cultural variables. The article finally discusses the interpretation and breadth of application of these results.
Z10|Los exilios políticos y la dimensión comparada: contribuciones a un campo en construcción|Los estudios sobre los exilios en América Latina han tenido un desarrollo importante en los últimos veinte años. Si bien el recorrido mayor es el de los exilios del Cono Sur (Argentina, Chile y Uruguay), en los últimos años, han comenzado a aparecer textos, investigaciones y espacios académicos con trabajos sobre Paraguay[1] o Colombia[2] y, en menor medida, Centroamérica. Consideramos, que hemos llegado a un punto en el que debemos trascender los estudios de casos nacionales y comenzar a reflexionar sobre otros aspectos, planteamientos teóricos y metodológicos que busquen aportar elementos y ayuden a los análisis que, sobre estas migraciones forzadas, se están realizando.El objetivo, es reflexionar sobre la pertinencia de los estudios comparados sobre exilios de o en América Latina en el siglo XX considerando los avances ya realizados y algunos elementos sobre por dónde podría discurrir esta propuesta de trabajo.
Z10|Los datos abiertos y el plan de acción de gobierno abierto en México 2013-2015|El presente artículo tiene por fin indagar sobre la relación entre el gobierno abierto y los datos abiertos en México, a la luz de los indicadores internacionales de datos abiertos conjuntamente con la estrategia federal de Gobierno Abierto Mexicano y los compromisos asumidos por el país ante la Alianza de Gobierno Abierto entre 2013 y 2015. Asimismo, se presentan propuestas y mecanismos de acción de datos abiertos que permiten generar mayor valor público de los datos disponibles para la ciudadanía.
Z10|Asociación estadística entre el ingreso y los derechos sociales en México|En México, el Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de la Política de Desarrollo Social estableció en su medición de la pobreza multidimensional que el ingreso y las carencias en materia de derechos sociales representan espacios independientes. No obstante, dicho supuesto no fue sometido a una verificación estadística, y su fundamentación es más bien teórica. Las técnicas estadísticas aquí propuestas, dado el carácter categórico de las variables involucradas, apuntan a la existencia de asociación entre ambos espacios. Los resultados obtenidos también sugieren omitir la carencia del acceso a los servicios de salud, y adicionalmente se encuentran relaciones entre las variables del espacio de los derechos, lo que conduce a problemas de redundancia entre las dimensiones.
Z10|Brecha salarial por género en México: Desde un enfoque regional, según su exposición a la apertura comercial 2005-2015|El objetivo de esta investigación es analizar la brecha salarial por género a lo largo de la distribución salarial en las regiones de México. Para ello se aplica, la metodología de Melly (2005) con la Encuesta de Ocupación y Empleo (ENOE) 2005-2015. Los resultados revelan que, en México, y sus regiones la desigualdad salarial por género, ha disminuido, aunque esta se encuentra en contra de las mujeres. La mayor parte de las diferencias no se explican por las características productivas, acentuándose en la parte alta de la distribución salarial, en las regiones más expuestas a la apertura comercial.
Z10|Perspectivas de una reforma migratoria que regularice a indocumentados mexicanos, en el contexto político actual de Estados Unidos|En 1986, el Congreso estadounidense aprobó la Immigration Reform and Control Act (irca), la última reforma que consideró la regularización masiva de indocumentados. La irca ha permitido regularizar más de tres millones de personas, la mayoría mexicanos. Casi tres décadas después, todavía doce millones de indocumentados, residen en Norteamérica. ¿Cuáles son actualmente las perspectivas de que las condiciones de esta población mejoren mediante una reforma que les saque de la clandestinidad? El presente artículo busca responder esta interrogante, analizando la situación actual, con base en examinar el contexto histórico, en que se han aplicado las leyes y políticas migratorias estadounidenses.
Z10|La perspectiva de género en los programas de estudio de las licenciaturas contables administrativas|La perspectiva de género consiste en visualizar los distintos fenómenos de la realidad tomando en cuenta que en todos los ámbitos existen diferencias entre el actuar de hombres y mujeres. El objetivo de este trabajo consiste en realizar una propuesta para incorporar la perspectiva de género en el currículo de los programas de estudio de las licenciaturas contables administrativas, para lo cual se realiza un análisis documental con el fin de comprender en primer lugar las temáticas: Universidad y género, el género en el currículo universitario, La perspectiva de género en el Plan Nacional de Desarrollo y en el Programa Sectorial de Educación en México y los estudios de género en las organizaciones, posteriormente se realiza una revisión de las publicaciones realizadas en México que abordan la temática de estudios de género en las organizaciones, clasificando por líneas de investigación los referidos trabajos, por último se presentan las temáticas que podrían incorporar los programas de estudios de estas disciplinas.
Z10|Centroamericanas menores de edad prostituidas en California|La migración irregular de menores a través de la frontera sureste de los Estados Unidos se ha incrementado de modo preocupante en los últimos años. Algunas de estas menores son niñas transportadas por redes de tráfico sexual. Este artículo, fundamentado en entrevistas cualitativas realizadas en 2015 y 2016, examina cómo las redes de tráfico sexual captan a las menores centroamericanas para explotarlas en centros de entretenimiento adulto de California, y analiza los abusos que sufren las menores. Finalmente, el artículo concluye que los traficantes utilizan la ley migratoria para lograr una mayor sumisión de las menores.
Z10|La imagen y el cine en la enseñanza de la historia económica|Este artículo presenta el modelo de enseñanza desarrollado en las asignaturas de Historia Económica de Colombia e Historia Económica Mundial, en el programa de Economía de la Universidad Católica de Colombia, 2014 y 2015, cuyo objetivo es abordar los problemas históricos de la economía, a través de las fuentes tradicionales, complementadas con la fotografía, el cine, y demás herramientas que brindan las nuevas tecnologías de la comunicación. En la primera parte se describe el contexto de la educación en Colombia en lo que se refiere a la catedra de Historia Económica, en la segunda parte, se describe el modelo de enseñanza de la historia económica a través del cine, en la tercera parte se presenta un listado de films para complementar el proceso de enseñanza de la historia económica, en la cuarta parte se enumeran algunos recursos didácticos y fuentes de investigación que ofrece la internet, y finalmente se presentan las conclusiones.
Z10|La inteligencia emocional como habilidad directiva. Estudio aplicado en los municipios de la provincia de Córdoba (España)|El artículo presenta una investigación sobre la inteligencia emocional como habilidad directiva en el contexto de la Administración Local en la Provincia de Córdoba (España), y en la que se posiciona como una habilidad con una gran influencia sobre el desempeño de las personas y sobre el conjunto de las variables que definen a las organizaciones municipales. A partir del trabajo de campo en diferentes entidades en el ámbito municipal, sobre un cuestionario aplicado a 362 empleados públicos, se centra en el objetivo de conocer la valoración de un inventario de 22 habilidades directivas y su importancia en las variables organizacionales. Los resultados muestran la discreta valoración otorgada a la inteligencia emocional, ofreciendo posibilidades en la definición de estrategias de formación directiva en esta habilidad, poniendo especial atención en la identificación y desarrollo del liderazgo de los directivos públicos.
Z10|Mujeres: entre la autonomía y la vida familiar|La capacitación para el trabajo constituye una herramienta importante para las mujeres, ya que les permite estar en mejores condiciones para ingresar o mantenerse en el mundo laboral; sin embargo, ellas viven diversas tensiones al tratar de compaginar la vida familiar con la capacitación. Este texto es resultado de una investigación cualitativa basada en el método biográfico, diseñada para analizar el significado que tiene dicha capacitación en la vida personal, familiar y laboral de las mujeres. Entre los resultados se encontró, que el incremento en su formación no ha modificado sustancialmente la visión tradicional sobre las funciones sociales de las mujeres y los hombres, pero las ayuda a impulsar su autonomía personal y económica, sin renunciar a sus responsabiliades reproductivas y familiares. Las mujeres asignan valor tanto al ámbito doméstico como al público, y los consideran como espacios diferenciados que es necesario concertar.
Z10|Los dientes de Raquel de Gabriel Jiménez Emán: Un abismo en miniatura|El presente artículo se plantea como objetivo, comprender los rasgos de la escritura minificcional de Gabriel Jiménez Emán a partir de su obra Los dientes de Raquel, cuyos rasgos son esbozados en tres dimensiones: a) el papel que juega, en la arquitectura del texto, el inicio como pieza fundamental en la economía lingüística y en la concisión discursiva, b) la importancia del final como efecto paralizante, golpe del ingenio creador y posibilidad de múltiples significados; y c) el empleo del suspenso y lo fantástico como recurso fundamental en la construcción de atmósferas absurdas, irónicas, paródicas, onírica y misteriosas. A partir de una comprensión hermenéutica, se plantea no solo la aproximación a las estrategias narrativas de Jiménez Emán, sino que el examen de los rasgos constitutivos de la minificción como género emergente, permite advertir el carácter de ruptura, fragmentariedad, juego, velocidad, multiplicidad y simultaneidad que convierten al universo minificcional en un abismo en miniatura.
Z10|La infidelidad de los dioses: lenguaje y simulacro en Pierre Klossowski|Pierre Klossowski se sirvió de la doctrina del eterno retorno de Nietzsche para poner en tela de juicio el principio de identidad tanto en la escritura como en el lenguaje; un falso principio que, como el Dios-Uno, simula ser único y verdadero. Así mismo, Klossowski se sirvió de la figura nietzscheana de la “muerte de Dios” para hablar del ocaso de la identidad, y poner en entredicho las certezas depositadas en la suficiencia y eficacia del lenguaje. A la luz de la filosofía de Klossowski se pondrá en evidencia cómo en su literatura y en su interpretación del mito del baño de Diana, asistimos a la caída del paradigma del principio de no contradicción, de lo que se deriva la posibilidad retórica del mundo devenido en fábula. Esto tendría lugar en el momento en que toda escritura estriba en el plano de la ficción, donde todos los simulacros, como ha dicho Gilles Deleuze comentando a Klossowski, ascienden a la superficie. El simulacro se convierte en fantasma.

Z10|Ancestral Characteristics of Modern Populations| We construct a database, with global coverage, that provides measures of the cultural and environmental characteristics of the pre-industrial ancestors of the world’s current populations. In this paper, we describe the construction of the database, including the underlying data, the procedure to produce the estimates, and the structure of the final data. We then provide illustrations of some of the variation in the data and provide an illustration of how the data can be used.
Z10|Working Moms, Childlessness, and Female Identity|In this paper I provide empirical evidence that the strength of beliefs regarding the harm children suffer when their mothers work plays an important role in explaining gender gaps in labor market outcomes and fertility trends. I exploit a unique setting in Switzerland and compare outcomes of one cohort of Swiss women born in the 1950s either into the French or German ethno-linguistic group. This allows me to compare outcomes of women exposed to different norms regarding working mothers while holding constant typical confounding factors such as composition, labor market opportunities, and work-family policies. Consistent with the strong belief that children suffer with working mothers in the German region, I find that German-born women are 15-25% less likely to work as mothers and 20-20% more likely to remain childless compared to their French-born peers. Only the extensive margins show marked differences and especially among the highly educated. I argue that an identity framework along the lines of Akerlof and Kranton (2000) can rationalize these patterns in a tractable way.
Z10|Diversity and Growth|The diversity of social interaction within economic communities affects productivity and growth, and is itself shaped by economic conditions. These reciprocal effects raise the possibility of multiple equilibria, of setting a socially polarized economy stagnating in poverty on a new path of social integration and economic growth through external intervention or an internal political initiative. This paper describes a simple analytical model that captures these reciprocal effects, and sheds light on the role of government capacity, community leadership, federation and external credit or aid, in achieving economic growth through social integration.
Z10|Physiological Constraints and Comparative Economic Development|"It is a well known fact that economic development and distance to the equator are positively correlated variables in the world today. It is perhaps less well known that as recently as 1500 C.E. it was the other way around. The present paper provides a theory of why the ""latitude gradient"" seemingly changed sign in the course of the last half millennium. In particular, we develop a dynamic model of economic and physiological development in which households decide upon the number and nutrition of their offspring. In this setting we demonstrate that relatively high metabolic costs of fertility, which may have emerged due to positive selection towards greater cold tolerance in locations away from the equator, would work to sti fle economic development during pre-industrial times, yet allow for an early onset of sustained growth. As a result, the theory suggests a reversal of fortune whereby economic activity gradually shifts away from the equator in the process of long-term economic development."
Z10|Asymmetric Cultural Proximity and Greenfield FDI|This paper investigates the role of asymmetric cultural proximity (CP) on greenfield foreign direct investment (FDI). We build a conceptual framework that explicitly accounts for cultural attractiveness as an asymmetric dimension within a broad notion of CP. We revisit the existing supply/origin-side theories of bilateral FDI to derive a gravity equation suited for testing the impact of (i) the attractiveness of destination's culture for citizens in the origin country, and (ii) the attractiveness of origin's culture for individuals in the destination economy. While the role of the former direction of CP is well understood in the literature, we propose new mechanisms to rationalize that of the latter. We use exports and imports of cultural goods to proxy for the two directions of asymmetric and time-dependent CP in the same empirical specification. The econometric analysis confirms a positive role of asymmetric CP as a determinant of Greenfield FDI. Moreover, it suggests a stronger investment effect of the origin's culture attractiveness for the destination country. Finally, it provides support for the mechanisms proposed in the theoretical discussion.
Z10|Justice Delayed Is Assimilation Denied: Rightwing Terror, Fear and Social Assimilation of Turkish Immigrants in Germany|Using the German Socioeconomic Panel (SOEP) data, this paper offers the first evidence that the 2011 news revelations about crimes committed by National Socialist Underground (NSU) network in early the 2000s resulted in an increase in worries about xenophobic hostility among NSU’s targeted groups. This serves as an indication of the minority’s perceived maltreatment by German institutions while investigating the NSU crimes. The results further show that the revelations significantly reinforced a feeling of estrangement among Turks, who were now less likely to self-identify as Germans and more likely to see themselves as foreigners; they, therefore, tended to bond more strongly with the ethos of their country of origin. The results also demonstrate that Turks reported a substantial decrease in their health satisfaction and subjective wellbeing. In conclusion, the paper underlines the pertinence of judicial efficacy over rightwing crimes for assimilation and welfare of immigrants.
Z10|Do emigrants self-select along cultural traits? Evidence from the MENA countries|This paper empirically investigates whether emigrants from MENA countries self-select on cultural traits such as religiosity and gender-egalitarian attitudes. To do so, we use Gallup World Poll data on individual opinions and beliefs, migration aspirations, short-run migration plans, and preferred destination choices. We find that individuals who intend to emigrate to OECD, high-income countries exhibit significantly lower levels of religiosity than the rest of the population. They also share more gender-egalitarian views, although the effect only holds among the young (aged 15 to 30), among single women, and in countries with a Sunni minority. For countries mostly affected by Arab Spring, since 2011 the degree of cultural selection has decreased. Nevertheless, the aggregate effects of cultural selection should not be overestimated. Overall, self-selection along cultural traits has limited (albeit non negligible) effects on the average characteristics of the population left behind, and on the cultural distance between natives and immigrants in the OECD countries.
Z10|A New Analysis of Population History in Sabah and Sarawak|Objective - This study is a comprehensive account of contemporary knowledge concerning pre-historic communities in Sabah and Sarawak based on newly available evidence from genomic and archaeological research. Methodology/Technique - The data presented in this review was obtained from primary literature including recent reports on several Neolithic excavation sites including Gua Sireh, Bukit Tengkorak, Melanta Tutup, and Bukit Kamiri. Findings - Pre-neolithic populations existed in Borneo long before the arrival of Austronesians as is evident from Niah Cave remains. These considerably pre-date the arrival of the latter new immigrants around 3,500 years ago. Further genetic research is needed, as the current view of the history of the population is based on a limited number of ethnic groups among those currently living in Borneo and to date, no trace has been found of any surviving genetic lineages from the earliest settlers. Novelty - This review paints a contemporary picture from existing information. In particular, it highlights the need for further research on the topic, as the current view of the genetic history of the population in Sabah and Sarawak is only available on a limited number of ethnic groups currently living in Borneo. Developing a conclusive and composite view on this topic will require widespread genetic surveys of many more ethnic groups scattered throughout the Sabah and Sarawak areas. This will require large-scale next-generation techniques (such as genome-wide SNP surveys and whole genome sequencing etc.). These methods should be enhanced by examination of ancient materials including human remains and their associated artefacts. These initiatives will require a number of well-planned excavations of recent settlements (last 10,000 years) and the application of trace and ancient DNA methodology.
Z10|Local Culture, Internal Marketing and Employee Satisfaction in Improving Financial Performance: A Case Study of Microfinance Institutions in Bali|Objective – Local culture acts as a bridge in empowering the resources owned by a firm so they can operate harmoniously. This research tests the theory of local culture, internal marketing, and employee satisfaction in an effort to improve financial performance. Methodology/Technique – The research is supported by the existing phenomenon of increasing credit issues. The data is obtained from 1,364 questionnaires and is quantitatively analyzed through Structural Equation Modelling. A qualitative analysis is used to deepen the anomaly relationship through a phenomenological approach. Findings – The result show that local culture becomes the organizational culture, but has no direct influence on the improvement of performance. Indicators related to the environment have a very low contribution to the development of organizational culture. Internal marketing indicators, such as recruitment processes and internal communication, have a significant contribution on the achievement of financial performance. Further, employee satisfaction has a significant impact on the achievement of financial performance. Novelty – This study develops a new model that can be used to enhance financial performance. The integration of local culture into internal marketing and employee satisfaction is a relatively novel invention.
Z10|Do Emigrants Self-Select Along Cultural Traits?

Z10|Cultural leader and the dynamics of assimilation|This paper studies the population dynamics of cultural traits in a model of intergenerational cultural transmission with a perfectly-forward looking cultural leader. We show that there exists a threshold size in terms of population above which the cultural leader becomes active. We also show that a policy affecting some key parameters (such as the cost of providing the religious good) has a different impact in the short run and in the long run due to over-reactions or under-reactions of the different cultural groups. Finally, we study the cultural competition between two forward-looking cultural leaders with opposite objectives. We show that the steady-state cultural equilibrium depends on the time preference structure of the two leaders.
Z10|Using Ethical Dilemmas to Predict Antisocial Choices With Real Payoff Consequences: An Experimental Study|Anti-social behaviours are costly to organizations, and the ability to identify predictors of such behaviours can be valuable. In this paper, we used a within-subjects laboratory design to study choices in the well-known (hypothetical) Trolley problem as well as in a real payoff moneyburning experiment that can inform our understanding of moral preferences and antisocial behavior. Choices in both environments respond to incentives (i.e., the relative price of the ethical decision). Trolley problem decisions are consistent with previously known results— individuals prefer no action over action, and they prefer to avoid direct over indirect responsibility when negative consequences would be similar in either instance. In analyzing the determinants of anti-social money burning, our data identify money burning due to inequality aversion, but we also find evidence of pure nastiness (burning money of others to increase one’s advantageous inequality). Importantly, we find that willingness to commit ethically dubious acts in the Trolley problem significantly predicts money burning and, more specifically, nastiness. We conclude that choices in hypothetical environments can predict consequential and inefficient antisocial behaviours. Also, utilitarian behaviour in the Trolley dilemma is not linked to antisocial money burning, which contrasts with conclusions in the literature. Key Words: experiments, money burning, ethical dilemmas, anti-social behavioral, trolley problem
Z10|How Persistent Is Life Satisfaction? Evidence from European Immigration|This paper asks to what extent life satisfaction among immigrants remains similar to that in their country of origin and to what extent it adapts to that in their country of residence. We employ data from 29,000 immigrants in the European Social Survey to estimate the relative importance of these influences. We find evidence that the persistence of life satisfaction from the country of origin is strong for migrants from developed countries and close to zero for migrants from formerly communist countries. We also find that persistence for second-generation immigrants is similar but weaker than for their parents.
Z10|Sibling Correlation in Risk Attitudes: Evidence from Burkina Faso|This study uses sibling correlation to investigate the importance of parental and household characteristics on three different risk domains collected in a nationally representative survey from Burkina Faso. Sibling correlations are between 0.51 and 0.83. The correlations are higher in the general risk domain compared to risk taking in financial matters and traffic. Moreover, the sibling correlation is higher for the younger generation of siblings than the older generation, and for sisters than brothers. We also explore which factors drive these correlations; parents’ risk attitudes help explain these correlations, whereas socioeconomic outcomes, family structure, parental health and residential zone have only a limited contribution. We also find that gender is important in explaining the variation in sibling correlations. Mother’s have a stronger contribution on daughter’s correlation than fathers, whereas fathers help to explain the son’s correlation to a larger extent.
Z10|Does revolution change risk attitudes? Evidence from Burkina Faso|A popular uprising in 2014, led to a revolution overthrowing the sitting president of Burkina Faso. We investigate if individuals’ risk attitudes changed due to this revolution. Specifically, we investigate the impact of the revolution on risk attitudes, by gender, age and level of education. The analysis is based on a unique nationally representative panel Household Budget Survey, which allows us to track the changes in the risk attitudes of the same individuals before, during and after the revolution. Our results suggest that the impact of the revolution is short-term. Individuals become risk averse during the revolution but converge back to the pre-revolution risk attitudes, slightly increasing their risk taking, after the revolution is over. Women are more risk taking than the men after the revolution but are more risk averse during the revolution. In general, older individuals tend to have higher risk aversion than the younger individuals. During the revolution, however, the individuals with higher level of education are less willing to take risk.
Z10|Misperceived Social Norms: Female Labor Force Participation in Saudi Arabia|Through the custom of guardianship, husbands typically have the final word on their wives’ labor supply decisions in Saudi Arabia, a country with very low female labor force participation (FLFP). We provide incentivized evidence (both from an experimental sample in Riyadh and from a national sample) that the vast majority of young married men in Saudi Arabia privately support FLFP outside of home from a normative perspective, while they substantially underestimate the level of support for FLFP by other similar men – even men from their same social setting, such as their neighbors. We then show that randomly correcting these beliefs about others increases married men’s willingness to let their wives join the labor force (as measured by their costly sign-up for a job-matching service for their wives). Finally, we find that this decision maps onto real outcomes: four months after the main intervention, the wives of men in our original sample whose beliefs about acceptability of FLFP were corrected are more likely to have applied and interviewed for a job outside of home. Together, our evidence indicates a potentially important source of labor market frictions, where job search is underprovided due to misperceived social norms.
Z10|Marriage Strategy Among European Nobility| We use a unique dataset to analyze marriage and union patterns of European nobility from the 1500s to the 1800s. Our matching model predicts homophily in title, and that more stringent constraints on the dowries lead to a higher degree of homophily. Historical evidence supports both predictions: nobles tended to marry nobles with identical title; and, German marriages, whose dowry rules were more rigid, were characterized by a higher degree of homophiliy in titles than English marriages. Moreover, homophily in titles decreased over time for Germans, and remained constant for English nobles.
Z10|Moral Incentives in Credit Card Debt Repayment: Evidence from a Field Experiment|We study the role of morality in debt repayment, using an experiment with the credit card customers of a large Islamic bank in Indonesia. In our main treatment, clients receive a text message stating that “non-repayment of debts by someone who is able to repay is an injustice.” This moral appeal decreases the share of delinquent customers by 4.4 percentage points from a baseline of 66 percent, and reduces default among the customers with the highest ex-ante credit risk. Additional treatments help benchmark the effects against those of direct financial incentives, understand the underlying mechanisms, and rule out competing explanations, such as reminder effects, priming religion, signaling the lender's commitment to debt collection, and provision of new information.
Z10|Long-Lasting Social Capital and its Impact on Economic Development: The Legacy of the Commons|This paper analyzes the historical determinants and long-term persistence of social capital, as well as its effect on economic development, by looking at the legacy of the commons in a Spanish region. In medieval times, common goods were granted to townships and were managed collectively by local citizens. This enabled the establishment of institutions for collective action and self-government. Common goods persisted until the second half of the nineteenth century. We argue that the experience of cooperation among villagers, repeated over the centuries, increased the social capital in each local community. In 1845, a law forced small villages to merge with others, a fact which generated exogenous variation in the number of mergers (i.e., cooperative networks) that each modern municipality was required to have. We exploit this change in an IV and RD setting and find that current municipalities formed by a greater number of old townships have a denser network of associations. We also find that higher social capital is associated with more economic development.
Z10|Identity, Beliefs, and Political Conflict|We present a theory of identity politics that builds on two ideas. First, voters identify with the social group whose interests are closest to theirs and that features the strongest policy conflict with outgroups. Second, identification causes voters to slant their beliefs toward the group's distinctive opinion. The theory yields two main implications: i) voters' beliefs are polarized and distorted along group boundaries; ii) economic shocks that induce new cleavages to emerge also bring about large changes in beliefs and preferences across many policy issues. In particular, exposure to globalization or cultural changes may induce voters to switch identities, dampening their demand for redistribution and exacerbating conflicts in other social dimensions. We show that survey evidence is consistent with these implications.
Z10|The Origins of the Division of Labor in Pre-modern Times Abstract: This research explores the historical roots of the division of labor in pre-modern societies. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that intra-ethnic diversity had a positive effect on the division of labor across ethnicities in the pre-modern era. Exploiting a variety of identification strategies and a novel ethnic level dataset combining geocoded ethnographic, linguistic and genetic data, it establishes that higher levels of intra-ethnic diversity were conducive to economic specialization in the pre-modern era. The findings are robust to a host of geographical, institutional, cultural and historical confounders, and suggest that variation in intra-ethnic diversity is the main predictor of the division of labor in pre-modern times|No abstract is available for this item.
Z10|Cultural Change and the Migration Choice|Cultural differences play an important role in shaping migration patterns. The conventional proxies for cross country cultural differences - such as common language, ethnicity, genetic traits or religion - implicitly assume that cultural proximity between two countries is constant over time and symmetric, which is far from realistic. This paper proposes a tractable model for international migration which explicitly allows for the time varying and asymmetric dimensions of cultural proximity. Similarly to Disdier et al (2010) we assume that the evolution of bilateral cultural affinity over time is reflected in the intensity of bilateral trade in cultural goods. Our empirical framework includes a comprehensive set of high dimensional fixed effects which enables for the identification of the impact of cultural proximity on migration over and beyond the effect of pre-existing cultural and historical ties. The results are robust across different econometric techniques and suggest that positive changes in cultural relationships over time foster bilateral migration.
Z10|Diversity and Growth|The diversity of social interaction within economic communities affects productivity and growth, and is itself shaped by economic conditions. These reciprocal effects raise the possibility of multiple equilibria, of setting a socially polarized economy stagnating in poverty on a new path of social integration and economic growth through external intervention or an internal political initiative. This paper describes a simple analytical model that captures these reciprocal effects, and sheds light on the role of government capacity, community leadership, federation and external credit or aid, in achieving economic growth through social integration.
Z10|A Theory of Conservative Revivals|Why do some societies fail to adopt more efficient political and economic institutions in response to changing economic conditions? And why do such conditions sometimes generate conservative ideological backlashes and, at other times, progressive social and political movements? We propose an explanation that highlights the interplay—or lack thereof—between productivity, cultural beliefs and institutions. In our model, production shocks that benefit one sector of the economy may induce forward-looking elites to provide public goods associated with a different, more traditional sector that benefits their interests. This investment results in more agents generating cultural beliefs complementary to the provision of the traditional good, which in turn increases the political power of the traditional elite. Hence, productivity shocks in a more advanced sector of the economy can increase investment, political power, and cultural capital associated with the more traditional sector of the economy, in the process generating a revival of beliefs associated with an outdated economic environment.
Z10|Creators’ Income Situation in the Digital Age|The digital transformation imposes both opportunities and risks for creativity and for creative employment, with implications for trends in income levels and the distribution of income. First, we consider skill-biased technological change as a determinant of income and labor market outcomes in the arts. Arguably, the IT revolution has changed the demand for certain skills, with creative occupations being more in demand than general employment. Second, we consider declines in the costs of generating new works and artistic experimentation due to digital technologies, and their effect on the barriers to entry in labor markets. Third, we touch upon the rise of online contract labor in certain creative professions as a determinant of income. Here, online platforms can change creators’ access to work opportunities and it may alter the way income is distributed. We find that wage trends for creative workers in the digital age outperform general trends in the population: based on various data sources and various ways to identify creators, we see creators losing less or even gaining a better income position in relative terms. From a policy perspective, results do not lend support to the idea that creators’ income situation has systematically worsened with the rise of the internet and its intermediaries. Evidence on changing distributions of income is ambiguous as trends differ from one country to the next.
Z10|The Geography of Linguistic Diversity and the Provision of Public Goods|This paper theoretically analyzes and empirically investigates the importance of local interaction between individuals of different linguistic groups for the provision of public goods at the national level. Depending on whether local interaction mitigates or reinforces antagonism towards other groups, the micro-founded theory we develop predicts that a country's provision of public goods (i) decreases in its overall linguistic fractionalization, and (ii) either increases or decreases in how much individuals locally learn about other groups. After constructing a 5 km by 5 km geographic dataset on language use for 223 countries, we compute measures of overall fractionalization and local learning, and investigate their relation to public good provision at the country level. While overall fractionalization worsens outcomes, we find a positive causal relation between local learning and public goods. Local mixing therefore mitigates the negative impact of a country's overall linguistic fractionalization. An IV strategy shows that this result is not driven by the possible endogenous spatial distribution of language speakers within countries.
Z10|Misperceived Social Norms: Female Labor Force Participation in Saudi Arabia|Through the custom of guardianship, husbands typically have the final word on their wives’ labor supply decisions in Saudi Arabia, a country with very low female labor force participation (FLFP).

Together, our evidence indicates a potentially important source of labor market frictions, where job search is underprovided due to misperceived social norms.
Z10|The Effects of Sexism on American Women: The Role of Norms vs. Discrimination|We study how reported sexism in the population affects American women. Fixed-effects and TSLS estimates show that higher prevailing sexism where she was born (background sexism) and where she currently lives (residential sexism) both lower a woman's wages, labor force participation and ages of marriage and childbearing. We argue that background sexism affects outcomes through the influence of previously-encountered norms, and that estimated associations regarding specific percentiles and male versus female sexism suggest that residential sexism affects labor market outcomes through prejudice-based discrimination by men, and non-labor market outcomes through the influence of current norms of other women.
Z10|Geographical Roots of the Coevolution of Cultural and Linguistic Traits|This research explores the geographical origins of the coevolution of cultural and linguistic traits in the course of human history, relating the geographical roots of long-term orientation to the structure of the future tense, the agricultural determinants of gender bias to the presence of sex-based grammatical gender, and the ecological origins of hierarchical orientation to the existence of politeness distinctions. The study advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that: (i) geographical characteristics that were conducive to higher natural return to agricultural investment contributed to the existing cross-language variations in the structure of the future tense, (ii) the agricultural determinants of gender gap in agricultural productivity fostered the existence of sex-based grammatical gender, and (iii) the ecological origins of hierarchical societies triggered the emergence of politeness distinctions.
Z10|The Effects of Out-of-School Activities in Elementary School Days on Future Income|This paper investigate the effect of out-of-school activity in elementary school days on one’s future income. In order to analyze specifically, the model includes extra-curricular activities in junior high school, years of schooling, marital status and occupation. They could be influenced by the activity and also have effects on income. The data used for the analysis is the Preference Parameters Study. Related variables are extract and their relationship is calculated by path analysis. The result is in case of female, cultural activities have significant effect on income via schooling. In case of male, educational and sports activities increase one’s future income.
Z10|Measuring Productivity Dispersion: Lessons From Counting One-Hundred Million Ballots|We measure output per worker in nearly 8,000 municipalities in the Italian electoral process using ballot counting times in the 2013 general election and two referenda in 2016. We document large productivity dispersion across provinces in this very uniform and low-skill task that involves nearly no technology and requires limited physical capital. Using a development accounting framework, this measure explains up to half of the firm-level productivity dispersion across Italian provinces and more than half the north-south productivity gap in Italy. We explore potential drivers of our measure of labor efficiency and find that its association with measures of work ethic and trust is particularly robust.
Z10|Can Conditional Transfers Eradicate Child Marriage?|Conditional cash transfers are increasingly being used by policymakers as a strategy to postpone the marriage of adolescent girls in developing countries. While this approach has met with success in the case of education and health programmes, it is unlikely, on its own, to address deeper issues related to child marriage, such as the agency of adolescent girls in their marriage decisions, sexual rights within marriage, and social norms within their own communities. We argue for a multi‐dimensional, longer‐term and holistic view of impact, that takes into account dimensions such as realized rights, health and access to education rather than cost‐benefit based approaches that rely on single‐focus indicators.
Z10|The Effect of Culture on Energy Efficient Vehicle Ownership|We provide an empirical analysis on the relation between culture and revealed environmental economic preferences. Switzerland's citizens share all major institutions but belong to multiple population groups which differ by culture and language across distinct geographical locations. This unique setting allows us to disentangle the effect of culture on individual consumer preferences from institutional characteristics. We use a spatial fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) at the internal French/German language border on municipality level data to estimate the effect of culture on preferences for energy efficient vehicle design. Our results indicate that French speaking municipalities have a 5.5 percentage points higher share of energy efficient vehicles compared to their German counterparts. In addition, we find that popular votes on environmental issues receive a substantially higher share of approval in French speaking regions. This indicates that they place a higher value on the environment, which may be due to a higher sense of collectivism and altruism.
Z10|Cultural proximity: a source of trade flow resilience?|While the significant influence of cultural proximity on bilateral trade flows has been extensively documented in the literature, its possible role in times of crisis has not yet been raised. Relying on a panel estimation of a gravity model incorporating cultural proximity parameters, we evidence the existence of a significant surge in the impact of the different components of cultural proximity during economic recession. The trade resilience among countries sharing a cultural bond is not a pure composition effect as it also appears within product categories. To understand this unexpected effect, we discuss different mechanisms that emphasize the potential mitigating influence of cultural proximity on some determinants of the trade collapse, namely the uncertainty shock, the increased moral hazard and the emergence of ethnocentric preferences.

Z10|Revisiting gender differences in ultimatum bargaining: experimental evidence from the US and China|Abstract We report results from a replication of Solnick (Econ Inq 39(2):189, 2001), which finds using an ultimatum game that, in relation to males, more is demanded from female proposers and less is offered to female responders. We conduct Solnick’s (2001) game using participants from a large US university and a large Chinese university. We find little evidence of gender differences across proposer and responder decisions in both locations.
Z10|Gender and central banking|Female Central Bank chairs represent but a tiny minority. To understand why, this article analyzes socio-economic and socio-political characteristics of the countries where women have chaired Central Banks. Then, it suggests that gender differences in preferences as regards monetary policy goals may have some influence. This hypothesis is based on an empirical analysis showing that female Central Bank chairs focus more than their male counterparts on achieving the price stability goal. This means, then, that women are more resistant than men to political pressures. Finally, it concludes that gender differences in degree of conservatism may be an explanatory factor in female underrepresentation in the Central Bank chairs.
Z10|Inequality, redistribution and cultural integration in the Welfare State|This paper constructs a simple theoretical political economy model to analyze the dynamic interactions between redistribution, public good provision and cultural integration of minority groups. Cultural differentiation erodes the support for general public good provision and vertical redistribution, reducing in turn the attractiveness of adoption of the mainstream culture by the minority groups. Our model shows the possibility for multiple politico-cultural steady state trajectories depending strongly on the initial degree of cultural differentiation in the society. An exogenous increase in income inequality is shown to increase the likelihood of multiple steady state trajectories. In a context with multiple minority groups, cultural fragmentation favors integration into the mainstream culture.
Z10|How Beliefs Influence Behavior: Confucianism and Innovation in China|Previous studies have studied how religious beliefs may affect economic activity. We extend this literature by examining how Confucianism is linked to innovative activities at the firm level in China. We analyze the relationship between Confucianism and several proxies for inputs and outputs of innovative activities. Our results show that Confucianism is significantly related to lower levels of innovative activities regardless of which measure for firm-level innovation we use. We also find that type of ultimate ownership influences this relationship, with innovation among state-controlled firms being significantly more affected by Confucianism. This study thus adds to the understanding of how traditional belief systems influence behavior at the firm level.
Z10|Seasonal Social Preferences|Christmas is when people are expected to act selflessly for the well-being of others, but are people actually more altruistic at this time of the year? Responding to this question poses a challenge because of the confounding factors of charitable tax breaks, reciprocity motives, direct social pressure and persuasive campaigns for giving that are more prevalent in December. In this paper, I use a unique solicitation situation where these factors are eliminated. Using nine years of data and more than 50 million individual giving decisions, I provide three main results. First, the month of December is associated with an 18 percent increase in the proportion of donors, thereby providing strong support to the notion of seasonal social preferences. Second, exploiting a reform that changed the price of giving, I find that this December effect is equivalent to a 42 percent discount on charitable giving. Finally, half of the December increase in generosity persists into January before returning to the baseline in February.

Z10|Significance of Social Capital in Socio-economic Development of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Social capital is used in interdisciplinary research as an analytical tool for explaining how culture, trust, and cooperation between people may be put into a function of general good, economic development and society in general. The objective of this paper consists of identification and analysis of status in the field of groups and networks, trust and solidarity, collective action and cooperation, information and communication, social cohesion and inclusion, and empowerment and political action, as key dimensions of social capital, and all in the context of overview of its significance in socio-economic development of Bosnia and Herzegovina. For the purpose of implementation of the named aim, a secondary and primary research has been conducted (by surveying 100 members of the top management teams in Bosnian and Herzegovinian SMEs). The research results show a relatively unsatisfactory status in the area of observed dimensions of social capital in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the decision makers and creators of socio-economic policies should put in a more significant effort in the area of development of social capital which has a significant potential in the context of incitement of socio-economic development.
Z10|Institutional Transplant and Cultural Proximity: Evidence from Nineteenth-Century Prussia|The economic impact of an institutional transplant depends on the underlying cultural envi-ronment of the receiving country. This paper provides the first evidence that the positive effect of importing good institutions cancels out when the receiving territories are characterized by cultural traits in conflict with those embedded in the imported institutions. We obtain this result using county-level data from late nineteenth-century Prussia. This environment allows us to exploit both the quasi-natural experiment generated by the radical Napoleonic institutional reforms and the deeply rooted cultural heterogeneity across Prussian counties. First, using religious affiliation as a proxy of cultural commonality, we find no effect of French institutions in Protestant areas. Then, using hand-collected data on pre-Napoleonic reigns we show that kingdoms with stronger ties to French culture exhibit a more effective transplant even when controlling for institutional proximity. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that cultural compatibility between the country exporting the institution and the receiving areas is a significant determinant of a successful transplant.
Z10|Can a common currency foster a shared social identity across different nations? The case of the euro|Fostering the emergence of a “European identity” was one of the declared goals of the euro adoption. Now, years after the physical introduction of the common currency, we investigate whether there has been an effect on a shared European identity. We use two different datasets in order to assess the impact of the euro adoption on the fostering of a self-declared “European Identity”. We find that the effect of the euro is statistically insignificant. We interpret this result as suggesting that the euro did not have the desired positive effect on feelings of European identity. This result holds important implications for European policy makers. It also sheds new light on the formation of social identities.
Z10|The Origins and Long-Run Consequences of the Division of Labor|This research explores the deep historical roots and persistent effects of the division of labor in pre-modern societies. It advances the hypothesis, and establishes empirically that population diversity had a positive causal effect on the division of labor. Based on a novel ethnic level dataset combining geocoded ethnographic, linguistic and genetic data, this research exploits the exogenous variation in population diversity generated by historical migratory patterns to causally establish that higher levels of population diversity were conducive to economic specialization and the emergence of trade-related institutions that, in turn, translated into differences in pre-modern comparative development. Additionally, this research provides suggestive evidence that regions historically inhabited by pre-modern societies with higher levels of economic specialization have higher levels of contemporary occupational heterogeneity, economic complexity and development.
Z10|The Macrogenoeconomics of Comparative Development|"The importance of evolutionary forces for comparative economic performance across societies has been the focus of a vibrant literature, highlighting the roles played by the Neolithic Revolution as well as the prehistoric ""out of Africa"" migration of anatomically modern humans in generating worldwide variations in the composition of human traits. This essay provides an overview of the literature on the macrogenoeconomics of comparative development, underscoring the significance of evolutionary processes and human population diversity in generating differential paths of economic development across societies. Furthermore, it examines the contribution of Nicholas Wade's recent hypothesis, regarding the evolutionary origins of comparative development, to this important line of research."
Z10|Gender Differences in the Link between Income and Trust Levels: Evidence from Longitudinal Data|We investigate the effect of individual income on interpersonal trust levels, using longitudinal survey data for 22,219 Australians over the 2005-2014 period. Our results produce two key insights. First, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for individual-level fixed effects, as the income coefficient goes from positive and statistically significant in a pooled regression to negative and statistically significant in a fixed effects panel model. Second, this negative effect of income on trust holds only for men, and not for women. This result appears to be concentrated among males who are young and moving from no income to positive income, but employment status is not the driving factor. Further, we explore a potential channel via psychological characteristics and find evidence of men reporting greater levels of neuroticism and fretfulness following an increase in income but, again, women do not. In turn, neuroticism and fretfulness are robust predictors of decreased trust levels; these additional findings are based on cross-sectional variation only, since both these variables are available in only one of the survey waves to date.
Z10|The Ideological Roots of Institutional Change|Why do some societies fail to adopt more e¢ cient institutions in response to changing economic conditions? And why do such conditions sometimes generate ideological backlashes and at other times lead to transformative sociopolitical movements? We propose an explanation that highlights the interplayó or lack thereofó between new technologies, ideologies, and institutions. When new technologies emerge, uncertainty results from a lack of understanding how the technology will Öt with prevailing ideologies and institutions. This uncertainty discourages investment in institutions and the cultural capital necessary to take advantage of new technologies. Accordingly, increased uncertainty during times of rapid technological change may generate an ideological backlash that puts a higher premium on traditional values. We apply the theory to numerous historical episodes, including Ottoman reform initiatives, the Japanese Tokugawa reforms and Meiji Restoration, and the Tongzhi Restoration in Qing China.
Z10|Roots of Autocracy|This research explores the origins of the variation in the prevalence and nature of political institutions across globe. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that variation in the inherent diversity across human societies, as determined in the course of the exodus of Homo sapiens from Africa tens of thousands of years ago, shaped the nature of political institutions across regions and societies. The study establishes that, while human diversity has amplified the beneficial e?ects of institutions, mitigating the adverse e?ects of non-cohesiveness, its simultaneous contribution to heterogeneity in cognitive and physical traits has fostered the scope for domination, leading to the formation and persistence of autocratic institutions. A larger degree of human diversity within societies diminished cohesiveness and therefore stimulated the emergence of institutions that have mitigated the adverse e?ects of non-cohesiveness on productivity. However, the dual impact of human diversity on the emergence of inequality and class stratification have diverted the nature of the emerging institutions towards extractive, autocratic ones. Developing a novel geo-referenced dataset of genetic diversity and ethnographic characteristics among ethnic groups across the globe, the analysis establishes that genetic diversity contributed to the emergence of autocratic pre-colonial institutions. Moreover, the findings suggest that the contribution of diversity to these pre-colonial autocratic institutions has plausibly operated through its dual e?ect on the formation of institutions and class stratification. Furthermore, reflecting the persistence of institutional, cultural, and genetic characteristics, the spatial distribution of genetic diversity across the globe has contributed to the contemporary variation in the degree of autocracy across countries.
Z10|Segregation and Fertility: the Case of the Roma in Serbia|We study the effect of residential segregation on fertility for the socially excluded and marginalized Roma ethnic minority. Using original survey data we collected in Serbia, we investigate whether fertility differs between ethnically homogeneous and mixed neighborhoods. Our results show that Roma in less segregated areas tend to have significantly fewer children (around 0.9). Most of the difference arises from Roma in less segregated areas waiting substantially more after having a boy than their counterparts in more segregated areas. We account for the endogeneity of the level of segregation using (il)legal possibility to build in the area at the time of its creation as an instrument. We find that the true gap due to segregation is actually larger than that estimated by OLS (around 1.4). We finally provide evidence that exposure to the Serbian majority culture is the main mechanism at play, as opposed to differences in opportunity cost of time, migration patterns, family arrangements and returns to education.
Z10|TV and entrepreneurship|We empirically analyse whether television (TV) can influence entrepreneurial identity and incidence. To identify causal effects, we utilise a quasi-natural experiment setting. During the division of Germany after WWII into West Germany with a free-market economy and the socialistic East Germany with centrally-planned economy, some East German regions had access to West German public TV that - differently from the East German TV - transmitted images, values, attitudes and view of life compatible with the free-market economy principles and supportive of entrepreneurship. We show that during the 40 years of socialistic regime in East Germany entrepreneurship was highly regulated and virtually impossible and that the prevalent formal and informal institutions broke the traditional ties linking entrepreneurship to the characteristics of individuals so that there were hardly any differences in the levels and development of entrepreneurship between East German regions with and without West German TV signal. Using both, regional and individual level data, we show then that, for the period after the Unification in 1990 which made starting an own business in East Germany, possible again, entrepreneurship incidence is higher among the residents of East German regions that had access to West German public TV, indicating that TV can, while transmitting specific images, values, attitudes and view of life, directly impact on the entrepreneurial mindset of individuals. Moreover, we find that young individuals born after 1980 in East German households that had access to West German TV are also more entrepreneurial. These findings point to second-order effects due to inter-personal and inter-generational transmission, a mechanism that can cause persistent differences in the entrepreneurship incidence across (geographically defined) population groups.
Z10|The World Heritage list: Which sites promote the brand? A big data spatial econometrics approach|Abstract UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention encourages inscribed sites to promote the World Heritage brand by clearly communicating their affiliation. Based on the feedback from over 319,000 visitors at 791 locations, we create an index that shows the extent to which World Heritage sites are actually branding themselves as such. We find great heterogeneity throughout the list and explain this econometrically with site-specific incentives. Notably, the sites that benefit more from the World Heritage brand are significantly more willing to contribute to the collective brand than sites that benefit less. Specifically, rural sites are much better branded than urban sites, as rural sites benefit more from the brand than urban sites. We also find a positive relationship between World Heritage branding and its conservation status and a U-shaped relationship between a site’s visitor numbers and its branding. Furthermore, Asian sites are much better branded than sites in the Middle East, and richer countries and those with already more international tourists are branded less. The difficulty of effective branding, e.g., for large, open-access sites, has no significant effect. Our findings suggest that mandatory World Heritage branding obligations would have a positive effect on the World Heritage brand equity, bringing conservation and economic benefits to a much wider range of World Heritage sites.
Z10|Irrigation, Collectivism and Long-Run Technological Divergence|This paper explores the historical origins of collectivist cultural norms and their longterm economic consequences. In its first part, I test the hypothesis that collectivism emerged historically in pre-industrial agricultural economies in which group effort was crucial for subsistence. I find a positive and significant association between the traditional use of irrigation - a production mode that required extensive collaboration and coordination within groups of farmers - and collectivist norms today. Instrumenting traditional irrigation by the environmental suitability for irrigated agriculture lead to similar results that point at a causal interpretation of the findings. I find that the effects persist in migrants, and investigate factors that hinder the transmission of collectivism. The second part of the paper shows that by affecting culture, past irrigated agriculture continues to influence contemporaneous innovation at the national and individual level. While irrigated agriculture is associated with greater technological progress in pre-modern societies, this relationship is reversed in the long-run. In addition, by favoring attitudes towards obedience, past irrigation also predicts patterns of job specialization and selection into routine-intensive jobs of countries and individuals.
Z10|Entrepreneurial Status, Social Norms, and Economic Growth|We offer a behavioural approach on the relation between growth and volatility, based on a monetary growth model where entrepreneurs borrow funds to invest in projects that produce capital goods. In addition to their varying pecuniary returns, different projects also vary with respect to the status they confer to the entrepreneurs who operate them. We show that social status promotes capital accumulation. We also show that, even when the status-induced increase of marginal utility is constant over time, the interaction between status and inflation is an additional source of transitional dynamics. When a social norm links this increase of marginal utility to past outcomes, however, the dynamics can generate endogenous cycles in the transition to the balanced growth path.
Z10|Economic Growth and the Cultural Transmission of Attitudes towards Education|This analysis investigates path-dependencies in a growing economy where altruistic parents try to inculcate their children with a behavioural trait that is conducive to human capital formation. The initial stock of physical capital is critical because it shapes the population dynamics of behavioural traits which, in turn, impinge on the formation of physical and human capital. Despite the absence of a complementarity in the process of cultural instruction, the long-run equilibrium can also depend on the initial distribution of behavioural traits among the population, as long as the efficiency of the external elements of cultural transmission is sufficiently low for households with parents who did not adopt the human capital-promoting trait when they, themselves, were young.
Z10|'Acting Wife': Marriage Market Incentives and Labor Market Investments|Do single women avoid career-enhancing actions because these actions signal undesirable traits, like ambition, to the marriage market? While married and unmarried female MBA students perform similarly when their performance is unobserved by classmates (on exams and problem sets), unmarried women have lower participation grades. In a field experiment, single female students reported lower desired salaries and willingness to travel and work long hours on a real-stakes placement questionnaire when they expected their classmates to see their preferences. Other groups' responses were unaffected by peer observability. A second experiment indicates the effects are driven by observability by single male peers.
Z10|From Extreme to Mainstream: How Social Norms Unravel|Social norms are typically thought to be persistent and long-lasting, sometimes surviving through growth, recessions, and regime changes. In some cases, however, they can quickly change. This paper examines the unraveling of social norms in communication when new information becomes available, e.g., aggregated through elections. We build a model of strategic communication between citizens who can hold one of two mutually exclusive opinions. In our model, agents communicate their opinions to each other, and senders care about receivers' approval. As a result, senders are more likely to express the more popular opinion, while receivers make less inference about senders who stated the popular view. We test these predictions using two experiments. In the main experiment, we identify the causal effect of Donald Trump's rise in political popularity on individuals' willingness to publicly express xenophobic views. Participants in the experiment are offered a bonus reward if they authorize researchers to make a donation to an anti-immigration organization on their behalf. Participants who expect their decision to be observed by the surveyor are significantly less likely to accept the offer than those expecting an anonymous choice. Increases in participants' perceptions of Trump's popularity (either through experimental variation or through the “natural experiment” of his victory) eliminate the wedge between private and public behavior. A second experiment uses dictator games to show that participants judge a person less negatively for publicly expressing (but not for privately holding) a political view they disagree with if that person's social environment is one where the majority of people holds that view.
Z10|Historical Antisemitism, Ethnic Specialization, and Financial Development|For centuries, Jews in Europe have specialized in financial services. At the same time, they have been the victims of historical antisemitism on the part of the Christian majority. We find that present-day financial development is lower in German counties where historical antisemitism was higher, compared to otherwise similar counties. Households in counties with high historical antisemitism have similar savings rates but invest less in stocks, hold lower bank deposits, and are less likely to get a mortgage-but not to own a house-after controlling for wealth and a rich set of current and historical covariates. Present-day antisemitism and supply-side forces do not appear to fully explain the results. Present-day households in counties where historical antisemitism was higher express lower trust in finance, but have levels of generalized trust similar to other households.
Z10|The strategy of Russia’s economic development: From reference to referent|(On the book by L. P. Evstigneeva and R. N. Evstigneev “The strategy of Russia’s economic development: A theoretical aspect”) Based on a brief review of the book “The strategy of Russia’s economic development: A theoretical aspect” by L. P. Evstigneeva and R. N. Evstigneev, the author introduces the reader to its basic ideas and shares with him/her his thoughts. The key idea is the economic synergy (or symbol in the language of semiotics), the essence of which (reference) is disclosed in detail in the book; the emphasis is not just on the new paradigm, adequate to humanitarian civilization (referent), but also on the ability to ensure the transition from the reference to the referent.
Z10|The health costs of ethnic distance: evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa|We show that ethnic distances can explain the ethnic inequalities in child mortality rates in Africa. Using individual level micro data from DHS surveys for fourteen Sub-Saharan African countries combined with a novel high resolution dataset on the spatial distribution of ethnic groups we show that children whose mothers have a higher linguistic distance from their neighbours have a higher probability of dying. Fractionalization reduces the probability of child death. We argue that fractionalization reflects a higher stock of knowledge and information leading to better health outcomes. Knowledge does not flow smoothly to linguistically distant groups. Linguistically distant mothers also have a lower probability of knowing about the oral rehydration product (ORS) for treating children with diarrhoea.
Z10|Measures of interpersonal trust: Evidence on their cross-national validity and reliability based on surveys and experimental data|Interpersonal trust (i.e. trust in other people) is an issue of high interest to both policy-makers and researchers seeking to understand what drives social and economic outcomes. However, for trust to usefully inform policy and analysis it is necessary to have valid and reliable measures of it. Despite a large body of evidence on the relationship between trust and other social and economic outcomes, evidence on the validity of trust from experimental data is conflicting. In particular, while many studies find no correlation between survey measures of trust and experimental measures at an individual level, other studies suggest a significant, if modest, correlation at the country level. This article examines the relationship between survey and experimental measures of trust in others using a large dataset containing aggregate experimental and survey measures of trust from 167 studies conducted in 36 countries. Importantly, the dataset also includes individual measures of both survey and behavioural trust in seven countries, and data from two panel studies with repeated survey measures of trust. Using these multiple data sources, the paper investigates the degree to which survey measures of interpersonal trust are valid at both an individual and cross-country level. The paper shows the existence of a significant correlation between survey and experimental measures of interpersonal trust at the country-level. Evidence on measurement errors in existing small-scale studies underscores the importance of developing better quality data from both surveys and experiments.
Z10|Heritability of time preference: Evidence from German twin data|Intergenerational correlations of time preference are well documented. However, there is still limited empirical evidence about the role of genetics in this transmission process. In our paper, we use data on roughly 3,000 twins from the German TwinLife project to estimate the heritability of time preference. We rely on an experimentally validated survey measure of temporal discounting, namely, self-assessed patience. The analysis of monozygotic and dizygotic twins enables us to apply standard biometric models. We find that genetic differences explain up to 23 percent of individual variation in patience. Whereas the additive genetic effect and common environmental effects are of minor importance, a major dominant genetic effect is present. These results indicate a notable degree of genetic infuence on economic time preferences.
Z10|Agricultural Returns to Labor and the Origins of Work Ethics|We examine the historical determinants of differences in preferences for work across societies today. Our hypothesis is that a society’s work ethic depends on the role that labor has played in it historically, as an input in agricultural production: societies that have for centuries depended on the cultivation of crops with high returns to labor effort will work longer hours and develop a preference for working hard. We formalize this prediction in the context of a model of endogenous preference formation, with altruistic parents that can invest in reducing their offsprings’ disutility from work. To empirically found our model, we construct an index of potential agricultural labor intensity, that captures the suitability of a location for the cultivation of crops with high estimated returns to labor in their production. We find that this index positively predicts work hours and attitudes towards work in contemporary European regions. We find support for the hypothesis of cultural transmission, by examining the correlation between potential labor intensity in the parents’ country of origin and hours worked by children of European immigrants in the US.
Z10|The Impact of Sports Participation on Crime in England between 2012 and 2015|This paper estimates the relationship between sports participation and two broad categories of crimes – property crimes and person crimes- in 323 local authorities in England between 2012 and 2015. The aim of this paper is to assess whether participation in sporting activities influences an individual’s decision to engage in crime. Furthermore, the impact of socioeconomic conditions on crime are estimated also. The results of this paper indicate that sport participation reduces crime rates for both property and person crimes in English local authorities between 2012 and 2015. The findings suggest that sports participation has a stronger effect on person crimes as opposed to property crimes. The results show that a 10% increase in sports participation leads to a fall in person crimes of 1.30 and 1.56% while a 10% increase in sports participation rates leads to a fall in property crimes of between 0.64 and 0.73%.
Z10|Local Authorities’ contribution on Gastronomy Tourism Development: the case of Ontario, Canada|The role of Local Government (LG) in achieving tourism development is extremely important. A characteristic example is the province of Ontario in Canada, which managed with the assistance of the Ministries of Tourism and Culture and with the cooperation of the private sector, to create an effective tourism development tool promote the region through its gastronomy - Ontario Culinary Tourism Alliance (OCTA), a non-profit, industry driven organization which leads the implementation of the provincial Culinary Tourism Strategy. Specifically, the municipalities, the ministry and the enterprises assigned to OCTA to develop a comprehensive, Strategic Action Plan 2005-2015 for the Development of Gastronomy Tourism in order to make Ontario, firstly, the primary culinary tourism destination across Canada, and then worldwide. OCTA connects and coordinates successfully all food tourism stakeholders of Ontario
Z10|The effect of culture on fiscal redistribution: Evidence based on genetic, epidemiological and linguistic data|Using a set of innovative instruments qualified by the literature, we investigate the effect of individualist culture on fiscal redistribution. Our analysis suggests that societies characterized by less collectivistic culture present higher levels of fiscal redistribution, as proxied by government subsidies and transfers as well as health and education expenses.
Z10|Running with a Mask? The Effect of Air Pollution on Marathon Runners’ Performance|Using a sample of over 0.3 million marathon runners in 37 cities and 55 races in China in 2014 and 2015, we estimate the air pollution elasticity of finish time to be 0.041. Our causal identification comes from the exogeneity of air pollution on the race day because runners are required to register a race a few months in advance and we control for city fixed effects, seasonal effects, and weather condition on the race day. Including individual fixed effects also provides consistent evidence. Our study contributes to the emerging literature on the effect of air pollution on short-run productivity, particularly on the performance of athletes engaging outdoor sports and other workers whose jobs require intensive physical activities.
Z10|Generational Shifts in Managerial Values and the Coming of a Unified Business Culture: A Cross-National Analysis Using European Social Survey Data|Abstract In a globalizing world, cross-national differences in values and business culture and understanding these differences become increasingly central to a range of organizational issues and ethical questions. However, various concerns have been raised about extant empirical research on cross-national dissimilarities in the cultural values of managers (what we refer to as managerial values) and the development of a unified business culture. This paper seeks to address three such concerns with the literature on convergence versus divergence of cultural values. It develops an empirical approach to the study of changing business cultures that revolves around birth cohorts and intergenerational values shifts and aims to advance empirical knowledge of the dynamics of cross-national differences in the cultural values of managers. We use time-series data covering 68,708 managers and are able to consider a sample of 32 countries that represent more than half of the cultural clusters recognized in the literature. Results reveal diverse shifts in managerial values across birth cohorts with cross-national dissimilarities waning for some basic cultural dimensions (“convergence”), remaining stable for other dimensions (“cultural stability”), and becoming more pronounced for other dimensions still (“divarication”). Moving beyond the standard convergence/divergence taxonomy, we conclude that a full-fledged convergence–stability–divarication perspective provides the best basis for thinking about the subtle ways in which business cultures are changing.
Z10|The use of identity primes to explain behavioral differences between groups: A methodological note|Although economists are increasingly using behavioral experiments to study variation in preferences among human groups (e.g., males vs. females), relatively little attention has been paid to the inferential limitations of such experiments. Focusing on group identity primes, this methodological note considers the conditions under which researchers are able to identify causes and explain differences in behavior or preferences between groups. Main concern is that group identity priming (or other approaches to strengthening causal inference in such experiments) are not a panacea and that a persistent omitted variables problem continues to hamper identification of specific causes of group differences in preferences. This note develops a framework for thinking systematically about the treatment effects of priming individuals’ group identity and possible approaches to clean identification of specific group-level traits explaining differences in preferences between groups. Unpacking observed effects of group membership on preferences and identifying specific causes of group differences is paramount from the perspective of policy implications and I clarify the framework's usefulness using concrete examples.
Z10|Social trust, workplace organization, and the comparative advantage of nations|In this paper, I consider a specific channel through which trust between parties to an exchange can go on to affect nations’ comparative advantage in certain industries. My approach revolves around the autonomy that employers (principals) grant to workers (agents), which is a key feature of workplace organization. I hypothesize that social trust generates a comparative advantage in industries with more autonomous micro production environments. I employ individual-level data on work autonomy to construct a measure of the extent to which industries are characterized by autonomy in the production process. Results of a cross-country cross-industry analysis confirm that countries with higher levels of social trust have a comparative advantage in high-autonomy industries and vice versa. Results are robust to the possibility of reverse causality. The paper’s key contribution is to provide a link between the microeconomic literature on workplace organization and the comparative macroeconomic literature on social trust.
Z10|Impact of Organizational Culture on the Pakistani Hotels Workforce's Job Satisfaction: Qualitative Report|The influence of organizational culture on the level of job satisfaction depends on the ability to cope up with the stress and working environment. This investigation tackle the purpose of Denison’s prototypical for searching the organizational culture and Spector JGS assessment to inspect workforce job gratification in the course of 5 points Likert Scale. The investigation studied 220 hotel employees from middle range 3 star hotels in Pakistan. For interpretation, researchers chiefly used MS Excel for classifying, coding, and fractionizing raw facts into processed meaningful themes. Current investigation demonstrates that employee’s job satisfaction chiefly dependent on organizational culture. The study undertakes in the direction of achieving organizational goals by initiating fortify strategies towards building the strength to obtain the objective. Moreover if organizations built a strong environment of learning as a part of their culture than it boosts the commitment level of employees. Further, it also helps employees to unfolding their career achievements. On the other hand, it is observed that females are occupied with higher level of job satisfaction while males have lower. Although, high level of job satisfaction exists but its more evident by this research that premiums, bonuses, and other types of incentives aid employees to lead from low level of job satisfaction to reach on their higher apex level of job satisfaction.
Z10|Receptivity and Innovation|In this study, we investigate the relationship between receptivity to novelty and innovation. Consumers’ receptivity to novelty, as an individual propensity toward new goods, might be perceived to encourage innovation at the aggregate level unambiguously. On analyzing data from the World Values Survey and the World Intellectual Property Organization, however, we find that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between average receptivity and innovation at country level; receptivity may not always be conducive to innovation. To capture a mechanism behind this counterintuitive fact, we develop a new dynamic general equilibrium model with the understanding that innovation consists of two separate activities of inventing new goods and introducing them to the society. In our model, consumer receptivity encourages firms to invent but discourages them from introducing. Interacted with population size and the elasticity of substitution, these opposing forces generate a non-monotonic relationship. While economies with moderate receptivity can achieve sustained innovation and thereby long-run growth, those with too much or too little receptivity are likely to be caught in an underdevelopment trap, in which innovations eventually fail. These results suggest a theory that explains the inverted-U.
Z10|Explaining the Impact of Formal Institutions on Social Trust: A Psychological Approach|By drawing on psychological models of action choice, this study distinguishes between four key factors that determine trust building: (1) knowledge to trust, (2) others-regarding, (3) cognition, and (4) contexts. These four factors are combined into a single analytical framework that is used for establishing channels through which the institutional context impacts social trust formation. Our theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that context is the strongest determinant of trust, with its overall effect being, however, modified by the degree to which the individual’s knowledge of trusting, cognition, and others-regarding are developed. The Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) data from the year 2012 are utilised for testing our propositions.
Z10|Trust as a Skill: Applying Psychological Models of Skill Acquisition to Explain the Social Trust Formation Process|This study uses psychological models of skill acquisition to explain how social trust is formed. We view trust as being shaped by four factors: crystallized, cognitive, contact, and context. We combine these four factors into a 4C-component analytical model by establishing links between them and explaining the rationale behind their individual and joint effects on trust. The proposed model is tested with the PIAAC public-use data. Both theoretical and empirical elaborations suggest that context is the strongest driver of trust formation. Good contexts also spur more trust when individuals already possess crystallized knowledge and can display faith in others. Such knowledge can be learned if it is missing, but how efficiently depends on the quality of one’s cognitive system, frequency of contacts with others, and the distance between one’s actual knowledge of trust and the optimal trust level for the given context.
Z10|Estimating Sustainable Development and Social Exclusion in Rural Pakistan|There are various aspects of sustainable development and social exclusion. Sustainable development commonly refers to the processes that meet the needs of individuals or groups without depleting social, political and economic resources. On the other hand, social exclusion refers to individuals or groups being deprived of participation in these processes. There is a vast body of international literature that defines these processes, but very little detailed empirical analysis available on rural Pakistan. This paper presents a situational analysis of sustainable development and social exclusion in rural Pakistan, using the Pakistan Rural Household Survey (Round 2) data1, set to compute the flexible multidimensional social exclusion index. This social exclusion index is based on various domains including material resources, education, health, living standard, financial hardship and food security, economic shocks, personal safety and societal and political participation. Each domain is defined by several indicators. A simple „sum-score‟ technique is used to estimate the depth of social exclusion at the household level. This social exclusion indicator is then aggregated to measure exclusion at the ethnic, regional and provincial level. These decentralized results can be used to formulate policies to help marginalized societies/ communities at the local and regional levels.
Z10|The Impact of Social Media On Belief Formation|Social media are becoming increasingly important in our society and change the way people communicate, how they acquire information, and how they form beliefs. Experts are concerned that the rise of social media may make interaction and information exchange among like-minded individuals more pronounced and therefore lead to increased disagreement in a society. This paper analyzes a learning model with endogenous network formation in which people have different types and live in different regions. I show that when the importance of social media increases, the amount of disagreement in the society first decreases and then increases. Simultaneously people of the same type hold increasingly similar beliefs. Furthermore, people who find it hard to communicate with people in the same region may interact with similar people online and consequently hold extreme beliefs. Finally, I propose a simple way to model people who neglect a potential correlation of signals and show that these people may be made worse off by social media.
Z10|Cultural Determinants of Household Saving Behavior|We analyze whether culture affects the saving behavior of households and which cultural channels matter for this household decision. To disentangle cultural effects from economic and institutional factors, we study how the saving behavior of second-generation immigrants relates to the attitudes and beliefs in the respective countries of origin. Using data from Germany and the UK, we find that culture significantly determines household saving behavior. The two cultural components that we robustly identify to affect saving rates are the attitudes towards thrift and the wealth accumulation motive: second-generation immigrants from countries that value thrift and wealth accumulation more tend to save more in Germany. By linking parents to their children, we present evidence that these attitudes are related to the saving behavior of both parents and children. We also provide evidence that future-orientation is related to the saving behavior through the intergenerational transmission of language, rather than the direct transmission of attitudes.
Z10|Cultural Preferences in International Trade: Evidence from the Globalization of Korean Pop Culture|The Korean pop culture (TV dramas and K-pop music) has grown immensely popular across the globe over the past two decades. This paper analyzes its impacts on international trade. We compile a cross-country panel dataset of South Korea's TV show exports to over 150 countries for the period of 1998-2014. These variations in exposure to Korean pop cultures are used to identify changes in consumer preferences for Korean merchandise across time, countries, and products (at the HS 4-digit level). First, we find that more Korean TV show exports significantly increase Korean exports of goods for women, while the effects are much smaller on men's merchandise. This strongly supports the demand-side preference mechanism, because supply-side factors can hardly generate such gender bias within the same product category. Second, we find that the TV show effect is much stronger for consumer goods than capital or intermediate goods. Third, we show that there exist significant and positive effects even for goods that are not actively advertised. Together, these findings provide evidence on the importance of cultural preferences and their diffusions in economic exchanges.
Z10|Family Economics Writ Large|Powerful currents have reshaped the structure of families over the last century. There has been (1) a dramatic drop in fertility and greater parental investment in children; (2) a rise in married female labor-force participation; (3) a significant decline in marriage; (4) a higher degree of positive assortative mating; (5) more children living with a single mother; and (6) shifts in social norms governing premarital sex and married women's roles in the workplace. Macroeconomic models explaining these aggregate trends are surveyed. The relentless flow of technological progress and its role in shaping family life are stressed.
Z10|"The Import of ""Cultural Goods"" and Emigration: an Unexplored Relation"|The paper examines the effect of the import of cultural goods as defined by UNESCO (2009): cultural heritage, performance, visual arts, books, audio-visual material and design on emigration decisions. The import of cultural goods, by affecting individual preferences, reduces the cost of any migration move and favors outflows towards exporting countries. A gravity model for 33 OECD destination countries and 184 sending ones has been estimated for the period 2009-2013. The issue of identification and endogeneity has been addressed through the inclusion of a comprehensive set of fixed effects and by instrumenting cultural imports with past flows and an imputed share of cultural imports à la Card (2001). The positive relationship is robust across different classifications for cultural goods, areas of destination and alternative econometric techniques.
Z10|Measuring productivity dispersion:Lessons from counting one-hundred million ballots|We measure output per worker in nearly 8,000 municipalities in the Italian electoral process using ballot counting times in the 2013 general election and two referenda in 2016. We document large productivity dispersion across provinces in this very uniform and low-skill task that involves nearly no technology and requires limited physical capital. Using a development accounting framework, this measure explains up to half of the firm-level productivity dispersion across Italian provinces and more than half the north-south productivity gap in Italy. We explore potential drivers of our measure of labor efficiency and find that its association with measures of work ethic and trust is particularly robust.
Z10|Culture, diffusion, and economic development: The problem of observational equivalence|This research explores the direct and barrier effects of culture on economic development. It shows both theoretically and empirically that whenever the technological frontier is at the top or bottom of the world distribution of a cultural value, there exists an observational equivalence between absolute cultural distances and cultural distances relative to the frontier, preventing the identification of its direct and barrier effects. Since the technological frontier usually has the “right” cultural values for development, it tends to be in the extremes of the distribution of cultural traits, generating observational equivalence and confounding the analysis. These results highlight the difficulty of disentangling the direct and barrier effects of culture. The empirical analysis finds suggestive evidence for direct effects of individualism and conformity with hierarchy, and barrier effects of hedonism.
Z10|Global Racist Contagion following Donald Trump’s Election|Using a causal inference in a cross-country regression design made possible by the coincidence that the 2016 US Presidential election occurred during the fieldwork period of the European Social Survey (ESS8), we test whether Donald Trump’s unexpected win increased the willingness to report racist attitudes. The election significantly increased the gap between the opposition to different-race immigration, which did not change, vs. same-race immigration, which significantly decreased. The finding, robust to a large set of checks, is shown to be substantially shaped by socioeconomic and partisan identities. In particular, the causal effect of Donald Trump’s unexpected win on the willingness to report racist attitudes is stronger among old men living in urban areas. Moreover, the aggregate effect is driven by extreme right-wing units with high level of political interest.
Z10|Review of information systems research for media industry–recent advances, challenges, and introduction of information systems research in the media industry|Abstract Global media reports clearly show a tremendous increase in spending on Information Technology (IT) and Information Systems (IS) in the media sector. Two main trends are currently visible. First, as stated in McKinsey & Company’s Global Media Report, consumers continuously shift from spending on traditional media products towards rapidly-increasing spending on digital services and media products – consumer patterns have rapidly changed. Second, as stated in Gartner’s reports about the media industry, spending on IT services in the media industry increases gradually, and as a whole, the media industry is the third-largest spender on IT, after banking/finance and manufacturing. Third, as reported by both authors in their works, several facets of the media industry have undergone extreme changes, including business models, declining revenue, content models, management, economics and public funding. The aim of this study is to investigate research work related to IS in the media industry, in particular in the management and economic areas. To conduct this study, we investigated a large corpus of studies that have been contributed to IS research within the Association for Information Systems (AIS) within the past decades. We utilised advanced text mining methods to identify contributions and thematic areas. Our results clearly indicate that there is a significant downward trend of research works dealing with media industry aspects. This trend was a surprise to us, as it contradicts the emergence of new digital technologies which became key drivers in the media industry after 2009. We conclude this article by giving research directions, illustrating the opportunities and importance of investigating media industries within the context of IS, and introducing the research field of Information Systems in the eMedia Industry.
Z10|Bowling for Fascism: Social Capital and the Rise of the Nazi Party|Using newly collected data on association density in 229 towns and cities in interwar Germany, we show that denser social networks were associated with faster entry into the Nazi Party. The effect is large: one standard deviation higher association density is associated with at least 15 percent faster Nazi Party entry. Party membership, in turn, predicts electoral success. Social networks thus aided the rise of the Nazis that destroyed Germany's first democracy. The effects of social capital depended on the political context: in federal states with more stable governments, higher association density was not correlated with faster Nazi Party entry.
Z10|The drunk side of trust: Social capital generation at gathering events|We present a case study to assess the relation between alcohol intake and trust generation at a cultural gathering event. Over a span of six editions (2012–2017), we interviewed and elicited blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of nearly 2,000 attendees of the final concert of “La Notte della Taranta Festival”, the biggest concert in Europe dedicated to traditional music (about 200,000 participants per year). Once controlling for the BAC of respondents, and for the belief about own and others’ BAC, we find that alcohol, consumption during the event is positively correlated with trust generation towards other attendees. Furthermore, looking at the amount of trust devoted to drinkers (the drunk side of trust), we find a positive correlation with both own measured BAC and own believed BAC. Considered together, we argue that these two results are indicative of endogenous group formation in terms of alcohol consumption: drinking during event attendance positively correlates with increased trust to other drinkers in the event audience.
Z10|Eradicating Women-Hurting Customs: What Role for Social Engineering?|Social engineering refers to deliberate attempts, often under the form of legislative moves, to promote changes in customs and norms that hurt the interests of marginalized population groups. This paper explores the analytical conditions under which social engineering is more or less likely to succeed than more indirect approaches when it comes to suppress gender-biased customs. This implies discussing the main possible interaction frameworks leading to anti-women equilibria, and deriving policy implications from the corresponding games. The theoretical arguments are illustrated by examples drawn from available empirical works, thus providing a reasoned survey of the literature.
Z10|Cultural Preferences and the Choice between Formal and Informal Financing|This paper documents significant differences in the financing structure of small firms with managers of diverse cultural backgrounds. To separate the effect of culture from other factors that affect the financing structure of firms, we exploit cultural heterogeneity within a geographical area with shared regulations, institutions, and macroeconomic cycles. Our findings suggest that there exist significant differences in the culturally embedded preferences towards the use of formal and informal sources of financing (bank loans and trade credit). Our results are robust to alternative explanations based on potential differences in credit constraints and in the distribution of cultural origins across industrial sectors, trading partners, and headquarters location.
Z10|The Import of “cultural goods” and emigration: an unexplored relation|The paper examines the effect of the import of cultural goods as defined by UNESCO (2009): cultural heritage, performance, visual arts, books, audio-visual material and design on emigration decisions. The import of cultural goods, by affecting individual preferences, reduces the cost of any migration move and favors outflows towards exporting countries.

The positive relationship is robust across different classifications for cultural goods, areas of destination and alternative econometric techniques
Z10|Ancestry, Diversity & Finance: Evidence from Transition Economies|In this paper, we analyze the growth effects of historical and biological ancestry, diversity and financial development in transition economies. We show that the common indicators of ethnolinguistic fractionalization, state history and genetic distance yield significant results and to some extent transform the impact of finance on growth in East-Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. Deep ethnolinguistic cleavages produce insignificant results, whereas at intermediate and lower levels of aggregation diversity is likely to significantly improve the effect of finance on growth. Similarly to finer ethnolinguistic cleavages, genetic distance from the United States also favorably increases the relevance of financial development for growth. However, state history as a proxy for long-run ancestral exposure to institutions, political organization and centralization reinforces the negative growth effect of financial development. We argue that financial development is inclined to resolve problems arising from coordination failures and absence of trust in diverse societies by easing liquidity constraints and offering incentives for entrepreneurship to minority groups. In contrast, long state history is likely to generate extractive institutions that facilitate the provision of soft budget constraints. Genetic distance from the United States induces higher reliance on continental rather than Anglo-Saxon financing practices, and therefore increases dependence on banks rather than bonds or equity for external liquidity purposes.
Z10|Shacklean Uncertainty and Cultural Embeddedness as Innovation Constraints in the UK|We focus on both individual and local uncertainty to explain the innovation potential of entrepreneurs in the NUTS1 UK regions in 2005 and 2009. The ‘potential surprise function’ (Shackle, 1949) clarifying why sometimes promising business choices are truncated is taken as a determinant of an entrepreneur’s innovation decision. GEM (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor) data and data on psychological types are used in the empirical analysis. The econometric estimation strategy addresses both the issue of selection bias (due to uncertainty) and that of zero-inflated data (i.e., presence of only a few highly innovative actors in comparison to the majority in our sample). Findings suggest that local uncertainty is the predominant determinant of individual entrepreneurial choice. The regional effect appears to amount to about 4% of the innovation differences across NUTS1 UK regions, while almost one third of it is determined by the local level of uncertainty bias. Thus, the novelty of the present study is that it shows how differences in local cultural tolerance to uncertainty may explain differences in the quantity of truncated innovative ideas among localities.
Z10|TV and Entrepreneurship|Can TV influence the entrepreneurial decisions of individuals? To identify causal effects, we utilize a quasi-natural experiment, namely that during the division of Germany after WWI into the capitalistic West Germany and the socialistic East Germany, West TV was exogenously available only in some regions of the latter. Using regional and individual data, we show that, after the Reunification, entrepreneurship is higher among the residents of East German regions with West TV signal, indicating a direct effect of TV on the entrepreneurial mindset of exposed individuals. Moreover, we find second-order effects due to intergenerational transmission, which cause persistent differences.
