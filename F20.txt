F20|Transfer Pricing and Corporate Social Responsibility: Arguments, Views and Agenda|The central thesis of the paper is that Multinational Companies (MNC) should invest in the use of â€œsoftâ€ methods (socially responsible behavior) to mitigate costs in society accrued due to use of â€œhardcoreâ€ tax evasion tactics (Transfer mispricing) to maximize profits from operations in developing countries and/or countries with weak or inefficient tax laws and tax collection institutions. Therefore, we articulate the argument of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as an indirect compensation for transfer mispricing. Our aim is not to present CSR as solution to transfer mispricing. An analytical approach is based on a content analysis of the existing literature with emphasis on a case study. We first discuss the dark side of transfer pricing (TP), next we present the link between TP and poverty and finally we advance arguments for CSR as a compensation for transfer mispricing. While acknowledging that TP is a legal accounting practice, we argue that in light of its poverty and underdevelopment externalities, the practice per se should be a strong defence for CSR because it is also associated with schemes that deprive developing countries of the capital essential for investment in health, education and development programmes.
F20|Sustaining cultural tourism through higher female participation in Nigeria: the role of corporate social responsibility in oil host communities|This paper adds to the gender discourse in sustainable African tourism development from the corporate social responsibility (CSR) perspective. Specifically, we examine the impact of CSR on the development of rural women in cultural tourism. A total of 600 rural women were sampled across the Niger Delta. Results from the use of a logit model indicate a significant relationship between CSR and cultural tourism development in oil host communities in Nigeria. This implies that CSR of a multinational oil company (MOC) is a critical factor for sustaining cultural tourism. The findings suggest increased female participation in General Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) interventions of MOC and the need to pay close attention to which extent the participation of rural women in the GMoU projects may be limited by cultural and traditional obstacles.
F20|Production Network and International Fiscal Spillovers|This paper analyzes the impact of fiscal spending shocks in a multi-country model with international production networks. In contrast to standard results suggesting that production network linkages are unimportant for the aggregate response to macro shocks in a closed economy, we show that network structures may place a central role in the international propagation of fiscal shocks, particularly when wages are slow to adjust. The paper first develops a simple general equilibrium multi-country model and derives some analytical results on the response to fiscal spending shocks. We then apply the model to an analysis of fiscal spillovers in the Eurozone, using the calibrated sectoral network structure from the World Input Output Database (WIOD). In a version of the model with sticky wages, we find that fiscal spillovers from Germany and other some other large Eurozone countries may be large, and within the range of empirical estimates. More importantly, we find that the Eurozone production network very important for the international spillovers. In the absence of international production network linkages, spillovers would be only a third as large as predicted by the baseline model. Finally, we explore the diffusion of identified German government spending at the sectoral level, both within and across countries. We find that government expenditures have both significant upstream and downstream effects when these links are measured by the direction of sectoral production linkages.
F20|Making Carbon Taxation a Generational Win Win|Carbon taxation has been studied primarily in social planner or infinitely lived agent models, which trade off the welfare of future and current generations. Such frameworks obscure the potential for carbon taxation to produce a generational win-win. This paper develops a large-scale, dynamic 55-period, OLG model to calculate the carbon tax policy delivering the highest uniform welfare gain to all generations. The OLG framework, with its selfish generations, seems far more natural for studying climate damage. Our model features coal, oil, and gas, each extracted subject to increasing costs, a clean energy sector, technical and demographic change, and Nordhaus (2017)’s temperature/damage functions. Our model’s optimal uniform welfare increasing (UWI) carbon tax starts at $30 tax, rises annually at 1.5 percent and raises the welfare of all current and future generations by 0.73 percent on a consumption-equivalent basis. Sharing efficiency gains evenly requires, however, taxing future generations by as much as 8.1 percent and subsidizing early generations by as much as 1.2 percent of lifetime consumption. Without such redistribution (the Nordhaus “optimum”), the carbon tax constitutes a win-lose policy with current generations experiencing an up to 0.84 percent welfare loss and future generations experiencing an up to 7.54 percent welfare gain. With a six-times larger damage function, the optimal UWI initial carbon tax is $70, again rising annually at 1.5 percent. This policy raises all generations’ welfare by almost 5 percent. However, doing so requires levying taxes on and giving transfers to future and current generations ranging up to 50.1 percent and 10.3 percent of their lifetime consumption. Delaying carbon policy, for 20 years, reduces efficiency gains roughly in half.
F20|Spillovers and Exports: A Meta-Analysis|This study uses meta-analysis to analyze the empirical literature on spillovers and exports. It collects 3,291 estimated spillover effects from 99 studies. The estimated spillover effects in the literature span a large number of types and measures of both exports and spillovers. As a result, we transform estimates to partial correlation coefficients (PCCs). We analyze these transformed effects using four different versions of Weighted Least Squares estimators, incorporating both meta-analytic “Fixed Effects” and “Random Effects”. Our analysis produces three main findings. First, while we estimate a mean overall effect of spillovers on exports that is statistically significant, the size of the effect is economically negligible. Second, we find evidence of positive publication bias using conventional Funnel Asymmetry Tests. However, the size of the estimated publication bias is small, and disappears in some regressions when other explanatory variables are included in the analysis. Third, using both Bayesian Model Averaging and frequentist WLS estimation, we find that some data, estimation, and study characteristics are significant in some regressions. However, only a few of the characteristics are robust, and none are large in size.
F20|Who's afraid of Virginia WU? The labor composition and labor gains of trade|There are various ways to indicate the importance of international trade. In this paper, we use the ‘labor footprint’ concept to gain new insights into the implications of trade for employment. We focus on the US, but also provide information on 39 other, mostly developed, countries for the period 1995-2008. We show that US consumption increasingly depends on foreign workers. At the same time, US labor has benefited from new jobs generated by the world economy, especially in the services sector. Next we compare labor footprints with labor endowments to evaluate the capacity of countries to be self-sufficient in terms of labor in a hypothetical situation of autarky and perfect labor mobility. This counterfactual exercise reveals that most countries in our study are able to produce all output for consumption themselves. However, once the assumption that labor is perfectly mobile across skill levels and that all unemployed workers accept a job when offered one is relaxed, most countries can no longer be self-sufficient. That is, these countries would not be able to sustain their current consumption pattern.
F20|International Capital Allocations and the Lucas Paradox Redux|This paper studies the marginal product of private capital (MPK) with new data and a new framework to obtain a better understanding of international capital allocations and the Lucas Paradox (LP). Our point of departure is three influential studies of MPK’s and, based on the most recently available data, the LP is either sustained, inverted, or rejected. We then introduce three improvements in measuring spot MPK’s, and the LP clearly reemerges. While these results are provocative, they may be misleading because they do not recognize the dynamics of the capital accumulation process toward steady-states. We develop and estimate a model that allows us to map spot MPK’s into steady-state MPK’s. The LP remains; the steady-state MPK’s for poor countries is 48% to 77% higher than for rich countries. Four policy implications follow from these estimates. First, there is a great deal of misallocated capital globally: 14% to 21% of the global capital stock. Second, this misallocation is primary due to the difference between country-specific steady-state MPK’s and the global MPK that would maximize world output. Third, the benefits of optimally reallocating capital and eliminating the LP are modest: 1.0% to 1.5% of global output or $873 to $1,309 billions of 2019 US dollars. Fourth, the estimates for both misallocation and reallocation depend crucially on the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. Our empirical work uncovered three new puzzles that have emerged beginning in 1990, 1) the MPK’s for both poor and rich countries have been rising sharply, 2) the gap has been widening, and 3) the steady-state MPK’s exceed the average spot-MPK’s. The later result is inconsistent with the Dynamic Inefficiency, Saving Glut, or Secular Stagnation hypotheses.
F20|Bilateral Trade Imbalances|In standard quantitative models, bilateral trade imbalances are determined by aggregate trade imbalances, expenditure and production patterns, and trade wedges. We calibrate such a model using recent data on incomes, factor endowments, and sector-level expenditures, outputs and bilateral trade flows for 40 economies and the rest of the world. Large pairwise asymmetries in trade wedges are needed for the model’s bilateral-trade predictions to match the data. They account for 21-35% of the standard deviation of bilateral trade imbalances. Aggregate imbalances play a minor role, while more than 50% of the variation is explained by international differences in production and expenditure patterns.
F20|Fracking: viabilidad económica y ambiental en Colombia|Conocer el valor del desarrollo de la explotación de hidrocarburos para el sostenimiento de las finanzas de la economía colombiana es de vital importancia para entender cómo las técnicas de extracción no convencionales, como el fracking, pueden ser una alternativa para el crecimiento y complemento de la matriz energética del país. En este sentido, es conveniente evaluar en detalle las múltiples consecuencias económicas y ambientales que trae consigo la aplicación de tales técnicas, que pueden verse magnificadas en un contexto como el colombiano. Este documento se encarga de hacer una revisión histórica sobre la extracción de petróleo en Colombia en las últimas dos décadas enfocada, principalmente, en cómo el desarrollo se vería afectado por la implementación de las técnicas de fracturación hidráulica para la explotación de yacimientos no convencionales. El objetivo principal del artículo es dar a conocer cómo funciona esta técnica y los argumentos a favor y en contra de su implementación; se revisa la experiencia de Estados Unidos y se pretende predecir qué efectos se tendrán en materia social, económica y ambiental para el país. *** Knowing the value of the development of the hydrocarbons exploitation to sustain the finances of the Colombian economy is of vital importance to understand how non-conventional extraction techniques, such as Fracking, can be an alternative for growth and a complement the country's energy matrix. In this sense, it is convenient to evaluate in detail the multiple economic and environmental consequences brought about by the application of such techniques, which can be magnified in a context such as the Colombian one. This document reviews the history of oil extraction in Colombia over the last two decades, focusing mainly on how development would be affected by the implementation of hydraulic fracturing techniques for the exploitation of non-conventional oil deposits. The main objective of the article is to show how this technique works and the arguments for and against its implementation; it reviews the experience of the United States and aims to predict what effects will have in social, economic and environmental matters for the country.
F20|Moving ideas across borders: Migrant inventors, patents and FDI|The purpose of this paper is to gain insights into the exact mechanisms through which migration enhances the innovative performance of multinational firms and fosters Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). We develop a formal model showing that migrants may help firms to increase the perceived quality of their products at the host country of investment. This can be done by patent an invention that permits the customization of products in order to meet foreign quality standards. We focus on a very specific type of migrants: Those who cross borders and patent an invention (migrant inventors). The structural estimation of our model using high-dimensional PPML 2SLS confirms our theoretical priors at both the intensive and the extensive margins. A placebo test reveals that non-inventor migrants are not a good instrument to capture the effect of patents on FDI. Additionally, a structural PPML gravity estimation shows that both patents and migrants inventors fosters Greenfield FDI, with a larger impact on the intensive margin. Our estimations also reveal certain sectoral heterogeneity.

F20|Global innovation networks for Chinese high tech small and medium enterprises: the supportive role of highly skilled migrants and returnees|Literature investigating highly skilled Chinese migrants has so far focused on their role as drivers of new entrepreneurship as well as innovation in firms and regions, although their role in supporting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) engagement in global innovation networks (GINs) is still underexplored. The participation in GINs is key for high tech SMEs, which rely on sophisticated knowledge but may not have the same absorptive capacity of large firms and multinational corporations. Based on primary data from a case study on 19 SMEs in the IT and new media industry in Beijing, this paper investigates the role of returnees and highly skilled migrants in supporting the engagement of Chinese high-tech SMEs in GINs. The results reveal the important role of those individuals in bringing SMEs in former international knowledge networks and establishing new linkages for sourcing key knowledge.
F20|GVC journeys: Industrialisation and deindustrialisation in the age of the second unbundling|Offshoring and participation in global value chains (GVCs) are critical to understanding the rapid deindustrialisation of G7 nations and the rapid industrialisation of a handful of developing nations. This paper distinguishes between trade in final goods and trade in parts to track the shifting pattern of the location of manufacturing. We introduce a simple empirical measure of comparative advantage in parts on one hand and in final goods on the other. We illustrate how this distinction can help organise thinking on the patterns of industrialisation and deindustrialisation—namely the ‘GVC journeys’ of advanced and emerging economies. We also provide one simple model. The model highlights the interactions of trade costs and the knowledge transfers to accompany offshoring of parts production and assembly, which we call trade-led versus knowledge-led globalisation.

F20|The Importance Of Culture For The Development Of Nations: A Comparative Between Developed Countries And Emerging Markets|"The paper evaluates the influence of cultural aspects on innovation, comparing emerging markets to developed countries. The assumption that guide the paper is that individualistic nations are risk-takers and tend to show higher innovation rates; whereas countries whose relations are more hierarchical, and therefore with high power distance, tend to be less innovative. It was conducted a multivariate data analysis from 56 nations, divided into developed and emerging countries, according to the International Monetary Fund criteria, that defines 36 countries as ""advanced economies"". The results indicate that confidence in population is related to a country?s degree of innovation. Nations with greater trust between individuals who are related tend to have a higher innovation index, while, on the other hand, countries in where people tend to have greater confidence in their neighborhood and community, have a lower chance of being innovative."
F20|Testing the Smile Curve: Functional Specialisation in GVCs and Value Creation|According to the ‘smile curve hypothesis’ the potential for generating value added varies significantly across the various functions along a firm’s value chain. It suggests in particular that the production stage is the least promising value chain function in the entire manufacturing process. This logic implies that countries specialising as ‘factory economies’ are likely to generate comparatively little value added. To shed light on the relationship between functional specialisation along the value chain and value creation, this paper develops measures for functional specialisation derived from project-level data on greenfield FDI for a global sample of countries. These measures keep the industry and the functional dimension of specialisation strictly apart. They are used to test econometrically the negative relationship between value added creation and functional specialisation in production as predicted by the smile curve hypothesis.
F20|Brexit: Bremsspuren beim Handel zwischen Britannien und Deutschland|Noch immer ist unklar, wann die Briten die EU verlassen werden. Es deutet aber viel darauf hin, dass der Brexit schon heute die Handelsbeziehungen zwischen dem Vereinigten Königreich und Deutschland beeinflusst hat. Das ist zum einen der Unsicherheit darüber geschuldet, ob es zu einem geordneten Austritt mit Übergangsfrist oder einem ungeordneten Verlassen des Vereinigten Königreichs kommt. Die Unsicherheit hat zu einem Investitionsabsentismus in Britannien beigetragen. Zum anderen hat die deutliche Abwertung des britischen Pfunds britische Exporte begünstigt und britische Importe verteuert, was über einen Preisanstieg die Dynamik des privaten Konsums gebremst hat. Insgesamt zeigte sich durch den Brexit ein dämpfender Einfluss auf die britische Volkswirtschaft, der sich auch in den Handelsbeziehungen niedergeschlagen hat. Während die deutschen Exporte in die Europäische Union insgesamt im Zeitraum 2015 bis 2018 um 12,4 Prozent wuchsen, gingen die deutschen Ausfuhren in das Vereinigte Königreich um 7,8 Prozent zurück. Hieraus ergibt sich eine Differenz von gut 20 Prozentpunkten. Die deutschen Einfuhren aus der EU-27 stiegen um 14,7 Prozent an, die Einfuhren aus dem Vereinigten Königreich gingen um 3,5 Prozent zurück. Auch im längerfristigen Vergleich des deutsch-britischen Außenhandels zeigte sich eine nennenswerte Veränderung. Von 1991 bis 2015 wuchsen die deutschen Exporte in das Vereinigte Königreich im Jahresdurchschnitt um 5,3 Prozent, von 2015 bis 2018 ergab sich ein jahresdurchschnittlicher Rückgang um 2,7 Prozent. Bei den deutschen Einfuhren aus Britannien zeigte sich ein ähnliches Bild. Bei Kraftwagen und Kraftwagenteilen, die einen Anteil von knapp einem Viertel am deutsch-britischen Außenhandel haben, sanken die deutschen Exporte in das Vereinigte Königreich im Dreijahreszeitraum 2018 gegenüber 2015 um knapp 23 Prozent, die Importe von dort um 13,6 Prozent. Pharmazeutische Erzeugnisse hatten mit einem Minus von 41,5 Prozent den stärksten relativen Exportrückgang zu verzeichnen; auf der Importseite gab es dagegen kaum eine Veränderung. Kraftwagen- und Kraftwagenteile sowie pharmazeutische Erzeugnisse zählen zu den Branchen mit engen britisch-deutschen Vorleistungsverflechtungen. Das deutet darauf hin, dass der Umbau der britisch-deutschen Wertschöpfungsketten bereits im Gange ist. Blickt man näher auf den Güteraustausch der fünf außenhandelsstärksten Bundesländer, so weisen alle fünf einen Rückgang der Exporte in das Vereinigte Königreich auf. In drei Ländern sanken auch die Importe; in Bayern blieben sie praktisch unverändert, in Hessen nahmen sie gegen den Trend deutlich zu.
F20|Globalization misguided views|Today, the world is in an evident disarray; many things seem to have gone wrong at once. Various topics: terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, black accounts; financial crises, income distribution, global coordination; or the social angriness and growing anti-migration —nationalistic-protectionist— sentiments and policies, show that something has changed for the worse. As we will see, all these events have a common deep cause that we must first understand, in order to be able to cope with its consequences. We are living a technological revolution that, in many ways, surpasses the so-called Industrial Revolutions, particularly because of the speed at which it is bringing change. We defend that institutions have not yet adapted to the new world that this technological revolution has brought about. Today’s inadequate institutional arrangements are sustained by old concepts or economic theories and ideas that no longer work as they did before. This mismatch between the new technological world and the old institutions explains most of today’s world economic problems.
F20|What Place does Luxembourg hold in Global Value Chains?|The paper analyses the place held by Luxembourg in global value chains (GVC) by relying on trade in value added data retrieved from OECD inter-country input-output tables, available over the period 1995-2011. The analysis is multifaceted as the role of Luxembourg in GVC is analyzed across 50 advanced and emerging market economies, at the country level, at the sector level and over time. Results show that Luxembourg acts as an important chain-link in GVC as evidenced by its strong upstream and downstream interconnections with other partner countries. Luxembourg is primarily a buyer of foreign value added and less a seller of domestic value added. The major part of Luxembourg’s GVC trading partners is located in Western Europe suggesting that the supply chain network is not global for Luxembourg but rather regional. Notwithstanding this, the share of East Asian and Eastern European emerging countries - albeit relatively low compared to advanced economies - is increasing over the period of analysis. A similar observation prevails for the geographical breakdown of the origin (destination) of foreign (domestic) value added for domestic (foreign) final demand at the end of the value chain. The analysis unveils that Luxembourg possesses a comparative advantage in GVC in the finance and insurance industry. It is from the latter sector that the country retrieves the most important share of value added from GVC participation.

F20|Do both demand-following and supply-leading theories hold true in developing countries?|To overcome the limitations of the traditional approach which uses linear causality to examine whether the supply-leading and demand-following theories hold. As certain countries will be found not to follow the theory by using the traditional approach, this paper first suggests using all the proxies of financial development and economic growth as well as both multivariate and bivariate linear and nonlinear causality tests to analyze the relationship between financial development and economic growth. The multivariate nonlinear test not only takes into consideration both dependent and joint effects among variables, but is also able to detect a multivariate nonlinear deterministic process that cannot be detected by using any linear causality test. We find five more countries in which the supply-leading hypothesis and/or demand-following hypothesis hold true than with the traditional approach. However, there is still one country, Pakistan, for which no linear or nonlinear causality is found between its financial development and economic growth.
F20|Oligopolistic Competition And Economic Geography|ABSTRACT This paper studies a general equilibrium model of economic geography in which firms engage in oligopolistic competition. This framework is conducive to analytic results. With increasing returns, oligopolistic competition leads to interindustry trade between regions rather than intraindustry trade. The choice of appropriate technology is a channel of concentration of industries.
F20|Globalization and the Jobs Ladder|Globalization affects the mix of jobs available in an economy and the rate at which workers gain skills. We develop a model in which firms differ in terms of productivity and workers differ in skills, and use the model to examine how globalization affects the wage distribution and the career path of workers as they move up the jobs ladder. We calibrate the model using many of the same parameters and targeting the same moments of the US economy as Melitz and Redding (2015) and then investigate the impact of globalization. Our results indicate that although falling trade costs results in greater wage inequality, it also leads to a wider path up the jobs ladders and less time spent in entry level jobs. The key assumptions and predictions are confirmed in data on recruitments and job mobility in Sweden.
F20|Regional disparities and migration in member states EU|Certainly, the spatial distribution of economic activities is far from uniform in many countries European Union and significant differences at national and at regional level are still persistent. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare regional disparities in member states of European Union and estimate the effect of regional migration flows on convergence of regions. This study focuses on income and employment, these two factors are considered as major determinants of migration and on the contrary, migration can contribute to reducing income and employment disparity between regions. The econometric analysis uses panel data primarily from Eurostat Database.
F20|The Joint Impact of Infrastructure and Institutions on Economic Growth| This paper examines the joint impact of infrastructure capital and institutional quality on economic growth using a large panel data set covering 120 countries and spanning the years 1980-2015. The empirical strategy involves estimating a simple growth model where, in addition to standard controls, infrastructure, institutional quality and their interaction are included as explanatory variables. Potential endogeneity concerns are addressed by means of GMM estimators that utilize internal instruments. We findd that the interaction terms between infrastructure capital and institutional quality have a positive and significant impact on economic growth. These results are robust to a variety of alternative specifications and institutional quality measures. Hence, our results suggest that maximizing returns from infrastructure development requires improving the quality of institutions. Keywords: infrastructure; institutions; growth; dynamic panel JEL classification: H54, F20
F20|Cheap Talk? Financial Sanctions and Non-Financial Activity|Sanctions restrict cross-border interactions and, therefore, not only put political and economic pressure on the target country, but they also adversely affect the sender country. This paper examines the effect of financial sanctions on the country imposing them. In particular, we analyze the business responses of German non-financial entities to the imposition of sanctions on 23 countries over the period from 1999 through 2014. Examining highly disaggregated, monthly data from the German balance of payments statistics, we find four main results. First, German financial activities with sanctioned countries are sizably reduced after the imposition of sanctions, with strong reductions in the scope of cross-border activities (i.e., the extensive margin) and less robust results for total financial flows which is consistent with the concept of ‘smart sanctions’. Second, firms doing business with sanctioned countries tend to be disproportionately large, making them largely immune to the reduction in business opportunities with selected partners. Third, firms affected by sanctions expand their activities with non-sanctioned countries, some of which display close trade ties to the sanctioned country. Fourth, we find no effect of sanctions on broader measures of firm performance such as employment or total sales. Overall, we conclude that the economic costs of financial sanctions to the sender country are limited.
F20|Offshoring and the polarisation of the demand for capital|While there is a consensus in the literature that offshoring has a polarising effect on the skill structure of labour demand, little is known about its impact on the capital side. In this paper, we analyse the effect of offshoring on the demand for capital by asset class using a rich country-sector panel dataset. Estimating a system of factor demand equations, we document that offshoring reduces the relative demand for non-ICT capital, thereby also polarising the demand for capital. Our results are robust against a wide range of specifications and methodological choices including an IV approach to address endogeneity concerns.
F20|Brain Drain-Induced Brain Gain and the Bhagwati Tax: Are Early and Recent Paradigms Compatible?|Based on a welfare-maximization model of skilled migration where education generates a positive externality, this paper examines whether the early view regarding brain drain's (BD) negative impact on source countries and the Bhagwati tax (BT) associated with it, is compatible with the recent more optimistic BD-induced brain gain view. I derive BD's impact on education, welfare, optimal education subsidy (s), and a combination of s and BT, when residents' (emigrants') weight in the government's objective function is 1 (1 − β), with β ε [0,1]. I find that: i) education, welfare and s are higher (lower) under an open than under a closed economy for 1 − β larger (smaller) than the ratio of source-country to host-country income; ii) s and BT are 'policy complements,' i.e., they are positively related; and iii) BT increases with β and reaches a maximum at β = 1. Two implications and a proposal are: a) The early literature focused on resident – rather than on migrant – welfare (the β = 1 case), which is precisely where the optimal BT is largest; b) A second policy instrument should be useful, especially if there are constraints on making changes in the other one. Thus, as opening up the economy implies a lower s, raising BT should be beneficial if, say, parents' and teachers' organizations make it politically difficult if not impossible to reduce s; c) A proposal for collecting the tax is presented.
F20|Does CSR contribute to the development of rural young people in cultural tourism of sub-Saharan Africa? Evidence from the Niger Delta in Nigeria|Handicrafts are key cultural products consumed in the Nigeria’s tourism industry. Owing to low entry barriers, as handicrafts require a low level of capital investment, there is potential to develop viable linkages between tourism and local handicrafts sectors that create economic opportunities for local artisans. Thus, we assess the impact of a new corporate social responsibility (CSR) model of multinational oil companies on the development of rural young people (RYP) in cultural tourism in the Niger Delta of Nigeria. Six hundred RYP were sampled across the rural Niger Delta region. Using the logit model, results indicate that RYP have remained widely excluded from the General Memorandum of Understandings (GMoUs) interventions in cultural tourism projects due to the traditional beliefs that cultural affairs are prerogatives of elders, a caveat to the youths. This implies that if the traditions of the communities continue to hinder direct participation of the RYP from the GMoUs cultural tourism project interventions, achieving equality and cultural change would be limited in the region. The findings suggest that since handicrafts are key cultural products consumed in the tourism industry, GMoUs can play a role in helping to create an appropriate intervention structure that will be targeted towards youth empowerment in the area of traditional handicraft. This can be achieved if the Cluster Development Boards (CDBs) would focus on integrating rural young artisans into local tourism value chains and ensuring that they benefit economically from the sector. The CDBs should aim at creating space for the views of rural young indigenous people’s handicrafts; emphasizing the value of indigenous knowledge, particularly on arts and crafts for tourists and expatriate in multinational corporations in Nigeria.
F20|What place does Luxembourg hold in global value chains?|The paper analyses the place held by Luxembourg in global value chains (GVC) by relying on trade in value added data retrieved from OECD inter-country input-output tables, available over the period 1995-2011. The analysis is multifaceted as the role of Luxembourg in GVC is analyzed across 50advanced and emerging market economies, at the country level, at the sector level and over time. Results show that Luxembourg acts as an important chain-link in GVC as evidenced by its strong upstream and downstream interconnections with other partner countries. Luxembourg is primarily a buyer of foreign value added and less a seller of domestic value added. The major part of Luxembourg’s GVC trading partners is located in Western Europe suggesting that the supply chain network is not global for Luxembourg but rather regional. Notwithstanding this, the share of East Asian and Eastern European emerging countries - albeit relatively low compared to advanced economies - is increasing over the period of analysis. A similar observation prevails for the geographical breakdown of the origin (destination) of foreign (domestic) value added for domestic (foreign) final demand at the end of the value chain. The analysis unveils that Luxembourg possesses a comparative advantage in GVC in the finance and insurance industry. It is from the latter sector that the country retrieves the most important share of valueadded from GVC participation.
F20|Central Bank Reputation and Inflation-Unemployment Performance: Empirical Evidence from an Executive Survey of 62 Countries|Although there is a well-established theoretical literature that links central bank (CB) reputation with inflation performance following Barro and Gordon, there is little empirical work testing the relationship rigorously. This paper empirically tests the impact of reputation on inflation-unemployment performance using a novel set of data on CB reputation--an annual local business manager survey on central bank policy covering 62 countries during 1995-2016. This paper finds that CB reputation is a significant determinant of inflation: the results of an FE panel and Arellano-Bond difference GMM model show that high-reputation CBs have achieved better inflation performances over the past 20 years with lower levels of inflation than others, holding the output gap and unemployment rate constant. This result remains robust to various control variables including money growth, past inflation levels, exchange rates, and financial crisis dummies. This paper also finds that high CB reputation is associated with a tight anchoring of inflation expectations to inflation targets in inflation-targeting countries. The effects of reputation on the volatility of inflation and unemployment rates are found to be not robust. This paper offers evidence of the opposite-direction causality as well that goes from high inflation to decreased CB reputation.
F20|Analysis of Changes in Determinants of Foreigners¡Ç Bond Investment before and after the Global Financial Crisis: The Case of Korea (in Korean)|This study employs regression analysis and variance decomposition based on portfolio selection and interest rate parity theories to examine whether the determinants of foreigners' bond investment for Korea, such as the degrees of arbitrage opportunities as well as global and country risks, have changed after the global financial crisis. Empirical results show that arbitrage opportunities played a more important role in the pre-crisis period (2004-07), while risk factors were more influential in the post-crisis period (2010-17). In addition, the explanatory power of the regression model decreased after the crisis, which implies that the influence of variables other than arbitrage opportunities and risk factors may have increased.
F20|Cheap talk? Financial sanctions and non-financial activity|Sanctions restrict cross-border interactions and, therefore, not only put political and economic pressure on the target country, but they also adversely affect the sender country. This paper examines the effect of financial sanctions on the country imposing them. In particular, we analyze the business responses of German non-financial entities to the imposition of sanctions on 23 countries over the period from 1999 through 2014. Examining highly disaggregated, monthly data from the German balance of payments statistics, we find four main results. First, German financial activities with sanctioned countries are sizably reduced after the imposition of sanctions, with strong reductions in the scope of cross-border activities (i.e., the extensive margin with fewer firms and fewer asset categories) and less statistically robust results for total financial flows (sum of inflows and outflows) which is consistent with the concept of 'smart sanctions'. Second, firms doing business with sanctioned countries tend to be disproportionately large, making them largely immune to the reduction in business opportunities with individual partners. Third, firms affected by sanctions expand their activities with non-sanctioned countries, some of which display close trade ties to the sanctioned country. Fourth, we find no effect of sanctions on aggregate variables of firm performance such as employment or total sales. Overall, we conclude that the economic costs of financial sanctions to the sender country are limited.
F20|A Model of Heterogeneous Firm Matches in Cross-Border Mergers & Acquisitions|In contrast to empirical evidence, recent theories of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) assume perfect knowledge transfers – from high to low productivity firms – between acquirer and target. Using the Melitz (2003) model of heterogeneous firms, we develop a matching model of cross-border M&As which allows for both perfect and imperfect knowledge transfers, where the latter leads to assortative matching on productivity for firms in cross-border M&As. This is in line with stylized facts (because M&As frequently occur between firms of similar productivity) and in contrast to the proximity-concentration trade-off (in which only the most productive firms have a physical presence in foreign markets). Allowing for M&As raises the firm viability cut-off level, average productivity and welfare in our model. The welfare benefits are weaker for more imperfect knowledge transfers.

En este apartado se incluye la mención al proyecto de transmisión de energía Colombia – Panamá. Tercero, se estudian algunas ventajas económicas que el país podría tener en términos comerciales y posibles marcos regulatorios ya existentes. Por último, se presentan algunas conclusiones.
F20|Inversión extranjera directa en Colombia. Comportamiento entre 1987 a 2017|En este documento se realiza un análisis de la inversión extranjera directa (IED) en Colombia durante las últimas tres décadas. Se presenta el comportamiento general de la IED y se afirma su importancia como principal fuente de financiación para el crecimiento y desarrollo económico del país. Este trabajo descubre que Colombia en los últimos treinta años ha tenido un flujo de IED positivo, en el cual, el sector servicios ha sido el principal impulsor sectorial desde la apertura económica. Otros determinantes importantes de la IED en Colombia son la inflación, la tasa de cambio, el nivel de apertura, el tamaño de mercado, los impuestos y el mercado laboral.
F20|Energy Market Integration and Electricity Trade: A gravity model|This paper explores energy trade in the electrical market by proving a solid theoretical model along with a comprehensive empirical analysis. The model rests on standard goods trade gravity models, which we adapt to energy trade in the electrical market. We derive a tractable gravity equation, which we then estimate with standard gravity techniques. We use energy trade ows between European countries to quantify the effect of economic, structural, cultural and institutional variables on energy ows. The results reveal that energy trade determinants are similar to trade in goods, and that standard notion of international economics like comparative advantage emerge in energy economics. However, we observe some distinctive traits. Our results suggest that energy trade ows are mainly driven by demand at the importer due to an increase in economic activity and institutional agreements in the context of energy integration.
F20|Globalization and the Jobs Ladder|Globalization might affect the mix of jobs available in an economy and the rate at which workers gain skills. We develop a model in which firms differ in terms of productivity and skills and use the model to examine how globalization affects the wage distribution and the career path of workers as they move up the jobs ladder. There are two types of skills that determine a worker’s productivity in the model: the ability to work with the appropriate technology and the ability to facilitate international commerce. Workers imperfectly acquire these skills on the job. Firms cannot costlessly observe the skills embodied in a worker but can observe each potential recruit’s employment history. In equilibrium, firms self-select into groups that use different networks to fill vacancies. Our results indicate that although falling trade costs may result in greater wage inequality, if trade costs are initially high, it can also lead to a wider path up the jobs ladders and less time spent in entry level jobs. The key assumptions and predictions are confirmed in data on recruitments and job mobility in Sweden.

F20|Three globalizations, not two: rethinking the history and economics of trade and globalization|The conventional wisdom is that there have been two globalizations in the modern era. The first began around 1870 and ended in 1914. The second began in 1945 and is still under way. This paper challenges that view and argues that there have been three globalizations, not two. The first half of the paper provides empirical evidence for the three-globalizations hypothesis. The second half discusses its analytical implications. The Victorian first globalization and the Keynesian-era second globalization were driven by gains from trade, and those gains increased industrialized country real wages. The neoliberal third globalization has been driven by industrial reorganization motivated by distributional conflict. Trade theory does not explain the third globalization; capitalâ€™s share has increased at the expense of laborâ€™s; and there can be no presumption of mutually beneficial country gains from the third globalization.
F20|Brain Drain-Induced Brain Gain and the Bhagwati Tax: Are Early and Recent Paradigms Compatible?|Based on a welfare-maximization model of skilled migration where education generates a positive externality, this paper examines whether the early view regarding brain drain’s (BD) negative impact on source countries – and the Bhagwati tax (𝐵𝑇) associated with it – is compatible with the recent more optimistic BD-induced brain gain view. I derive BD’s impact on education, welfare, the optimal education subsidy (𝑠), and a combination of 𝑠 and (the optimal) 𝐵𝑇, when residents’ (emigrants’) weight in the government’s objective function is 1 (1−𝛽), with 𝛽 𝜖 [0,1]. I find that: i) education, welfare and 𝑠 levels are higher (lower) under an open than under a closed economy for 1−𝛽>(
F20|Firm-to-Firm Relationships and Price Rigidity - Theory and Evidence|Economists have long suspected that firm-to-firm relationships might increase price rigidity due to the use of explicit or implicit fixed-price contracts. Using transaction-level import data from the U.S. Census, I study the responsiveness of prices to exchange rate changes and show that prices are in fact substantially more responsive to these cost shocks in older versus newly formed relationships. Based on additional stylized facts about a relationship’s life cycle and interviews I conducted with purchasing managers, I develop a model in which a buyer-seller pair subject to persistent, stochastic shocks to production costs shares profit risk under limited commitment. Once structurally estimated, the model replicates the empirical correlation between relationship age and the responsiveness of prices to shocks. My results suggest that changes to the average length of relationships in the economy - e.g., in a recession, when the share of young relationships declines - can influence price exibility and hence the effectiveness of monetary policy.
F20|On the optimal design of place-based policies: A structural evaluation of EU regional transfers|We quantify general equilibrium effects of place-based policies in a multi-region framework with population mobility, trade and agglomeration economies. Using detailed data on EU transfers, we infer the local effects of different transfer types on productivity, income and transportation cost. Based on these estimates and the general equilibrium model we derive the spatial distribution of economic activity and the resulting aggregate welfare effects if (i) no transfers were paid and taxes set to zero, (ii) transfers were distributed uniformly, (iii) transfers were welfare-optimally distributed. Characterizing the optimal distributions, we reveal complementarities between transfer types and between transfers and local endowments.
F20|The Life-Cycle Dynamics of Exporters and Multinational Firms|This paper studies the life-cycle dynamics of exporters and multinational enterprises (MNEs). We present a dynamic model of trade and MNE activity in which the mode of serving a market depends on the well-known proximity-concentration tradeoff. We show that the option of performing MNE activities in the model produces life-cycle patterns for exporters that differ from those in an export-only model. Calibrating our model to rich firm-level data from France and Norway, our main quantitative finding is that a reduction in trade costs triggers much larger responses in growth rates and exit rates, for young exporters, in the model with MNEs than in the model without MNEs. We also show that the model is largely consistent with a set of new facts on the joint life-cycle dynamic behavior of exporters and MNEs.
F20|Determinantes de las relaciones reales de intercambio de España con Alemania (1970-2010). Un análisis econométrico de la ventaja absoluta de costo intrasectorial|El presente trabajo tiene como objeto analizar los determinantes de las relaciones reales de intercambio de España con Alemania, tomando como período 1970-2010. Para tal propósito, se lleva a cabo un análisis de series temporales aplicando pruebas de raíces unitarias y un test de cointegración, siendo el marco teórico de referencia el enfoque de Anwar Shaikh de la ventaja absoluta de costo intrasectorial. Finalmente, el análisis econométrico constata que el tipo de cambio real efectivo entre España y Alemania se encuentra sujeto en el largo plazo a los costos laborales unitarios reales relativos de la industria manufacturera de ambos países. ***** The main aim of this paper is to analyse the determinants of the real terms of trade between Spain and Germany during the 1970-2010 period. In order to do so, we have used unit root and cointegration tests, in which our theoretical framework is the absolute cost advantage that was developed by Anwar Shaikh. Finally, our econometric analysis discovered that the real effective rate exchange between Spain and Germany is, in the long term, subject to the real unit labour costs of manufacturing sectors.
F20|Panel de VAR : una aplicación en la movilidad de factores de producción en la integración económica Alianza del Pacífico|Resumen: Este trabajo presenta la aplicación de un modelo de panel de Vectores Autorregresivos (pVAR) para la estimación de un conjunto de coeficientes en un escenario dinámico, con variación en el tiempo de los mismos. Se toma como referencia el bloque de países de la Alianza del Pacífico. Se estudian las relaciones entre éstos, especialmente las vinculadas con los factores de producción como la mano de obra y capital; sobre los cuales se generan impulsos. Se encontró que en términos comerciales la Alianza del Pacífico no representa innovaciones y que las alteraciones del empleo y stock de capital desvían levemente las tasas de crecimiento del PIB de los cuatro países, presentándose un rápido retorno al estado estacionario de las mismas. / Abstract : This paper presents the application of one panel-vector autoregressive (p-VAR) model for estimating a coefficient set in a dynamic scenario, which allows for observing variations throughout time. The Pacific Alliance countries bloc is taken as a reference. The relations between these are studied, especially those related to the factors of production such as labor and capital; On which impulses are generated. It was found that in commercial terms the Pacific Alliance does not represent innovations and that the alterations of the employment and stock of capital slightlydeviate the rates of growth of the GDP of the four countries, being presented a fast return to the steady state.
F20|How Important are Spillovers from Major Emerging Markets?|The seven largest emerging market economies -China, India, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Indonesia, and Turkey- constituted more than one-quarter of global output and more than half of global output growth during 2010-15.These emerging markets, which we call EM7,are also closely integrated with other countries, especially with other emerging and frontier markets. Given their size and integration, growth in EM7 could have significant cross-border spillovers. We provide empirical estimates of these spillovers using a Bayesian vector auto regression model. We report three main results. First, spillovers from EM7 are sizeable: a 1 percentage point increase in EM7 growth is associated with a 0.9 percentage point increase in growth in other emerging and frontier markets and a 0.6 percentage point increase in world growth at the end of three years. Second, sizeable as they are, spillovers from EM7 are still smaller than those from G7 countries (Group of Seven of advanced economies). Specifically, growth in other emerging and frontier markets, and the global economy would increase by one-half to three times more due to a similarly sized increase in G7 growth. Third, among the EM7, spillovers from China are the largest and permeate globally.
F20|Structural asymmetries and financial imbalances in the eurozone|Almost two decades after the introduction of the common currency diﬀerences in institutional frameworks remain a major source of cross-country heterogeneity in the eurozone. We develop a two-country model with incomplete international markets in which the availability of credit depends on the country’s institutional environment. Our main ﬁnding is that structural diﬀerences in domestic credit environments provide an explanation for the procyclicality of net capital inﬂows observed in the South of Europe. We show that frictions in domestic credit markets generate asymmetries in the transmission mechanism of shocks that are common to both regions. JEL Classification: F32, F20, G17
F20|The Term Structure of Currency Carry Trade Risk Premia|Fixing the investment horizon, the returns to currency carry trades decrease as the maturity of the foreign bonds increases. The local currency term premia, which increase with the maturity, offset the currency risk premia. The time-series predictability of foreign bond returns in dollars similarly declines with the bonds' maturities. Leading no-arbitrage models in international finance cannot match the downward term structure of currency carry trade risk premia. We derive a simple preference-free condition that no-arbitrage models need to satisfy to match the carry trade risk premia on long term bonds.
F20|Did FDI Really Cause Chinese Economic Growth? A Meta-Analysis|Foreign direct investment (FDI) has been linked to economic growth in a number of countries. Productivity spillovers at the firm level have been identified as a key element in the process by which FDI stimulates economic growth. Moreover, there is evidence of FDI-related productivity spillovers in China. Whether these spillovers have been of sufficient size to affect growth at the aggregate level, however, is an empirical question. We apply meta-analysis to the corresponding empirical literature to find an answer. Our main finding is that the effect of FDI on Chinese economic growth is much smaller than one would expect from a naïve aggregation of existing estimates. Publication bias and a profusion of estimates based on less preferred study and sample characteristics have served to inflate observed estimates. Once these effects are accounted for, the estimated effect of FDI on Chinese economic growth is reduced to statistical insignificance. This suggests that the cause(s) of the Chinese “economic miracle” likely lie elsewhere.
F20|Rebalancing in China: a taxation approach|The rebalancing of the Chinese economy is analyzed through a heterogeneous taxation of various types of firms. Based on a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model, the paper applies tax reforms to raise consumption, reduce some firms' overinvestment and maintain a high level of welfare. To rebalance consumption and investment, taxation may allow reallocating a part of the labor force to firms that are not overinvesting. Moreover, the correction of distortions in production factor costs (capital and labor) is necessary during certain reforms applied in the model; that is, on the one hand, higher credit costs for State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and, on the other hand, a catch-up of foreign firms' wages by domestic firms (public and private). In this model, firms' credit cost is a key channel because it impacts both firms' investment and household consumption (through returns on savings). These consumption and investment reforms bring welfare benefits to households, and the results are close to direct welfare maximization. In this framework, the rebalancing of the domestic demand does not require the readjustment of the external financial position because the aggregate savings rate remains high and the supply of domestic assets is reduced. Finally, another theoretical framework proposes a heterogeneous taxation of consumption across home and foreign goods to enhance consumption.
F20|Are all cycles alike? An empirical investigation of regional and global factors in developed and emerging economies|Business cycles are significantly more volatile in emerging economies than in developed ones, as has been extensively documented in the macroeconomic literature. There is also consensus that a substantial share of output volatility in emerging economies can be accounted for by domestic and idiosyncratic factors. As a result, the policy implications of these findings tend to predict that substantial welfare gains can be made from domestic policies that smooth business cycles. This paper argues the opposite view and asserts that there are no significant differences between emerging and developed economies in terms of the global and regional factors shaping macroeconomic fluctuations. Our results show that global factors account for 37%–48% of the de-trended output variance in emerging economies, substantially more than the 5%–15% range reported in the literature. By comparison, approximately half of output variance in developed economies is accounted for by global factors. We conclude that global and regional factors account for the bulk of output fluctuations in all economies, and that domestic factors are marginally more important in emerging economies than in developed ones. Therefore, cycle-smoothing domestic policies in emerging economies may not be as effective as the literature suggests.
F20|Migration and Servicification: Do Immigrant Employees Spur Firm Exports of Services?|Many countries display remarkably high dependence on services for production and employment that is incommensurate with their level of services exports. One explanation is that trade in services is more sensitive to informal and behind-the-border trade barriers such as information friction and inadequate access to foreign networks. Immigrant employees may provide access to and appeal in foreign markets through their knowledge of—and contacts in—their former home countries. We develop a heterogeneous firm framework to guide our empirical analysis and draw on new employer-employee data for nearly 30,000 Swedish firms during the period 1998-2007. The results suggest that immigrant employees facilitate services exports. Hiring one additional foreign-born worker can increase services exports by approximately 2.5 percent, on average, with a stronger effect found for skilled and newly arrived immigrants.
F20|What Can Be Learned from Spatial Economics?|Spatial economics aims to explain the location of economic activity. While the importance of the proximity to natural resources has declined considerably, distance and location have not disappeared from economic life. Recent work in spatial economics indicates that new forces, hitherto outweighed by natural factors, are shaping an economic landscape that, with its many barriers and large inequalities, is anything but flat. The location of economic activity is the outcome of a trade-off between different types of scale economies and costs generated by the transfer of people, goods, and information. This trade-off is used as a guide in our survey of the main developments in regional and urban economics, which refer to different spatial scales. The role of transport is discussed for each subfield. We briefly survey the ingredients that could be useful for a synthesis of regional and urban economics and conclude with general policy insights.
F20|Export And Population Dynamics In The States Of Baja California, Mexico And California, United States, Exportacion Y Dinamica Poblacional En Los Estados De Baja California, Mexico Y California, Estados Unidos|Internationalization is an invaluable tool to expand markets. the investment flows and relocation processes productive. However, under a systemic optic, the incursion into foreign markets requires government cooperation, business determination and social participation. The tendency of an economy to internationalize is mainly reflected in the relations of public and private companies abroad through products, services or investments. The results must be reflected in population welfare. This study determines exports per capita in the states of Baja California (Mexico) and California (United States), seeking to infer their impact on revenues distribution and economic development
F20|Convergence vs. the middle income trap: The case of global soccer|"Unconditional convergence across countries worldwide is typically rejected in terms of GDP per capita. But when focusing on a specific internationally competitive industry, such as manufacturing, rather than the overall economy, unconditional convergence has been found to hold. As the epitome of competition and globalization, this paper uses the performance of national soccer teams as a further test case. We rely on data of more than 25,000 games between 1950 and 2014 and find clear evidence of unconditional $\beta$- and $\sigma$-convergence in national team performance, as measured either by win percentages or goal difference. We argue that transfer of technologies, skills and best practices fosters this catch-up process. But there are limits: we show that good teams from Africa and Asia are failing to close the gap with top European or South American teams for reasons that are analogous to the ""middle income trap"". Lessons for other sectors include the virtues of internationally transferable human capital as well as the mixed blessings of regional integration for worldwide convergence."
F20|Market size in globalization|A salient feature of the current globalization is a loss of manufacturing in developed countries and rapid industrialization in middle-sized developing countries. This paper aims to construct a simple three-country trade and geography model with different market sizes and non-constant wage rates. The large country fosters industrial agglomeration (geographical concentration) in the early stage of globalization, but loses manufacturing in the later stage of globalization. When losing manufacturing, the large country might be worse off. Thus, the large country might have an incentive to implement welfare-maintaining policies to prevent a loss of manufacturing. All of these results can be explained by market sizes.
F20|How Important are Spillovers from Major Emerging Markets?|The seven largest emerging market economiess - China, India, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Indonesia, and Turkey - constituted more than one-quarter of global output and more than half of global output growth during 2010-15.

Second, sizeable as they are, spillovers from EM7 are still smaller than those from G7 countries (Group of Seven of advanced economies). Specifically, growth in other emerging and frontier markets, and the global economy would increase by one-half to three times more due to a similarly sized increase in G7 growth. Third, among the EM7, spillovers from China are the largest and permeate globally.
F20|Firms’ Internalisation Theories – (non) applicability for Micro- and Small Enterprises in the Bulgarian Airfreight Forwarding Market|The article discusses aspects of the popularity of firms’ internationalisation theories and their (non)applicability among micro and small enterprises in the Bulgarian market. The theories of internationalisation are classified best practices of successfully internationalised companies. In an effort to create a universal theoretical model scientists move away, in one or another aspect, from the concrete: business situations in the companies, organizational management structures, the personality of the business leaders, the business culture, the relevant economic policy, the national business infrastructure and others. The increased turbulence and business dynamics after the advent of the Internet, changed the way of doing business and questioned the applicability for today’s business conditions in Bulgaria of a number of internationalisation theories. The answer to the question of (non) applicability is sought among internationalized, due to the nature of its activities, micro and small enterprises in the airfreight forwarders sector, through personal interviews of 26.7% of companies operating in Sofia Airport, during the Feb-Nov 2014 period.
F20|Lucas Paradox in the Short-Run|This paper is concerned with whether the persistence of the Lucas paradox (that unlike what the classical economic theory would predict, capital flows to richer economies rather than poorer ones where marginal returns to capital are expected to be higher) within developing countries is because of the unobservable county-specific effects. Perhaps capital has been flowing to where it has already flowed and not necessarily where it had already been. Using five-year (rolling-averaged) panel data for up to 47 developing countries over the period 1980-2006, it examines if including the institutional quality index removes the Lucas paradox intertemporally (i.e. in the short-run). The ‘short-run’ relationships are captured by employing linear static (principally within-group fixed effects) and dynamic (system GMM) panel data methods. I demonstrate that the persistence in the Lucas paradox within developing countries is so entrenched that allowing for unobserved country-specific effects, within-group (time series) variation and autoregressive dynamics do not resolve the paradox.
F20|International stocks and flows of students and researchers reconstructed from ORCID biographies|This document describes a dataset of estimated bilateral flows and stocks of students and researchers (including some other types of high-skilled workers) for more than 200 countries (and territories) since 1990. The data is derived by analysing education and employment histories of more than 650 thousand individuals registered with ORCID. Comparison with independent data sources supports technical validity and representativeness of this data. The dataset provides new measures of the geography of a subset of high-skilled labour and opens opportunities for exploring hypotheses related to migration and agglomeration, impact of immigration policy, scientific production and development, academic mobility, and brain drain.
F20|On the Optimal Design of Place-Based Policies: A Structural Evaluation of EU Regional Transfers|We quantify general equilibrium effects of place-based policies in a multi-region framework with mobility, trade and agglomeration economies. Using detailed data on EU transfers, we infer the local effects of different transfer types on productivity, income and transportation cost. Based on these estimates and the general equilibrium model we derive the spatial distribution of economic activity and the resulting aggregate welfare effects if (i) no transfers were paid and taxes set to zero, (ii) transfers were distributed uniformly, (iii) transfers were welfare-optimally distributed. Characterizing the optimal distributions, we reveal complementarities between transfer types and between transfers and local endowments.
F20|The Effect of a Second Home Construction Ban on Real Estate Prices|In 2012, a drastic regulation prohibiting the construction of holiday and investment homes in touristic municipalities in Switzerland was surprisingly introduced. I investigate the causal effect of such a construction limitation on real estate prices. The regulation does not affect all municipalities, which provides a unique possibility to separate the municipalities into treatment and control groups. I apply the synthetic control method to estimate the causal effect of the regulation. Unlike the classic synthetic control method literature, I deal with multiple heterogeneous treatment units. This allows me to compute statistical significance precisely and construct confidence intervals. I demonstrate a salient drop in real estate prices of between - 10% and -18% three to five years after the intervention. These results are highly significant. However, no effect on prices in the first two years after the intervention is found. The decrease in prices is shown to be caused by indirect channels such as adverse effects on local economies and legal uncertainty.
F20|When Veblen meets Krugman: social network and city dynamics|Abstract The present paper explores the role of the social structure of suburban areas on city dynamics. We focus on relative concerns in the form of conspicuous consumption and introduce them into a standard economic geography model a la Krugman. We show that the level of social integration within the suburban areas of cities and the level of economic integration across cities are crucial in determining the city sizes. An interesting case arises with moderate trade costs when relatively small shares of income are devoted to the consumption of the differentiated good: if classes of workers are segregated (as in homogenous suburban areas), relative concerns tend to generate dispersed, medium-size cities; when workers of different classes socially interact, relative concerns contribute to foster socially integrated megalopolises. This result shows that keeping-up-with-the-Joneses motives may generate counterintuitive results when agents are able to choose their location.

F20|Financing and performance of female-owned firms in Middle Eastern and African Economies|Empirical evidence suggests that lack of access to financing is a major constraint to performance by female-owned firms in most countries. Firm performance, financing structure, and constraints have been well explored for firms in developed economies but this is not the case for firms in developing economies, especially in Africa and the Middle-East. Largely due to lack of data availability, existing literature on African firms has presented some survey-based evidence on firm performance and financing structures while detailed financial evidence is lacking. This paper aims at filling this research gap. We identify female-owned firms and examine the impact of ownership structure on financing and firm performance. We use cross-sectional financial data covering 25,500 companies in the Middle East and Africa for the years 2006 to 2014. Our results reveal a clear, but perhaps surprising, gender-specific pattern.
F20|A Conceptual Culture Model for Design Science Research|The aim of design science research (DSR) in information systems is the user-centred creation of IT-artifacts with regard to specific social environments. For culture research in the field, which is neces-sary for a proper localization of IT-artifacts, models and research approaches from social sciences usual-ly are adopted. Descriptive dimension-based culture models most commonly are applied for this pur-pose, which assume culture being a national phenomenon and tend to reduce it to basic values. Such models are useful for investigations in behavioural culture research because it aims to isolate, describe and explain culture-specific attitudes and characteristics within a selected society. In contrast, with the necessity to deduce concrete decisions for artifact-design, research results from DSR need to go beyond this aim. As hypothesis, this contribution generally questions the applicability of such generic culture dimensionsâ€™ models for DSR and focuses on their theoretical foundation, which goes back to Hofstedeâ€™s conceptual Onion Model of Culture. The herein applied literature-based analysis confirms the hypothesis. Consequently, an alternative conceptual culture model is being introduced and dis-cussed as theoretical foundation for culture research in DSR.
F20|The Effect of Foreign Direct Investment from Austria on Skilled and Unskilled Labor in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Foreign direct investment (FDI) is considered a major factor in the process of a country's economic development. The presence of FDI in host countries has multiple effects on their economic development. One of these effects pertains to the change in organization and composition of labor market. With that in mind, this paper studies the effect of FDI inflow from Austria on the labor market in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H). It analyzes the time series data for the period 2005 - 2014. The research of the paper is divided into two parts. The first part studies the effect of certain independent variables on the increase in real average wages of skilled and unskilled labor. The second part examines the effect of certain independent variables on the increase in the number of skilled and unskilled workers. This paper applies the North-South Model and OLS Regression. The research has shown that the impact of the majority of independent variables on dependent variables is statistically significant.
F20|Will the Paris Accord Accelerate Climate Change?|"The 2015 Paris Accord is meant to control our planet’s rising temperature. But it may be doing the opposite in gradually, rather than immediately reducing CO2 emissions. The Accord effectively tells dirty-energy producers to ""use it or lose it."" This may be accelerating their extraction and burning of fossil fuels and, thereby, be permanently raising temperatures. Our paper uses a simple OLG model to illustrate this long-noted Green Paradox. Its framework treats climate damage as a negative externality imposed by today’s generations on tomorrow’s – an externality that is, in part, irreversible and can tip the climate to permanently higher temperatures. In our model, delaying abatement can lead to larger changes in climate than doing nothing, reducing welfare for all generations. In contrast, immediate policy action can raise welfare for all generations. Finally we question the standard use of infinitely-lived, single-agent models, which assume, unrealistically, intergenerational altruism in determining optimal abatement policy. Their prescriptions can differ, potentially dramatically, from those needed to correct the negative climate externality today’s generations are imposing on tomorrow’s."
F20|Costa Rica: Boosting productivity to sustain income convergence|In the latest 30 years, Costa Rica's real GDP per capita has more than doubled, driven by increasing labour utilisation. Labour productivity has instead stagnated at around 30% of the more advanced OECD countries. Productivity growth has been lacklustre despite the opening up of markets to international competition and large FDI inflows. Several obstacles continue to hamper the development of domestic firms and markets. They have fostered a dual speed economy characterised, on the one hand, by an innovative, productive and export oriented FDI sector – increasingly focussing on high value added sectors – and, on the other hand, a domestic sector – dominated by small firms and focused on traditional industries – that is neither innovative nor very productive. Boosting national productivity to sustain the convergence process towards OECD countries living standards will hinge on creating the right conditions for domestic firms to thrive and become more innovative and productive, while maintaining the long-standing commitment to open international markets and investment. To make this happens the government should: 1) encourage innovation and improving links between domestic and foreign firms by better enforcing and implementing intellectual property rights, shifting public R&D spending towards tertiary education institutions, and improving the coordination of public programmes promoting innovation of local firms and linkages with foreign affiliates; 2) strengthen competition in product markets and ease access to finance for SMEs by eliminating anti-trust exemptions, empowering the competition commission and giving it more independence, reducing barriers to entrepreneurship, ameliorating the corporate governance of state-owned enterprises and creating a level-playing fields between state-owned and private banks; 3) enhance the institutional and legal framework of the transport and other infrastructure sectors by reducing the number of agencies involved in policy development and project executions, and establishing an institutional framework to reduce policy uncertainty and attract more private investment. This Working Paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Assessment of Costa Rica (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-costa-rica.htm). Costa Rica: Stimuler la productivité pour soutenir la convergence des revenus Dans les dernières 30 années, le PIB réel par habitant du Costa Rica a plus que doublé, grâce à une utilisation croissante du travail. La productivité du travail a stagné autour de 30% des pays les plus avancés de l'OCDE. La croissance de la productivité a été terne, malgré l'ouverture des marchés à la concurrence internationale et de grandes entrées d'IDE. Plusieurs obstacles continuent d'entraver le développement des entreprises et des marchés intérieurs. Ils ont favorisé une économie à deux vitesses caractérisée, d'une part, par un secteur de l'IDE innovateur, productif et orienté vers l'exportation - se concentrant de plus en plus sur les secteurs à forte valeur ajoutée - et, d'autre part, un secteur domestique - dominé par les petites entreprises et concentré sur les industries traditionnelles - qui ne sont ni innovantes, ni très productives. Stimuler la productivité nationale pour soutenir le processus de convergence vers des pays de l'OCDE le niveau de vie dépendra de la création des conditions pour les entreprises nationales de se développer et de devenir plus innovantes et productives, tout en maintenant l'engagement de longue date pour ouvrir les marchés et les investissements internationaux. Pour que cela arrive, le gouvernement devrait: 1) encourager l'innovation et l'amélioration des liens entre les entreprises nationales et étrangères par une meilleure application et par la mise en oeuvre des droits de propriété intellectuelle, en déplaçant les dépenses de R&D vers les établissements d'enseignement supérieur, et par l'amélioration de la coordination des programmes publics de promotion de l'innovation des entreprises locales et des liens avec des sociétés étrangères affiliées; 2) renforcer la concurrence sur les marchés de produits et de faciliter l'accès au financement pour les PME en éliminant les exemptions anti-trust, habilitant la commission de la concurrence et en lui donnant plus d'indépendance, de réduire les obstacles à l'entrepreneuriat, améliorer la gouvernance des entreprises publiques et la création d'une concurrence equitable entre les banques publiques et privées; 3) renforcer le cadre institutionnel et juridique du transport et d'autres secteurs de l'infrastructure, en réduisant le nombre d'organismes impliqués dans les exécutions de développement des politiques et des projets, et l'établissement d'un cadre institutionnel pour réduire l'incertitude politique et d'attirer davantage d'investissements privés. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de la Costa Rica 2016 (www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-costa-rica.htm).
F20|Aspirations, Achievements and Challenges of European Social Economic Models|Knowing the errors of the past and learning from them, we have a chance to take the right decisions for the present and future. Taking into account the challenges posed by the current global economic crisis, it becomes necessary to concern about finding solutions to overcome its premises and to ensure healthy and sustainable economic growth, social welfare and capable of providing an efficient business environment. The efficiency of the Scandinavian model and the welfare of the population that belong to those countries face difficulties recently due to the increased rate of migration. To avoid an economic crisis northern states must find new solutions as control of social transfers, stimulating investment and efficient management of the migration phenomenon to fade negative fluctuations in the global economy
F20|A New Perspective of the Welfare State in the European Context|The economic environment is facing various challenges in an internationalized context, creatingthe premises for new structural reforms in the global management. Knowing the deficiencies of thepast experiences, the main challenge is to create a unique model of development that shouldsustain both the social welfare and the economic progress. This paper is based on the assumptionthat a standard social model can only provide fragmentary results and can lead to a dysfunctionaleconomic relationships. The main outcomes of this paper sustain the idea of improving the major indicators of thewelfare state only after a proper adjustment of the social economic models to the national context. Starting from a structured comparative analysis of the major economic social models, the paperwill outline the evidence that a complete model for the welfare state is a composite structure,involving both budgetary and social indicators.

F20|Exchange Rate Trends and Export Performance in Nigeria: A Descriptive Approach|This study examines the exchange rate trends and export performance in Nigeria between 1970-2015 using a descriptive approach. Particularly, the study emphasizes the impacts of exchange rate volatility on export demand in the country. The choice of this period is underscored by the fact that the starting date predates the era of the structural adjustment program (SAP) which is often described as the good days where agricultural and non-oil exports tremendously increased. Again, this date coincides with period when the external trade and exchange rate were indeed liberalized. Findings from descriptive analysis show that despite the policy pronouncements in the period covered, exchange rate volatility greatly affected export performance in Nigeria, in particular, the volume of export demand. The study recommends a deliberate exchange rate policy action that will have good implication for export growth in Nigeria
F20|Capital Openness and Income Inequality: A Cross-Country Study and The Role of CCT in Latin America|Recently, capital controls have made a comeback as both policymakers and academia have questioned the net benefits of liberalization and economic growth, especially after the 2008 Great Recession. While that literature has largely concluded that capital account liberalization may have detrimental effects on growth and accentuate financial instability in emerging markets, relatively little literature has examined the impacts of capital account liberalization on income inequality. Thus, this paper investigates the extent to which liberalization is beneficial for countries, conditional on institutional strength and financial depth. We specifically explore the differential impacts of capital account liberalization on income inequality during periods of economic expansion and contraction. The main findings suggest that the net impact of financial liberalization on income inequality is ambiguous during periods of economic expansion but detrimental during contractions. However, we also find that capital account openness needs not to be detrimental on income inequality if institutions are strong or - as it is the case in Latin America -if social safety nets are available.
F20|The Costs and Benefits of Migration into the European Union: Debunking Contemporary Myths with Facts|The purpose of this study is to dispel some myths associated with migrants in order to improve socio-economic appraisal of the consequences of the recent surge of migrants into Europe. We argue that: (i) the concern about loss of Christian cultural values is lacking in substance because compared to a relatively near historical epoch or era, very few European citizens do go to Church in contemporary Europe; (ii) the threat to European liberal institutions is falsifiable and statistically fragile because it is not substantiated with significant evidence; (iii) the insignificant proportion of the Moslem population that is aligned with Islamic fundamentalism invalidates the hypothesis on importation of radical Islamic fundamentalism and (iv) the concern about social security burden is relevant only in the short-term because of Europe’s ageing population.
F20|Transfer Mispricing as an Argument for Corporate Social Responsibility|This article presents a case for transfer mispricing as an argument for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The argument builds on the position that in order to compensate for potential loss of brand image and reputation, Multinational Companies (MNCs) would be more socially responsible when they are operating in countries where the legislation and laws in place are not effective at identifying and sanctioning transfer mispricing. We first discuss the dark side of transfer pricing (TP), next we present the nexus between TP and poverty and finally we advance arguments for CSR in transfer mispricing. While acknowledging that TP is a legal accounting practice, we argue that in view of its poverty and underdevelopment externalities, the practice per se should be a solid justification for CSR because it is also associated with schemes that deprive developing countries of capital essential for investments in health, education and development programmes. Therefore CSR owing to TP cannot be limited to a strategic management approach, but should also be considered as some kind of social justice because of associated transfer mispricing practices. We further argue that, CSR by multinational corporations could incite domestic companies to comply more willingly with their tax obligations and/or engage in similar activities. Whereas, traditional advocates of CSR have employed concepts such as reputation, licence-to-operate, sustainability, moral obligation and innovation to make the case for CSR, the present inquiry extends this stream of literature by arguing that TP and its externalities are genuine justifications for CSR. We consolidate our arguments with a case study of Glencore and the mining industry in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
F20|A Note on Home Bias and the Gain from Non-Preferential Taxation|In a symmetric model of tax competition, we support the claim in Haupt and Peters (2005) that a non-preferential regime generates higher tax revenues compared to a preferential regime when investors have home bias. Further, we show that a complete ban on preferential taxation is desirable even when capital base is in?finitely elastic.
F20|Growth and internationalization of fast growing firms|The purpose of this article is to identify the factors positively and negatively affecting the growth of companies in the foreign markets and internationalization. We examined and constructed in this paper a complex set of those factors which help and impede the growth on foreign markets of fast growing enterprises and their internationalization. Moreover, we contributed to the research of fast growing firms, adding more insight into the specificity of Polish enterprises. Due to the aim of the research, a qualitative multiple case study approach was applied based on the sample of 19 companies which were examined with semi-structured direct interviews. The findings should prove useful for academics, firms and governments.
F20|A born global’s radical, gradual and nonlinear internationalization: A case from Belarus|This paper contributes to the literature on internationalization processes by showing that a born global can experience nonlinear internationalization (de- and re-internationalize) after radical/fast initial growth, and use some subsidiaries as bases for further gradual expansion. After studying a case of a Belarusian door producer that has invested to seven and exported to 11 more countries, we conclude that a home country’s political/economic environment can be a crucial ‘push’ factor for a firm’s fast internationalization but, thereafter, it can internationalize gradually due to lacking knowledge or other resources, and de- and re-internationalize due to various internal and/or external reasons.

F20|Bridging Iranian Exporters with Foreign Markets : Does Diaspora Matter?|After matching a rich micro-level Iranian customs dataset with a macro-level cross-country database on Iranian diaspora stocks, we establish that diaspora matters for dynamics of Iranian exporters. We document the extent to which Iranian emigrants foster exports through both intensive and extensive margins at the micro-level. We show that destinations with more emigrants from Iran attract more Iranian exporters and allow them to survive longer and grow faster. One plausible explanation is that the diaspora channel reduces the fixed cost of exporting that Iranian exporters incur to enter a destination, those related to creating distribution channels, and those associated with learning about market demand. Our results add firm-level insight to the burgeoning literature on the channels through which emigration could impact economic integration. As Iran is now trying to integrate more with the global economy, these results suggest that Iranian embassies across the world have a role to play in bridging the gap between Iranian diaspora and exporters through trade promotion exhibitions and workshops to encourage greater trade between Iran and the rest of the world.
F20|To Whom Does Outward FDI Give Jobs?|Abstract This study used the Korean industry-level data for the period of 2007–2014 to decompose the effects of outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) on overall domestic employment into the forms of OFDI, workers’ skill level and employment status. The main finding is that OFDI has no effect on the overall employment of permanent workers, while it is positively associated with the overall employment of temporary workers. These results possibly indicate that the MNEs initiating FDI, at least in Korea, prefer employing temporary workers rather than permanent workers when the success of their FDI is not clearly visible. Given the high degree of labor market rigidity in Korea, these results seem legitimate and self-explaining. Although there is little evidence that OFDI has an impact on overall domestic employment, especially for permanent workers, there does exist heterogeneous effects of OFDI on employment depending on the types of FDI, workers’ skill level and employment status.
F20|Bilateral Investment Treaties and Investor State Disputes|Bilateral Investment treaties have been a source of political controversy in recent years because of the alarming increase in the investor state dispute settlement cases. Against this backdrop, the paper analyses the issues with diffused reciprocity imbibed in BITs leading to the unequal distribution of rights and obligations between developed and developing countries. The hypotheses developed within this analytical framework that a) BITS increases the risk of litigation and b) BITs negatively impacts on the net benefits of countries, are tested empirically using multivariate regression models using country pooled and panel data. Our conclusions are that the investors initiate higher number of cases against countries with BITs. Moreover, the net benefits accruing to countries are seen to be substantially lower for countries with BITs. Our findings support the growing view that a re-look at the traditional BITs model is warranted with a focus to evolve a new generation foreign investment policy framework that together with promoting foreign investment will also enable regulation of investment in keeping with host country public policy.
F20|Do Bangladesh and Sri Lanka Enjoy Export-Led Growth? A Comparison of Two Small South Asian Economies|The export-led growth (ELG) hypothesis suggests that there is a strong positive linear relationship between a countryâ€™s exports and economic growth. For many years, theoretical and empirical studies have examined the causal relationship between exports and economic growth and found that this relationship is one of interdependence rather than of unilateral causation. The purpose of this article is to empirically re-examine the ELG hypothesis in the context of two small South Asian countries: Bangladesh for the period of 1980â€“2011 and Sri Lanka for the period of 1984â€“2011. Using a model that controls for a host of domestic and international factors, this article tests the ELG hypothesis by employing the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds test for cointegration and the Granger causality tests. The empirical results confirm the validity of the ELG hypothesis for both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
F20|Chinese investments in Africa: what have we known and what should we know?|This study conducts a systematic review of the researches on Chinese investments in Africa, publishing in major journals of business administration and international business over these last 10 years. It studies the motivational factors for Chinese firm?s presence in Africa, the modes of entry of Chinese investment, the management issues, and their impacts on local economy and firms. It aims to provide an organizing framework for emerging theoretical and methodological issues, as well as future research direction in this field.Based on the international business theories, the findings of this study indicated that, to date, the majority of research has attempted to either qualitatively or conceptually criticize the cooperation between China and Africa, and there are very few studies that define model and develop measurement tools to empirically test the effects of the Chinese presence in the African continent and its impacts on local enterprises. Very few studies have provided robust evidence to establish the role that China is playing and the crowding-in or crowding-out effects of the Sino-Africa cooperation. This paper discusses about 5 major flaws in the existing literature and concludes with some emerging issues, the practical implications of this review, and future research directions.
F20|Born Globals in Interactive Branding Environment: A case of the BonAlive|Interactive Branding (I-Branding) environment consists of business network environments in which companies cooperate with each other through mutual interactions that are based on three dimensions: internal, external and mutual branding dimension. I-Branding as an activity is therefore presented as a business strategy through which a company is positioning itself in a local and foreign network of business relationships. Internationalization provides a new lens for this process, in which different networks of large distances are all interconnected through interactions of three branding dimensions. Born global companies are small companies with early and rapid internationalization, which are successfully implementing their strategies and fighting for a favourable position in foreign networks. In order to discover challenges and opportunities of becoming successful so rapidly, a family owned company in the pharmaceutical industry is followed over the years. Based on case findings, the paper suggests managerial implications for start-ups and born global companies, together with some direction for a future theoretical and empirical research.
F20|Determinantes de la migración interna en México|La migración ha sido explicada por diversos autores como una respuesta a diferenciales salariales entre regiones, sin embargo, también existen autores que afirman que los individuos no sólo se ven incentivados a cambiar de residencia debido a dicho diferencial sino también por otras situaciones no monetarias, tales como las condiciones climáticas o los niveles de seguridad. Resulta interesante el investigar cómo reaccionan los individuos ante cambios en determinantes diferentes a los monetarios al momento de tomar la decisión de migrar. En particular sobre el nivel de seguridad, México ha presentado en los últimos años un incremento en la tasa de delincuencia en gran parte del territorio. Hasta la fecha prácticamente no se han realizados estudios sobre el impacto del grado de seguridad y factores climáticos como motivadores de la migración en México. El presente trabajo tiene como finalidad iluminar en la materia de cuáles son, en adición a los determinantes generalmente considerados en la literatura (salarios esperados, distancia y capital migratorio), otros determinantes que aquí se denominan como ?no monetarios? que son considerados al momento de migrar y qué pesos tiene cada uno de ellos en la decisión. De los resultados que nos arroje el estudio podremos entender mejor la migración interna en México y generar recomendaciones de política económica para establecer estrategias que permitan conseguir el objetivo de promover la distribución geográfica de la población conforme a las potencialidades de desarrollo sustentable del territorio. Entre los principales resultados resalta el hecho de que los individuos migran de estados con altas tasas delictivas. Tanto hombres como mujeres migrantes responden de manera similar ante ciertos aspectos como los índices de delincuencia o la temperatura. Y finalmente los migrantes más jóvenes responden ante aspectos monetarios, en contraste los migrantes mayores lo hacen ante aspectos no monetarios.
F20|Internationalization choices: an ordered probit analysis at industry level|Abstract This paper extends a highly influential contribution by Helpman et al. (Am Econ Rev 94: 300–316, 2004), on the link between within-industry heterogeneity, exports and foreign direct investment (FDI), by examining the robustness of their results using a more comprehensive dataset and relaxing the assumptions regarding the distribution of firm sales. The results of an ordered probit model—estimated on exports and mergers and acquisitions data for a sample of 25 origin countries, 91 destination countries and 57 manufacturing industries, over the period 1994–2004—confirm that sectors characterized by larger firms and more dispersed firm sales show higher probability of internationalization, through both exports and FDI.

F20|Location Choices of Chinese Multinationals in Europe: The Role of Overseas Communities| Overseas Chinese communities are an important determinant in the location choice of greenfield investments made by mainland Chinese multinational enterprises across European regions. Conceptually embedded in a relational approach, this effect is shown through an empirical analysis of an exhaustive set of investment projects across NUTS-1 regions in twenty-six European countries for the period 2003–2010. When controlling for endogeneity bias and the embeddedness of existing Chinese economic activity, we find that the importance of overseas communities in the location choices of Chinese firms is based on increased access to strategic information. Our results confirm that the relationship between the size of an overseas Chinese community and the probability of Chinese investment is stronger for communities hosting newer generations of Chinese migrants; in addition, they partially corroborate that this relationship is stronger when the education level of the community’s Chinese migrants is higher. Our findings are particularly robust in the context of knowledge-intensive sectors and high value-added functions.
F20|Mexican manufacturing and its integration into global value chains|This paper studies the value added contributions to final manufacturing output produced in Mexico. It distinguishes between contributions originating from foreign producers located in different major regions of the world economy and contributions made by domestic producers. The analysis is performed for the main two components of Mexican manufacturing: assembly plants producing for export markets (Maquiladora industry) and manufacturing firms mainly producing for the domestic market (Domestic Manufacturing). To this end, Mexico (Maquiladora) and Mexico (Domestic Manufacturing) are separately included into World Input-output Tables (WIOT) from 1998 to 2011. The empirical analysis shows that the structure of value added contributions with regard to the final output of the Mexican domestic sector has remained unaltered, while the structure of value added contributions to the final output of the Maquiladora sector has drastically changed over time. For its own final output, Mexico (Domestic) has the largest share of value added contributions with some increase in the value added contributions of producers in foreign countries (notably, the USA). With regard to the final output of Mexico (Maquiladora) there was a shift from a dominance of US value added in all the manufacturing sectors (70% in 1998) to a much more diversified structure of value added contributions. By 2011, the East Asian share in value added was the largest in the Electrical and Optical equipment sector. Mexico (Domestic Manufacturing) and Mexico (Maquiladora) had the largest value added contributions in the Transport Equipment sector, while the US continued to account for the lion's share of value added in the textile industry. In our view, those changes in the structure of value added contributions have to do with decisions by US firms to reallocate production to low-cost countries in Asia. They reflect changing patterns of the integration of Mexico in global value chains.
F20|You’re banned! The effect of sanctions on German cross-border financial flows|Summary This paper examines the effect of financial sanctions on cross-border capital flows. While sanctions can be expected to hinder international transactions, thereby putting political and economic pressure on a target country, we study the patterns of adjustment in bilateral financial relationships after the imposition of sanctions along various dimensions. Our analysis is based on highly disaggregated, monthly data from the German balance of payments statistics for the period from 2005 through 2014. During this time, Germany imposed financial sanctions on 20 countries; two of these sanctions have been lifted. Applying a differences-in-differences approach, we find two key results. First, financial sanctions have a strong and immediate negative effect on direct financial flows with the sanctioned country, with cross-border flows reduced in either direction. Second, sanctions imposed by the European Union alone, and therefore only enforced by their member countries instead of the United Nations, are evaded as flows with major trading partners of sanctioned countries increase. We conclude that financial sanctions do matter for capital flows.
F20|Internationalisierung von kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen im Dienstleistungssektor im Lichte der (amtlichen) Statistik|Der Dienstleistungshandel Deutschlands hat seit 2001 erheblich zugenommen. Inwieweit KMU des Dienstleistungssektors am Dienstleistungshandel teilnehmen, war bisher unklar. Unsere Analysen zeigen, dass zwar nur 14% dieser KMU exportieren, sie aber anteilsmäßig stärker zum Exportvolumen des Sektors beitragen als KMU im Verarbeitenden Gewerbe. Dienstleistungen werden vor allem zwischen Unternehmen bzw. innerhalb von multinationalen Konzernen gehandelt, z. B. Nutzungsrechte für geistiges Eigentum oder FuE-Ergebnisse. In den Wirtschaftsabteilungen Verkehr, Handel und unternehmensbezogene Dienstleistungen erzielt ein exportierendes KMU im Schnitt 20% des Jahresumsatzes mit dem Auslandsgeschäft.
F20|Rigid relations: External adjustment under the Gold Standard (1880-1913)|External adjustments during the classical gold standard – a fixed exchange rate regime – were associated with few, if any, output costs. This paper analyzes the relative importance of flexible prices, migration and mildly countercyclical monetary policy for this relatively smooth adjustment experience. For this purpose we build and estimate a structural model of the classical gold standard. We find that the sustainability of the gold standard as a fixed exchange rate regime was primarily a consequence of flexible prices. Pre-1914 price flexibility is furthermore largely explicable by large pre-1914 primary sector shares. The paper proceeds in a historical comparative fashion by relating the gold standard experience to that of another fixed-exchange rate regime – today’s eurozone.

F20|Invoice Currency in Brazil|The article describes the invoice currency choice in the Brazilian foreign trade, focusing on the use of the Brazilian real (BRL). The Ministry of Foreign Trade (MDIC) database is used for the first time for this purpose. Even with the US dollar being far more used in Brazil than in other countries, the BRL use for denominating trade has had exceptional growth. We categorically move away from the idea that the BRL is not used in Brazilian international trade. Brazilian imports show a strong tendency toward being more invoiced in noninternational currencies than exports. Brazilian trade evidence does not confirm some previous international findings. Although they are homogenous products, sugar and tobacco are the two main exports denominated in BRL. BRL use as invoice currency and as payment currency does not match.

The trade regime interacts with industrial policy and regulations on capital mobility in governing capital accumulation. In a capital-scarce economy, capitalist oligarchs striving for import substitution industrialization (ISI) initially shelter the economy from trade, while promoting industrial policies that promote total factor productivity growth in the manufacturing sector. This gradually shifts the comparative advantage toward manufacturing and renders the economy attractive to foreign investors. Allowing for trade and foreign capital inflows are thus complementary policies that spur growth in the capital oligarchy. By contrast, landed oligarchs in a capital-scarce economy favor openness to trade at an early stage of development, neglect industrial policies, and block foreign capital to maximize extractable rents. The policy mix causes the economy to stagnate. Consistent with the experiences of South Korea and Argentina in the postwar era, the model predicts that the success of ISI policies depends crucially on the conditions governing the incentives for capital accumulation.

F20|Financial Integration, Growth and Volatility|The aim of the paper is to evaluate the welfare gains from financial integration for developing and emerging economies. To do so, we build a stochastic endogenous growth model for a small open economy that can (i) borrow from the rest of the world, (ii) invest in foreign assets, and (iii) receive FDI. The model is calibrated on 32 emerging and developing economies for which we evaluate the upper bound for the welfare gain from financial integration. For plausible values of preference parameters and actual levels of financial integration, the mean welfare gain from financial integration is about 10 percent of the existing wealth. Compared to financial autarky, actual levels of financial integration translate into slightly higher annual growth rates (around 0.4 percentage points per year.)<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F20|Can the periphery achieve core? The case of the automobile components industry in Spain|The paper analyses changes experienced by Spain, as a European Peripheral region, in the spatial concentration of value-added and high-skill activities, and generation of technology in the automobile components industry. The analysis of plants set up (investments) and relocated (divestments) by multinationals (MNEs) between 2001 and 2010 show that Spain is no longer a place for labour-intensive activities and standardized processes using simple technologies in comparison to other peripheral regions. However, the continuing majority presence of foreign-owned companies is limiting decision power for generating and transferring technology, concentrating it mainly in those which Spanish MNEs have specialised<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F20|The Effect of Terrorist Incidents on Capital Flows|Current literature shows a significant negative impact of terrorism on countries economies. We explore this relationship in more detail. Using an unbalanced panel of over 160 countries for up to 25 years and the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) we show a decrease in FDI as a consequence of terrorism. We also find evidence that FDI flows are more sensitive to terrorism than either portfolio investments or external debt flows. Finally, we test the hypothesis that terrorism has negative spill-over effects on FDI flows into neighboring countries and find evidence that cultural but not geographical closeness matters.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F20|Innovation frugale, effectuation et Fablabs : des pratiques à croiser pour penser l’innovation différemment|In this article, we explore the articulation between two approaches?: frugal innovation and effectuation. We highlight the points of convergence, such as their management of resources, their relation to uncertainty and their integration into an ecosystem. We consider how the contexts of developing countries and emerging countries can make a combination of both approaches successful. To illustrate this idea, we draw on the practices of makers within FabLabs, who manage to promote empowerment and multidirectional innovation in constrained environments. JEL Codes: F20, O31, O33
F20|Did Chinese Outward Activity Attenuate or Aggravate the Great Recession in Developing Countries?|Using data on Chinese large-scale overseas investment and project contracts by sector, we analyze whether Chinese outward activity (COA) before the crisis worsened or alleviated the contractionary phases in developing countries. We find that, on average, COA did not increase vulnerability to the global recession. However, both the sectoral targeting and the size of the pre-crisis engagement matter: While COA in clearly to financial markets tied sectors implied an aggravation, substantial precrisis investment in the energy, metals and transportation industries implied an attenuation of the slump.
F20|Why is China Investing in Africa? Evidence from the Firm Level|China’s increased trade with and investment in Africa have boosted the continent’s economic growth but have also generated considerable controversy. In this paper we investigate China’s outward direct investment ODI in Africa using macro and micro data. The aggregate data on China’s ODI in African countries reveal that China’s share of the stock of foreign investment is small, though growing rapidly. China’s attraction to resource-rich countries is no different from Western investment. China’s overall ODI is uncorrelated with a measure of rule of law, whereas Western investment favors the better governance environments. As a result, Chinese investment in strong and weak governance environments is about the same, but its share of foreign investment is higher in the weak governance states. The micro data that we use is MOFCOM’s database on all registered Chinese firms investing in Africa between 1998 and 2012. We use key words in project descriptions to code the investments into 25 sectors. This database captures the small and medium private firms investing in Africa. Contrary to common perceptions, there are few projects in natural resource sectors. Most projects are in services, with a significant number in manufacturing as well. In our country-sector-level regressions based on firms’ transaction-level data, we find that Chinese ODI, both horizontal and vertical, is profit-driven, just like investors from other countries. In particular, our regressions show that Chinese ODI is relatively more concentrated in skill-intensive sectors in skill-abundant countries, but in capital-intensive sectors in capital-scarce countries. These patterns are mostly observed in politically unstable countries, suggesting stronger incentives to seek profits in tougher environments. The predominance of Chinese ODI in services appears to be widespread across host countries, independent of host countries’ market size and trade costs, but is negatively correlated with their skill abundance.
F20|The European Neighbourhood Policy : One Policy, Two Neighbourhoods|"The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) was launched in 2003 and implemented in 2004 by the European Union (EU) to create an area of prosperity, stability, security and economic cooperation with neighboring countries, with the objective of avoiding the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged EU and its neighbors. Indeed, this policy has been implemented immediately after 2004 enlargement to avoid the emergence of ""new dividing lines"" with neighbouring countries. It supposes the application of the same approach applied for countries applying for membership become then member of the EU to prepare the countries of the Eastern region to an eventual membership. This approach confirms the orientation of this policy for the Eastern neighborhood. It has been more active in this region than in the southern Mediterranean region, mainly due to the presence of a geostrategic concurrency with Russia."
F20|Hofstede’S Cultural Dimensions And Management In Corporations|In many cases the success or failure in management is caused by the way leaders understand the cultural environment the companies develop. The leadership approach and rules applied increase or decrease performance in economies and companies. The paper describes the relation between management failure or success and the management adjustment to the cultural dimensions. People build organizations and rule them according to their values, but in the corporation field specific values might be successfully applied or implying the whole company failure. The analysis is made based on Hofstede research and having in mind his dimensions on a dynamic hypothetical case where there are taken into account cultural dimensions for Romania, Germany, Kazakhstan and United States of America.
F20|Corporate Communication Challenges In Multicultural Environments|In the current economic environment where globalization is powerful and demographic changes complex and continuously changing, the cultural and structural dimensions inside and outside business are getting more intricate. Management and companies leaders search a more complex and valuable solution to increase shareholders satisfaction, to protect the environment and keep calm internal circumstances. The more complex the changes are, the higher the leaders challenges for setting the successful path to their organizations are and our aim in the current paper would be to present several solutions found through communication tools.
F20|Political, Economic And Social Mutations. Political Realism|The characteristics of contemporary international relations cannot be understood without their doctrinaire analysis, outlined around three main approaches: realist, liberal and structuralist. Even if the object of the study is the same, they provide extremely different responses to questions such as: What relations are established between states? Who are the leading players on the international scene? What is the priority in approaching the international relations of a state? How are the relations between states characterized and determined? This study aims at highlighting the manners in which multilateral approaches are the way to manage global business, either through flexible, open, variable forms, or through reviving the tradition of international institutions.
F20|Knowledge In Learning Companies|Changes are the only constant value in the current unpredictable economy. Under these circumstances leaders and employees must manage the external and internal environment and bring profitability for their companies. This paper gives an introductory approach to different perspective over learning companies in international literature. Different theoretical aspects, models and theories are taken into account for having a higher visibility to the complex concept of learning companies from leadership side to multiculturalism as the firm profitability should be the final goal of each economic system. The article concludes that not the process of learning is important but the adaptability to every different environment must be seen as vital.
F20|Developing Countries. Transition Economies|According to the modern theories of economic development – the take-off, backwardness, convergence and balanced growth hypothesis - the new industrialized states from Asia seem to have noticed the advantages of backwardness from which low income countries benefited, namely the possibility to take advantage of the latest technological discoveries of advanced countries, thus achieving a faster growth than the latter which operated closer to the technological border. The assimilation of appropriate technologies, however, required the efficient mobilization and allocation of resources and the improvement of human and physical capital. While the Western countries were confronted with crises generated by inflationary shocks and movements of speculative capital, the relative isolation of countries whose economy was planned by the world economy sheltered them until 1990, unemployment being practically non-existent. Asia's exceptional economic success is not only due to borrowing Western practices, but also to the fact that Asian societies maintained certain traditional features of their own culture - such as a strong work ethic - and integrated them in the modern business environment.
F20|Global Production System|"The most significant transformations that globalization produces occur in production. Since the '60s, a new division of labor has made its presence felt in the world, arising from the ""de-industrialization"" of the developed and transfer production capacity of resource-intensive industries and pollutants from these countries to the developing world. ""Dislocation"" industry had the interim foreign direct investment made in the new industrialized countries, the latter becoming, in turn, sources of direct foreign investment, taking its capital in other countries in developing handsets. Currently, FDI destination is no longer a priority in developing countries, yet they are increasingly leaning towards the developed countries, due to the attractiveness offered by their economies."
F20|Margins of Trade: Czech Firms Before, During and After the Crisis|We investigate the extensive and intensive margins of trade of Czech firms in periods before, during and after the crisis of 2008-2009. The intensive margin explains most of the aggregate export growth in 2006-2014, which corroborates previous findings for other countries. The contribution of the extensive margin is smaller, explaining on average 39% of the aggregate export growth in 2006-2007 and around 25% to 30% of that in the post-crisis period. The lower contribution of the extensive margin may signal a lower rate of convergence of the Czech economy. The results indicate that the crisis had a more severe impact on small exporting firms and that exports to countries outside the EU gained more prominence in the post-crisis years. Our results are similar to findings from previous studies on the impact of participation in global value chains on firms' trade. Specifically, a more negative impact of the crisis was observed for exports with higher import intensity. Overall, our results point to the importance of using disaggregated data in the analysis of countries' export performance.
F20|Export behavior and board independence in Colombian family firms: The reverse causality relationship|In the context of greater market liberalization in Latin America, one issue that merits greater attention for empirical investigation is the international expansion of family-owned business. Specifically, the relationship between export behavior, family control and board composition in the Latin American context is absent in the literature. Using a large and unique database from Colombian firms (33,249 firms in the period of 2008 to 2013), one may find insightful information on the determinants of export behavior of family firms in emerging markets. Our empirical test confirms an endogenous relation between boards' composition (specifically the presence of independent members) and export behavior in family firms. Firms with a higher participation of independent board members are more likely to exhibit higher levels of exports. A “virtuous cycle” was also detected whereby the introduction of independent members on the board can be expected to boost export behavior, which in turn will encourage the increase of independent members on the board of private firms.
F20|La política fiscal frente a los flujos de capital: evidencia para algunos países de América Latina|Los flujos de capital representan oportunidades para financiar el crecimiento y el desarrollo de los países, pero también conllevan riesgos, especialmente de tipo macroeconómico y financiero. Las respuestas de política para mitigar sus efectos, juegan un papel importante especialmente en los mercados emergentes. En este trabajo se evalúa la postura de la política fiscal frente a los choques de los flujos de capital registrados durante las dos últimas décadas en seis economías emergentes de América Latina: Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Colombia, México y Perú. Con base en la caracterización de los diferentes episodios de entradas y salidas súbitas de capital y en la estimación de un modelo de datos de panel con variables instrumentales, se encuentra quelos gobiernos no respondieron con medidas fiscales excepcionales. Por el contrario, su postura fiscal de naturaleza procíclica parece estar asociada al efecto que los flujos de capital produjeron sobre la actividad económica.
F20|Reversal of migration flows: A fresh look at the German reunification|We investigate the dynamic effects of interregional labor market integration on migration flows, capital formation, and the price for housing services. The co-evolution of these variables depends on initial conditions at the time of labor market integration. In an initially capital-poor economy, there may be a reversal of migration flows during the transition to the steady state, while housing costs are increasing over time. Although capital may accumulate while labor emigrates early in the transition, the causal effect of immigration on capital investments and housing costs is positive. We present new data on the evolution of net migration flows and rental rates for housing in East Germany after 1990. Our results are consistent with the presented evidence in the reverse migration scenario.
F20|El Mercado Mundial De Aceituna De Mesa (1990-2015)|El olivar ha sido tradicionalmente un cultivo mediterráneo cuya producción de aceitunas se ha destinado, en su mayor parte, a la elaboración de aceite de oliva, producto básico de la dieta mediterránea. En el presente trabajo intentamos abordar de forma preliminar el análisis del mercado mundial de aceituna de mesa, el cual ha registrado un importante crecimiento en las últimas décadas debido, por un lado, al aumento de la producción mundial de las variedades de aceitunas aptas para esta transformación, y por el otro, al importante crecimiento de la demanda de este producto como alimento de acompañamiento y celebración. Además del análisis de la producción y del consumo internacional de aceituna de mesa, se analizan los flujos de comercio internacional y el peso relativo en éstos de los diferentes países que participan en este comercio en los últimos 25 años. The olive grove has traditionally been a Mediterranean crop whose olive production has been directed, mostly, to the manufacture of olive oil, a staple of the Mediterranean diet. In this paper we address the analysis of the global market for table olives, which has had a significant growth in recent decades due, on the one hand, to the increase in world production of varieties of olives suitable for this transformation, and on the other, to the growth in olives demand for appetizer and celebration consumption. In addition to analysis of production and international consumption of table olives, international trade flows and the relative weight of these different countries involved in this trade over the past 25 years are analyzed.

F20|Regional capital flows and economic regimes: Evidence from China|Using provincial data from China, this paper examines the pattern of capital flows in relation to the transition of economic regimes. We show that fast-growing provinces experienced less capital inflows before the large-scale market reform, contrary to the prediction of the neoclassical growth theory. As China transitioned from the central-planning economy to the market economy, the negative correlation between productivity growth and capital inflows became much less pronounced. From a regional perspective, this finding suggests domestic institutional factors play an important role in shaping the pattern of capital flows.
F20|US firms – How global are they? A longitudinal study|Many studies examine firm-level internationalisation using measures such as percentage foreign sales, number of foreign subsidiaries and the number of countries in which the firm operates, but few examine the changes in these measures over time. We conduct a longitudinal study of the internationalisation of Russell 1000 US firms between 1996 and 2010, with further categorisations by age, industry and size. We find little change in the number of purely domestic firms, but substantial overall increases in the extent and scope of internationalisation of MNCs, with periods of both de- and re-internationalisation. Firms appear to expand into new regions and increase their foreign sales in those regions in subsequent years. More than half of the MNCs in our sample experienced a decrease in foreign sales after the 2007/08 credit crisis, with relatively few decreases in the regions in which they operate. By 2010 we find that the majority of the MNCs in our sample are pursuing a semi-global strategy.
F20|Hot money in bank credit flows to emerging markets during the banking globalization era|This paper investigates the relative importance of hot money in bank credit and portfolio flows from the US to 18 emerging markets over the period 1988–2012. We deploy state-space models à la Kalman filter to identify the unobserved hot money as the temporary component of each type of flow. The analysis reveals that the importance of hot money relative to the permanent component in bank credit flows has significantly increased during the 2000s relative to the 1990s. This finding is robust to controlling for the influence of push and pull factors in the two unobserved components. The evidence supports indirectly the view that global banks have played an important role in the transmission of the global financial crisis to emerging markets, and endorses the use of regulations to manage international capital flows.
F20|On cross-border bank credit and the U.S. financial crisis transmission to equity markets|This paper examines the role played by cross-border equity, bond and bank credit flows versus international trade in the transmission of the U.S. financial crisis to equity markets worldwide. We estimate vector autoregressive models with exogenous global factors using monthly data on 36 emerging and developed countries. The results from an eclectic methodology that includes causality tests, generalized impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions indicate that the crisis is mostly transmitted through bank credit rather than portfolio flows and international trade. The results are robust to altering the exogenous versus endogenous vectors of variables, to measuring equity prices in U.S. dollars or local currency, to averaging the data across countries versus averaging the parameters from individual country estimation, and to redefining the start date of the crisis. The findings endorse the use of banking regulation and capital controls as part of the policy toolkit to limit financial vulnerability.
F20|Nontariff protection without an outside good|Assuming an outside good, the existing intra-industry trade models show that the domestic price index is lowered and the welfare is improved by unilateral nontariff protection against foreign products. Removing the outside good, we reexamine this issue incorporating the factor-price changes to capture the terms-of-trade effect. In the case of one production factor (immobile labor), we find that unilateral protection is neither price-index lowering nor welfare improving. In the case of two production factors (immobile labor and mobile capital), the same result holds if the elasticity of substitution between varieties is as large as that observed in empirical studies. Therefore, the outside-good assumption is not harmless to evaluate trade policies.
F20|Holes in the Dike: the global savings glut, U.S. house prices and the long shadow of banking deregulation|We explore empirically how capital inflows into the US and financial deregulation within the United States interacted in driving the run-up (and subsequent decline) in US housing prices over the period 1990-2010. To obtain an ex ante measure of financial liberalization, we focus on the history of interstate-banking deregulation during the 1980s, i.e. prior to the large net capital inflows into the US from China and other emerging economies. Our re- sults suggest a long shadow of deregulation: in states that opened their banking markets to out-of-state banks earlier, house prices were more sensitive to capital inflows. We provide evidence that global imbalances were a major positive funding shock for US wide banks: different from local banks, these banks held a geographically diversified portfolio of mort- gages which allowed them to tap the global demand for safe assets by issuing private-label safe assets backed by the country-wide US housing market. This, in turn, allowed them to expand mortgage lending and lower interest rates, driving up housing prices.
F20|Does institutional diversity promote global innovation networks?|Recent literature stresses the increasing importance of global innovation networks as a new mechanism to organize innovation across geographical space. This paper investigates if institutional diversity, defined at the level of the firm, influences firms’ engagement in GINs. Institutional diversity provides knowledge about the institutional context of other countries, increased capabilities to deal with institutional differences, larger social networks to build GINs and a broader search space. Further, the paper examines how the absorptive capacity of firms mediates the relationship between institutional diversity and global innovation networks. The empirical study is based on a linked employee-employer dataset with 8,573 innovative firms in Sweden. It provides strong evidence that the engagement in GINs is positively related to institutional diversity and that the relation is particularly strong for global innovation networks, depending, however, on the absorptive capacity of firms.
F20|Exploring outward FDI and the choice of destination: evidence from Swedish firm-level data| Using Swedish firm-level data on all firms and their affiliates abroad, we investigate what observable firm and country characteristics affect the size of an affiliate in a particular destination. We employ the richness of the data to investigate the importance of destination country factors in explaining firm outward FDI activities and distinguish between the factors that affect such activities in manufacturing versus services firms as well as vertical versus horizontal investments. Our results lend support to existing theories of multinational activity of manufacturing but not services firms. We also find observable differences between vertical and horizontal manufacturing firms that are not always explained by theory.
F20|Appropriation Of Investments And Innovation Benefits In The U.S. - China Trade Relationship|It is widely understood that the 1978 market-oriented economic reforms set the stage for Chinaâ€™s phenomenal growth and swift accession to the worldâ€™s second-largest economy. A part of the reforms involved relaxing restrictions on foreign investment inflows, privatization and contracting of state-owned industries, and the lifting of protectionist policies. These initiatives are thought to have assisted the flow of knowledge and skills into China. Such flows are known to help deepen human capital which results in productivity increases when combined with improvements in physical capital and other resources. It is reasonable that these advantages are primarily channeled through international commerce linkages. This context provides for investment and innovation choices to influencing productivity outcomes among trading partners. This study presents an empirical framework for testing data from the U.S.-China trade experience for the period 1996-2014, with the aim of identifying how research and development (R&D) expenditures in the U.S. and China combine to influence productivity outcomes in the Chinese economy. The results indicate that R&D stock accumulation in the U.S. plays an important role in prompting productivity increases in Chinaâ€™s economy when combined with Chinaâ€™s own R&D efforts. The implications of the results can be applied in making strategic R&D choices that improve the advantages in the U.S.-China trade relationship
F20|How immigration affects investment and productivity in host and home countries|Migration policies need to consider how immigration affects investment behavior and productivity, and how these effects vary with the type of migration. College-educated immigrants may do more to stimulate foreign direct investment and research and development than low-skilled immigrants, and productivity effects would be expected to be highest for immigrants in scientific and engineering fields. By raising the demand for housing, immigration also spurs residential investment. However, residential investment is unlikely to expand enough to prevent housing costs from rising, which has implications for income distribution in society.
F20|Determinants of foreign direct investment in Ethiopia; time series evidence from 1991-2013|The hub of this study is investigating the forces behind the foreign direct investment inflow to Ethiopian economy in the long run as well as in the short run. To this end, the researcher has reviewed theoretical explanations relating to the determinants of foreign direct investment. The investigator has also reviewed relevant empirical literature pertaining to the determinants of foreign direct investment in the context of developing and developed countries and Ethiopia in particular. The review of the literature and the context analysis has culminated with a fundamental question what are the major determinants of foreign direct investment inflows in Ethiopia in both the long run and the short run? Methodologically, the researcher adopted empirical and quantitative analysis. To this end, a time series model was developed based on the critical synthesis of theoretical and empirical literature on foreign direct investment. The model is estimated using error correction model(ECM) formulation for the period 1991 to 2013 using annual data from World Bank world development indicators report after co-integrating relationship is proved with the Dickey Fuller residual based unit root tests. The tests for stationarity before the model developed was estimated proved that the variables in the model suffer from mixed order of co-integration at levels and hence the variables were differenced so as to alleviate that problem of mixed order co-integration. The result revealed that the determinants of foreign direct investment inflow are found to be consistent in the short and long run models. The most important forces behind foreign direct investment are found to be the GDP per capital, GDP growth rate, real interest rates, inflation rate, gross capital formation, adult literacy rate, Labor force growth rate, telephone lines per 1000 people and official exchange rate. In both models, Export of goods and services, and energy consumption per capita in transport sector are found to have insignificant impact on foreign direct investment inflow to Ethiopia. The policy implication of the result is that policy makers need to put in place policies congenial to pursue economic growth, macro-economic stability, human capital formation and fixed capital formation for attraction of foreign direct investment.
F20|Rational Asymmetric Development: Transfer Pricing and Sub-Saharan Africa’s Extreme Poverty Tragedy|A recent publication by the World Bank on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has established that extreme poverty has been decreasing in all regions of the world with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), in spite of over two decades of growth resurgence. This chapter explores the role of transfer pricing in SSA’s extreme poverty tragedy. The analytical structure entails: (i) emphasis of rational asymmetric development as the dark side of transfer pricing, (ii) evidence that the recent growth resurgence in African countries has been driven substantially by resource-rich countries which are experiencing high levels of exclusive growth and extreme poverty, (iii) the practice of transfer pricing by multinationals operating in resource-rich countries of SSA and (iv) a Zambian case study of extreme poverty and transfer pricing schemes by Glencore in the copper industry. While transfer pricing is contributing to diminishing African growth, available evidence shows that the component growth that is not captured by transfer pricing does not trickle down to the poor because the African elite is also captured by practices of rational asymmetric development. Policy implications for the fight against extreme poverty are discussed.
F20|Rational Asymmetric Development: Transfer Mispricing and Sub-Saharan Africa’s Extreme Poverty Tragedy|A recent publication by the World Bank on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has established that extreme poverty has been decreasing in all regions of the world with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), in spite of over two decades of growth resurgence. This chapter explores the role of transfer mispricing in SSA’s extreme poverty tragedy. The analytical structure entails: (i) emphasis of rational asymmetric development as the dark side of transfer pricing; (ii) linkages between financial reporting, international financial reporting standards (IFRS), transfer pricing and poverty; (iii) evidence that the recent growth resurgence in African countries has been driven substantially by resource-rich countries which are experiencing high levels of exclusive growth and extreme poverty; (iv) the practice of transfer mispricing by multinationals operating in resource-rich countries of SSA and (v) a Zambian case study of extreme poverty and transfer mispricing schemes by Glencore in the copper industry. While transfer mispricing is contributing to diminishing African growth, available evidence shows that the component of growth that is not captured by transfer mispricing does not trickle down to the poor because the African elite is also animated by practices of rational asymmetric development. Policy implications for the fight against extreme poverty are discussed.

Assessing the effectiveness of these dollars is necessary to measure program success and to allocate such funds among competing projects. This study measures the impact of the first phase of the Cocoa Livelihood Program (CLPI), a current World Cocoa Foundation project sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The project seeks to improve the livelihood of over 200,000 small cocoa producers in Sub-Saharan Africa via training, crop diversification and farmer based organizations. Using data collected from 2,048 pre and post CLPI interviews of cocoa producers in Ghana, Cote d’ivoire, Nigeria and Cameroon, the economic impact of the CLPI program can be estimated. The results show that yield enhancements attributable to CLPI are 36%, 38%, 49% and 24% in Ghana, Côte D’Ivoire, Nigeria and Cameroon, respectively. Using a total program cost of $158-$200 per beneficiary and estimated annual benefits of $86-$152 per beneficiary over 25 years, the benefit- cost ratios were estimated to range from $13 to $22 for every dollar spent on human capital development.
F20|Invoice currency: Puzzling evidence and new questions from Brazil|This article for the first time uses Brazilian trade data to draw conclusions about the invoice currency choice — both in general and as it pertains to the Brazilian real (BRL). We find that the Brazil-Argentina policy of providing payment orders associated to an exchange transaction between their currencies has had a significant impact on the currency chosen for invoicing, establishing a link between the availability of financial instruments and the invoice currency choice. Moreover, the evidence does not confirm some previous international results. We identify that in Brazil there is no coincidence regarding the use of BRL for invoicing and its use for making payments. Yet we find that the main exports denominated in BRL are homogenous goods — sugar and tobacco — suggesting that some bargaining power might remain even if goods are traded in international markets. From the BRL-specific perspective, we categorically move away from the idea that the BRL is not used in Brazilian international trade. Although it is used at a limited absolute volume, an exceptional ninefold growth between 2007 and 2011 is observed. New intriguing questions about Brazilian currency usage can therefore be proposed.Classification-JEL: A12; B12
F20|International Trade, Multinational Activity, and Corporate Finance|An emerging new literature brings unique ideas from corporate finance to the study of international trade and investment. Insights about differences in the development of financial institutions across countries, the role of financial constraints, and the use of internal capital markets are proving central in understanding international economics. The ability to access financial capital to pay fixed and variable costs affects choices firms make regarding export entry and operations and, as a consequence, influences aggregate trade patterns. Financial frictions and the use of internal capital markets shape decisions that multinationals make regarding production locations, integration, and corporate governance. This article surveys this recent research with the goal of highlighting the main themes it explores, the key results it establishes, and the leading open questions it raises.
F20|Preparing France’s balance of payments in accordance with the new international standards: a statistical response to economic globalisation|This study analyses the impact on France’s balance of payments and international investment position data of the new international methodology developed by the IMF, which better reflects international trade in goods and services.
F20|Integrating India with Asian Production Networks: Prospects and Challenges|The formation of regional production networks (RPNs) is one of the most important drivers of growth in East and Southeast Asia. In view of slowdown in growth and even recession in advanced economies as a result of the adverse impact of the global financial crisis of 2008 and the ongoing European debt crisis, RPNs need to reorient their production and exports toward rising middle class of Asia. To successfully implement the new initiative of “Make in India”, India needs to be integrated significantly with the RPN. The paper attempts to assess how far intra-industry trade in the form of production and service networks will grow and contribute to the rapid growth in China, India, and Southeast Asian countries, especially from India's perspective. It also examines the trends and patterns; and prospects of integration as well as the prospects for, and the challenges and risks of, significantly integrating India with the RPN. The paper focuses on electronics, automobiles and auto parts and components. The paper finds that in view of high competitiveness in providing outsourced information technology and R&D services in a wide range of industries, India has tremendous potential to integrate with RPN and become a key player like the PRC. India should improve technological capability, ease of doing business, infrastructure, and local support industries as well as EASE efficient governance and regulatory system, including full transparency in the application of the law.
F20|Foreign language learnings: An econometric analysis|The paper is devoted to an econometric analysis of learning foreign languages in all parts of the world. Our sample covers 193 countries and 13 important languages. Four factors significantly explain learning. All four affect the broad decision to learn but the last two also point to the choice of the particular language to learn. Literacy promotes learning in general while the world population of speakers of the native language discourages it. Trade with speakers of a specific language prompts learning of that specific language while the linguistic distance between the home and the foreign language discourages learning of that specific language. Trade may well deserve more emphasis than the other three factors (literacy rate, linguistic distance, and world population of native speakers), not only for its high significance, but also because its direction can change faster and by a larger order of magnitude. Controlling for individual acquired languages, including English, is of no particular importance.
F20|Factor shares, inequality, and capital flows|I present an endogenous growth model where innovations are factor saving and model the choice of technologies in an Overlapping Generations framework. Markets are competitive and factor prices are determined by marginal productivity of factors; therefore, the income share of reproducible factors increases with the stage of development. Beyond the standard results of this type of model I find that (i) without bequests long-run growth is not possible, (ii) if the economy presents long-run growth then intrageneration inequality may last forever but if the economy does not present long-run growth then in steady state, there is no intrageneration inequality, (iii) when the economy is open, the pattern of capital flows depends not only on the relative abundance of factors but also on the technologies and, for this reason, capital may not flow from rich to poor economies, and (iv) consistently, capital flows may not help to break poverty traps.
F20|Tax competition and the relocation process|In this article the author discusses the problem relating to the tax competition in the context of relocation as a process resulting from the ongoing globalization of economic activity. For this purpose the author discusses the essence and causes of tax competition and relocation. The conclusion is that relocation leads usually to an increase in the competitiveness of enterprises, their development, and thus to the development of the economies of individual countries. Healthy competition leads to streamlining the fiscal policies of competing countries and to the creation of a business-friendly atmosphere. Therefore, the role of governments, particularly in the developing countries, is such action, including the use of fiscal instruments, that would enable the achievement of competitive advantage in the international market and socio-economic development.
F20|International patenting by Chinese residents: Constructing a database of Chinese foreign-oriented patent families|This paper analyzes Chinese patenting abroad by constructing a novel database of foreign-oriented patent families (1970–2012) and by distilling stylized facts about China's international patenting strategies. Patent families are a set of related patents filed in one or more foreign jurisdictions to protect the same invention. We find that by the turn of the century China emerged as major actor in terms of international patenting. Nonetheless, the share of Chinese patents which get filed abroad is still a fraction of patents filed at home; most patents abroad also only target one foreign country. Moreover, China's foreign patents are concentrated in a few technology fields and in a few firms, mostly the information technology sector. A shift is underway however to an increased proportion of filings abroad. The paper finds that the main drivers for this change are the desire to facilitate collaboration, to license IP, and to further the firm's reputation as true innovator.
F20|Convergence of European retail payments|We estimate convergence in the European retail payments market during the period 1995–2011 for the most popular retail payment instruments: cash, debit card, credit card, direct debit, credit transfer, cheque and e-money. To estimate convergence, we employ the concepts of beta and sigma convergence. There is some evidence of convergence for all payment instruments, except for cheques and e-money. The results suggest that the cross-country dispersion of the use of payment instruments has declined over time in Europe, and the pace of convergence has picked up since the introduction of the single currency. We also find evidence for beta convergence for card payments, direct debits and credit transfers. The results indicate that convergence in European retail payments has progressed despite the financial crisis.
F20|Regional economic integration and factor mobility in unified Germany|The massive movement of capital and labor in opposite directions is the most striking characteristic of economic integration of Eastern and Western Germany. Beyond that, wage-setting behavior during the early years of unification and massive public social transfers have affected the transition path of the Eastern economy. In this paper, I set up a two-region open economy model with capital and labor mobility, wage-setting behavior, and public social transfers to explain major empirical trends of the German integration episode. I show that the model is able to replicate aggregate migration pattern in unified Germany and that wage-setting behavior has delayed labor productivity convergence between both German regions, whereas public social transfers have reduced the effect of wage setting on East-West net migration.
F20|The Quest to Lower High Remittance Costs to Africa: A Brief Review of the Use of Mobile Banking and Bitcoins|"The paper reviews the last technological tools that arguably can contribute to reducing the excessively high costs of remittance transactions in Africa. Indeed, despite huge remittance inflows to and within the continent, Africa is the most expensive destination to send money to. As remittances have become more important than Overseas Development Assistance and Foreign Direct Investment inflows in some countries, it has become crucial to explore technological advances that can contribute to reducing their transaction costs. Such reduction would enable the end beneficiaries to capture a larger share of these external resources, which in turn could have an even bigger impact on development in Africa. In addition to revisiting the role of mobile banking in lowering remittance transaction prices, the paper takes a closer look at the newest available technology, the Bitcoin blockchain technology that underpins digital currencies. At this early stage, very few social science researchers have addressed the role that such digital currency could play in the reduction of the remittance transaction prices, except for a few innovative Bitcoin operators. The paper proceeds as follows. It first looks at the causes of the high remittance transaction costs. Then, it reviews, presents and analyses the official remittances data downloaded from the World Bank's Remittances Prices Worldwide database. It also briefly reviews a few remittance transfer technological instruments. Given the novelty of the topic, the review of the most recent existing ""literature"" on Bitcoin is mainly retrieved from either on - line news sources or information from a few leading Bitcoin operators. In the light of the UN Global Working Group Post-2015 Development Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals proposal to reduce by 2030 the remittance transaction costs to even less than 3%, the effectiveness of these new technological instruments to reach such objective are discussed. Finally, a number of appropriate policy actions to foster the economic impact of remittances are proposed."
F20|The role of geographical proximity in the international knowledge flows of European firms: an overview of different knowledge transfer mechanisms|The paper provides an overview of the international knowledge flows in Europe particularly looking at the drivers and consequences of such flows as well as the general trend. It distinguishes between different types of mechanisms for the acquisition and transfer of knowledge from trade to research and technological collaboration, mobility of human capital and FDI. The paper is empirical in nature and targeted to a wider audience. The analysis reveals that proximity matters significantly for the mobility of human capital as well as for the establishment of collaborative networks. In both cases, intra-Europe knowledge flows are more important that extra-Europe knowledge flows, thus pointing to the role of the European market facilitating these forms of exchange. The patterns of offshoring of R&D as well as trade networks are rather different- more global than intra-European. In other words, trade and investment networks are more dispersed globally than mobility of human capital and research and technological networks.
F20|Internationalization Of Regional Clusters: Theoretical And Empirical Issues|Today regions are becoming independent actors able to compete globally as globalization of competition is consistent with the localization of competitive advantage. In many ways regional competitiveness is based on the clustering concept. Changes in the global economic environment are making cluster linkages more important, too. Clusters are not capable of long-term excellence and development unless their members are acting in global markets and involved in international knowledge transfer. Thus, internationalization of clusters has turned out to be a new subject of innovation policy and regional development agenda, however lacking strong scientific background in Russia. The paper aims at discovering theoretical and analytical basis for clustering concept and internationalization, the reviewing of best internationalization practices from the clusters worldwide as well as exploring empirical issues of regional clusters` internationalization in Russia and their comparison with the EU outputs. A special emphasis is put on the articulation of practical guide for cluster management organizations responsible for the development of global linkages.

F20|SEDUCTIVE ROUTE TOWARDS CONVERGENCE DISCLOSURE: IFRS FOR SMEs,RUTA SEDUCTORA HACIA LA CONVERGENCIA DIVULGACION: NIIF PARA PYMES|Efforts to standardize accounting standards have been relevant since 1973, with the creation of the IASC. International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) was created in 2001. This entity currently regulates the International Financial Reporting Standards for public companies or full IFRS. These are mainly aimed at satisfying the demands of investors in international stock markets. However, there is another sector that requires standardized and quality reporting. Creditors, government and regulators belong to a group of users that need uniform financial information, enabling them to rate companies, analyze disclosure and make decisions. Addressing the claim of these, in 2009 the IASB, creates the IFRS for SMEss or little IFRS. The main attraction for adoption is that they have minimum requirements for implementation and disclosure. It is pertinent to investigate whether these requirements are a seductive element that motivates companies to implement them. The study emphasized disclosure requirements and a comparison that shows simplicity in the application of little IFRS. The trend of adoption varies between continents. The advantages and disadvantages of these rules are listed, statistics of adoption and ideas for further academic research.
F20|Are energy market integrations a green light for FDI?|This paper studies the effect of energy market integration (EMI) on foreign direct investment (FDI). EMIs diminish energy uncertainty and price volatility in the host country and affect FDI through two channels: first, by harmonizing energy prices and, second, by reducing price dispersion. FDI may, as a result, increase both within and outside the EMI area, through energy stability mechanisms and price mechanisms, respectively. An empirical application on a global dataset including bilateral FDI data, during 2003-2012, using the gravity equation, shows that the integration of Portugal and Spain's electricity market in 2007 increased the amount of FDI's participants. Additionally, a positive increase in FDI from neighboring countries (in this instance, France), albeit lower in magnitude, is observed.
F20|Does ICT Investment Spur or Hamper Offshoring? Empirical Evidence from Microdata|In this paper we provide empirical evidence on the effect of ICT investment on the propensity to offshore for a large sample of Italian manufacturing firms. Contrary to previous literature focusing on the service sector, after taking into account the endogeneity of ICT investment in the offshoring decision equation we find a negative and significant effect of ICT on the propensity to offshore some stages of the production process. Furthermore this effect turns out not to depend on the type of ICT investment and applies both to hardware and software/telecommunication expenditures. A potential explanation for our finding is that ICT investments in manufacturing increase the complementarity of production processes within the firm, thereby reducing the incentive to offshore. Our results seem therefore to suggest that negative exogenous shocks to ICT prices - possibly induced by targeted policy programs aimed at the diffusion of ICT technologies - do not favor offshoring of manufacturing activities.
F20|International business travel: an engine of innovation?|While it is well known that managers prefer in-person meetings for negotiating deals and selling their products, face-to-face communication may be particularly important for the transfer of technology because technology is best explained and demonstrated in person. This paper studies the role of short-term cross-border labor movements for innovation by estimating the recent impact of U.S. business travel to foreign countries on their patenting rates. Business travel is shown to have a significant effect up and beyond technology transfer through international trade and foreign direct investment. On average, a 10 % increase in business travel leads to an increase in patenting by about 0.2 %, and inward business travel is about one fourth as potent for innovation as domestic R&D spending. We show that the technological knowledge of each business traveler matters by estimating a higher impact for travelers that originate in U.S. states with substantial innovation, such as California. This study provides initial evidence that international air travel may be an important channel through which cross-country income differences can be reduced.

F20|Geographical Factors in Determining IFDI Policy|With the initiative of the West China Development policy, the flow of Inward Foreign Direct Investment (IFDI) gradually increased in western China. This paper investigates and tests the determinants of IFDI for western China’s11 provincesduring2002 – 2008. By compiling a pool data set and employing General Least Squares (GLS) with fixed effects model in natural logarithmic form, we explorethe IFDI in western China thoroughly. The proposed model illustrates reliable estimates of determinants of IFDI for the region. The market size, laborcosts, education level, imports and highway length are found to have a significant relationship with IFDI in western China, hence, they may be considered as determinants. On the other hand, research and development (R&D), length of railways, and postal and telecommunication services have a statistically insignificant effect on IFDI.
F20|Imputation of missing expenditure information in standard household income surveys|The aim of this paper is to present a new methodology for dealing with missing expenditure information in standard income surveys. Under given conditions, typical imputation procedures, such as statistical matching or regression-based models, can replicate well in the income survey both the unconditional density of household expenditure and its joint density with a set of socio-demographic variables that the two surveys have in common. However, standard imputation procedures may fail in capturing the overall relation between income and expenditure, especially if the common control variables used for the imputation have a weak correlation with the missing information. The paper suggests a two-step imputation procedure that allows reproducing the joint relation between income and expenditure observed from external sources, while maintaining the advantages of traditional imputation methods. The proposed methodology suits well for any empirical analysis that needs to relate income and consumption, such as the estimation of Engel curves or the evaluation of consumption taxes through micro-simulation models. An empirical application shows the makings of such a technique for the evaluation of the distributive effects of consumption taxes and proves that common imputation methods may produce significantly biased results in terms of policy recommendations when the control variables used for the imputation procedure are weakly correlated with the missing variable.

F20|Simulating Russia’S And Other Large Economies’ Challenging And Interconnected Transitions|This paper develops a large-scale, dynamic life-cycle model to simulate Russia’s demographic and fiscal transition under favorable and unfavorable fossil-fuel price regimes. The model includes Russia, the U.S., China, India, the EU, and Japan+ (Japan plus Korea). The model predicts dramatic increases in tax rates in the U.S., EU, India, and Russia. Indeed, the increases are so large as to question their political feasibility let alone their actual collection given the potential for tax avoidance and tax evasion.
F20|The European Social Models Facing the Economic Crisis|European social models that emerged in Europe are answers to various problems faced by micro and macroeconomic activity. The austerity measures adopted by some of these models have led, in most cases, to a deepening of the economic recession. European social models which had an innovative investment plan, mainly Scandinavian model, managed to pass easily from the critical moments, increasing prosperity and living standards. This paper provides an overview of how the European social models have attempted to revive their economies. The main hypothesis of the paper assumes that investments in education and workforce improvement led to the growth of the living standards in the Scandinavian model.
F20|European Clustering Landscape - a Short Description|One of the objectives of the European Commission is to build a Europe based on knowledge, rapid and sustainable growth and on social progress. Cooperation between businesses, universities, research institutes and public authorities through forms of partnership of cluster type can support this objective. Defined by many experts by terms such as research cluster, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT cluster), industrial clusters and innovative cluster, this form of partnership rests increasingly often in discussion and public debates. Clusters have become the subject of a whole series of documents issued by national and international organizations; it is increasingly promoted the idea that due to clusters competitiveness increase, workforce specializes, businesses and regional economies develop.
F20|A Region of Welfare and a New Path for Europe|By 2020, the European Union, prefigures an economic and social system based on social and economic policy coordination in order to generate the growth for a sustainable development, for the level of employment and social cohesion. The challenges faced by the European Union are greater than before the recession and have a much broader area, starting with fundamental economic issues to social instability. This paper provides an overview of how the European social model should revive the economic system. The main hypothesis of the paper assumes that social market economy with valence in social responsibility can be a viable solution for the future of the European Union.
F20|Debt concentration of European Firms|This paper investigates the level of debt specialization across European firms relying on a cross-country comparable sample of manufacturing firms. We find that a number of firm characteristics -- such as firm size and age -- help predict the firm composition of the various types of debts (i.e. debt specialization) but not the level of each debt share. In particular, we observe that small and young firms have a more concentrated debt structure (i.e. they rely on few types of debt). However, these relationships are not linear and seem to be U-shaped. We also find that Spanish firms have the most diversified debt structure, and that diversified firms are less likely to experience a severe reduction in turnover.
F20|Procesos de internacionalización en la educación superior de Costa Rica<BR>[Internationalisation Processes in Costarican Higher Education]|One of the most important dimensions in the development of contemporary higher education is internationalization. The growing economic, political and cultural integration of today's society, favors the intensification of the activities of internationalization by settlements and the various tertiary education systems, as well as the elaboration of public policies to promote global linkages and aggregation of this dimension as a key element in the management of educational institutions in this sector. Among the most notable actions of internationalization are the mobility of students and teachers; the multiplication of networks and institutional and academic associations, in various areas of knowledge. There so, the application of mechanisms of mutual recognition of accredited degrees and programs; the promotion of shared titles or double degree programs; the inclusion in the curriculum of the international dimensions, as well as the proliferation of cross-border programs. All of them are expressions of internationalization in contemporary higher education. The purpose pursued with the study is to carry out an approach to knowledge about the level reached by the processes of internationalization in Costa Rican higher education. The investigation on the main actions promoted in this field, the forms of institutional arrangements adopted for its development, existing institutional policies and the impact of initiatives in institutional life and shape how internationalization is conceptualized, are some of the ways followed to get this purpose.
F20|Rational Asymmetric Development: Transfer Pricing and Sub-Saharan Africa’s Extreme Poverty Tragedy|A recent publication by the World Bank on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has established that extreme poverty has been decreasing in all regions of the world with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), in spite of over two decades of growth resurgence. This chapter explores the role of transfer pricing in SSA’s extreme poverty tragedy. The analytical structure entails: (i) emphasis of rational asymmetric development as the dark side of transfer pricing, (ii) evidence that the recent growth resurgence in African countries has been driven substantially by resource-rich countries which are experiencing high levels of exclusive growth and extreme poverty, (iii) the practice of transfer pricing by multinationals operating in resource-rich countries of SSA and (iv) a Zambian case study of extreme poverty and transfer pricing schemes by Glencore in the copper industry. While transfer pricing is contributing to diminishing African growth, available evidence shows that the component growth that is not captured by transfer pricing does not trickle down to the poor because the African elite is also captured by practices of rational asymmetric development. Policy implications for the fight against extreme poverty are discussed.
F20|Rational Asymmetric Development: Transfer Mispricing and Sub-Saharan Africa’s Extreme Poverty Tragedy|A recent publication by the World Bank on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has established that extreme poverty has been decreasing in all regions of the world with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), in spite of over two decades of growth resurgence. This chapter explores the role of transfer mispricing in SSA’s extreme poverty tragedy. The analytical structure entails: (i) emphasis of rational asymmetric development as the dark side of transfer pricing; (ii) linkages between financial reporting, international financial reporting standards (IFRS), transfer pricing and poverty; (iii) evidence that the recent growth resurgence in African countries has been driven substantially by resource-rich countries which are experiencing high levels of exclusive growth and extreme poverty; (iv) the practice of transfer mispricing by multinationals operating in resource-rich countries of SSA and (v) a Zambian case study of extreme poverty and transfer mispricing schemes by Glencore in the copper industry. While transfer mispricing is contributing to diminishing African growth, available evidence shows that the component of growth that is not captured by transfer mispricing does not trickle down to the poor because the African elite is also animated by practices of rational asymmetric development. Policy implications for the fight against extreme poverty are discussed.
F20|Analysis Regarding the Growing Presence of Italian Firms in Romania|At the end of 2014, the number of firms with an Italian presence in Romania was 39,556, representing 19.33% out of total registered firms and this number is still growing. This article focuses on answering the following question: what kind of Italian firms are investing in Romania and why? Starting from the empirical observation that the number of Italian firms in Romania grew by 6.82% last year, we have used a PESTEL analysis to find the key points characterizing the country, paying attention also to the concept of country brand. From the point of view of Italian firms, we have also analyzed the shifting paradigm of internationalization from a Vertical Foreign Direct Investment model to a Horizontal Foreign Direct Investment model. This paper can be useful for managers and entrepreneurs who are oriented towards investing in Romania following the path of Italian firms.
F20|The impact of the financial crisis under the effects of increasing global economic interdependence. The case of Eastern and Central Europe Economies|The technological progress that arose in areas such as transportation, communication and information exchange has led to a series of consequences that forced national economies to converge into a global, market based economy. In addition to the aforementioned causes, increased liberalisation amidst financial markets has supplemented the initiation of this metamorphosis that had several benefits in terms of general commercial exchange (trade), capital flows, and investment opportunities for business organisations. Simultaneously with the financial leverage resulted from the expansion of these interconnections, a series of channels that are detrimental to the financial welfare of entities has emerged, which, in consequence elevated the vulnerability and susceptibility to external economic shocks. The major debate elicited by this trade-off mainly concerns the costs and benefits of the international liberalisation of capital flows and trade. The purpose of this article is to examine the methods through which globalisation has affected the expansion of the international financial crisis back in 2008, by identifying and assessing the subsequent transfer routes, to and from the United States, where it was initially triggered. This article also aims to evaluate the repercussions experienced by Central and Eastern Europe and how they re-established economic growth following the financial crisis.
F20|Realizing an ASEAN Economic Community: Progress and Remaining Challenges|"Launched as a political bloc and security pact in the aftermath of the Viet Nam War, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has evolved to embrace an ambitious economic agenda. Its latest project is to establish the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by 31 December 2015. Fulfilling these commitments would promote predictability in ASEAN, as well as strengthen its credibility. But is ASEAN likely to meet this deadline? The blueprint for achieving the goal envisages the AEC standing on four pillars and meeting the deadline depends on progress on each of them. Each pillar presents a demanding set of challenges to be met before the AEC can be fully realized. We find that although ASEAN has come a long way toward realizing its goal, the challenges that remain suggest that the AEC will miss its approaching deadline. Accommodating AEC accords will not be easy when they require changes to domestic laws or even the national constitution. The flexibility that characterizes ASEAN cooperation, the celebrated ""ASEAN way,"" may hand member states a convenient pretext for noncompliance. How to enforce the accords remains an issue. If the AEC is to be more than a display of political solidarity, ASEAN must find a way to give the commitments more teeth. The real test for the community, therefore, will lie in the years ahead."
F20|The Nexus between FDI and Growth in the SAARC Member Countries|This paper examines the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) on South Asian economies' output growth, utilizing recent panel cointegration testing and estimation techniques. Annual panel data on eight SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) member countries' macroeconomic variables over the period 1960- 2013 are employed in empirical analysis. Using various heterogeneous panel cointegration and panel causality tests, a bi-directional relationship between FDI and growth is found. We find evidence for both FDI-led growth and growth-induced FDI hypotheses for the South Asian economies over the sample period. Individual member countries exhibit heterogeneity in terms of the direction or existence of causality subject to their idiosyncratic economic conditions. Among various regressors, FDI, financial development, human capital, and government consumption show the most significant positive effects on output growth. As determinants of FDI, GDP, financial development, human capital, and government consumption are found significant in the region. The bi-directional causality between FDI and growth is found robust to the inclusion of other control variables and using different estimation techniques.
F20|Time-Varying Causality between Oil and Commodity Prices in the Presence of Structural Breaks and Nonlinearity - Causalità time-varying tra petrolio e prezzi delle materie prime in presenza di break strutturali e di non-linearità|The recent commodity price dynamics has spurred interest to understand determinants of commodity price movements. This paper investigates the causal relationship between oil prices and the prices of 25 other commodities, which include both metals and agricultural products, in the presence of instability and nonlinearity. For this purpose, we make use of a long annual time series dataset spanning from 1900 to 2011, and analyze time-varying Granger causality test, since the inference drawn based on linear Granger causality tests could be invalid due to structural breaks and nonlinearity – which we show are present in the relationship between the variables of interest. We find that, under the case of time-varying causality there are fewer rejections of the null than under the standard linear Granger causality test, thus highlighting the importance of accounting for instability and nonlinearity. Relying on the time-varying causality test, we observe stronger evidence of other commodity prices in predicting (in-sample) oil prices (15 cases) than the other way around (7 cases). - La recente dinamica dei prezzi delle materie prime ha stimolato l’interesse verso lo studio delle determinanti delle variazioni di tali prezzi. Questo studio esamina la relazione causale tra prezzi petroliferi e i prezzi di altre 25 materie prime, inclusi metalli e prodotti agricoli, in presenza di instabilità e nonlinearità. A questo scopo vengono utilizzate numerose serie di dati annuali dal 1900 al 2011 e si applica il test di Granger-causality time-varying, in quanto i risultati dei test lineari potrebbero essere non validi a causa dei break strutturali e delle non-linearità presenti nella relazione tra le variabili considerate. I risultati evidenziano che nel caso della causalità time-varying ci sono meno rigetti del valore zero che nel caso del test standard lineare di Granger, segnalando così l’importanza dell’instabilità e della non-linearità. Sulla base del test di causalità time-varying osserviamo una maggiore capacità dei prezzi delle altre materie prime nel predire (in campione) i prezzi petroliferi che il viceversa (sette casi).

The universe of study was 17 strawberries exporters located in México. To make the results analysis it was used SPSS software. The results were that the factors that most matters for the strawberries exporters to develop a geographical diversification strategy are exporting experience, productivity and firm size.
F20|Debt Concentration of European Firms|This paper investigates the level of debt specialization across European firms relying on a cross-country comparable sample of manufacturing firms. We find that a number of firm characteristics – such as firm size and age – help predict the firm composition of the various types of debts (i.e. debt specialization) but not the level of each debt share. In particular, we observe that small and young firms have a more concentrated debt structure (i.e. they rely on few types of debt). However, these relationships are not linear and seem to be U-shaped. We also find that Spanish firms have the most diversified debt structure, and that diversified firms are less likely to experience a severe reduction in turnover.
F20|A risk-adequate valuation of Brazilian companies using the example of Arezzo Indústria e Comércio S.A|Whether and to what extent an investor conducts a direct investment depends inter alia on how much the investor assesses the risk of a direct investment. This article examines the risk-adequate valuation of foreign equity investments. Foreign equity investments can be calculat-ed with an investment calculating procedure; however, the final decision regarding the foreign shareholding depends on the investor’s subjective risk assessment. This subjective risk as-sessment may lead to a determination that the investment risk is overvalued or undervalued. Therefore, it is possible that the investor loses opportunities or mistakenly invests. Hence, we will present different objectives and risk-adequate methods to value companies. The risk as-sessment can be performed using previously existing credit rating agencies and insurance company risk assessments, or it can be performed using the theory of international parity rela-tions. This new method is used to evaluate foreign companies. Also it is possible to simulate changes in a foreign equity investment over a long period and using scenarios. This will be performed using the fashion group Arezzo Indústria e Comércio SA in Brazil as the example. The acquired knowledge allows the investor to make an objective and risk-adequate assess-ment of foreign equity investments.
F20|A Financial Perspective on the UK Current Account Deficit|A drop in net FDI investment income has been the primary factor in the recent deterioration in the measured UK current account balance, with the trade balance relatively stable. We argue that financial engineering (with little net impact on the underlying international investment position for the UK) may have contributed to the decline in net FDI investment income, such that the headline current account balance cannot be interpreted as a sufficient indicator of the state of the UK's external position. A more granular analysis of cross-border financial linkages than is possible with currently-published data would be required in order to provide a comprehensive assessment of external sustainability.
F20|Social-Cultural Function and Role of Gender in Development of Global Business|To study the problems of gender equality is of great importance for the global business. Gender is a cultural construct, within which our different cultures attach different values, roles and responsibilities to women and men. However, in addition to culture, the gender issues are in close relation with the global business. From this viewpoint, experience of the West is considerable and of great importance. It can be said that the problems of women?s rights and a whole number of barriers, which impede to reach the gender equality have long been a great problem for the leading countries of Europe and America. But one problems remains ? the so-called ?glass ceiling? ? the barriers, which impede carrier advance of the female representatives. At the same time, in the countries on the stage of low development, women are still considered to be minor creatures, which do not have the rights for not only work, but education equal to men. To this are added the religious laws of Islamic countries, which radically separates the rights of women and men from one another and often consider women?s public activities inacceptable. In the background of such diversity it is interesting to familiarize with the apprehension of gender equality in Georgia. In the present study the ways for settlement of the problem mentioned above are given.
F20|Terrorism, as Social-Political Phenomenon and Impeding Factor for Global Business|Economic stability and peace are the important determinants of socio-economic development in the modern world. Analysis of the situation in conflicting regions worldwide clarifies that at the modern stage it is very complicated to reach this. One of the main factors, which cause the process of economic and political destabilization, is global terrorism, which became the world?s important phenomenon. After the terrorist act of 11 September in the USA in 2001 and terrorist act on the journal ?Charlie Hebdo? in Paris in 2015 the problem became more actual. Compared with 2013, in 2014 the world terrorism threat increased up to 61%, which considerably limits dynamic development of the global market.In such countries, where threat of terrorism is high, it becomes far difficult to develop the international trade relations, inflow of foreign investments reduces, and the danger of starting business is high. Within this context, the main principles of market formation are determined not by the supply-demand phenomenon, but the main source of its destabilization is the fear caused in result of terrorism. In result of we receive atrophied market relations, when separate states possess relevant resources and economic potential for economic development, but in result of interference of exogamic forces (terrorism) it is impossible to perfectly master them and, owing to this, dynamic development of the economic system. In the present article we studied the socio-political aspects of terrorism and its influence on the global business.
F20|I've Been Everywhere (Except Mexico): Investor Responses to NAFTA's Cross-Border Trucking Provisions|We investigate the response of US trucking firms to the removal of barriers to cross-border trucking under NAFTA. This was done via a program implemented in 2007, cancelled in 2009, and reinstated in 2011. We find that, unsurprisingly, the program's start resulted in lower stock returns, particularly for border firms. However, later policy changes indicate that investors, and particularly those in US multinationals, viewed the pilot as beneficial. We use a model of endogenous exporting to show that this can arise from incorrect expectations of import competition.
F20|Long-run profits in times of crisis: A comparison between European SMEs and large companies|This is pioneering research in that it makes a comparison of the process of convergence of long-run profits in the manufacturing sector of six European countries (2000-12), differentiating between SMEs and large firms, and by identifying the impact of the crisis on this process. The results obtained by employing the convergence model, known as the Partial Adjustment Model, indicate that the inter-country competitive process, is working better among large companies than among SMEs. The impact of the crisis on this process has been uneven across the countries and the sizes of the firms.
F20|How Deep Is Your Love? A Quantitative Spatial Analysis of the Transatlantic Trade Partnership|This paper explores the quantitative consequences of transatlantic trade liberalization envisioned in a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the United States and the European Union. Our key innovation is to develop a new quantitative spatial trade model and to use an associated technique which is extraordinarily parsimonious and tightly connects theory and data. We take input-output linkages across industries into account and make use of the recently established World Input Output Database (WIOD). We also explore the consequences of labor mobility across local labor markets in Germany and the countries of the European Union. We address the considerable uncertainties connected both with the quantification of non-tariff trade barriers and the outcome of the negotiations by taking a corridor of trade liberalization paths into account.
F20|Simulating Russia’s and Other Large Economies’ Challenging and Interconnected Transitions|This paper develops a large-scale, dynamic life-cycle model to simulate Russia’s demographic and fiscal transition under favorable and unfavorable fossil-fuel price regimes. The model includes Russia, the U.S., China, India, the EU, and Japan+ (Japan plus Korea). The model predicts dramatic increases in tax rates in the U.S., EU, India, and Russia. Indeed, the increases are so large as to question their political feasibility let alone their actual collection given the potential for tax avoidance and tax evasion.
F20|Did Chinese Outward Activity Attenuate or Aggravate the Great Recession in Developing Countries?|Using data on Chinese large-scale overseas investment and project contracts by sector, we analyze in a quasi-experimental set-up whether Chinese outward activity (COA) before the crisis worsened or alleviated the contractionary phases in developing countries. We find that, on average, COA did not increase vulnerability to the global recession. However, both the sectoral targeting and the size of the pre-crisis engagement matter: While COA in clearly to financial markets tied sectors implied an aggravation, substantial pre-crisis investment in the energy, metals and transportation industries implied an attenuation of the slump.
F20|On the Interaction Between Migration, Capital Formation, and the Price for Housing Services|We theoretically investigate the effects of interregional labor market integration on the dynamic interaction between migration flows, capital formation, and the price for housing services. The nature of this interaction depends on initial conditions at the time of labor market integration. In an initially capital-poor economy, there may be a reversal of migration flows during the transition to the steady state, like observed in Eastern Europe after 1990. In a high-productivity country which attracts immigrants, the price for housing services and the rental rate of land increase along with (residential) capital investments. Welfare effects are heterogeneous: whereas landless individuals lose from immigration because of increases in the price for housing services, landowners may win because of an increasing rental rate of land.
F20|Do Stringent Environmental Policies Deter FDI? M&A versus Greenfield|This study examines how environmental stringency affects the location decision of foreign direct investments. We analyze a firm-level data set on German outbound FDI and innovate on previous studies by controlling for the mode of entry and applying the mixed-logit analysis. The results show that Greenfield projects react to environmental regulation in a strongly different way than M&As. We find robust support for pollution haven hypothesis for polluting Greenfields. M&A investments in low polluting industries, on the other hand, seem to be attracted by stricter environmental regulation. We introduce a new instrumental variable for environmental stringency and apply it to verify the results.
F20|Conventional or Atypical: FDI in the Internationalisation Process of Polish Firms|The principal aim of this study is to provide preliminary evidence on whether Polish firms behave according to the conventional theory of firm internationalisation. To fulfil this objective, an overarching research hypothesis that Polish firms follow gradual expansion patterns is formulated based on theoretical concepts and available data on Polish internationalisation. It is subsequently tested on a sample of 98 Polish outward investors. While the study confirms the gradual expansion patterns of Polish firms, in which exports and contract manufacturing mostly precede foreign direct investiment (FDI) projects in a given host country, there is also visible evidence for irregular internationalisation paths, in which FDI is the first entry mode into foreign markets. The vast majority of Polish outward investors still control a limited network of foreign subsidiaries. The paper is one of the few studies explicitly related to establishment chains of Polish firms, thus providing an empirical contribution to the debate on the internationalisation of emerging multinationals. The limited scope of Polish firms' internationalisation indicates an important need for a more widespread implementation of support policies.
F20|Soft, hard or smart power? International students and investments abroad|This paper analyses the impact of education networks on the FDI from the United States and United Kingdom in 167 countries during 1999-2011. Proxies of networks are international students in the US and UK and alumni associations abroad. Results show that education networks boost the British FDI, while their influence on American FDI is weak, except for foreign students of the Cold War period and alumni associations. The gap is partly explained by the different political and economic roles played by the US and UK on the world stage. Results are robust to different econometric specifications.
F20|Politiche di innovazione e trasferimento tecnologico in Toscana. Ricognizione degli strumenti attivati nel periodo 2000-2013|"The survey of innovation policies and technology transfer activated by the Tuscany Region (Italy) in the periods 2000-2006 and 2007-2013 is one of the tools to support the research project ""Poli.in_Analysis and modeling of Innovation Poles in Tuscany"". In the first part of this paper we present a detailed review of innovation policies in Tuscany, by listing the calls, decrees and infrastructure created by the various policies, from the RIS and RIS +, implemented at the end of the 90s and early 2000s, to the last decrees issued in July 2014 on the basis of policies ERDF 2014-2020. On the basis of the legislation analyzed, we propose a timeline with a graphical representation where we highlight the relationship between the decrees, calls for funding and infrastructure created in the period 2000-2014. Where possible, the financial resources available to the region are reported. To define the purpose, the time evolution and the mutual relations between the entities and the infrastructure is the Glossary containing: the description of the infrastructure that facilitate or promote innovation; some definitions of the key technology transfer system in Tuscany; definitions of the services included in the catalog of advanced and qualified services. The Glossary is divided into three sections: Infrastructure or entities that facilitate or promote innovation; Definition; Qualified services. The sources used to prepare the report and the time line were those provided by the Region and, as a supplement, other documents and decrees that have been sourced from the official site of the Tuscany Region. As for the preparation of the glossary, in addition to the official documents of the Region of Tuscany we used also the corporate websites of the various entities described."
F20|Soft, hard or smart power? International students and investments abroad|This paper analyses the impact of education networks on the FDI from the United States and United Kingdom to 167 countries during 1999 - 2011. Proxies of networks are i nternational students in the US and UK and alumni associations abroad. Results show that international students boost the British FDI to their home countries, while their inf luence on American FDI is weak , except for students from developing economies and for international students who attended university during the Cold War. Alumni associations have a substantial impact on both American and British FDI , but especially on the latter. The stronger impact of education networks on British FDI is partly related to the different political and economic role s played by the US and UK on the world stage , and to their different use of soft and hard power. Results are robust to different econometric specifications.
F20|Is Sell-Side Research More Valuable in Bad Times?|In bad times, uncertainty is high, so that investors find it more difficult to assess the prospects of the firms they invest in. Learning models suggest that in such times investors should, everything else equal, value informative signals such as analyst forecasts and recommendations more than in good times. However, the higher uncertainty in bad times and career concerns stemming from troubled employers may make the task of analysts harder, so that analyst output is noisier and hence less valuable in bad times. Consequently, whether analyst forecasts and recommendations are more valuable during bad times is an empirical matter. We examine a large sample of analyst output from 1983 to 2011. We find that analysts work harder in bad times, but their earnings forecasts accuracy is worse and that they disagree more. Despite more inaccurate earnings forecasts, revisions to earnings forecasts and stock recommendations have a more influential stock-price impact during bad times as predicted by a learning model.
F20|Would a Growth Slowdown in Emerging Markets Spill Over to High-income Countries?: A Quantitative Assessment|Growth in emerging market economies (EMEs) is set to durably slow from the rates observed over 2010-12 as cyclical effects fade, potential growth declines and external financing conditions tighten. Large negative current account balances make some EMEs vulnerable to sudden reversals in capital flows while exceptionally rapid credit expansions, as those observed in Brazil, China, Poland and Turkey over the past years, may have raised financial risk. This paper assesses recent developments and vulnerabilities in EMEs and uses macroeconometric model simulations to provide quantitative estimates of spillovers to highincome countries. The results suggest that for each slowdown of 2 percentage points in EMEs, highincome countries’ growth could be around ⅔ percentage points lower on average, with around ½ percentage point accounted for by trade. Experience with past EME crises suggests that this could be exacerbated by effects from exchange rates and by financial market turbulence. OECD countries which would be hit hardest include Belgium, Japan and the Netherlands, reflecting mainly strong trade linkages with EMEs. Quelles retombées d'un ralentissement dans les pays émergents sur les pays à haut revenu ? : Une évaluation quantitative La croissance dans les économies des marchés émergents (EMEs) va se ralentir durablement par rapport à la période 2010-2012 à mesure de la disparition des effets cycliques, du déclin de la croissance potentielle et du durcissement des conditions financières externes. D’importants déficits de la balance des transactions courantes rendent certains EMEs vulnérables à des inversions soudaines des flux de capitaux tandis que des expansions rapides des crédits, comme ceux observées ces dernières années au Brésil, en Chine, Pologne et Turquie, ont pu augmenter les risques financiers. Ce papier montre les récents développements et les vulnérabilités des EMEs ; il utilise en outre des simulations d’un modèle macroéconométrique pour donner une estimation quantitative des effets sur les pays à haut revenu. Les résultats suggèrent que pour chaque ralentissement de 2 points de pourcentage des EMEs, les pays à haut revenu auraient une croissance environ ⅔ point de pourcentage plus basse en moyenne, avec à peu près ½ point de pourcentage qui viendrait du commerce. Au vu de l’expérience des EMEs avec les crises passées, cet effet pourrait être augmenté par des effets via les taux de change et des turbulences sur les marchés financiers. Les pays de l’OCDE les plus touchés seraient la Belgique, le Japon et les Pays-Bas, ce qui reflète principalement les liens commerciaux importants qu’ils ont avec les EMEs.
F20|Economic Diplomacy – the Case of Slovenia|This paper discusses the importance of economic diplomacy for a small open economy in the case of Slovenia. Additionally, it also discusses the importance of foreign trade and foreign trade promotion for growth and development of a small open economy, in the same case. Nowadays, economic diplomacy plays a very important role in restoring economic stability, which is, in addition to political stability, essential for peace and prosperity, both in Slovenia and elsewhere in the world.
F20|The Unbalanced Physical Movements of International Trade|The goods produced in developed nations are often of higher quality, advanced technology and better design, hence goods even with little physical mass have higher value than goods produced in developing nations. This means that if the payment is balanced between developed and developing nations, the physical mass must be unbalanced. As a result, developed nations will become increasingly heavier, and the northern hemisphere where developed nations are clustered will also become more and more heavy. The earth will be reshaped like a ice-cream. Using customs data we confirm this conjecture.
F20|The Malfunctioning of the Gulf Cooperation Council Single Market: Features, Causes and Remedies|Five years after its inception, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) single market is malfunctioning in a litany of ways: there remain restrictions on the movement of goods, capital and labor across political boundaries. This paper describes the GCC single market’s malfunctions. We also propose remedies, taking advantage of the single market experiences of, among others, the European Union. A key conclusion is that there is an absence of GCC supranational political institutions powerful enough to enforce rules, with the exception of the Supreme Council, which is itself not designed to deal with day-to-day issues such as enforcing a single market. Consequently, the GCC needs to alter its institutional structure if it wants the single market to operate correctly.
