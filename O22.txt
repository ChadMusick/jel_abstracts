O22|International Business Travel and Technology Sourcing|Access to new foreign technology is often central to countries' development strategies. However, we know very little about the quantitative impact of technology sourcing. In this paper, we study the role of outward international business travel for technology sourcing and innovation by examining whether patenting in European regions is affected by the number of business travelers heading to the United States. Using European regional patent data for the years 1996 to 2010 from Eurostat and information on incoming business travelers from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Survey of International Air Traveler, we find that controlling for a region's R&D spending and size, innovation is increasing in the number of business travelers of the region to the United States. Technology sourcing through in-person business travel is not only statistically but economically significant accounting, for example, it accounts for 20% of the higher patenting in Germany's Greater Stuttgart area, compared to Portugal's Algarve region.
O22|Nonlinear Pricing in Village Economies|This paper examines the price of basic staples in rural Mexico. We document that nonlinear pricing in the form of quantity discounts is common, that quantity discounts are sizable for typical staples, and that the well-known conditional cash transfer program Progresa has significantly increased quantity discounts, although the program, as documented in previous studies, has not affected on average unit prices. To account for these patterns, we propose a model of price discrimination that nests those of Maskin and Riley (1984) and Jullien (2000), in which consumers differ in their tastes and, because of subsistence constraints, in their ability to pay for a good. We show that under mild conditions, a model in which consumers face heterogeneous subsistence or budget constraints is equivalent to one in which consumers have access to heterogeneous outside options. We rely on known results (Jullien (2000)) to characterize the equilibrium price schedule, which is nonlinear in quantity. We analyze the effect of nonlinear pricing on market participation as well as the impact of a market-wide transfer, analogous to the Progresa one, when consumers are differentially constrained. We show that the model is structurally identified from data on prices and quantities from a single market under common assumptions. We estimate the model using data from municipalities and localities in Mexico on three commonly consumed commodities. Interestingly, we find that nonlinear pricing is beneficial to a large number of households, including those consuming small quantities, relative to linear pricing mostly because of the higher degree of market participation that nonlinear pricing induces. We also show that the Progresa transfer has affected the slopes of the price schedules of the three commodities we study, which have become steeper as consistent with our model, leading to an increase in the intensity of price discrimination. Finally, we show that a reduced form of our model, in which the size of quantity discounts depends on the hazard rate of the distribution of quantities purchased in a village, accounts for the shift in price schedules induced by the program.
O22|Improving Access and Quality in Early Childhood Development Programs: Experimental Evidence from The Gambia|This paper studies two experiments of early childhood development programs in The Gambia: one increasing access to services, and another improving service quality. In the first experiment, new community-based early childhood development (ECD) centers were introduced to randomly chosen villages that had no pre-existing structured ECD services. In the second experiment, a randomly assigned subset of existing ECD centers received intensive provider training. We find no evidence that either intervention improved average levels of child development. Exploratory analysis suggests that, in fact, the first experiment, which increased access to relatively low quality ECD services, led to declines in child development among children from less disadvantaged households. Evidence supports that these households may have been steered away from better quality early childhood settings in their homes.
O22|Value Chain Development as Public Policy: Conceptualization and Evidence from the Agri-Food Sector in Bangladesh|Value chain development (VCD) has become a popular policy instrument to help farmers in developing countries access markets. While VCD initiated by the private sector has received much attention in the literature, there is yet little research on public-led VCD. This paper provides a conceptualization of public-led VCD and discusses in what context it can be a relevant policy instrument. As an illustration, the paper then describes the project “SAFAL”, which directly intervenes in the aquaculture, horticulture, and dairy sector of South-West Bangladesh. Using a matched difference-in-difference methodology, it is estimated that SAFAL increased farmers’ output market participation, food production, and smallholder welfare, and reduced the number of days in which participating households were food insecure.
O22|Employment Structure and the Rise of the Modern Tax System|This paper studies how the transition from self-employment to employee-jobs over the long run of development explains growth in income tax capacity. I construct a new database which covers 100 household surveys across countries at different income levels and 140 years of historical data within the US (1870-2010). Using these data, I first establish four new stylized facts: 1) within country, the share of employees increases over the income distribution, and increases at all levels of income as a country develops; 2) the income tax exemption threshold moves down the income distribution as a country develops, tracking employee growth; 3) the employee share above the tax exemption threshold is maximized and remains constantly high; 4) movements in the tax exemption threshold account for the observed variation in tax collection across development. These findings are consistent with a model where a high employee share is a necessary condition for effective taxation and where the rise in income covered by information trails through increases in employee shares drives expansion of the income tax base. To provide a causal estimate of the impact of employee share on the exemption threshold, I study a state-led US development program implemented in the 1950s-60s which shifted up the level of employee share. The identification strategy exploits within-state changes in court-litigation status which generates quasi-experimental variation in the effective implementation date of the program. I find that the exogenous increase in employee share is associated with an expansion of the state income tax base and an increase in state income tax revenue.
O22|The Effect of the Universal Primary Education Program on Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from Tanzania|The purpose of this article is to study the effect of education on labor market participation and household consumption in a rural environment. The Tanzanian Universal Primary Education (UPE) program, which provides variations in education across locations and over time, is used as a natural experiment. Exploiting these two exogenous variations to instrument education, I find that education increases household consumption, especially in agriculture and in nonfarm self-employment activities. I also provide evidence that education increases the probability of working in agriculture. These results, initially surprising, suggest that returns to education in agriculture are positive, provided that the skills taught at school are suitable for agriculture.
O22|Anchoring in project duration estimation|The success of a business project often relies on the accuracy of its schedule. Inaccurate and overoptimistic schedules can lead to significant project failures. In this paper, we explore whether the presence of anchors, such as relatively uninformed suggestions or expectations of the duration of project tasks, play a role in the project estimating and planning process. Our laboratory experiment contributes to the methodology of investigating the robustness and persistence of the anchoring effect in the following ways: (1) we investigate the anchoring effect by comparing the behavior in low and high anchor treatments with a control treatment where no anchor is present; (2) we provide a more accurate measurement by incentivizing participants to provide their best duration estimates; (3) we test the persistence of the anchoring effect over a longer horizon; (4) we evaluate the anchoring effect also on retrospective estimates. We find strong anchoring effects and systematic estimation biases that do not vanish even after the task is repeatedly estimated and executed. In addition, we find that such persisting biases can be caused not only by externally provided anchors, but also by the planner's own initial estimate.
O22|How to Improve the Accuracy of Project Schedules? The Effect of Project Specification and Historical Information on Duration Estimates|The success of a business project often depends on the accuracy of project estimates. Inaccurate, often overoptimistic schedules can lead to significant project failures. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the effectiveness of two interventions designed to mitigate the pervasive underestimation bias and improve the accuracy of project duration estimates: (1) increasing the quantity of available information prior to estimation by providing historical information regarding the average duration of similar projects in the past and (2) increasing the quality of available information prior to estimation by providing a more detailed project specification. In addition, we also test whether it is more effective to provide historical information together with the project specification or only after the initial beliefs regarding the project duration are formed. We find that increasing both the quantity and quality of project relevant information successfully mitigates the underestimation bias. However, only the provision of historical information is also associated with significant improvement in absolute estimation accuracy. The timing at which such information is disclosed to planners does not seem to influence the effectiveness of the intervention. We also find that subjective confidence in the accuracy of duration estimates does not vary across experimental treatments, suggesting that the confidence in estimates is neither a function of the quantity nor the quality of available information prior to estimation.
O22|Benefits of Community-driven Development program to improve livelihood: Case Study of Dana Desa (Village Funds) in Indonesia|Indonesia has been implementing Dana Desa (Village Funds) program since 2015. It is a form of the community-driven development approaches in rural areas which involves more than 74.000 villages. This research presents a case study from Ponggok village, Jetak Village, and Ngadas Village, which have successfully implemented Dana Desa. The central government appoints them as the national role models on implementing Dana Desa. They show that benefits from CDD (community-driven development) program can fulfil their needs, especially on developing clean water and sanitation access which leads to improving their livelihood. This research uses a qualitative approach using case study methodology. The research uses purposive sampling, by which, collecting data is done by interviewing, documenting, and observing the samples. It discusses several social factors which are claimed to have been contributing to the success of the implementation of Dana Desa programs, such as the role of central and local government, social capital and community participation. It aims to analyse the study case that is expected to be a lesson learned for government, practitioners and other village government, to make sure that Dana Desa is well-implemented in their areas. It is concluded that Dana Desa can be well-implemented if the villages have decent community participation, leadership, and suitable planning.
O22|Dana Desa on clean water and sanitation access in Indonesia: Does Cash-for-work (PKT) matter?|This paper estimates the impact of Dana Desa as a form of the community-driven development program (CDD) on clean water and sanitation improvement in Indonesia. The data used is Indonesian National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS) from Statistics Indonesia (BPS) and the amount of Dana Desa?s money transfer in districts level from Ministry of Village, Development of Disadvantaged Regions And Transmigration (KEMENDESA) in 2015. The baseline data used is SUSENAS in 2014, and SUSENAS in 2016 as the data of post-intervention. The study used is quantitative analysis named difference-in-difference estimation (DID) which compare the outcome before (2014) and after (2016) the program using fixed-effect regressions. The analysis involves 405 districts and 810 observations of rural area. The study aims to assess the impact of Dana Desa on clean water and sanitation. The findings show that Dana Desa gives a positive and significant impact on sanitation access and clean water access in the districts where more people are working in informal sectors. Because they have more time to participate on supporting the program by joining cash-for-work (Padat Karya Tunai). This research is important to evaluate Dana Desa program as the biggest CDD program under President Joko Widodo?s era.

O22|Mortalidad neonatal en el Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia: desigualdades territoriales en el acceso a los servicios de salud|A pesar de los esfuerzos realizados para reducir la mortalidad neonatal en el Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, y de la implementación del Seguro Universal Materno Infantil (SUMI), los datos revelan que el progreso ha sido más lento que lo logrado en cuanto a la reducción de la mortalidad infantil en general. En ese contexto, el interés principal de esta investigación es definir las características de la mortalidad neonatal en el país. El estudio parte del análisis econométrico de los datos de la Encuesta Nacional de Demografía y Salud (ENDSA) de 2008. El objetivo es visualizar cómo el lugar de procedencia incide en el riesgo de muerte del recién nacido. Los hallazgos revelan que, en el Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, el riesgo de muerte neonatal está condicionado por el acceso a los servicios de salud, debido a las disparidades territoriales a nivel urbano y rural. Estas disparidades se traducen en barreras de acceso económicas, geográficas y de exclusión que disminuyen la equidad en el acceso y la utilización de los servicios de salud, refuerzan los determinantes sociales que inciden en la muerte del recién nacido y limitan el acceso a intervenciones oportunas y adecuadas en la atención materno-neonatal.
O22|Should a Poverty-Averse Donor Always Increase the Share of Governance-Improving Countries?|In this paper we revisit the problem of inter-country aid allocation with a single donor and two recipient countries. The donor has a given amount of aid to distribute and is sensitive to both needs and governance considerations. Conventional wisdom, as articulated in a well-known paper of Collier and Dollar (2002), holds that when a country improves its governance, it should receive more aid for a given level of poverty. We challenge this view by showing that this conclusion is not necessarily warranted. If the donor has strong enough aversion to poverty, the aid share of a country whose governance has improved will be reduced, thereby punishing instead of rewarding that country for its better institutional environment. Yet, the aid that reaches the poor will have risen. In this framework, the allocation rules actually used by important international organizations appear as implicitly based on a preference pattern that privileges governance over need considerations.
O22|Opportunism and hold-up in the incomplete public private partnership (PPP) contracts|Opportunism is a concern for contracts that are incomplete in the presence of bounded rationality and uncertainty. Since Public Private Partnership (PPP) contracts are incomplete, are these contracts prone to opportunism? This paper attempts to find the answer to this question. It examines the contract design of the Indian PPP road contracts and analyzes its strengths and weaknesses to avoid the opportunism or hold-up using the probabilistic framework. This framework suggests that each type of contract should have its own self-enforcing range to make it incentive compatible. This paper compares the risk allocated in the two types of contracts (i.e. linked and delinked contracts) for delivering the project on time. Further, it empirically tests these findings using 82 PPP projects. The low probability of timely completion and longer time overruns in the delinked projects indicate the presence of possible opportunism. A further analysis of delinked contracts shows that the same set of companies (which have both types of contracts in their portfolio) could exploit the incorrectly specified delinked contract to create a hold-up like situation. In consonance with the contract theory, the analysis suggests that extra leverage should be given with more accountability and better checks.
O22|Impact of Decentralized Electrification Projects on Sustainable Development: A Meta-Analysis|This paper is the first product of a project which aims to build a Collaborative Smart Mapping of Mini-grid Action (CoSMMA), whose principal objective is to identify best practice in decentralized electrification projects. By evaluation of 421 projects, from published research papers, we have built a pilot CoSMMA which proves its feasibility. Its relevance is demonstrated by a meta-analysis, which reveals the principal characteristics of decentralized electrification projects which have positive impacts on sustainable development. Four main characteristics were considered: technology (source or energy), system size (power), decision level (from local to country level), geographic location. When searching for best practice, technology and system size must be considered together, because the chosen technology may constrain the power, which is provided by the system. We find that the most popular projects, which are based on Solar Home Systems (SHS) are not the most effective. The problem with SHS is not the use of solar energy, but the small system size often chosen for SHS. Mini-grids, of larger size, especially those which use hybrid renewable sources of energy, have more positive impacts, because these systems combine the benefits of sustainability and flexibility. In terms of decision level, we find that both top-down and bottom-up approaches have advantages, with the observation of a U-shaped curve for the influence of the decision level on the probability of obtaining positive impacts. Geographical location matters, as it is very often the key to system feasibility. We find that DEPs are more effective in Latin America than in Asia, and more effective in Asia than in Africa. We also attempted to study the type of effects resulting from DEPs. Descriptive data suggest that for some types of effects, positive impacts are more likely than for others. Decentralized electrification projects have a more positive impact on Lifestyle & NICT or Household agenda than on Economic transformation or Community life. However, this pilot CoSMMA does not contain enough information to study precisely the types of effects, because some types of effects have not been studied frequently in the existing literature. This is the case, for instance, for environmental effects, which have been rarely measured scientifically. Finally, we attempted to broaden our information set by including expert data, which was entered into the CoSMMA meta-analysis. We define expert data as data that are not supported by statistical tests with measures of significance, whereas the evaluations based on scientific data were supported by statistical tests of significance. The expert data may be valid, but our attempt to include it in the analysis failed at this stage. The determinants of unproven effects appear to be quite different from the determinants of proven effects in our meta-analysis, and using expert data would imply merging proven and unproven effects, which would totally blur the conclusions.

O22|Migrant Remittances and Economic Growth: The Role of Financial Development and Institutional Quality|[eng] This paper investigates the conditional effects of remittances on economic growth in 14 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries. Using unbalanced panel data over the period 1982 2016, we study the hypothesis that the effect of remittances on economic growth varies depending on the level of financial development and institutional environment in recipient countries. We use Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS/IV) instrumental variables method in which we address the endogeneity of remittances. Our results reveal a complementary relationship between financial development and remittances to ensure economic growth. The estimations show that remittances promote growth in countries with a developed financial system and a strong institutional environment.
O22|Offshoring and Innovation Capabilities: Evidence from Swedish Manufacturing|This paper examines the impact of global value chains on rms' innovation capabilities. Using the United Nations Broad Economic Categories (BEC) system to identify offshoring-related intermediate imports, we study contracting out production over the period 2001-2014 from about 7,000 mainly small Swedish manufacturing frms to six different destinations and test hypotheses on improvements and outcomes of innovation capabilities. Our empirical fndings show that the strategy to participate in global value chains increases frms' innovative capability regardless of frms' technology intensity. The results are robust to a wide set of controls and in line with predictions in recent models of directed technical change.
O22|Management and Execution of Investment Projects, the Task Prior to the Measurement of Development Effectiveness: The Case of the Inter-American Development Bank|The literature on development effectiveness has traditionally focused on the ex-post analysis of projects. While this is the appropriate method of measuring benefits, a previous step must be taken as a forerunner to good ex-post evaluation: the measurement of the efficiency in the execution of investment projects. This document aims to identify the determinants of good execution. Unlike previous studies, the current study analyzes execution using a project life cycle approach. Using an Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) database with information from various departments, the authors identify the factors that are associated with faster or slower disbursement on several stages of the projects’ life cycle. The basic premise is that the duration of an investment project– that is, the days elapsed from its approval to its final disbursement– is associated with preparation and execution-related factors as well as exogenous country factors. There is evidence that a sound macroeconomic and fiscal environment in countries is important for the purposes of good execution. Moreover, the authors find that delays in project planning and execution substantially extend project lives. These findings suggest the need to continue to improve efficiency in these areas. Finally, the authors find differences in project life cycles that are associated with delays caused by the projects’ executing units.

O22|Government Decentralization Under Changing State Capacity: Experimental Evidence From Paraguay|Standard models of hierarchy assume that agents and middle managers are better informed than principals about how to implement a particular task. We estimate the value of the informational advantage held by supervisors – middle managers – when ministerial leadership – the principal – introduced a new monitoring technology aimed at improving the performance of agricultural extension agents (AEAs) in rural Paraguay. Our approach employs a novel experimental design that elicited treatment-priority rankings from supervisors before randomization of treatment. We find that supervisors did have valuable information—they prioritized AEAs who would be more responsive to the monitoring treatment. We develop a model of monitoring under different allocation rules and roll-out scales (i.e., the share of AEAs to receive treatment). We semi-parametrically estimate marginal treatment effects (MTEs) to demonstrate that the value of information and the benefits to decentralizing treatment decisions depend crucially on the sophistication of the principal and on the scale of roll-out.
O22|Long-term and Intergenerational Effects of Education: Evidence from School Construction in Indonesia|In 1973, the Indonesian government began one of the largest school construction programs ever. We use 2016 nationally representative data to examine the long-term and intergenerational effects of additional schooling as a child. We use a difference-in-differences identification strategy exploiting variation across birth cohorts and regions in the number of schools built. Men and women exposed to the program attain more education, although women’s effects are concentrated in primary school. As adults, men exposed to the program are more likely to be formal workers, work outside agriculture, and migrate. Households with parents exposed to the program have improved living standards and pay more government taxes. Education benefits are transmitted to the next generation. Increased parental education has larger impacts for daughters, particularly if mothers are exposed to school construction. Intergenerational results are driven by changes in the marriage partner’s characteristics, with spouses having more education and improved labor market outcomes.
O22|National Parameters and Commodity Specific Conversion Factors for Project Evaluation in Uganda|In this project, the National Parameters which includes the Economic Opportunity Cost of Capital (EOCK), the Foreign Exchange Premium (FEP) and the Premium for Non- Tradable Outlays (NTP) were estimated for the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development of the Republic of Uganda (MoFPED), the commodity – specific conversion factors for Uganda was estimated and a database for the Republic of Uganda for the national parameters and commodity – specific conversion factors was created. After conducting a sensitivity analysis for the key parameters used in this study to ensure the robustness of estimate, the simulation results for the economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCK) shows that 11% is the net value. Values obtained for the foreign exchange premium (FEP) is 7.25%, and 1% for the premium on Non – tradable outlays (NTP). The national parameters and commodity–specific conversion factors (CSCF) could be found on http://national-parameters.ug.
O22|Evaluation of the Economic Performance of Hydropower Developments Supported by the World Bank Group 1975 to 2015|One solution to the global energy challenge is the intensification of investment in hydropower projects that provide clean, reliable and affordable energy (IEA, 2012). Advocates of hydropower projects site their numerous benefits such as reduction in fossil fuel consumption, provision for water for irrigation and other uses, flood control and inland water transport. However, a common challenge often faced by hydropower projects is the issue of cost and time overruns. This study builds on the earlier work of Awojobi and Jenkins (2015) which examined the net economic benefits of 58 WBG financed hydropower projects between 1975 and 2005. It is thus important to evaluate the net benefits attached to hydropower projects constructed post-2005. This study extends the sample size by 10 more to cover 68 WBG financed hydropower projects and re-computes the results for the previous 58 hydro dams using a consistent set of data and assumptions. This extended sample will enable one to evaluate changes that might have taken place in project design and appraisal over time.
O22|The Use Of The Mechanism Of Tax Increment Financing (Tif) In The Financing Of Infrastructure Projects|The article presents an analysis of the foreign experience of the mechanism of tax increment financing (TIF) in the financing of infrastructure projects and assesses the possibility of implementing this mechanism in the Russian investment practice.Investment in infrastructure development is an important factor in the socio-economic development of the country and has a multiplier effect. In the world practice, the involvement of private capital in the creation and subsequent operation of infrastructure facilities contributes to the sustainable growth of the national economy, the introduction of promising technological, organizational and institutional innovations, resource saving and energy independence, improving the quality of services provided to the population.The problem of efficiency of joint investment activity of private and public capital owners in infrastructure projects is due to the complexity of taking into account the interests of all participants. The format of joint activities should be based on the principles of risk sharing, connection of projects with the target socio-economic characteristics of the development of territories, obtaining benefits from the results of projects.The authors studied the most successful practices of infrastructure development financing, taking into account possible future benefits from the creation of these facilities in the form of additional revenues from taxes, fees, access rights to the operation of infrastructure and other privileges. One of these tools is the mechanism of tax increments of financing.The paper analyzes the conditions for the implementation and fulfillment of this mechanism in different countries of the world, studied the experience of the TIF mechanism, taking into account industry specifics and other features of the projects, describes the specific models of the TIF mechanism.The comparative approach and macroeconomic analysis were used to compare the conditions of implementation of the TIF mechanism and project financing, and to identify fundamental similarities and differences. The conclusion is made about the possibility of embedding (diffusion) of individual elements of the TIF mechanism in project financing in Russia.The use of institutional and statistical analysis, as well as the methodology for assessing the effectiveness of investment projects, allowed the authors to form a comprehensive assessment of the possibility of using the TIF mechanism in the Russian environment.
O22|A Matter of Time: An Impact Evaluation of the Brazilian National Land Credit Program|This paper provides an impact evaluation of the Programa Nacional de CrÃ©dito FundiÃ¡rio, a market assisted land reform program in Brazil. The paper uses a panel dataset and pipeline control group to evaluate the programâ€™s impact on agricultural production and earned income, using a difference in differences model with either municipal or individual fixed effects. The heterogeneous effect of additional years of land ownership is investigated. The findings suggest that the program increases production and earned income by about 75% and 35%, but only after four years of land ownership. The conclusions are supported by a number of robustness tests, although considerable attrition and potential bias due to unobserved variables suggests caution. The benefits of the program largely go to making debt payments. If the impact on income continues to grow, as it did in the first five years, improvements in net wealth and current welfare could both be achieved.
O22|A guide for the evaluation of programs of human capital training for science, technology and innovation|We provide a practical guide for impact evaluation of Training and Human Capital programs in Science Technology and Innovation (STI). This document addresses specific challenges that arise when evaluating this type of programs, discussing its logic, the advantages and drawbacks of the different sources of information, the strategies which may be appropriate for evaluation, and the suitability of applying the different experimental and quasi-experimental available methods. For each technique, the document highlights the characteristics and assumptions, the strengths and weaknesses, and the practical issues related to their application to programs of human capital training for STI. Also, some specific issues, as for example the time after which the effects and externalities are expected to materialize, are discussed. Discussion is based on specific examples of existing evaluations.
O22|Knowledge management in Interreg cross-border cooperation: A project perspective|"The management of knowledge in projects delivers benefits, while the im-plementation of knowledge management is challenged by (project-specific) issues. Based on practice in interorganizational, cross-border projects funded by the Interreg South Baltic Programme (SBP), this paper analyses the potential value and hindrances of knowledge management in projects funded within Interreg programs. The SBP mentions repeatedly ""Transfer of knowledge and exchange of good practices"" as an example activity in the program manual (Interreg South Baltic Programme 2016b, pp. 13, 25, 34, 38), however, dedicated knowledge management processes, tools or plans are not part of the com-pulsory application for funding nor its assessment. Knowledge management (KM) can provide value at different levels: to individuals, project partner organisations, the entire programme and even cross-programme as well as other project stakeholders. While KM can support strategy towards building competitive advantage in the programme region, KM processes can enhance the efficiency of project implementation. Worth noting is the impact of KM on individual motivation both for joining a project and for contributing to knowledge exchange. [...]"
O22|Using unobtrusive sensors to measure and minimize Hawthorne effects: Evidence from cookstoves|People act differently when they know they are being observed. This phenomenon, the Hawthorne effect, can bias estimates of program impacts. Unobtrusive sensors substituting for human observation can alleviate this bias. To demonstrate this potential, we used temperature loggers to measure fuel-efficient cookstoves as a replacement for three-stone fires. We find a large Hawthorne effect: when in-person measurement begins, participants increase fuel-efficient stove use approximately three hours/day (53%) and reduce three-stone fire use by approximately two hours/day (29%). When in-person measurement ends, participants reverse those changes. We then examine how this Hawthorne effect biases estimates of fuel use and pollution concentrations. Our results reinforce concerns about Hawthorne effects, especially in policy-relevant impact evaluations. By measuring the Hawthorne effect we permit researchers to correct for the bias it introduces.
O22|Innovación social y microcrédito: ¿estamos financiando el statu quo de la pobreza?|Resumen Este documento busca identificar el papel de las políticas públicas que fomentan el microcrédito en Colombia mediante el estudio del caso de la Banca de las oportunidades. Para este fin, se relacionan los conceptos innovación social y microcrédito en cuanto a concepción y objetivo a partir de una visión crítica que incluya perspectivas tanto ortodoxas como alternativas que permitan ampliar la capacidad de análisis del problema. Así también, se explica, por medio de una descripción histórica de las políticas que fomentan el microcrédito, si el camino seguido por este en Colombia ha mantenido la propuesta original de ser una herramienta de lucha contra la pobreza. Finalmente, se hace un breve análisis cualitativo de dichas políticas intentando plantear una generalidad en cuanto a la política de microcrédito empleada por el gobierno nacional.
O22|Aid Effectiveness: Revisiting the Trade-off Between Needs and Governance|This paper aims at elucidating the issue of inter-country aid allocation by a single donor when the latter is sensitive to both needs and governance considerations and is moreover able to influence local governance through his own disciplining effort. In a one-donor-two-recipient framework and in conformity with observations from the real world, the poorer recipient country is assumed to be less well governed than the richer one. Many rich insights are gained from the analysis. In particular, the poorer and less well governed country is more likely to receive a higher share of aid if governance is endogenized through external disciplining by the donor. And the share of a country will always increase if it has succeeded in improving its internal governance, or discipline, thanks to its own effort. This is true even in the case where this effort leads to a fall of aggregate governance as a result of an overcompensating reaction of the donor when setting the level of external discipline . Finally, a decrease in the cost of external discipline will favor the poorer and less well governed country but only provided that the inter-country governance gap is large enough.
O22|Cash-Plus: Variants and Components of Transfer-Based Anti-Poverty Programming|Can extensions such as coaching and training augment the poverty relief effects of cash transfers, or do they unnecessarily constrain the agency of recipients in the allocation of program resources? We use a randomized trial to estimate the impacts of philosophically distinct variants of transfer-based poverty reduction approaches in rural Uganda. One is a microenterprise intervention in the spirit of so-called graduation programming that provides beneficiaries with an integrated package of cash transfers, coaching, and training on sustainable livelihoods; the other variant monetizes the cost of coaching and training so as to more than double the size of cash transfers. We also we evaluate the merits of more marginal individual extension components, involving savings group formation in the microenterprise variant and light-touch behavioral intervention (involving goal-setting and plan-making) in the cash variant. Overall, we build confidence that investing program resources in productive extensions can expand poverty reduction. We gain elevated confidence in the impacts and cost-effectiveness of the fully integrated microenterprise intervention.
O22|Cash-Plus: Poverty Impacts of Transfer-Based Intervention Alternatives|Can programmatic extensions such as training and mentorship enhance the economic impact of cash transfers, or do they needlessly absorb resources that program recipients could allocate more meaningfully by themselves? Using a randomized trial, we evaluate a program that targets poor Ugandans and offers them an integrated package comprised of lump sum transfers, coaching, and training on microenterprise development as well as savings group formation. We assess its impact and that of its savings component, as well as the impacts of much simplified program variants: one intervention variant that is limited to lump sum cash transfers and another that expands upon transfers using a light-touch behavioral intervention component. The results support the notion that integrated development interventions are sensible poverty reduction tools.
O22|Chained to Sustainable Development Goals? The Changing Role of Entities for Enhanced Resilience along Agriculture Food Value Chains in Thailand|The operation period of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ended in 2015, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be in operation in 2016-2030. The sustainable development agenda contained 17 goals and covered a broad range of quantitative and qualitative objectives across social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. These include (i) ending poverty and hunger, (ii) sustainable consumption and production, (iii) improving health and education, (iv) making cities more sustainable, (v) combating climate change, and (vi) protecting oceans and forests. Sustainable food production, marketing, and other post-harvest management practices are important to achieving majority of the SDGs. This paper examines the required changing roles of private and public organisations, as well as international organisations, in 2016-2030 to enhance resilience of agricultural food value chains in Thailand. The Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) of Thailand is a growth and development model characterised by its universality and inclusiveness; people-centred approach; moderation, moral values, and reasonableness; and knowledge and integrity. The SEP encourages a holistic farm management system to promote sustainability, food security, water conservation and biodiversity, development of human resources, risk management, investment, and expansion of businesses, thereby creating self-sufficiency at the household, community, organisational, and national levels. These objectives of the SEP are somewhat consistent with Goals 1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 15 of the SDGs. The required roles of organisations to enable Thailand to achieve the SDGs towards enhancing the resilience of agricultural food value chains are presented, and the policy implications are highlighted.
O22|Supervision and Project Performance: A Principal-Agent Approach|This paper extends and applies principal-agent theory to the performance of donor projects. There is variation in the degree of divergence between the interests of the donor (the principal) and the recipient government (the agent). Further, the effort expended on observation of the agent is a control variable. We show that in a wide range of circumstances an implication of principal-agent theory is that the principal should put greater effort into observation the wider is the divergence of interest with the agent. We then test this prediction using data on World Bank project performance. We measure the degree of divergence between donor and recipient interests, as perceived by the donor, through a donor classification system of recipient governments. Consistent with the theory, we find that donor supervision of projects is significantly more effective in improving project performance where interests are widely divergent. However, donors do not put more effort into the supervision of projects in such cases.________________________________ Cet article étend et applique la théorie Principal-Agent à la performance des projets d’aide. Les intérêts du donneur (le principal) et du gouvernement receveur (l’agent) peuvent différer de manière importante. Dans le modèle, l’effort mis en oeuvre pour observer l’agent est une variable de contrôle. Nous montrons qu’une implication du modèle principal-agent est que le principal devrait faire d’autant plus d’effort pour observer l’agent quand ses intérêts divergent de ceux de l’agent. Nous testons ensuite ces prédictions en utilisant les données de performance des projets d’aide de la Banque mondiale. Nous mesurons le degré de divergence entre les intérêts du donneur et du receveur, telle que perçue par le donneur, par la classification des receveurs comme ‘partenariats difficiles’. Comme prédit par le modèle, nous trouvons que la supervision des projets d’aide par le donneur permet d’autant plus d’assurer le succès des projets que les intérêts du donneur et du receveur diffèrent. Toutefois, le donneur ne semble pas faire plus d’effort de supervision dans les partenariats difficiles.
O22|Organizational Efficency or Bureaucratic Quagmire: Do Quality at Entry Assessments Improve Project Performance?|Do quality at entry assessments enhance the delivery of development projects? In this paper we take advantage of approval and execution systems in place at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to examine whether projects that have higher quality at entry--captured through grading scores provided by a checklist--perform better in terms of project implementation performance indicators. Implementation indicators include measures based on actual versus planned schedule of activities and cost outlays, as well as percent of loan disbursed. The analysis suggests higher scores on project logic and economic analyses at entry have had a positive impact on project performance. However, monitoring and evaluation and impact assessment scores had limited impacts on performance. The evidence supports the hypothesis that the use of a checklist can be an effective framework for assessing quality at entry for IDB projects, though there is scope to improve the checklist for certain indicators.
O22|Women’s economic capacity and children’s human capital accumulation|Abstract Programs that increase the economic capacity of poor women can have cascading effects on children’s participation in school and work that are theoretically undetermined. We present a simple model to describe the possible channels through which these programs may affect children’s activities. Based on a cluster-randomized trial, we examine how a program providing capital and training to women in poor rural communities in Nicaragua affected children. Children in beneficiary households are more likely to attend school 1 year after the end of the intervention. An increase in women’s influence on household decisions appears to contribute to the program’s beneficial effect on school attendance.
O22|Temporary work visas as US-Haiti development cooperation: a preliminary impact evaluation|Abstract We report a small-sample, preliminary evaluation of the economic impact of temporary overseas work by Haitian agricultural workers. This work occurs in the USA in the context of a pilot program designed as a form of post-disaster development assistance to Haiti. We find that the effects of matching new seasonal agricultural jobs in the USA with Haitian workers differs markedly from the effects of more traditional forms of assistance to Haiti, in three ways: the economic benefits are shared roughly equally between Haiti and the USA; these benefits are very large, including raising the value of Haitian workers’ labor by a multiple of 15; and the portion of the benefits accruing to Haiti is uncommonly well targeted for the direct benefit of poor Haitian households. We discuss implementation challenges faced by the program and the potential for policies of this kind to complement more traditional forms of development and humanitarian assistance.

O22|Smarter through social protection? Evaluating the impact of Ethiopia’s safety-net on child cognitive abilities| Ethiopia’s productive safety net is the second largest Social Protection Program in sub-Saharan Africa and has been rolled out to almost 10 million beneficiaries since 2005; its effects are therefore of general interest. We provide the first estimates of its impact on children’s cognitive abilities. To identify impacts of this program, we exploit four rounds of data on a cohort of children surveyed repeatedly between 2002 and 2013. We find a small but significant positive effect of the programme on both numeracy skills and vocabulary. This is driven mainly by children in households that had graduated (left) the programme just before 2013. We argue that this is at least partially related to time allocation: graduates of the programme spent more time in school than continuing beneficiaries. We also find evidence that the maths (though not language) improvement is more pronounced for boys.
O22|Child Schooling and Child Work in the Presence of a Partial Education Subsidy|Could a partial subsidy for child education increase child labor? Using data from the randomized evaluation of a conditional cash transfer program (CCT) in the Philippines, we find that children who were neither in school nor work in the absence of the program not only increased school participation but also increased work for pay. We show suggestive evidence that because the cash transfer only provided a partial schooling subsidy children worked to cover the shortfall in schooling fees. Our findings contribute to the increasing evidence that the design of CCTs, in this case transfer size, matters considerably in terms of achieving program goals.
O22|Impact evaluation of EU subsidies for economic development on the Hungarian SME sector|Although EU funds play a pivotal role not only for Hungary but for the entire European Union as well, there is debate regarding their effectiveness in the literature. This paper investigates the impact of direct economic development subsidies extended in the context of the Cohesion Policy programmes as part of the 2007-2013 programming period of the European Union, on Hungarian micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. Based on a micro database, we assess the effects of the beneficiaries' first subsidies on various performance indicators, using a combination of propensity score matching and fixed effects panel regression. According to our results, economic development funds had a significant positive impact on the number of employees, sales revenue, gross value added and in some cases, operating profit. However, the labour productivity of beneficiaries was not significantly affected by any of the support schemes. Furthermore, by explicitly comparing non-refundable subsidies (grants) and refundable assistance (financial instruments) extended under the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, we find that there is no significant difference in their effectiveness.
O22|Data for Development: DAC member priorities and challenges|The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development commits the international community to support the modernisation and strengthening of national statistical capacities and systems in developing countries and to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data to measure their progress against the Sustainable Development Goals. This paper, informed by a survey circulated among DAC members between February and April 2017, presents DAC members’ policies and practices to support national statistical capacities and systems in developing countries. It highlights some of the main challenges that DAC members face in relation to making data work for sustainable development, notably in co-ordinating their support for statistics to avoid duplication and find synergies, in mobilising more resources, and in using quality data for development co-operation decision-making, programming, monitoring and reporting. The findings presented in this paper will inform the analysis of the 2017 Development Co-operation Report on Data for Development which will be published in October 2017. The report will provide guidance to providers of development assistance on how to best support developing countries to have and use quality and timely data for enabling delivery of the SDGs.
O22|The grant element method of measuring the concessionality of loans and debt relief|The grant element is the “gift portion” of a financial transaction. The mathematical technique for arriving at a precise grant element percentage was first proposed by John Pincus of the RAND Corporation in 1963, and developed mathematically by Göran Ohlin of the Development Centre in 1966. Pincus also advocated expressing foreign aid in terms of its grant equivalent – i.e. the grant element expressed as a monetary value instead of a percentage. Grant element methodology was first used officially in 1969, in a target for softening the terms of aid. A grant element test was then introduced into the definition of official development assistance in 1972. Grant element methodology was subsequently applied to regulate the terms of export credits, to help assess the sustainability of developing country borrowing, and to calculate the level of debt relief and ensure comparability of effort in relevant Paris Club debt rescheduling operations. Central to grant element calculations is the selection of an appropriate discount rate to reflect financial market conditions. The present low interest rate environment raises challenges in this respect. This paper offers a layman’s introduction to the nature and mechanics of grant element methodology, and to the history of its application in practice.
O22|Insights from national adaptation monitoring and evaluation systems|Adaptation monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is an important step of the process of adapting to climate change, by enabling Parties to learn from climate risks and the effectiveness of adaptation measures, and increase accountability. While relatively few countries have designed and implemented a national M&E system for adaptation, a number of countries have indicated in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) that they are developing one or plan to do so.National systems for M&E of adaptation are tailored to domestic circumstances, priorities and capacities. Several bilateral and multilateral support channels aim to address information gaps and capacity and resource constraints, which can be limiting factors to building national M&E systems for adaptation. The processes and results of such systems may help provide relevant information to assess progress towards the global goal on adaptation under the UNFCCC.
O22|Optimal Design of Experiments in the Presence of Interference*, Second Version|This paper formalizes the optimal design of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the presence of interference between units, where an individual's outcome depends on the behavior and outcomes of others in her group. We focus on randomized saturation (RS) designs, which are two-stage RCTs that first randomize the treatment saturation of a group, then randomize individual treatment assignment. Our main contributions are to map the potential outcomes framework with partial interference to a regression model with clustered errors, calculate the statistical power of different RS designs, and derive analytical insights for how to optimally design an RS experiment. We show that the power to detect average treatment effects declines precisely with the ability to identify novel treatment and spillover estimands, such as how effects vary with the intensity of treatment. We provide software that assists researchers in designing RS experiments.
O22|Does Experience Exert Impact on a PPP Performance?|Researchers traditionally assume that learning is a product of experience. In general it means that learning can only take place through the attempt to solve a problem and therefore only takes place during activity (Arrow, 1962). On the ground of organizational theory it has two implications. First we can agree that repeated activity requires less effort. Second we can argue that firms undertake activities, with which they have been the most successful in the past and that they expect to be the most successful in the future. The aim of the research is twofold. Firstly, this article aims to investigate if we can identify a relationship between the experience in PPP projects and the performance of initiatives of this kind. Secondly, the article aims to provide an interpretation of the relationship between experience and PPP performance. This research investigates factors influencing the survival of PPP projects in Poland over the period 2009-2015. Cox proportional hazard model is utilized to distinguish between PPPs that succeeded to the operation phase and those that were cancelled on the procurement stage. The research confirms the existence of a positive relationship between experience in PPP and the outcome of a PPP development.
O22|Effects of ISO 9001 Standard on Critical Factors of Project Management in Construction Industry|This paper provides a significant contribution to the knowledge by identifying the impact of ISO 9001 implementation on the most vital factors of project management within large scale (AAA) construction firms in Metro Manila, Philippines. Thus, the study was accomplished an extensive literature review for identifying the main factors of project management, ISO 9001 standard, and other concepts, for developing an appropriate survey instrument. Then the questionnaires were distributed randomly among selected ISO 9001:2008-certified projects of large-scale (AAA) construction firms. For data analysis, the study adopted the descriptive and inferential statistics analysis, in order to find the results and conclusions. Lastly, the findings indicated that ISO 9001 certification can statistically affect the two main factors of project management, except time length of projects in Metro Manila, Philippines.
O22|Impact of ISO 9001 Standard on the Quality Costs of Construction Projects in the Philippines|Since past two decades, ISO 9001 standard has shown its capabilities to lower cost, increase productivity, and satisfy stakeholders (customers) in the organizations. Although ISO 9001 standard has proven its benefits to different sectors in all over the world. But there is still debate among researchers and practitioners concerning the usefulness of applying ISO 9001 in construction projects. However, it seems that among different methods, quality cost analysis is an excellent technique to indicate how much ISO 9001 is able to improve effectively quality performance, and reduce costs in the projects. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to assess the effects of ISO 9001 implementation on quality cost in construction projects. For this aim, a literature review was conducted to design a structured questionnaire in a sample of the 67 respondents from ISO 9001:2008-certiﬁed projects of large-scale (AAA) construction companies in Metro Manila, Philippine. As a quantitative research, the inferential statistics analysis used to test the hypotheses of this study. Lastly, the results reported that ISO 9001 standard significantly affects the reduction of quality cost within construction projects in Metro Manila, Philippines.
O22|Principle-agent analysis of technology project (LINCOS) in Costa Rica|In this paper we analyze the institutional arrangement between various actors to understand how ICT project objectives flow among actors in a standard LINCOS project and how they would affect the sustainability and effectiveness of LINCOS in particular and an ICT project in general. Since there are many actors involved in different stages and processes of a single LINCOS project, the paper analyses the bilateral and multilateral relationships among these actors to understand the factors that might affect the efficiency of the ICT project. In other words the paper looks at the actors involved in a LINCOS project in an effort to capture those circumstances under which a LINCOS project is exposed to principal- agent problems.
O22|Child Schooling and Child Work in the Presence of a Partial Education Subsidy|Could a partial subsidy for child education increase children's participation in paid work? In contrast to much of the theoretical and empirical child labor literature, this paper shows that child work and school participation can be complements under certain conditions. Using data from the randomized evaluation of a conditional cash transfer program in the Philippines, the analysis finds that some children, who were in neither school nor work before the program, increased participation in school and work-for-pay after the program. Earlier cash transfer programs, notably those in Mexico, Brazil, and Ecuador, increased school attendance while reducing child labor. Those programs fully offset schooling costs, while the transfers under the Philippine transfers fall short of the full costs of schooling for a typical child. As a result, some beneficiary children from poor Philippine households increased work to support their schooling. The additional earnings from this work represent a substantive share of the shortfall in the schooling costs net of transfer. The paper rules out several potential alternative explanations for the increase in child labor, including changes in household productive activities, adult labor supply, and household expenditure patterns that, in principle, can arise after a cash transfer and may also affect the supply of or demand for child labor.
O22|Can Electronic Procurement Improve Infrastructure Provision? Evidence from Public Works in India and Indonesia|This paper examines whether electronic procurement (e-procurement), which increases access to information and reduces personal interactions with potentially corrupt officials, improves procurement outcomes. We develop unique datasets from India and Indonesia and use variation in adoption of e-procurement within both countries. We find no evidence of reduced prices but do find that e-procurement leads to quality improvements. In India, where we observe quality directly, e-procurement improves road quality, and in Indonesia, e-procurement reduces delays. Regions with e-procurement are more likely to have winners come from outside the region. On net, the results suggest that e-procurement facilitates entry from higher quality contractors.
O22|Welfare Effect of Farm Input Subsidy Program in the Context of Climate Change: Evidence from Malawi| The Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP) in Malawi was introduced in 2005/06 season against the background of bad weather affecting production, prolonged food shortages and high input prices in the absence of soft farm input loans for smallholder farmers. The primary purpose of the program was to increase resource-poor smallholder farmers’ access to improved agricultural farm inputs to achieve food self-sufficiency and increased income through increased maize and legume production. This paper uses a recently released panel data of nationally representative sample households combined with geo-referenced climate and administrative data to analyze FISP targeting effectiveness and the program’s impact on a broad set of welfare outcome variables including consumption, caloric intake, marketed surplus and crop productivity, within a context of climate variability. Our study finds that Malawi’s FISP targeting needs to improve if the primary target is to reach resource-poor and climate-constrained households. Moreover, results show that the program is positively associated with household welfare, food security and productivity. Heterogeneity analysis also suggests that the program benefits households residing in areas characterized by higher climate variability, with a stronger impact for a larger level of treatment.
O22|Are Agricultural R&D Returns Declining and Development Dependent?| There is widespread professional consensus that agricultural research and development (R&D) receives high economic returns, though there is also concern that these returns have been declining over the past few decades and unevenly distributed among different regions in the world. This study attempts to reveal both the time trend (i.e., increasing or decreasing) and regional developmental differences in the reported returns to agricultural R&D. Using a newly updated and expanded global database of estimated returns to agricultural R&D and a robust statistical methodology, our findings suggest that after accounting for methodological changes and other study factors that have varied over time, the contemporary returns to agricultural R&D investments are as high as ever. Furthermore, this study provides evidence that regional developmental differences are attributable to more than differences in the focus of research, researcher or research methodology.
O22|Indirect protection: the impact of cotton insurance on farmers’ income portfolio in Burkina Faso| While risk is known to harm farmers’ production investments, there is still limited evidence of index-insurance impact on household ex-ante behavior. This paper studies a pilot area-yield index insurance project sold to cotton farmer groups in Burkina Faso. Insurance sales were randomized, and in the treatment area, an encouragement design was generated by providing premium subsidies (between 25% and 75%) randomly distributed to farmer groups. No impact was found on cotton production, most likely in reason of the late sale period (during the sowing period). However, substantial and significant impacts were found on several activities and assets such as field investments, sesame cultivation and livestock herding. The mechanisms behind these indirect effects are discussed. Overall, the findings suggest a promising role of index insurance for stimulating ex-ante investments, but also draws attention on implementation gaps which currently threaten this type of intervention.
O22|Junior Farmer Field Schools, Agricultural Knowledge and Spillover Effects: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Northern Uganda| We analyse the impact of a junior farmer field school project in Northern Uganda on students’ agricultural knowledge and practices. We also test for the presence of intergenerational learning spillover within households. We use differences-in-differences estimators with ex-ante matching and find evidence that the programme had positive effects on students’ agricultural knowledge and adoption of good practices. The project also produced spillover effects in terms of improvements of household agricultural knowledge and food security. Overall, our results point to the importance of adapting the basic principles of farmer field schools to children.
O22|Using Activity Based Costing For Investment Decisions|This article presents one of the most common tools in making investmentdecisions - Activity Based Costing (ABC). For this, we focused in the study on the literaturereview and practice using the ABC method in funding to establish investment decisions. We usefor exemplification a project financing with the objective based on upgrading a hotel throughcomplex arrangement works, achieved in order to obtain European funds. The basic informationused for the cost-benefit analysis we access using the financial layout related to the fundingmeasure that was desired accessing grants, information found in the financial statements of thecompany. The accuracy of the method used for this evaluation depends on the accuracy offinancial statements provided by the hotel that reflects the work. Thus, our results have allowedus to establish clearly the investment situation, but equally the sustainability and reliability,confirming the need of the hotel analyzed to access grants.

In particular, attention is drawn to two examples: Skolkovo and Rusnano, with a preliminary evaluation of their effectiveness.
O22|Human Capital in Economic Development: From Labour Productivity to Macroeconomic Impact| Micro-econometric evidence reveals high private returns to education, most prominently in low-income countries. However, it is disputed to what extent this translates into a macro-economic impact. This paper projects the increase in human capital from higher education in Malawi and uses a dynamic applied general equilibrium model to estimate the resulting macroeconomics impact. This is contingent upon endogenous adjustments, in particular how labour productivity affects competitiveness and if this in turn stimulates exports. Choice among commonly applied labour market assumptions and trade elasticities results in widely different outcomes. Appraisal of such policies should consider not only the impact on human capital stocks, but also adjustments outside the labour market.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O22|Operational Highlights In The Educational Project Management|The management of educational projects, as part of the management's new concept, meets the requirements of a performant management, which integrates the structures and recommended methods, the complexity and the organizational flexibility as well as the social and psychological aspects of the educational organization in which the project is implemented.
O22|Mesurer l’économie circulaire à l’échelle territoriale. Une analyse systémique de la gestion des matières organiques à Bruxelles|L’économie circulaire connait un engouement réel et apparaît comme une approche prometteuse pour rompre avec les flux linéaires qui commencent par l’extraction d’une ressource et finissent par la création d’un déchet. Mobilisant la théorie des systèmes socio-écologiques et différents indicateurs d’impact, cet article souligne l’existence de trajectoires alternatives vers la circularisation de l’économie – et que ces alternatives ne sont pas neutres quant à leurs conséquences économiques, sociales et environnementales. La mesure de ces conséquences pour le cas des flux des matières organiques dans la métropole bruxelloise permet de faire ressortir deux trajectoires potentielles :celle d’une « troisième révolution industrielle », avec une prolongation de la logique de croissance économique basée sur l’accumulation de capital et une expansion quantitative, et celle d’une « post-croissance » créatrice d’une nouvelle organisation polycentrique du travail et d’un développement qualitatif moins intensif en capital.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O22|Searching for the Devil in the Details: Learning about Development Program Design|Motivated by our experience in designing a particular social program, skill set signaling for new entrants to the labor market in Peru, we articulate the need for, and explore the empirical consequences of, alternative learning approaches to the design of development projects. Using a simulation, we demonstrate that even with only modest dimensioned design space and even modest ”ruggedness” of the outcome with respect to design a naive iterative approach of ”crawling the design space” dominates an RCT learning strategy. We suggest that the empirical results of RCTs to date are consistent with social programs having high dimensional design space and outcomes sensitive to design and hence project, program, and policy design must depend on more robust learning strategies than the attempt to directly apply results from ”systematic reviews” or move prematurely to an RCT.
O22|Present Times Sport Management|The goal of this paper is to play as introduction for the sport management science, both as academic and professional major. The paper provides a broad overview of sport management rather than detailed instructions about how sport management is seen. The professional career in sport management should be built on a strong conceptual foundation. Sport managers who can think critically about sport – related issues will be competent, reflective professionals who have the potential to become influential agents of change. The sport management will face many challenges in the future, as examination of the ethics, social responsibility and principled decision making but in the meantime will offer opportunities towards society.
O22|Impact Of Grant Projects Implementation In Romanian Higher Education Institutions|Romanian Higher Education Institutions were one of the main beneficiaries of European funding in the 2007-2013 funding excercise, especially in the Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development. Analyzing the data provided by 21 public universities in Romania, we find that Universities have accessed in a significant proportion two types of projects: those dedicated to transition from school to active life and those dedicated to doctoral studies. Also, the proportion of the European funds attracted by HEIs is an overwhelming part of the allocation of reference (over 40% since 2011), and also a significant proportion of total revenues universities (~15.5 % for 2011-2014).
O22|A Business Intelligence Instrument for Detection and Mitigation of Risks Related to Projects Financed from Structural Funds|The Structural Funds, in order to produce the intended effects, must use their specific management tools, for achieving the strategic objectives, outcome indicators and elements of added value set by each EU member state. The project portfolios must be managed properly. If risks of a project become contagious for other projects, we are witnessing a phenomenon that can compromise the chance that a program financed by Structural Funds to be well carried out. In this paper it is introduced an algorithm to reduce the project implementation risk and an IT interface is designed to serve as a control system, for the permanent measurement and monitoring of the risk indicators, in order to facilitate decision-making and prediction.

O22|The Role of Project Management Information Systems towards the Project Performance: The Case of Construction Projects in United Arab Emirates|Project management information systems (PMIS) has become an essential tool in contemporary organizations. 21st century project managers cannot afford the losses, delays, and disappointments often triggered by redundant projects. PMIS is even more critical for business organizations, where profitability and long-term sustainability is pegged on competitively performing projects. PMIS has thus become a strategic resource for project managers when seeking optimal level of project performance. United Arabs Emirates (UAE) has gradually transformed to an epicentre of economic development in the Middle East. In pursuit of economic development and globalization, UAE has made unprecedented investments in the construction of infrastructural and networking systems. The present study established that construction represents perhaps the most advanced and progressive market-based industries in UAE. Construction projects are now defined by a complex matrix of profitability, performance, and cost-time balance. After collecting questionnaire data from a purposive sample of 20 project managers in UAE, the survey established a positive correlation (r = +0.72) between the use of PMIS and project performance. The findings validated the hypothesis of the study, and affirmed that, there is a significant positive relationship between the quality, information output and user influence of PMIS and project performance when implementing construction projects in UAE. Future research should cover a more reliable sample size and triangulate the data collection instruments to generate more reliable findings. Further, future research should focus on establishing how PMIS improve project management while in actual practice, rather than exclusively relying on the admissions of relatively biased project managers whose core interest is display their companies as market leaders in practice.
O22|Too much and too fast? Public investment scaling-up and absorptive capacity|A recent trend in several low-income developing countries has been a rapid scaling-up of public investment. It is argued that in the presence of limited absorptive capacity countries are not able – in terms of skills, institutions, and management – to translate additional public investment into sustained output growth. We test for the presence of absorptive capacity constraints using a large dataset of World Bank investment projects, approved between 1970 and 2007 in 80 countries. Our results indicate that projects undertaken in periods of public investment scaling-up are less likely to be successful, although this effect is relatively small, especially in poor and capital scarce countries. We also verify that this effect is unrelated to large aid flows and donor fragmentation.
O22|External and Internal Validity of a Geographic Quasi-Experiment Embedded in a Cluster-Randomized Experiment|Abstract This chapter analyzes a geographic quasi-experiment embedded in a cluster-randomized experiment in Honduras. In the experiment, average treatment effects of conditional cash transfers on school enrollment and child labor were large – especially in the poorest experimental blocks – and could be generalized to a policy-relevant population given the original sample selection criteria. In contrast, the geographic quasi-experiment yielded point estimates that, for two of three dependent variables, were attenuated. A judicious policy analyst without access to the experimental results might have provided misleading advice based on the magnitude of point estimates. We assessed two main explanations for the difference in point estimates, related to external and internal validity.
O22|Impactos del proyecto desde una aproximación cuantitativa|Este capítulo presenta los resultados de la evaluación de impacto —con enfoque cuantitativo—del proyecto Haku Wiñay en las condiciones de vida de hogares que además han sido usuarios del programa Juntos. Como se mencionó en el capítulo 2, el proyecto busca incidir en diversas esferas de la vida de los hogares, y es de esperar que en algunas de estas la complementariedad con Juntos permita intensificar los impactos. Por ello, la estrategia metodológica identifica como hogares comparables (control) a hogares similares que los tratados en un conjunto de características, incluida su participación en Juntos, pero que no son intervenidos por Haku Wiñay. De esta manera, los impactos estimados incorporan tanto impactos directos del proyecto Haku Wiñay como potenciales complementariedades con Juntos, excluyendo el efecto directo individual de este programa.
O22|Una mirada a los procesos locales|Durante la evaluación del proyecto Haku Wiñay, se hizo evidente la necesidad de estudiar algunos procesos clave que se desarrollaron a lo largo de su ejecución. Para ello, era indispensable conocer las percepciones y el imaginario de los protagonistas del proyecto: la población usuaria, los ejecutores y las autoridades locales de los distritos en los que este se aplicó. Este capítulo presenta los resultados del estudio que se realizó con dicho fin.
O22|Sistematización de los procesos de programación y asignación de recursos a la población beneficiada por el proyecto Haku Wiñay: ¿puede FONCODES convertirse en un programa nacional de desarrollo de las poblaciones rurales más pobres?|El análisis tomó como base las fases de programación, preinversión y ejecución de cada uno de los componentes de la estrategia, así como de una de sus estrategias de sostenibilidad: la institucionalización del mecanismo comités locales de asignación de recursos (CLAR) en las municipalidades.
O22|Project Management As A Positive Force For Change In Underserved Communities|This paper discusses the development of a project management course at a high school in an underserved community in the United States. This course was part of the ThrivalsÂ® initiative, which strives to be a positive force in the African American community. Our research goal was to assess whether high school students could acquire and demonstrate knowledge of the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) at a proficiency level equivalent to the level of university students. We compared the performance of the pilot class at the high school to that of a university level class and found no statistically significant difference in high school studentsâ€™ learning compared to that of the university students
O22|Social and economic impact analysis of Vadinar refinery of Essar oil: The Case of a mega refinery|The paper is a case study of Vadinar refinery in Gujarat. It examines the costs and benefits associated with one of the world's mega refinery projects highlighting the welfare impacts on society. The paper briefly examines whether refining at Vadinar by Essar is of net economic benefit to the region, state and the country by constructing a Social Cost Benefit Analysis of the Vadinar Refinery Project. The paper analyses the local-level economic impacts (on-site labor impacts, local revenue and supply chain impacts and induced impacts) and jobs supported by Vadinar refinery construction and ongoing operations. The paper also analyses the regional (state and country) level economic impacts; multiplier effect of income, tax and savings generated as a result of the refinery operations, including other externalities associated with the project. There is abundance of scope to reflect the strategic food and oil security of India from the macroeconomic perspective; the gradual increase in investor and consumer confidence with respect to self-reliance in production and consumption of oil and natural gas resources in the country and the broader social impact of the project, which may be taken up in subsequent research. A sequel to this paper will explore an approach to integrating the methods with a CGE model framework.
O22|Increasing Rural Health Clinic Utilization with SMS Updates: Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation in Uganda|This paper examines an alternative to monitoring staff at a public health clinic in rural Uganda. The program sent SMS updates regarding confirmed attendance of clinic staff and activities to randomly selected cell phone-owning households in the local community. These messages aimed to reduce uncertainty regarding the availability of clinic services, and in turn, increase the expected benefit of deciding to visit the local health clinic. A difference-in-difference approach is used to evaluate the impact of the SMS program, and we find that the messages led to an increase in clinic attendance, the receipt of medicine, and reduced the duration of illness for young children aged six and under. However, these benefits are only seen for children who are the same sex as the cell phone owner, suggesting favoritism toward the health of these children. The benefits are found to be similar for both boys and girls. This is evidence that it is possible to increase health care utilization without changing the behavior of clinic staff.
O22|The Power of Social Pensions|This paper examines the impacts of social pension provision among people of different ages. Utilizing the county-by-county rollout of the New Rural Pension Scheme in rural China, we find that, among the age-eligible people, the scheme provision leads to higher household income (18 percent) and food expenditure (10 percent), lower labor supply (6 percent), and better health (11-14 percent). In addition, among the age-ineligible adults, the pension scheme shifts them from farming to non-farming work, lowers insurance participation rate, but does not change income, expenditure or health significantly. Finally, among the children aged below 15, the pension scheme leads to more pocket money received, more caring from grandparents, improved health, and higher schooling rate.
O22|Horizontal Objectives Of Eu Programmes And The Socio-Cultural Context For Eap Members|As the Eastern Partnership (EaP) was founded in 2009, between European Union (EU) and six countries from Eastern Europe, its main goal was to create adequate conditions for economic integration, social and regional development of the EaP country members. Based on the same principles as the EU was built, international law and fundamental values (e.g. human rights, freedom, democracy, rule of law), sustainable development and also good governance, the EaP was regularly analysed and renewed (once every two years) in order to better respond to the needs of Eastern European countries. Even so, while the economic context was especially considered, there are still some actions to be undertaken with regards to socio-cultural factors. Therefore the aim of the paper is toanalyse the socio-cultural context of the six Eastern European EaP members (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine) in order to make recommendations regarding their absorption capacity when integrating the horizontal EU objectives into the funding neighbourhood instruments. Our main research question is: what is the right approach for developing operational funding programmes (individual/bilateral or partnership/multilateral participations) for EaP members: is it by maintaining the EU horizontal objective orby adapting these objectives from the beginning considering the socio-cultural context?
O22|Impact of Electrification on Children’s Nutritional Status in Rural Bangladesh|Access to electricity has the potential to improve the nutritional status of children by a variety of pathways such as increased wealth, reduced fertility through the change in time use, spread of information through technology such as TV, and improved health care services. Yet, the relationship between electrification and children’s nutritional status is rarely explored in the literature. We attempt to fill this lacuna by offering microeconometric evidence from rural Bangladesh, where a rapid expansion of electrification and significant improvement in children’s nutritional status were observed in the past two decades. We find that access to electricity has a positive impact on the nutritional status of children under five as measured by height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) by around 0.1–0.2 points using five rounds of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey from 2000 to 2014. Our results also appear to indicate that the quality of electricity may influence the size of this positive impact. While our analysis of causal pathways is limited by the data availability, it suggests that the positive impact of electrification partially comes from increased wealth. For some years, the positive impact can also be attributed to reduced fertility and information exposure through TV viewing. On the contrary, we find little evidence that the impact is attributable to the improvement of local health facilities. Our findings underscore the importance of evaluating infrastructure programs such as rural electrification from a broad perspective as their impacts may go well beyond the economic benefits considered in a typical cost–benefit analysis. This in turn may encourage governments to invest more in basic infrastructure, which is still severely lacking in Bangladesh and many other countries in the rest of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
O22|DVD-based distance-learning program for university entrance exams -- RCT experiments in rural Bangladesh|In contrast to the remarkable progress in developing countries in improving primary education, access to higher education in many countries remains limited, especially in rural areas where the quality of education is inadequate. We evaluate a DVD-based distance-learning program in rural Bangladesh, targeted at students aiming to take university entrance tests. We conducted two experiments: one to evaluate the effect of the distance-learning program and the second to determine the demand and price sensitivity. Our first experiment shows that the DVD-based distance-learning program has a considerable positive effect on the number of students passing entrance exams. This effect does not depend on cognitive scores, but does depend on non-cognitive attributes, indicating the importance of commitment, which is imposed through our program. In the second experiment, we offered a random subsidy to interested participants. The uptake decision is price-sensitive, although the price sensitivity is not correlated with students' past academic performance or their socio-economic status, suggesting that increasing the price should not disproportionately exclude poor students.
O22|Methods of Choosing an Optimal Portfolio of Projects|This paper presents an analysis of existing methods for a portfolio of project optimization. The necessity for their improvement is shown. It is suggested to assess the portfolio of projects on the basis of the amount in the difference between the results and costs during development and implementation of selected projects and the losses caused by non-implementation or delayed implementation of projects that were not included in the portfolio. Consideration of capital and current costs components are required for the portfolio of projects efficiency calculation. An optimization model for a portfolio of projects is developed. Consideration of social and economic factors that contribute the integral assessment of the portfolio of project and methods for their calculation are proposed.
O22|Route-Based Tourism Product Development as a Tool for Social Innovation: History Valley in the Cserehát Region|Route-based tourism product development is known worldwide, and can be particularly advantageous for lessdeveloped areas, which are less familiar in the tourism market. By mixing the phenomena of tourism, the economy, innovation and social difficulties, certain types of tourism routes can be tools for social innovations, if they are combined with spatial development, support of local communities and integration of local products. The first part of this study gives a literature review regarding route-based tourism products, alongside the explanation of conceptual differences. In the second part, we introduce the so-called “History Valley” in the Cserehát region, with a multi-view analysis.

O22|Understanding and misunderstanding randomized controlled trials|Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are increasingly popular in the social sciences, not only in medicine. We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in RCTs over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or unobserved) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more difficult than commonly believed. At best, an RCT yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justification is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding ‘external validity’ is unhelpful because it expects too much of an RCT while undervaluing its potential contribution. RCTs do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientific progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. RCTs can play a role in building scientific knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not ‘what works’, but ‘why things work’.
O22|The Economy-wide Impacts and Risks of Malawi's Farm Input Subsidy Program|We estimate the impact of Malawi's Farm Input Subsidy Program using an economy-wide approach. This approach yields benefit-cost ratios about 60% higher than existing partial equilibrium studies, a result of our accounting for indirect benefits. Fertilizer response rates remain the determining parameter for benefit-cost ratio levels. Even with lower-end response rates, the program is pro-poor and generates double-dividends through higher and more drought-resilient yields. Overall, for macro-economically significant programs, our approach strongly complements survey-based evaluations. For Malawi, our results buttress arguments for a focus on program improvements.
O22|Improving service quality to local communities via satisfaction measurament in Greece: The MUSA approach|The objective of this paper is to propose a model that improves service quality to local communities via citizen satisfaction measurement. The main argument arises is that citizen satisfaction represents a modern approach for service quality in local communities and serves the development of a truly citizen-focused management and culture. Measuring citizen satisfaction offers an immediate, meaningful and objective feedback about citizens’ preferences and expectations. In this way, service performance may be evaluated in relation to a set of satisfaction dimensions that indicate the strong and the weak points of a Municipality. The study based on primary data collected through questionnaires from 456 respondents- citizens’ users of the municipality services of Skopelos Island in Greece. The main satisfaction criteria were: C.S.C (Citizen's Service Centre), Municipal Roll-Registry Office, Cleanliness -Lighting, Municipal Works, Home Assistance. These criteria are aggregated through an additive value function which is inferred from a set of satisfaction judgments with the use of the MUSA multi-criteria methodology and software. According to the findings of this research, the citizens of the Municipality of Skopelos seem to be satisfied to a large extent, either fully or partly, with the total of the provided services. However, there appeared some fields that need further improvements, such as Cleanliness - Lighting and Municipality works. The findings of the study are also related to particular policy implications regarding the role and the capacity of local authorities and decision makers to provide efficient and operational services to local communities. It’s very important to relate the findings and the case of Skopelos as pilot guide with the degree of organising capacity of local / regional authorities in larger and different municipalities in Greece. For this reason the proposed MUSA approach, we support that offers the framework to extent our analysis and to evaluate local/ regional authorities role and capacity regarding community development issues.
O22|Implementation of the eHealth Project in Latvia: Project audit perspective|In order to improve effectiveness of provision of healthcare service, the project implemented by the Ministry of Health- ”E-health in Latvia” is a step towards the right direction. It will provide the possibility for patients to ensure a greater control over their health issues, by maintaining healthy habits, lifestyle, increase substantiation of adoption of decisions and speed of service in the healthcare industry, ensuring quality and accessible information; patients will receive more quality services and in a shorter period of time for issuance of prescription drugs. Nevertheless, the policy prepared by the Ministry of Health in the area of e-Health will not be implemented in the planned scope and the planned term; therefore the target-to improve the effectiveness of the provision of healthcare services will only be partially achieved. The project „e-Health in Latvia” is necessary and important for the society, but already from the very beginning there have been substantial deficiencies (errors) - the professionals of industry are not involved in the project, multiple changes of institutions implementing the project, ineffective project management and finally, there has not been sufficient supervision of the project. This Paper analyzes the implementation of the e-Health Project in Latvia from the audit perspective, showing th results from the performance-compliance audit carried out by the supreme audit institution – State Audit Office of the Republic of Latvia.
O22|Project Management in the Port Development Project in Latvia|Paper analyse case study of performance and compliance audit in the port development project in Latvia. Author has participated in the audit process evaluating project management application practical approach in the project implemented by the Riga Freeport Authority and co-funded by the Cohesion Fund “Development of Infrastructure on Krievu Island for the Transfer of Port Activities from the City Centre”. Despite the mass media reports that the Riga Freeport Authority has successfully completed the project, only the construction phase of the project has been completed. During the following two years the stevedore activity must be transferred to the newly built port infrastructure on Krievu Island and coal handling operations must be commenced. In order to implement these activities the stevedores have to build internal infrastructure objects, to install equipment and to restructure logistics. Furthermore, in order to obtain positive opinions from the responsible institutions on the completion of the project and attainment of the defined objectives, by March 2019 it must be proved that the project objective has been reached and the benefits must be presented. The project was initiated in 2006 when the Riga Freeport Authority made a decision on using degraded Krievu Island territories for port activities and commenced the planning estimating that the construction phase of the project would be completed by the end of 2012. In accordance with the initial plans, active cargo handling should be currently taking place in the new port territories on Krievu Island. However, the implementation of the project has delayed by almost three years (detailed project implementation timeline see as annex 1), as we see it – due to ineffective solutions to project management issues and untimely, poor communication with the parties involved in the project, such as stevedores, builders, credit institutions etc.
O22|Адаптация Хозяйствующих Субъектов Аграрной Сферы: Конъюнктурное Изучение, Государственное Регулирования, Информационная База<BR>[Adaptation of economic entities of the agrarian sphere: opportunistic study, state regulation, information base]|The book examines the theory and practice of adaptation of rural commodity producers to the real environment in the conditions of development of market relations in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The concept of G. Simon is analyzed, which allows to formulate the basic idea of the approach to the adaptation of the production system: on the basis of studying demand and determining the values of external requirements for deliveries, the parameters of the organization of the production system are regulated and thus the stability of its functioning is ensured in conditions of environmental variability. The paper suggests ways of coordinating adaptation processes at the enterprise level and in the framework of state regulation measures; The state of adaptation of agricultural enterprises to the conditions of the market environment and the existing information base in the system of state statistics are analyzed; Generalized the experience of applying methods of market research of economic entities, monitoring the adaptation of agricultural enterprises to market conditions. The study was conducted on specific materials of enterprises of the Republic of Kazakhstan, which reflects the socio-economic situation of the period of reforms. The study was carried out in two stages -1900-2002gg period of reform of ownership forms and the second stage of 2003-2015 - publications published in Kazakhstan and Russia: V. Stukach, K. Kasenov, K. Abuov, T. Gorbunova, A. Nukesheva, A. Bykov. Keywords. Adaptation of agricultural enterprises, monitoring of adaptation processes, market research of enterprises, state regulation.
O22|Impact of ISO 9001 Certification on the Projects' Success of Large-Scale (AAA) Construction Firms in the Philippines|The general aim of the study was to identify the effects of ISO 9001 certification on project success, and its main criteria into large-scale construction companies in Metro Manila, Philippines. For this aim, the research was conducted an in-depth literature review for identifying the main variables first. Subsequently, a survey questionnaire was designed, and distributed randomly among 67 managers working in ISO 9001:2008-certified projects of large-scale construction firms. Then the descriptive and inferential statistics analysis employed, in order to find the results and conclusions. Finally, the findings revealed that ISO 9001 certification can significantly affect the construction project success and its main criteria, except time length of projects in Metro Manila, Philippines
O22|Effectiveness of Quality Management System (QMS) on Construction Projects|Quality management system (QMS) provides generic guidance and requirements for establishing an appropriate quality management procedure, in order to lower cost, increase productivity, customer's satisfaction, and market share in the organizations since the last two-decade. In construction industry, it can assist the companies to achieve successfully their objectives, and ensure that all phases of construction project consistently meet client's requirements (need). The main aim of this article was to evaluate the impact of QMS implementation on main factors of construction projects in Metro Manila, Philippines. For this intention, the study was conducted an in-depth literature review from different books, journals, and websites, in order to understand profoundly quality management system, identify the characteristics of the vital factors of construction projects, and the findings of empirical studies concerning the effects of QMS on construction projects. Subsequently, a questionnaire was designed based on previous studies and then distributed randomly among the 37 managers with the aim of collecting data. Finally, the analysis of data was accomplished by descriptive statistics to find the results and conclusion. The findings have shown that the implementation of QMS can be affected mostly on customer's satisfaction, followed by cost, and time respectively, while minimum effectiveness of QMS was on scope (quality) through QMS implementation in construction projects in Metro Manila.
O22|Dynamics of a facilitator’s role: Insights from the Danish construction industry|A facilitator is used in many different business capacities. In the construction industry, the role of facilitator is usually carried out by a stakeholder, often the architect. Facilitation embodies different roles, competences and activities. The present research addresses how a facilitator may have and make use of different roles during different phases of a process. This paper is based on a theory-building approach that combines existing theory and cases. Three cases demonstrate other stakeholders’ involvement in the process and the impact of this involvement on the facilitator’s role. The research in the three cases applied is based on workshops, interviews and observations. The cases are viewed from role and network perspectives, offering both possibilities and limitations for innovations in different stages of construction projects. Construction process facilitators fill the role of assisting and enabling the process. To achieve project success, they align the activities of various stakeholders. They reach alignment by influencing the other stakeholders, based on competences and the role taken and made. This paper contributes to the understanding of the facilitator’s role, the changes in this role over time and this role’s importance in construction industry projects.
O22|Application of Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making Methods on Six Sigma Projects Selection|Six sigma method widely applied in production and service businesses is known as a project-oriented method. In six sigma method, selection of the prior project among others can be considered as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. The conducted literature review has revealed that there is a large number of methods to select six sigma projects. It is more appropriate to use fuzzy multi-criteria decision making methods in project selection since evaluation criteria of six sigma projects include uncertainties. The aim of this study is to select the most appropriate project as a result of evaluating the projects by Fuzzy VIKOR, Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy COPRAS as methods of fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making and integrating the ranking scores obtained from each method by Copeland method. The proposed method has been implemented in a large scale production company, operating in Aydın ASTİM Organized Industrial Zone.
O22|The Difficulty in Following Project Schedule as a Key Project Management Challenge: Family Firm Perspective|The problem of how to manage projects successfully has been gaining growing interest for the last decades. The aforementioned is mainly caused by the fact that project management offers a wide range of methods and tools which, when properly used, can stimulate long-term growth of businesses. As a consequence it offers a particular development opportunity for family enterprises which, due to their specificity, have to overcome many difficulties. The primary objective of this paper is to examine whether family enterprises perceive, and to what extent, the factor of following project schedule as a difficulty in the area of project management. 154 Polish family firms representing different sectors were surveyed. The results of regression analysis show that family firms with global range of business activities, on the contrary to those with local or regional ones, do not find the factor of following project schedule as a difficulty. This results manly from the tools employed and the maturity level they have reached in project management. The findings support the current discussion on the specificity and uniqueness of family businesses in relationship to the knowledge area of project management. It also contributes to filling the gap on understanding the functioning of family firms in the emerging economies of Eastern Europe.
O22|Оценка общественной эффективности инвестиций в промышленно-логистический парк Новосибирской области. The Estimation of Economic Efficiency of Investments in the Industrial Park of the Novosibirsk Region|Описывается метод оценки общественной эффективности инвестиций, основанной на модели затраты-выпуск. Предлагаемый метод развивает известные приемы cost-benefits analysis и применяется для оценки эффективности бюджетного финансирования создания Промышленно-логистического парка (ПЛП) в Новосибирской области (НСО). Оценка осуществляется на основе модели затраты-выпуск, разработанной для НСО. Общественные выгоды оцениваются исходя из прироста валовой добавленной стоимости (ВДС). При этом учитывается ряд потерь ВДС, например, потери из-за вытеснения существующих производителей, потери из-за закупки импортных ресурсов и т. д. Общественные затраты оцениваются как полный выпуск экономики, необходимый для создания и функционирования инвестиционного проекта. The author describes a method for estimation the economic efficiency, based on the input-output model. The proposed method develops the author of well-known methods of cost-benefits analysis. The method is used to assess the effectiveness of budget financing the establishment of Industrial logistics Park (PLP) in the Novosibirsk region (NSO). The estimation is based on the input-output model developed for the NSO. Economic benefits are assessed on the basis of growth in gross value added (GVA). This takes into account a number of losses GVA, for example, losses due to the displacement of existing producers, losses due to the purchase of imported resources, etc. Economiccosts is estimated as a fulloutput of the economy, necessary for the establishment and operation of the investment project.
O22|Productive Complex of Defense and Security in Brazil: dimension, sectoral and technological impacts|The defense and security sector engages in a series of production and service activities that, beyond their contribution to national security and sovereignty, play an important role in terms of technological development, labor qualification, and social and economic impact. In this study, we measure the GDP of the defense and security complex in Brazil, including the upstream and downstream links of the value chain, comprising unpublished information of the country. We also assess the socioeconomic impacts of 23 investment projects of the Brazilian armed forces. We find that the Defense and security complex of Brazil corresponded to 3.7% of the country’s GDP in 2014, indicating a high potential to generate jobs paying wages above the economy average. Investment projects of the Brazilian armed forces have significant impacts on the national economy. The sectors directly affected by the investment projects are the medium-high and high technology industries and knowledge-intensive services. These sectors contribute to structural changes in Brazil once the country’s current production structure concentrates in low-intensive knowledge services sectors and commodities. Brazil lacks in studies and evaluations of public policies pertaining to the defense and security sector, and this study is an attempt to reduce these gaps.
O22|The effects of youth training on risk behavior: the role of non-cognitive skills|Abstract This paper uses unique experimental data from a youth training program in the Favelas, Brazil, to examine whether youth training programs can prevent treatment recipients from engaging in risk behavior—i.e., cigarettes, alcohol, and hard drug utilization, as well as witnessing or being a victim of violent crime. Although the program was successful in increasing income, we find that it only improved risk behavior of the treated individuals with higher levels of socio-emotional skills. JEL Classification: O11, O22, O17
O22|Making Money Work: Unconditional cash transfers allow women to save and re-invest in rural Zambia|Savings play a crucial role in faciliating investment in income-generating activities and the pathway out of poverty for low-income households in developing settings. Yet, there is little evidence of successful programmes that increase savings, particularly those that are simultaneously cost effective, scaleable and address gender inequalities. This paper examines the impact of the Government of Zambia’s Child Grant Programme (CGP), an unconditional cash transfer targeted to women in households with young children, on women’s savings and participation in non-farm enterprises.Findings show that the CGP enabled poor women to save more cash and that the impact is larger for women who had lower decision-making power at baseline. The results support the proposition that cash transfers have the potential for long-term sustainable improvements in women’s financial position and household well-being by promoting savings and facilitating productive investments among low-income rural households.
O22|Adapting the Supply of Education to the Needs of Girls: Evidence from a Policy Experiment in Rural India|This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a large-scale government initiative (NPEGEL/KGBV) that provided earmarked funds for addressing girls’ special needs to public schools in rural India. Our empirical strategy exploits local variation in program eligibility around a threshold based on the female literacy rate at the community level. The main result is that the program led to an enrollment gain of about six to seven percentage points for girls in upper primary school. Evidence of an enrollment gain for boys is tentative. Available evidence on mechanisms suggests that the program improved girl-friendly school infrastructure and services as well as gender-neutral school resources.
O22|What Influences World Bank Project Evaluations?|Do geopolitics influence project evaluation ratings by the World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group? Examining a wide range of geopolitical factors, we find evidence of rating bias only for one variable: non-permanent membership on the UN Security Council. Selection for rating is non-random and reflects bureaucratic interests but does not impact performance estimates.
O22|Does Child Sponsorship Pay off in Adulthood? An International Study of Impacts on Income and Wealth|We estimate the impact of international child sponsorship on adult income and wealth of formerly sponsored children using data on 10,144 individuals in six countries. To identify causal effects, we utilize an age-eligibility rule followed from 1980 to 1992 that limited sponsorship to children twelve years old or younger when the program was introduced in a village, allowing comparisons of sponsored children with older siblings who were slightly too old to be sponsored. Estimations indicate that international child sponsorship increased monthly income by $13–17 over an untreated baseline of $75, principally from inducing higher future labor market participation. We find evidence for positive impacts on dwelling quality in adulthood and modest evidence of impacts on ownership of consumer durables in adulthood, limited to increased ownership of mobile phones. Finally, our results also show modest effects of child sponsorship on childbearing in adulthood.
O22|Providing Policy Makers with Timely Advice: The Timeliness-Rigor Trade-off|Policy makers bemoan the lack of research findings to guide urgent decisions, whereas researchers' professional code puts rigor first. This article argues that provisional assessments, produced early in the research cycle, can bridge the gap. Numerous case studies point to the importance of early interaction with policy makers and the delivery of brief, policy-focused papers; but preliminary analyses may be flawed and so increase the chances of a wrong decision. This article demonstrates analytically that a preliminary assessment, supported by the offer of more refined research, provides an option that is superior, on average, to the current practice of submitting a final report at the end of the research cycle. Where practical implementation is concerned, it calls for donor-funded subsidies to promote the use of provisional assessments and for a rapid, independent, professional review process to ensure their quality. While the research-policy exchange in developing countries is a complex, context-specific phenomenon, the proposal offered here holds out some promise of improving decisions in the public sphere under a wide range of circumstances.
O22|Koordination, Lernen und Innovation zur Entwicklung peripherer ländlicher Regionen: Phase II der Begleitforschung zum Modellvorhaben LandZukunft|Das Bundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft suchte mit seinem Modellvorhaben LandZukunft von 2012 bis 2014 nach neuen Wegen, um anhaltende sozioökonomische Probleme in peripheren ländlichen Regionen zu lösen. Dazu sollten das aus der Managementlehre bekannte Instrument des Steuerns über Ziele, neue Finanzierungsinstrumente wie Mikrokredite und die Beteiligung neuer 'unternehmerischer Menschen' in vier Modellregionen erprobt werden. Die Begleitforschung untersuchte in ihrer zweiten Phase von 2014 bis 2015, inwiefern das Modellvorhaben zum Lernen und Kapazitätsaufbau in den teilnehmenden Regionen beigetragen hat sowie neue und dauerhafte Lösungen für die Herausforderungen peripherer Regionen anstoßen konnte. Darüber hinaus wurde das Steuern über Ziele hinsichtlich seines Potentials zur Koordination der ländlichen Entwicklung im politischen Mehrebenensystem untersucht. Der thematische Fokus der Begleitforschung jenseits dieser Querschnittsthemen ergab sich aus den unterschiedlichen Aktivitäten der Modellregionen: die Stärkung lokaler Bildungslandschaften, die touristische Destinationsentwicklung, die Entwicklung neuer Finanzierungsangebote, Finanzierung und Strategien sozialen Unternehmen sowie die mögliche Rolle großer Bildungseinrichtungen für die ländliche Entwicklung. Neben der Auswertung des Forschungsstandes und von Dokumenten basieren die Ergebnisse insbesondere auf Befragungen von beteiligten Akteuren und teilnehmender Beobachtung in den vier Modellregionen. Die Forschungsergebnisse zeigen, dass das Modellvorhaben in den Regionen auf großes Engagement gestoßen ist. Die schnelle Umsetzung des Vorhabens war aber mit großem Aufwand und hohen Kompetenzanforderungen verbunden, die nicht überall vorausgesetzt werden können. Das Steuern über Ziele birgt die Gefahr von Interessenkoalitionen zwischen Kontrolleuren und Kontrollierten, um die Fördermittel auszugeben und Ergebnisse positiv nach außen darzustellen. Lernprozesse konzentrierten sich auf die Fähigkeiten, die nötig waren, um das Modellvorhaben finanziell abzuwickeln, während strategische Veränderungen und institutionelle Anpassungsprozesse wesentlich seltener zu beobachten waren. Nachhaltige Entwicklungen konnten vor allem dort angestoßen werden, wo an vorhandene Kompetenzen und Kapazitäten angeknüpft wurde. Aufbauend auf diesen Erkenntnissen leitet die Begleitforschung Handlungsempfehlungen ab. So sollte beispielsweise das Steuern über Ziele nur dann für die ländliche Entwicklung in Betracht gezogen werden, wenn Innovationen nicht im Vordergrund stehen, sodass bereits Erfahrungswerte für mögliche Zielwerte und deren Verhandlung zwischen den Vertragspartnern vorliegen. Zudem sollte der thematische Fokus der Strategie möglichst eng gewählt werden, um die Definition und Kontrolle der Ziele sowie die Aneignung des nötigen Wissens zu erleichtern.
O22|The Value of Democracy: Evidence from Road Building in Kenya|Ethnic favoritism is seen as antithetical to development. This paper provides credible quantification of the extent of ethnic favoritism using data on road building in Kenyan districts across the 1963-2011 period. Guided by a model, it then examines whether the transition in and out of democracy under the same president constrains or exacerbates ethnic favoritism. Across the post-independence period, we find strong evidence of ethnic favoritism: districts that share the ethnicity of the president receive twice as much expenditure on roads and have five times the length of paved roads built. This favoritism disappears during periods of democracy. (JEL D72, H54, J15, O15, O17, O22, R42)
O22|An Application of Qualitative Risk Analysis as a Tool Adopted by Public Organizations for Evaluating “Green Projects”|This paper intends to explore the application of Qualitative Risk Analysis in evaluating the risk level associated with several public projects based on urban and peri-urban agriculture as a model of sustainable development of a territory. Therefore, urban agriculture is seen as an experimental model through which we can analyze the interaction between local institutions and citizens, as well as being a marketing tool to promote sustainability aspects linked to the territory. To this end, after a bibliographic review on the Qualitative Risk Analysis and the involvement of stakeholders in decisions relating to the public sector, a valuation of certain projects on the theme of urban and peri-urban agriculture, advanced by the local public Administration will be shown. The analysis proceeds with the classification of projects according to defined risk categories and their graphical representation through probability-impact matrix. The matrix shows that the data scores and the ranking vary significantly for each of the different projects involved. In this respect, the main purpose of this paper is to reveal how the success of a marketing policy based on the concept of sustainable marketing for promoting the territory depends, in many cases, not only on the characteristics of the territory analyzed, but also on the level of “riskiness” associated with the projects. Consequently, the empirical results of the paper can be a guide for public organizations, dealing with a plurality of projects but with limited resources, to assess and to prioritize projects using the level of “riskiness” as a criterion. Furthermore, economic resources could be directed to manage projects after taking into account the relevant risk ranking.
O22|A New Entrepreneurial Decision-Making Support Framework for Assessing Business Line Correlations|Sustainability is probably the ultimate goal of any entrepreneur when initiating or developing a business. As it involves competitiveness, companies aim to produce differentiated economic offerings by reusing and sharing processes, components, information and knowledge ? many times from different domains. However, to be effective, this should be envisaged already when developing the entrepreneurial plan or when assessing the opportunity of extending the business – therefore the need for planning / implementing / integrating several business lines (from various domains). As many of them may look attractive, an effective decision of starting one business line or another should be supported by some tool that allows a systematic assessment of the opportunity of implementing them. This paper proposes an algorithm that supports entrepreneurs in this respect. The opportunity of developing new business lines is assessed by estimating the mutual impact between them and existing business lines, their impact on organizational performance, and additional indicators such as financial effort, the estimated return on investment, technical and organizational difficulty, risk level or domain financing opportunities. An application example is presented in which an SME in an interdisciplinary domain (covering IT and life-sciences) assesses the opportunity of opening two new business lines.
O22|Total factor productivity, domestic knowledge accumulation, and international knowledge spillovers in the second half of the twentieth century|This paper analyses the relationship between total factor productivity (TFP) and innovation-related variables during the second half of the twentieth century. We perform this analysis for several European countries (France, Germany, UK, and Spain) and the USA, extending Coe and Helpman’s (Eur Econ Rev 39:859–887, 1995) empirical specification to include human capital. We use a new dataset of patents data for the past 150 years to calculate the stock of knowledge using the perpetual inventory method. Our time series empirical analysis confirms the heterogeneous relationship between innovation variables (domestic stock of knowledge, imports of knowledge, and human capital) and productivity. Our results reveal the extent to which observed differences in technology adoption patterns and the levels of endowment of such resources can explain differences in TFP dynamics across countries. The estimated coefficients confirm the considerable gap that still exists between the European countries and the USA in innovation-related variables. Furthermore, we obtain a finding that may have important implications for innovation policies: the higher the levels of human capital and domestic knowledge stocks, the higher will be the response of TFP to a 1 % increase in any of the aforementioned variables.
O22|Atratividade de Canaviais Paulistas Sob a Ótica da Teoria das Opções Reais| In the sugarcane production in Sao Paulo it was found that between crops 2007/08 and 2011/12 there was economic loss, a fact that leads to the goal of the present study : answer why these producers still remain providing sugarcane. Apart from the traditional viability analysis, the study incorporated the Real Options Theory analysis, which includes managerial flexibility on the investor decision model. Two sugarcane investment projects based on available information of Piracicaba and Sertãozinho regions were analyzed. Considering the discounted cash flow method, we obtained estimates pointing to the economic attractiveness of sugarcane planting in both regions, as shown by the positive response of the Net Present Values calculated. This evidence was corroborated when using the Real Options Theory, which incorporates flexibility on the decision model. Price and quality of sugarcane and agricultural productivity presented the higher impact on the financial viability of projects. Actions focused on agricultural productivity gains are seen as motivating for financial gain, while in terms of public policy we mention the possibility of adjustments in C gasoline pricing systems and in the taxation on sugarcane byproducts.
O22|The Impact of a Food for Education Program on Schooling in Cambodia| This study is an evaluation of the impact of a food for education program implemented in primary schools (grades 1–6) in six Cambodian provinces between 1999 and 2003. We find that school enrolment increased to varying degrees in relation to different designs of the intervention. We also investigate the effect of the program in terms of completed education and probability of having ever been in school, following up the affected cohorts in a 2009 survey. With an estimated cost of US$85 per additional child in school per year, the program can be considered very cost-effective within a comparable class of interventions.
O22|Pipeline Power: A Case Study of Strategic Network Investments|We analyze the impact of three controversial pipeline projects on the power structure in the Eurasian network for natural gas. Two pipelines, “Nord Stream” and “South Stream,” allow Russian gas to bypass transit countries, Ukraine and Belarus. The third project, “Nabucco,” aims at diversifying Europe’s gas imports by accessing producers in Middle East and Central Asia. If network power is measured with the Shapley Value we obtain a clear ranking of the projects which corresponds to the observed investment patterns. Nord Stream’s strategic value is huge, easily justifying the high investment cost for Germany and Russia. The additional leverage obtained through South Stream is much smaller and Nabucco is not viable. For the nucleolus in contrast, none of the pipelines has any strategic relevance at all, which contradicts the empirical evidence on investment.
O22|Innovation and entrepreneurship in aging societies: theorical reflection and a case study from kamikatsu, Japan|This paper aims at applying the Schumpeterian framework to issues of rural communities with shrinking and aging populations and a lost linkage to economic dynamics and to innovation. Discussion of how to obtain wealth and the well-being of townspeople remain undeveloped in theory and practice. This paper asks how innovative entrepreneurship and enterprise development can contribute to regional and communal competitiveness as well as create positive relationships between work and well-being. By applying Schumpeterian approaches to entrepreneurship and innovation a hypothetical schema is built. Our case study of a typical rural aging town with a stagnant economy provides empirical evidence to support the theoretical conception. The personality of the entrepreneur plays the main role in the creation of an innovative enterprise and for improvement in the well-being of townspeople. With entrepreneurial leadership, older residents in rural communities may indeed create disruptive innovation with low technology and become healthier and happier. JEL Codes: J14, O22, O35
O22|Impact des plateformes multifonctionnelles sur l’activité économique des femmes et l’éducation des enfants au Mali|Initié au Mali dans les années 1990 avec le soutien du PNUD, le programme plateformes multifonctionnelles (PTFM) vise à lutter contre la pauvreté en développant l'offre énergétique en milieu rural. L'énergie fournie par un moteur diesel sert essentiellement à transformer les produits agricoles, activité traditionnellement réservée aux femmes. L'objectif de ce travail est d'évaluer l'impact des PTFM sur l'activité économique des femmes et l'éducation des enfants à l'aide de méthodes quasi-expérimentales. L'analyse est conduite sur un panel de 201 villages et 2412 ménages obtenu à partir d'une enquête à deux passages effectués en 2009 et en 2011. Deux méthodes sont mises en œuvre pour estimer l'impact des PTFM : la méthode des entrées échelonnées et la méthode de la double différence avec ou sans appariement. Deux types d'effets sont identifiés : l'effet de la présence du programme et l'effet lié à la participation au programme. Les estimations ne rejettent pas l'hypothèse d'un impact positif des PTFM sur l'activité économique des femmes et sur la scolarisation des enfants au Mali.
O22|Determining the Underlying Reasons of License Termination and Cancellation Associated with Local Power Production in Turkey|Considerable changes have taken place in power production investments in Turkey within the last decade. As a result, an increasing number of investments in this sector have been terminated or cancelled and still continue to do so. When these investments are analyzed, significant issues attributed to misconceptions on cash flow estimations, local community objections, changes in the environmental impact assessment regulation interpretations, diminished trust in the conducted project evaluations and the associated reduction of capital and funds have been observed. Thus, the main contributors and their underlying reasons for these issues are examined in this study. In order to determine the associated key aspects and parameters, a survey has been developed and distributed to companies working on the renewable energy sector with questions regarding the number and the size of the licenses they have, the percentage of them turning into investments, the major methods of financial evaluation they use in the decision making process, their ability to calculate the cash flows during project evaluation process and the modelling of associated risk factors in the renewable energy sector.
O22|Protecting child nutritional status in the aftermath of a financial crisis: Evidence from Indonesia|In response to concerns over the vulnerability of the young in the wake of Indonesia's 1997–1998 economic crises, the Government of Indonesia implemented a supplementary feeding program to support early childhood nutritional status. This paper exploits heterogeneity in duration of program exposure to evaluate the impact of the program on children aged 6 to 60months. By examining differences in nutritional status of treated younger children and a placebo group of older children, the analysis finds that the program improved the nutritional status of treated children, and most significantly, led to 7 and 15% declines in rates of moderate and severe stunting, respectively, for children aged 12 to 24months who were exposed to the program for at least 12months over two years.
O22|Real option valuation of power transmission investments by stochastic simulation|Network expansions in power markets usually lead to investment decisions subject to substantial irreversibility and uncertainty. Hence, investors need valuing the flexibility to change decisions as uncertainty unfolds progressively. Real option analysis is an advanced valuation technique that enables planners to take advantage of market opportunities while preventing or mitigating losses if future conditions evolve unfavorably. In the past, many approaches for valuing real options have been developed. However, applying these methods to value transmission projects is often inappropriate as revenue cash flows are path-dependent and affected by a myriad of uncertain variables. In this work, a valuation technique based on stochastic simulation and recursive dynamic programming, called Least-Square Monte Carlo, is applied to properly value the deferral option in a transmission investment. The effect of option's maturity, the initial outlay and the capital cost upon the value of the postponement option is investigated. Finally, sensitivity analysis determines optimal decision regions to execute, postpone or reject the investment projects.
O22|Overseas oil investment projects under uncertainty: How to make informed decisions?|To better address the complexity of overseas oil investment and help investors to make the informed decision in overseas oil investment, this paper applies real options theory and Monte Carlo simulation to study overseas oil investment evaluation. The model has incorporated not only the uncertainties of oil price and investment cost but also the uncertainties of exchange rate and investment environment. These unique features have enabled our model to be best equipped to evaluate the value of oil overseas investment projects of three oil field sizes (large, medium, small) and under different resource tax systems (royalty tax and production sharing contracts). In our empirical setting, we have selected China as an investor country and Indonesia as an investee country as a case study. Our results show that, although production sharing contract (PSC) is convertible to that of resource royalty system, given the flexibility in PSC, it can to great extent increase the bargaining power of investee country. As there is an important tradeoff between oil resource investee country and overseas oil investor, in medium and small sized oil investment negotiation the oil company should try to increase the cost oil limit in production sharing contract and avoid the term of a windfall profits tax to reduce the investment risk of overseas oil fields.

O22|Cost-Benefit Estimation of the Smart Grid Development for the Russian Unified Power System|The paper is devoted to the issue of smart power system cost-benefit analysis. The innovative character of smart grids is defined and related obstacles for traditional cost-benefit assessment are revealed, primarily referred to external effects evaluation. Brief systematization of existing methods of smart grids assessment is provided and their weak points are defined. A new Smart Grid cost-benefit assessment approach is presented, basing on the elaborated comprehensive system of smart power system effects. The approach is tested for the system effects of smart power system implementation in the Russian Unified Energy System, quantitative results are presented.
O22|Project management approach in USA, Japan and Germany â€“ a comparative analysis|Project management is a complex form of economic activity based on three dimensions: objective, cost and duration. Over time, the most developed countries preserved their status at global scale through knowledge, judicious use of national resources - human and material - and by taking advantage of certain natural or circumstantial advantages. Analyzing the literature, in this paper we plan to evaluate the project management styles adopted and used by three major world economies (US, Japan and Germany) and to identify those specific features that favourise the success of their projects. We consider that despite the problems arising in the implementation of projects (overruns of budget, project duration and resources), it is better to 43 organise the economic activity on a project basis, than aleatory, depending on current conditions and inspiration
O22|Identifying similarities at cultural level adapted to Romanian specificity, from the project management perspective|Knowledge dissemination represents an important driver of economic growth. Therefore, knowing the best practice of project management around the world improves the performances of our leaders at both public and private level. To a great extent, the education of national human capital is very important in its mission to develop specialists capable of assimilate the international knowledge and experience in project management and to adapt it to local conditions. From this perspective, our paper aims at identifying the Romanian cultural characteristics which are compatible with the ones of the analyzed developed countries, experienced in using the techniques of project management and at finding the economic power which is closer to our country from a cultural standpoint.
O22|InterconexiÃ³n ElÃ©ctrica en Chile: Precios versus Costos|El presente trabajo tiene por objeto estimar el impacto en precios a cliente final de la interconexiÃ³n entre los dos mayores sistemas elÃ©ctricos de Chile. Para ello se estima un modelo economÃ©trico en que los precios son explicados, entre otras variables, por el nivel de los costos marginales del sistema, los grados de concentraciÃ³n del mercado y la variabilidad de los costos marginales proyectados por los agentes. Los datos utilizados corresponden a los contratos bilaterales entre generadores y grandes clientes, desde 2006 hasta 2014. Los resultados encontrados indican que la interconexiÃ³n beneficiarÃ­a a los clientes finales al disminuir los precios de equilibrio, producto de una caÃ­da en la variabilidad de los costos marginales esperados y una menor concentraciÃ³n de las empresas generadoras existentes. El aporte de este enfoque es que centra los beneficios de la interconexiÃ³n en las condiciones de competencia y riesgo, y no en la simple estimaciÃ³n de costos directos como tradicionalmente se ha hecho.
O22|Initial Conditions Matter: Social Capital and Participatory Development|Billions of dollars have been spent on participatory development programs in the developing world. These programs give community members an active decision-making role. Given the emphasis on community involvement, one might expect that the effectiveness of this approach would depend on communities' pre-existing social capital stocks. Using data from a large randomised field experiment of Community-Led Total Sanitation in Indonesia, we find that villages with high initial social capital built toilets and reduced open defecation, resulting in substantial health benefits. In villages with low initial stocks of social capital, the approach was counterproductive – fewer toilets were built than in control communities and social capital suffered.
O22|On the economic impact of university proof of concept centers|University proof of concept centers (PoCCs) are an organizational innovation intended to improve the dissemination and commercialization of new knowledge. During the past 15 years, at least 32 university-affiliated PoCCs have been established at universities within the United States. Despite this recent growth, little systematic empirical research exists relating to the organization or impact of PoCCs. Analyzing data published by the Association of University Technology Managers, we find that universities affiliated with a PoCC enjoy a positive and statistically significant increase in the number of spinoffs established each year after adoption. While additional research is needed, our findings are consistent with the presumption that PoCCs may offer a promising new tool for regional and national economic development.

O22|Nonlinear Pricing in Village Economies|This paper analyzes and estimates the impact of quantity discounts for basic staples in rural Mexico. We propose a model of price discrimination that nests those of Maskin and Riley (1984) and Jullien (2000), in which consumers differ in their tastes and, due to subsistence constraints, in their ability to pay for a good. We show that, under mild conditions, a model in which consumers face heterogeneous subsistence or budget constraints is equivalent to one in which consumers have access to heterogeneous outside options. We then rely on known results (Jullien (2000)) to characterize the equilibrium price schedule. We analyze the effects of nonlinear pricing on market participation, as well as the impact of a market-wide income transfer on the price schedule, when consumers are differentially budget constrained. Such a transfer, which is a common policy in developing countries, stimulates consumption by increasing households’ ability to pay but also typically leads to an increase in the intensity of price discrimination. We prove that the structural parameters of the model are identified from data on prices and quantities in a given market. The intuition behind this identification result is that the equilibrium price schedule in a market is a function of the distribution of consumers’ willingness and ability to pay, which, in turn, is related to the distribution of quantities. We estimate the parameters of the model using data from municipalities and localities in Mexico on three commodities, rice, kidney beans, and sugar, which are consumed by most households and are part of the evaluation component of the well-known conditional cash transfer program Progresa. The model fits the data remarkably well. Interestingly, we find that nonlinear pricing is beneficial to a large number of households, especially those who consume small quantities, relative to linear pricing. Available evidence indicates that the program had no effect on average prices. We show, however, that the program has affected the slope (in quantity) of the price schedule, which has become steeper as implied by our model, and has thus lead to an increase in the degree of price discrimination. We also show that, empirically, accounting for the impact of the hazard function of the distribution of quantities on prices, as consistent with our model, explains a large fraction of the shift in the price schedule induced by the program.
O22|The Role of Project Office for Project Portfolio Management|The paper focuses on the management of project portfolios as a novel and complex area in the practice of project-oriented organizations. The paper’s main goal is to review the role of project management office /PMO/ for enhancing the performance of organizational project portfolio. It considers several core issues and functions related to the process of implementation of PMO in a particular organization. A case study has been conducted in order to provide evidence about the benefits from the introduction of PMO in a company operating in the media sector. Results from the case study analysis shows that this approach to project management in a multi-project environment is to a large extent universal and can be successfully applied in similar organizational context.
O22|A Qualitative Evaluation On Sop Hrd 2007-2013 In Romania - Focus-Group Study|This paper seeks to underline the main problems faced in implementing and using European Union (EU) funds in Romania within the Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development (SOP HRD) during the first programing period 2007-2013. The problems and barriers revealed were identified during a focus-group for the second interim evaluation of SOPHRD, organized by the Management Authority of this program in Nord-Vest region, in November 2014. The focus-group represents a small part of the entire process of evaluating the programme for the development of human resources during its implementation, with the purpose of finding beneficiaries opinions about the efficiency, effectiveness and relevance of interventions financed through SOP HRD. Beliefs, personal recommendations from the participants are presented in order to improve the use of European funds for development of human resources (in particular) and the use of structural instruments (in general). These results and solutions can be efficiently used during the next financial period 2014-2020 to create the framework for every priority axis and key areas of intervention, during the implementation of new projects and within the entire process that these funds require in order to successfully use the structural instruments to catch up with developed countries. Moreover, some of the problems identified can be found in other operational programmes and therefore, this research can be useful for every one that wants to use this kind of financing or has a project of this kind in implementation, without taking into account the European funding source. Besides the qualitative approach given by focus-group research method, this paper is going to present a general approach over SOP HRD in Romania during 2007-2013, from a quantitative perspective (number of projects submitted, approved, contracted, payment rate, absorption rate). Moreover solutions linked to knowledge management practices will be proposed to overcome identified problems in using structural and cohesion funds. We choose to focus our attention on knowledge management solutions due to the fact that we can say that we are now living in a knowledge age. This research is important by connecting knowledge management/knowledge sharing practices with the management of European funds.
O22|Integrated Project Plan As Basis For Multi-Project Systems Management|Organizations today are faced with the challenge of managing a bigger number of projects in an efficient way. Public sector is a good example of a multi-project system and each improvement in project management in this kind of environment is a very interesting field for study. Assuming there is a well-defined and organized project management system in place, the literature describes and practical examples show that efficiency depends directly on quality of data delivered from the lowest levels of management. Research into the theoretical background of this phenomenon points to the necessity of a systematic approach to planning: clearly defined demands and standardized forms for project plans development create preconditions for a precise and transparent vertical flow of information available to all project participants. The goal is to record and keep all required pieces of information on the project, in the first place those regarding time and finances, in one place in an integrated document called the project plan.
O22|Main Factors Influencing Project Success|The high frequency of using projects in all fields determined the increasing importance of adequate project management. Considering the direct relationship between reaching projects’ objectives and the long term development of an organization, aspects regarding projects’ success and the success factors of projects are topics of great interest in project management literature. Reaching projects’ objectives in compliance with constraints of cost, time and performance is usually not sufficient to determine whether the project was successful or not. While literature provides different perspectives regarding this topic, in practice things get sometimes even more complicated, project success being often vaguely defined. This article aims to present an overview on the topic of project success and identify main success factors when dealing with projects using a quantitative research.
O22|Partnership Principle – A Theoretical Approach within Cohesion Policy|The article is presenting partnership principle in the context of cohesion policy (regional policy). The conceptualization of this principle is useful for increasing the performance of the programs using management strategies. The article follows a series of articles that explores the importance of partnership in projects within cohesion policy. Also the article is highlighting the feedback of interviewed from different countries regarding the importance of the partnership in the performance of their projects and some of the good practices presented in the European code of conduct on partnership applicable in the period 2014-2020. The theories and the lessons presented are also applicable to other aspects referring to management, development and regional planning.
O22|Impacts of a Micro-Enterprise Clustering Programme on Firm Performance in Ghana|Widely considered an important backbone of economies in developing countries, micro- and small enterprises face several growth constraints. The creation of industrial zones (IZs) with improved access to infrastructure and secure land tenure is a potential remedy to promote local economic development. We assess the effects of an intervention on business performance indicators that establishes IZs for micro-enterprises in Ghana based on firm-level data on 227 enterprises. The results show that the establishment of IZs leads to the creation of new firms, but for existing firms that relocated to the IZs the effects on firm performance are negative.
O22|Designing Experiments to Measure Spillover Effects, Second Version|This paper formalizes the design of experiments intended specifically to study spillover effects. By first randomizing the intensity of treatment within clusters and then randomly assigning individual treatment conditional on this cluster-level intensity, a novel set of treatment effects can be identified. We develop a formal framework for consistent estimation of these effects, and provide explicit expressions for power calculations. We show that the power to detect average treatment effects declines precisely with the quantity that identifies the novel treatment effects. A demonstration of the technique is provided using a cash transfer program in Malawi.
O22|Management of projects risk with Business Intelligence|Project management is characterize like the broader concept of a comprehensive set of management processes and activities that are limited in time and whose aim is to implement something specific, whether the introduction, change, etc. In project management, which aims to ensure effective management of a comprehensive package of activities to a greater or lesser extent, concerns virtually all organizations and from internal changes or activities, supply of products, the introduction of ICT technologies to large investment projects. Project management involves the application of knowledge, experience, skills, activities, tools and techniques so that the final project met its requirements and achieves its goals in a limited time interval. Between the initial and final state the project goes through several phases, including project risk. To eliminate these risks is determined by the risk management as an area focusing on analysis and risk reduction using various tools and techniques. If we seek to answer the question what is the risk, then in terms of project management it can be understood as the likelihood that an event occurs that is contrary to the assumption. The first stage is to identify risks. This is based on the areas covered by the project and cannot be generalized for different types of projects. For example, a project for the implementation of data warehouse will have different areas of risk than new product development. The next stage is risk analysis. At this stage, we try to find the level of risk and its impact on the completion of the project. We are looking for those risks which are important and have a significant influence on the project (priority risks). Following the planning and risk management, which proposes procedures to minimize risk, responsibility for the procedures and time frames in which the procedures are being implemented. The last phase is monitoring, which leads to elimination of risks, which are no longer relevant and to re-identify new risks. This entire process is appropriate to support software tool that allows us to their effective management. We can use Business Intelligence tools as one of the software tools, especially in the phase of risk identification and analysis. Identifying risks putting together a basic set of potential risks when the input use various available sources of information such as the previously identified risks files or lists the usual risks in managing similar projects. In the analysis phase, then we can make risk assessment of the potential risks, including the determination of their probabilities to create a catalogue of potential risks of the project, which must be addressed at the planning stage and management, Business Intelligence tools are with justification used for the suggestions to minimize risks. The article discusses the Business Intelligence tools and their application in the field of project’s risk management. This is an opportunity to create panels, tables, graphs and matrices, including analyses of data cubes and to a certain extent and use of prediction algorithms for determining the probability of the risk and its impact on the implementation of the project.
O22|Modeling and Applied Research in Sustainable Development|We develop an algebraic polynomial model to measure and compare the sustainability in 4 countries after studying existing sustainable development index systems. The model consists of three facets of indicators: natural resources reserve, environment carrying capacity and social welfare level. We use recursive least-squares method (RLS) to determine the parameters of the fitted model and apply this model to design a sustainable development plan for Tanzania. Considering the country profile and model testing results, the plan comprises of five programs: producing clean water, generating electricity, improving transport conditions, developing tourism industry and advancing medical and health services. Finally we predict the change of each indicator in the next two decades and compare the results under natural state, finding that the sustainability of Tanzania will increase.
O22|Micro-Economical Aspects of Public Projects: Impact Factors for Project Efficiency and Sustainability|Project management approach in the public administration becoming gradually applied tool for implementation of different public programs and activities. Latvia has several methodological documentations to evaluate the possible benefits from infrastructure but still there is need for improvements as the only clear defined methodology is for transport sectors and those which have been provided by the European commission, but not always have been practically used in local municipalities’ project evaluations. Public projects, and planning for such projects, generally have the following characteristics: • Such projects are inherently risky due to long planning horizons and complex interfaces. • Technology is often not standard. • Decision making and planning are often multi-actor processes with conflicting interests. • Often the project scope or ambition level will change significantly over time. • Statistical evidence shows that such unplanned events are often unaccounted for, leaving budget contingencies sorely inadequate. • As a consequence, misinformation about costs, benefits, and risks is the norm. • The result is cost overruns and/or benefit shortfalls with a majority of projects. Paper exanimates public project management applications in the context of the underlying structure that adverse dynamics and their application to specific areas for micro-economical level of project management, synthesizes the policy messages, and provides directions for future research. Public sector project management in Latvia become popular in recent years as there is different type of public funding sources available. The paper examined the application of the project management practice and its micro-economic aspects in public sector in Latvia. Public sector project management in Latvia become popular in recent years as there is different type of public funding sources available. The paper describes the public sector project management practice in Latvia. Study shows that public sector project maturity level is low and should be improved. Research period covers the time from January 2013 – March 2015.
O22|The “Highway Effect” on Public Finance: Case of the STAR Highway in the Philippines|In this study, we examine the impact of the STAR highway located in Batangas province, Philippines, on the public finance of the cities and municipalities through which it directly passes. Specifically, we exploit a unique, disaggregated dataset on tax (property and business taxes) as well as non-tax revenues (regulatory fees and user charges) of the cities and municipalities in the Batangas province. We find, based on our two specifications of a modified difference-in-difference model, that the STAR highway had a robust, statistically significant, and economically growing impact on business taxes. We also find that this so-called “highway effect” also extends to municipalities located in a neighboring province to Batangas. Furthermore, based on more careful inspection and robustness checks, it appears that the STAR highway had a significant impact not only on business taxes, but also on property taxes and regulatory fees. These findings support the widely held belief that infrastructure investments matter; further, our micro-case study suggests that infrastructure investments can indirectly boost tax and non-tax revenues through their power to reduce transportation costs and enhance the activity of firms and workers located along the highway.
O22|Contester par projets. Le cas des monnaies locales associatives|Les monnaies associatives à circulation locale et commerciale, qui ont émergé en France depuis 2010 principalement, sont construites sur des fondements contestataires en vue d’une économie alternative et prennent la forme de projets destinés à agir sur la réalité. Elles font donc converger la critique et l’initiative. Ce texte analyse en quoi l’emploi de la catégorie du projet par les militants peut avoir un effet retour sur la portée de la contestation elle-même. À cette fin, ce texte commence par caractériser ce qui relève de la critique ou de la contestation dans les initiatives de monnaies associatives. Il poursuit en montrant en quoi ces initiatives relèvent de la forme du projet et souligne la contradiction possible entre projet et contestation du capitalisme dans sa forme néolibérale. Il ébauche la catégorie de « cité par projets solidaires » afin de rendre compte du genre particulier de projet que sont les monnaies locales associatives. L’examen d’une initiative monétaire associative particulière au filtre de la gestion de projet permet d’identifier les décalages que cette dernière occasionne sur le projet lui-même, et interroge la capacité de tels projets de réaliser leur dimension alternative et donc de contribuer à la transformation sociale désirée.
O22|Проект реконструкции Транссиба как объект оценки общественной эффективности. Project of the Trans-Siberian Railway reconstruction as an object of social efficiency evaluation|Рассматривается проблема оценки общественной эффективности крупномасштабного проекта реконструкции Транссиба, реализуемого в ситуации стратегической (фундаментальной) неопределённости. Имеющийся инструментарий недостаточен для решения этой проблемы (из-за качественно иного характер данного проекта в сравнении с зарубежными, гораздо более высокой степени неопределённости, отсутствия оценок ряда необходимых нормативов). Цель нашего исследования состоит в разработке подхода, адекватного рассматриваемой проблеме. Для оценки и выбора варианта крупномасштабного проекта разработана двухуровневая модель принятия инвестиционного решения, верхний уровень которой основан на макроэкономическом подходе (с применением специализированной версии модели ОМММ), а нижний – на микроэкономическом. В отличие от принятой за рубежом практики, оценка эффективности и выбор варианта транспортного проекта осуществляется «сверху вниз». При этом учёт фактора неопределённости носит сквозной характер. На верхнем уровне инструментом для этого служит сценарный подход, на нижнем – теория размытых множеств. We consider the problem of social efficiency evaluation concerning the project of the Trans-Siberian Railway reconstruction. This project is to be realized in the situation of strategic (fundamental) uncertainty. Existing tools are not sufficient for solving this problem (because of qualitatively different nature of the project as compared with those abroad, much higher degree of uncertainty, and the lack of estimates for a number of necessary norms). Our study aims at development of an approach that would be adequate to the problem under consideration. We developed a two-level model for investment decision-making for appraisal and selection of a variant of the large-scale project. The upper level of this model bases on the macroeconomic approach (with the use of a specialized version of the Inter-Sector Inter-Region Optimization Model); the lower level bases on the microeconomic approach. As opposed to the foreign practice, the efficiency evaluation and selection of a variant of the transport project is top-down. End-to-end taking uncertainty into account is implemented. A tool for this is the scenario approach on the upper level, and the fuzzy set theory at the lower one.
O22|Применение методов современной оценки активов для анализа экономической эффективности проектов в российском нефтегазовом секторе. Applications of modern asset pricing methods to project valuation in oil and gas industry|"Для большинства проектов в нефтегазовом секторе характерны длительные сроки окупаемости капитальных вложений и наличие множества разнообразных рисков. Оценка эффективности подобных проектов являет собой сложную задачу вследствие необходимости учета и структурирования различных типов неопределенности. В данной статье кратко проанализированы возможности и особенности применения методики «современной оценки активов» для устранения недостатков традиционного метода дисконтирования денежных потоков применительно к экономической оценке проектов нефтегазовой сферы. Рассмотрены примеры оценивания проектов в нефтедобыче (на базе ретроспективных показателей) и мегапроекта по освоению ресурсов гелия на востоке Российской федерации. В первом случае была выполнена прямая проверка двух методов на предмет адекватности результатов оценки в сравнении с динамикой расчетно-фактических показателей. Проведенная проверка показала, что метод «современной оценки активов» в целом дает более точные результаты (по верификации с фактическими) и не занижает показатели эффективности — в отличие от обычного метода дисконтирования, склонного к излишнему детерминизму. Во втором случае исследовался сложный «сверхдолгосрочный» проект, оценка которого с помощью стандартных методик в текущих организационно-экономических и технологических условиях зачастую дает неутешительные результаты, что противоречит здравому смыслу и успешному опыту развития гелиевой промышленности в других странах мира. Важным результатом является следующий: моделирование гелиевого мегапроекта с помощью методов «современной оценки активов» позволяет не только получить более адекватные представления о его экономической эффективности, но и по-новому взглянуть на подходы к реализации. Investment projects in oil & gas sector are usually characterized by long payback periods and a considerable number of risks involved. Thus, valuation of E&P projects is a complicated task implying structuring and estimation uncertainty. This paper analyses and provides examples of application “modern asset pricing” for mitigating drawbacks of DCF-method in valuation E&P projects. Essay gives examples of evaluation of projects in the oil industry (based on historical figures) and the mega-project to develop the helium resources in the east of the Russian Federation. In the first case direct verification of two methods was performed — for assessing the adequacy of the results in comparison with the dynamics of actual figures. The audit shows that ""modern asset pricing"" method generally gives more accurate results (with actual verification) and doesn’t underestimate the project efficiency indicators — in opposite to the conventional discounting method, which is prone to excessive determinism. In the second case, we study complicated ""super long"" project whose evaluation with use of standard techniques under current organizational, economic and technological conditions often gives disappointing results, which is contrary to common sense and the successful experience of helium industry in other countries. An important result is the following: modeling of helium megaproject using the methods of ""modern asset pricing"" allows you to not only get a more adequate estimate of the economic efficiency, but also take a new view at the approaches to implementation."
O22|Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators in Wind turbines and its impact on the Wind Energy|With rapid development of wind power technologies and significant growth of wind power capacity installed worldwide, various wind turbine concepts have been developed. The wind energy conversion system is demanded to be more cost-competitive, so that comparisons of different wind generator systems are necessary. An overview of different wind generator systems and their comparisons are presented. First, the contemporary wind turbines are classified with respect to both their control features and drive train types, and their strengths and weaknesses are described. The promising permanent magnet generator types are also investigated. Then, the quantitative comparison and market penetration of different wind generator systems are presented. Finally, the developing trends of wind generator systems and appropriate comparison criteria are discussed.

This requires a suitable information flow, determination of objectives, a selection of activities required to follow these goals, motivate members, employees, volunteers to work together to achieve these goals. The organization must be led by competent managers at the early stages of activity to its most developed stage. Through public relations activities, the organization will project a positive attitude and image that will be preferred by top public. This image must be that of an organization working for the benefit of the community and is mainly interested in the physical, mental and moral development of youth. Such an image has to be consistent with the core values of the country in general and those of the community in which the organization, in particular.
O22|Hofstede Vectors: A Visualization Approach to Cultural Factors in the Knowledge Transfer - International Business Team Optimization Model|There is no universal management style. Managing across diverse cultural teams in this age of diffused, widespread globalization can be a challenge. Diversity, within a workplace represented by multiple time-zones, is the new norm for many companies. With this in mind, there is an increasing need to understand the processes & systems, organizational and managerial mechanisms & styles that contribute to successful internationally-based projects. At the core of such systems and teams is the notion of effective communication, of effective transfer of real meaning leading to real knowledge transfer across international team members and managers. This then is expected to greatly and directly affect the success of global business projects. This fundamental relationship between knowledge transfer and international business project success has been investigated, quantitatively modeled, and results published in an original doctoral dissertation by the author. The foundation of the work was based on research and data gathered from 69 international companies across the US, Europe, and Japan. The original model was further optimized and new results were published and presented in the form of a software-based decision tool which offered greater utility.This paper further expands the original work of the author in two areas. It presents a rigorous system test in the form of verification and validation analysis of the original concept and decision-tool. This is accomplished using specific data from 56 large industrial projects, across 16 countries, involving 5 subsidiaries of a well-known international corporation over a two year period from January 2013 to December 2014. Furthermore and as a subsequent step towards further improvement of utility, the distinct and original concept of ?Hofstede Vectors? is proposed and integrated into the model. The novel concept was established from Dutch psychologist Geert Hofstede?s well-known and widely-accepted research establishing his cultural dimensions theory. Hofstede Vectors are presented as a visualization knowledge optimization tool in the knowledge transfer - team culture ? business success relationship triad. After establishing the concept, the paper further presents ways of visualizing the analysis through graphical vector based techniques, and, interpreting quantitative results into practical real-world constructs for optimizing business teams. Utilizing actual project data, the concept is then verified, validated and integrated into the original model. The paper makes contributions on various levels of international business. The newly-established Hofstede Vector concept provides a construct for optimizing knowledge transfer and global business team performance.
O22|The Economic Impact of the SAPARD Programme on the Tourism Supply in Suceava County|The Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD) was a pre-accession instrument, created and implemented by the European Union since 1999 and aimed at providing logistical support to applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe. The programme had two main components: providing non-refundable financial assistance, by stimulating regional economic growth and development and, at the same time, it was directed at implementing certain management systems that matched the development policies of the EU. The effects triggered by the implementation of the SAPARD Programme in Romanian tourism were assessed in the past years from various quantitative perspectives (number of projects, value of the granted funding), but the regional economic impact generated strictly by this programme hasn’t yet been explicitly and unequivocally pointed out. From this standpoint, the previous research has been mainly focused on pre/post implementation comparisons of the GDP and of the unemployment rate. On a national level, the Suceava county stands out in terms of the large number of SAPARD projects funded through the Measure 3.4 – The development and diversification of economic activities to generate multiple activities and alternative income, thus leading to an increasing number of boarding houses in rural areas and, at the same time, fostering the qualitative development of the tourism supply in the area. From our point of view, an analytical approach of the multiplying effect generated by the SAPARD Programme would start from the thorough measurement of the economic changes that have occurred locally, in relation to the weight of the absorbed grants. The preliminary results arrived at in less than 5 years since the suspension of this funding source pinpoint a rather insignificant contribution of these funds to the local economy. The lack of experience of the parties involved in the system, bureaucracy and the migration of the non-refundable money are the most probable causes of the selection and implementation of projects that were rather unsustainable and inadequate in terms of quality.
O22|Structures and dynamics of transnational cooperation networks: evidence based on Local Action Groups in the Veneto Region| The paper assesses the structures and the dynamics of transnational cooperation projects promoted by Local Action Groups (LAGs) in different periods (from LEADER II to LEADER Axis) using Social Network Analysis (SNA) in a specific case study: the Veneto region in Italy. The classical indexes of SNA have been critically examined, moreover the paper presents innovative indexes able to capture the peculiarity of transnational cooperation: disaggregated densities of the network and transnational centrality of the node. These indexes are useful in order to quantify how transnational a network actually is, and to measure the power-information that each actor (LAG) can acquire through its transnational contacts. The methodology can become an instrument for Managing Authorities to implement new forms of evaluation of transnational cooperation of LAGs.
O22|Trust in the LEADER approach: the case study of the Veneto region in Italy| The paper presents a methodology for the assessment of interpersonal and institutional trust measured at the level of Local Action Groups of the LEADER Approach and based on the use of indicators and on Social Network Analysis (SNA). From the theoretical point of view, the indicators can be used in longitudinal studies to assess if the relation between individual trust and social networks is verified with regard to specific organizations promoting rural development at local level. From the operative point of view, the indicators of trust represent a useful and relative simple instrument to be used in the monitoring and evaluation activities of the LEADER Approach.

O22|An Analysis of the Impact of Cohesion Policy in the Transport Sector|With reference to the general importance of transport infrastructure for regional devel-opment, this paper takes a different approach to the analysis of the European Union cohesion policy funding and views it in terms of transport oriented business entities. It analyses the data matrix of cohesion policy funded projects in the period 2007 – April 2011, in terms of the beneficiary characteristics, project characteristics and spatial distribution within the districts of the Czech Republic. The results show particular activity of public sector entities in transport infrastructure oriented projects, while private sector entities focus rather on human resources and technological advancement projects. The analysis confirms the predominance of small and medium enterprises among the beneficiaries in the majority of districts, but results contradict the officially declared preference of economically lagging regions.
O22|Aproximación a la cooperación en innovación en empresas del programa de asociatividad y desarrollo empresarial sectorial –PADES– en Antioquia (Colombia)|Resumen El objetivo principal de este artículo es describir los aspectos más relevantes de las relaciones de cooperación en innovación entre empresas pertenecientes al Programa de Asociatividad y Desarrollo Empresarial Sectorial -PADES- de la Asociación Colombiana de Micro, Pequeñas y Medianas Empresas -ACOPI- en el departamento de Antioquia (Colombia). La investigación es de carácter exploratorio, se indagó fundamentalmente la opinión de gerentes / personal de la alta dirección y se utilizó el análisis descriptivo para establecer frecuencias en materia de actividades y resultados de innovación; agentes, motivos, obstáculos para la cooperación en innovación y fuentes de financiación. Los resultados muestran que las empresas, cooperan mayoritariamente con empresas del PADES, realizan innovaciones blandas, poco intensivas en conocimiento, sobre todo en materia organizacional y en marketing, financiadas mayormente con recursos propios. Además, que la falta de confianza y de cultura son sus mayores obstáculos para la cooperación en innovación.

This paper explores strengthening connectivity between the two subregions by identifying the missing links in transport connectivity. The paper is specifically concerned with the role of cross-border transport infrastructure investments. To this end, the author reviews all possible road and rail land corridors that would help create seamless transport connectivity. Missing gaps and corresponding transport infrastructure projects are identified, and projects are screened and prioritized. For the selected critical projects, the study recommends phased investments.
O22|Qualitative Assessment of Energy Initiative: Case Study from Liberia|In policy domain, economics is concerned with decision about the best alternative for undertaking public and private initiatives. Economic decision is a complex issue since many explicit and implicit economic factors affect the available economic alternatives. This is particularly difficult when we have to decide about launching an energy initiative. Generally, economic options are quantitatively evaluated using cost benefit analysis method which considers only explicit factors and does not cater for the opinion of masses about suitability of particular economic option. This shortfall of quantitative assessment is more pronounced in case of energy initiative for which the ultimate recipients are the masses and undertaking of energy initiative has to cater for the consent of the masses. The opinion of people gives important conclusions about explicit and implicit factors affecting the economic options. Thus, for launching an energy initiative, it is more prudent to go for qualitative participatory assessment procedure rather than rigid cost benefit analysis. In 2009, Government of Liberia decided to invest in an energy initiative to generate energy for the diverse consumption. In this case studydiscusses qualitative economic evaluation of three different options considered for the energy initiatives. The study was aimed at finding the relative feasibility of available options based on the opinion of people. For this purpose, instead of using cost benefit analysis method, Itemized Scalesurvey technique was used to ascertain the economic feasibility of options. Case study contains useful and pertinent policy lessons for implementation.
O22|Is fiscal policy stationary in China? A regional study by local government|In this study, we apply a stationarity test with a flexible Fourier function proposed by Enders and Lee (2012) to test the stationarity of the deficit–GDP ratio in China. We find that our approximation has a higher power to detect U-shaped breaks and to smooth breaks than the linear method if the true data-generating process of the deficit–GDP ratio convergence is, in fact, a stationary non-linear process. The results show that the stationarity for fiscal policy varies across different regions and that the deficit–GDP ratio of half of the regions is stationary. The results related to the budget structural balance and the fiscal deficit indicate no expansion in the Eastern and Central regions. We find that China's provinces in these two regions meet the stability theory of fiscal policy in the current stage of development. The deficit–GDP ratio is not stationary in the Western and Northeastern regions. These results indicate that the fiscal deficits in these regions are expanding and cannot be controlled by automatic market adjustment, and the government should therefore avoid deficit expansion in favor of a balanced budget policy.
O22|A real options model to evaluate the effect of environmental policies on the oil sands rate of expansion|Canadian oil sands hold the third largest recognized oil deposit in the world. While the rapidly expanding oil sands industry in western Canada has driven economic growth, the extraction of the oil comes at a significant environmental cost. It is believed that the government policies have failed to keep up with the rapid oil sands expansion, creating serious challenges in managing the environmental impacts. This paper presents a practical, yet financially sound, real options model to evaluate the rate of oil sands expansion, under different environmental cost scenarios resulting from governmental policies, while accounting for oil price uncertainty and managerial flexibilities. Our model considers a multi-plant/multi-agent setting, in which labor costs increase for all agents and impact their optimal strategies, as new plants come online. Our results show that a stricter environmental cost scenario delays investment, but leads to a higher rate of expansion once investment begins. Once constructed, a plant is highly unlikely to shut down. Our model can be used by government policy makers, to gauge the impact of policy strategies on the oil sands expansion rate, and by oil companies, to evaluate expansion strategies based on assumptions regarding market and taxation costs.
O22|The impact of Oportunidades on human capital and income distribution in Mexico: A top-down/bottom-up approach|To analyze the effects of the Mexican Oportunidades conditional cash transfer program on school attendance and household income distribution, this paper links a microeconometric simulation model and a general equilibrium model in a bidirectional way, so to explicitly take spillover effects of the program into account. Our results suggest that partial equilibrium analysis alone underestimates the distributional effects of the program. Extending the coverage of the program to the poor increases school attendance, reduces child labor supply, and increases the equilibrium wages of children who remain at work. With a relatively low fiscal cost, Mexican social policy could further reduce income inequality and poverty.
O22|Tehnike kompetitivne analize|Osmišljavajući integralni pristup kompetitivnoj analizi uočili smo potrebu ostvarenja sinergijskog učinka primjene različitih analitičkih tehnika nad istim poslovnim problemskim prostorom. Pritom smo uočili problem primjene ekspertnog znanja. Eksperti pojedinog poslovnog problemskog prostora vrlo su podložni učinku ustrajnosti s obzirom na to da se mentalni sklop brzo formira, ali teško mijenja. Posljedica jest asimiliranje novih činjenica u prvobitnu sliku sve dok one ne postanu značajno kontradiktorne s prvobitnom percepcijom te dok ta kontradikcija ne postane toliko očigledna da se nametne svijesti eksperta. To znači da će početna percepcija, iako možda netočna, odolijevati promjeni s obzirom na to da je količina informacija potrebna za pobijanje hipoteze značajno veća od količine koja je potrebna za početnu interpretaciju. Tražeći rješenje navedenog problema naišli smo na nove probleme: emocionalnu dimenziju naših misli i odluka; utjecaj mentalnih prečaca podsvijesti na svjesno razmišljanje; nagonsko promatranje okoline u obliku obrazaca; podložnost predrasudama i pretpostavkama i instinktivno oslanjanje na njih; tendenciju donošenja preuranjenog zaključka na temelju prepoznavanja sličnosti između trenutačne i neke prijašnje situacije; potrebu iznalaženja objašnjenje za sve, bez obzira na to jesu li ta objašnjenja precizna i točna; traženje i prikupljanje činjenica koje podupiru naša uvjerenja i prosudbe uz istovremeno izbjegavanje onih činjenica koje ih ne podupiru; sklonost pridržavanju neistinitih uvjerenja unatoč kontradiktornim dokazima i dr. Rješenje svih navedenih problema omogućuju strukturirane analitičke tehnike pomažući identificirati i razbiti restriktivne mentalne sklopove koji onemogućuju otvaranje prema novim spoznajama i prihvaćanje alternativnih rješenja.
O22|Multicriteria Evaluation of Urban Regeneration Plans for Social Housing Neighbourhoods|This paper presents a methodology to assess regeneration plans for social housing neighbourhoods through measurement of key performance indicators. This tool furnishes an integrated view of urban design principles, environment and energy saving, and social needs by means of the community’s participation in the decision-making process. The CMap tool and the ANP were useful in depicting the complexity of the links connecting objectives, targets and indicators. Interviews with the stakeholders and experts involved in regeneration plans established the bases for the assessment. The ANP was then applied to a public estate in Milan in order to evaluate two alternative Master Plans.
O22|Projecting Future Insured Coastal Flooding Damages with Climate Change|Estimates of future damages from climate change in coastal areas are of growing interest for climate change research and policy-making. A newly-developed methodology is applied to estimate total insured coastal damages with climate change for the period 2025-2085 in New York State, USA. Total damages without adaptation include future insured damages from economic growth and additional damages from climate change due to increases in flood frequency, based on two sea level rise scenarios. Data and methodological issues are discussed, and a comparison with the results of a metro New York City flood damage study using different data and methods is presented.
O22|Designing Experiments to Measure Spillover Effects|This paper formalizes the design of experiments intended specifically to study spillover effects. By first randomizing the intensity of treatment within clusters and then randomly assigning individual treatment conditional on this cluster-level intensity, a novel set of treatment effects can be identified. We develop a formal framework for consistent estimation of these effects, and provide explicit expressions for power calculations. We show that the power to detect average treatment effects declines precisely with the quantity that identifies the novel treatment effects. A demonstration of the technique is provided using a cash transfer program in Malawi.
O22|Evaluating the Impact of Cluster Development Programs|Do the programs that aim to promote and develop industry clusters (also known as Cluster Development Programs, or CDP) work? Do they have an impact on enterprise development? This paper offers an insight into the methods that can help answer these fundamental questions through solid quantitative evidence. In general, results will depend on the level of coordination that is achieved and on the actions undertaken as a result of improved coordination and strategy-setting of the relevant actors. The techniques of Social Network Analysis (SNA) can be employed to assess the evolution of coordination among cluster actors, with the requirement that network indicators are observed before and after the implementation of the CDPs. While this particular analysis can assist in monitoring and assessing the process of coordination and its changes throughout the program, other qualitative and contextual information can also assist in interpreting the data and, thus, increase the reliability of results. However, in order to properly assess the impact of CDPs, their causality needs to be explored further by the application of additional quantitative methods. In fact, the effects cannot be attributed to the program itself, unless a proper counterfactual is built in, such as what would have happened to the beneficiaries in the absence of the program. By definition, this particular counterfactual cannot be observed, but the application of experimental and quasi-experimental techniques can help construct control groups of non-beneficiaries to approximate the counterfactual and assess the evidence with econometric techniques. Furthermore, a detailed observation of cases and specific interviews can help regarding the interpretation of results derived from these methods. The quantitative tools discussed herein are indeed complementary and not alternatives, with each applied as a means to strengthen the explanatory capacity of the other. Each tool requires specific and challenging data analysis that can be achieved with careful resource planning and the appropriate team skill set. The overarching objective is to build new and solid evidence on the effectiveness of CPDs and their respective policies.
O22|Social Network Analysis Methodologies for the Evaluation of Cluster Development Programs|Cluster development programs (CDPs) have been adopted widely in many countries worldwide. Many such programs aim to promote economic development by forming and strengthening inter-organizational networks. Despite their widespread diffusion, we know very little about CDP outputs or the impact CDPs have on host regions and their populations. Evaluation studies are beginning to appear, but the overall concern is that a distinct evaluation concept and method with a focus on CDPs is not yet available. The objective of this paper is to address this limitation, by proposing a novel methodological approach in the evaluation of CDPs based on the application of concepts and methods of social network analysis (SNA).
O22|Towards FET Concept: Pathway To Evaluation Of Foresight Effectiveness, Efficiency And Validity|The increasing diversity and interdisciplinary nature of science and technology in a globalised world are exerting mounting pressure on national research and innovation locations to develop clear profiles. Among many instruments to meet this challenge is the systematic analysis and continual monitoring of scientific, societal and technological trends – often done using Foresight. Foresight is expected to provide a reliable basis for the future structuring and profiling of the national research and innovation landscape. Foresight is a complex process which is also reflected in the discussion of the effectiveness, efficiency and validity of Foresight. In the recent years various aspects of Foresight evaluation have seen researchers’ attention across different national and corporate schools of Foresight. Ranging from Foresight exercises’ impact assessment (measuring effectiveness and efficiency of Foresight – summative evaluation) to results verification (validation, windtunelling / wind tunnel testing of Foresight – normative evaluation), separate approaches to the problem at hand exist. However, academic and professional literature on the specific topic is rare, as a problem of openness of methodologies also exists. Aside from these factors, there seems to be a consensus that Foresight science is actively developing and there currently are many gaps in available evaluation methods, which brings us to looking further into the supposed gaps. The paper discusses in depth the effectiveness and efficiency in the light of Foresight and the meaning of both for the validity of Foresight.
O22|Self-Managing Teams in Agile Project Management – Pain or gain|Due to an increasingly dynamic global environment with a high unpredictability, the classical project management approach in software development changed. New agile methods were introduced which promise a faster, cheaper, and better software development with on-time, and on-budget delivery of the agreed scope. Core of the agile approach are self-managing teams, where the team members are empowered to manage their tasks themselves. The new form of team organization promises many benefits. Based on a literature review, the paper provides an insight into the basics of selfmanaging teams. It furthermore provides an evaluation of the approach, considering benefits and limitations. The aim of the paper is to come to a final judgment, if self-managing teams in agile project management should be considered as pain or gain.
O22|Analytics-Based Management Of Information Systems|Information technologies penetrate virtually every division in contemporary organizations. Organizations deploy a spectrum of information technologies with aim of alleviating operating efficiency. Knowledge workers increasingly depend on deployed information systems to accomplish their tasks. Well-deployed and managed information systems have a potential to increase effectiveness and efficiency in organizations; whereas poorly deployed and managed systems may have significant negative impact. Strategic deployment and management of information systems play the key roles in attaining beneficial impacts for organizations. Conventionally, information technology managers have relied primarily on tacit knowledge. Such knowledge and experiences have been accumulated over a number of years. However, information technologies progress at a rapid pace and early adopters gain considerable strategic advantages. Information technology managers cannot afford spending years accumulating tacit knowledge. Viable solution to this problem is to adopt an analytics-based management. We explore pertinent aspects of analytics-based management of information systems in organizations.
O22|The Impact of Agricultural Extension for Improved Management Practices: An Evaluation of the Uruguayan Livestock Program|Management is an important input into agricultural production, as it a determinant of the uptake and proper implementation of productive technologies and practices. While there is a large literature on evaluations of extension programs meant to improve management practices in agricultural development, there is no consensus on the extension modalities that are most effective. This paper adds to the literature on extension interventions by evaluating the Uruguayan Livestock Program (ULP), a publicly funded, privately delivered extension program designed to improve management practices among cattle breeders. Using an eight year panel constructed by combining data from the Uruguayan livestock traceability system with a registry of ULP participants, we place bounds on the impact of the program on production and sales of calves by ULP beneficiaries using inverse probability weights estimated using propensity scores for selection into the ULP and selection into the dataset. Results show that the ULP increased calf production by between 11.36 and 15.3 calves on average in 2009 and 2010 and increased calf sales minus purchases by 4.35 on average over the same time span. Internal rates of return suggest these are moderately sized economic impacts. We examine the aspects of the ULP's design that might account for its positive but modest effects.
O22|User right as a mezzanine capital investment: Innovations in infrastructure debt financing|"Bank-led infrastructure financing in India has subsided in a reflection of the micro-prudential risks faced by banks. Bond-based financing is constrained by an incomplete bond market. Foreign borrowing is particularly inappropriate as it forces currency mismatch upon infrastructure projects. In the search for innovative methods of infrastructure financing this paper introduces the possibility of ""User right"" as one component of infrastructure financing. The key insight is to harness users, from amongst the universe of investors, as financiers with a high yield tradeable debt instrument that derives its value from a rebate on user charges. Liquidity would come about through trading at exchanges, which would yield a liquidity premium. Users as bond-holders would have the incentive to perform monitoring functions, which would enhance accountability. Public interest vested in public infrastructure may improve existing institutional mechanism."
O22|Appraisal of Research Infrastructures: Approaches, methods and practical implications|Reflecting the growing importance taken by research infrastructures (RIs) and especially large ones (“Big Science”), there is increasing concern about the way these are selected for public funding and appraised, an issue that takes a specific relevance in the context of the current public spending constraint. The objective of this paper is to review international practices in RI projects selection and appraisal. In particular it accounts for the development of new evaluation approaches and tools mobilising quantitative and systematic methods that illustrate a shift away from traditional methods relying on peer review. It finds that “roadmaps” or systematic strategic planning of RIs make increasing recourse to quantitative indicators besides the “science case”. Also, even if still rare, there are examples of RIs selection processes based on a comparison of costs and benefits, as well as comprehensive approaches resorting to quantitative indicators adopted to monitor and assess RIs. In this context, cost benefit analysis emerges as a promising decision-making tool which needs however tailored techniques to account for the specificities of socio-economic benefits generated by RIs.
O22|Local and Global Measures for Success and Reconstructive Determination of the Optimal Number of Partners in European Educational Projects|"The present study is based on real data of 306 project proposals submitted for funding in 2013. The distribution of the project proposals by the countries of initiation and partnering countries is specifically considered in relation to the quality of the established consortia. A quality indicator is defined that determines whether a given project has the appropriate quality/characteristics to meet the predefined quality requirements/criteria. On the basis of this indicator local and global measures for quantification of the project’s success are introduced. The local and global measures for success along with the results obtained by ""Quality of the consortium"" evaluation criterion are used to calculate the statistical evaluation and the reconstruction of the optimal number of partners in a consortium, ensuring success of the project application. The presented data were analysed by methods of applied statistics and relevant findings were made about the discussed topic and guidelines for further research and development are given."
O22|A Method for Choosing a Project's Planned Value Curve by Integrating Earned Value and Risk Management|The timely and precise feedback is of crucial importance for the success of every project. It allows identifying the problems at an early stage and performing corrective actions that help keeping the initially planned costs and time of the project on schedule. Nowadays Earned Value Management is known as one of the most effective methods for the performance measurement of projects. At the same time it uses the fundamental principle that the models and trends of the past can be used to determine the future status. As both Earned Value Management (EVM) and Risk Management (RM) are directed towards solving the same problem – measuring a project’s performance by providing information that is used for a basis for making informed decisions and taking actions, there is a considerable interest in the possibility of developing a combined approach and creating a synergy between them, given their different point of view - while EVM is based on the past, RM is directed towards the future. Currently in practice EVM and RM function as parallel processes without systematic integration. Most of the discussions on the relationship between them are rather theoretical and are addressed to the key principles underlying the two techniques. In this regard the aim of this article is to present the opportunity of these two management approaches to be integrated, given their common intent to explore and reveal the driving forces of the project performance. The study will provide a methodology that will assist the selection of one of the key figures in the theory of EVM - the basic project plan. This methodology is based on historical data from completed projects, as well as on simulation methods that generate possible project outcomes.
O22|Projects to Increase Physical Security at Commercial Banks|The article discusses current issues related to the operation of commercial banks in Bulgaria. The increase in the number of bank robberies and a number of other threats to banking security dictate the need for increased physical protection. The article offers a methodology based on which you can develop projects to improve the physical security of banks and by that to increase their goodwill . The article successively describes the process of analyzing the environment, risk assessment, development and evaluation of projects in their specificity.
O22|Monitoring and Evaluation of Climate Change Adaptation: Methodological Approaches|This paper explores methodological approaches that can be used to monitor and evaluate climate change adaptation initiatives at the projects and programme levels. It examines approaches that have been used in other areas of development practice to see what lessons have been learned that can inform the development of monitoring and evaluation frameworks targeted at adaptation. The paper focuses on three methodological challenges related to monitoring and evaluation that are particularly relevant for adaptation: i) assessing attribution, ii) establishing baselines and targets, and iii) dealing with long time horizons. The paper also considers the importance of on-going learning in evaluation and the benefit of applying a comprehensive approach to monitoring and evaluation, building on tested practices from participatory methods and social sciences techniques. Ce rapport analyse les approches méthodologiques utilisables pour suivre et évaluer les initiatives d’adaptation au changement climatique mises en oeuvre au niveau des projets ou des programmes. Il examine les approches adoptées dans d’autres domaines d’action en faveur du développement afin de cerner, parmi les enseignements qui en ont été tirés, ceux qui pourraient éclairer l’élaboration de cadres de suivi et d’évaluation visant l’adaptation. Le rapport met l’accent sur trois enjeux méthodologiques du suivi et de l’évaluation qui s’avèrent particulièrement intéressants du point de vue de l’adaptation : i) évaluer l’attribution, ii) établir des niveaux de référence et des objectifs, et iii) travailler avec des horizons temporels lointains. Il aborde également l’importance que revêt l’apprentissage continu dans l’évaluation, ainsi que l’avantage que présente une approche globale du suivi et de l’évaluation, fondée sur des pratiques éprouvées qui relèvent de méthodes participatives et de techniques des sciences sociales.
O22|Restoration And Sustainable Valorization Of Cultural Heritage And Regional Policy In North-West Region Of Romania. Case Study Of Revitalization Of The Oradea Fortress|The paper presents cultural heritage, cultural tourism potential of North-West Region of Romania face to face with restoration and sustainable valorization of cultural heritage as a major domain of intervention of regional policy in Romania. Due to Romanian regionalization form, the Regional Operational Programme (ROP) is currently the only programme of regional policy in Romania in 2007-2013. One of the major domains of intervention of ROP 2007-2013 in Romania was restoration and sustainable valorization of cultural heritage. The first paper specific objective is to explore projects contracted until 31.12.2013 in the field of restoration and sustainable valorization of cultural heritage in North-West Region of Romania and their regional development relevance in the context of existing regional development strategies. The second paper specific objective is to present a model of restoration of cultural heritage in a sustainable way throughout the case study of Revitalization of the Oradea Fortress in order to introduce it in the tourism circuit - that could become an example for other cultural sites around the region and a succes story in the field of cultural tourism based of ROP 2007-2013 experience. Exploring rich cultural heritage of the North-West Region face to face with poor condition of cultural heritage sites and investments required in order to introduce them in touristic circuit, the paper concludes that all contracted projects are relevant for sustainable valorization of regional cultural heritage and cultural tourism potential in the context of existing regional development strategies, but they contributed only partially to regional specific needs. Also, the paper concludes that number of ROP 2007-2013 projects implemented in the field of cultural heritage is surprisingly small, area of interest of these projects is rather narrow and analyzes the most important causes for these gaps. Based on the case study presented, the paper suggests that a combination between devoting substantial own resources, perseverance and innovativeness in implementing and promoting projects could be an important condition for success for highly expensive, long lasting and highly innovative cultural heritage projects.
O22|Reducing Delivery Times Of Products Using Dmaic Methodology|The global market is a challenge for Croatian companies because the current business paradigm applied in the domestic market can hardly be applied globally. Faced with changing customer demand and increased competition, companies in the manufacturing sector have continued to question the production processes and continuously improve them if they want to survive in the global market and keep pace advantages over market competitors. One way of questioning, enhancement and improvement of existing business systems is DMAIC methodology. This paper presents the application of the DMAIC methodology to a product that has lost its market position. Although the product price was competitive, the delivery times of products for customer were too long. To solve this problem, observed business entity starts DMAIC project of improvement operations. The project covers all functional units and their operating procedures, and the end result of the project activities were new working procedures. Changing its operating modes observed business entity is able to shorten delivery times and win new geographical segments of the global market without additional financial investment.
O22|Web Technologies Development Supporting Contemporary Project Management Needs|During the last two decades, projects have become increasingly important and recognizable tools for achieving competitiveness, strategic aims and much needed positive changes. The consequence of this, among other things, is the growing number of projects which emerge and are carried out in all business systems around the world. With the growing number of projects, there arose the need for trained project managers. In order to successfully do their tasks, it is very important for project managers to know and understand various techniques and methods of project management. The rate at which the number of formally trained project managers is growing and the dynamics of their adaptation to the specifi cities of today’s business environment is still insuffi cient. Development of user-friendly IT support tools which would enable project managers to successfully implement projects without previous very long and intense project training imposes itself as a possible and increasingly available solution to the above mention problem. The development of IT technology and software increased enormously in the last decade. The emergence of Web 2.0 technology finds new solutions, very useful and applicable also in the field of project management. These options are currently still underutilized by companies when dealing with projects. Capabilities of existing and emerging solutions of Web 2.0 development and the open source community create important value and the potential to increase the efficiency of project management.The emergence of the Semantic Web (Web 3.0) currently being developed and implemented, with its innovations and technologies based on semantic and artificial intelligence, is expected to greatly change the present concepts of doing business. In the paper we will analyze the importance and possibilities arising from new web technologies (especially Web 2.0 and Web 3.0) when dealing with project management issues.
O22|Does the Heterogeneity of Project Implementers Affect the Programme Participation of Beneficiaries?: Evidence from Rural Cambodia| This study employs the dataset collected for the assessment of a post-harvest technology project in rural Cambodia and focuses on the heterogeneous preferences of project implementers, frequently overlooked in the literature on programme evaluation studies. We focus on the ‘implementer effect’ on the programme participation of the treated farmers. We demonstrate that the heterogeneous programme participation of ordinary farmers could be induced due to heterogeneity in the characteristics of the project staff. In particular, we indicate that the baseline altruism of the project staff, measured by the dictator game, consistently increases the participation rate and the number of participations in the training sessions of beneficiaries. This type of heterogeneity in project staffs’ preferences across treatment sites could be a source of treatment heterogeneity for programmes conducted at a certain cluster level. While few studies have focused on the heterogeneity of programme implementers, our empirical results indicate that the preference of implementers could be a source of treatment heterogeneity and imply the importance of implementation of an actual project.
O22|Designing Experiments to Measure Spillover Effects|This paper formalizes the design of experiments intended specifically to study spillover effects. By first randomizing the intensity of treatment within clusters and then randomly assigning individual treatment conditional on this cluster-level intensity, a novel set of treatment effects can be identified. We develop a formal framework for consistent estimation of these effects, and provide explicit expressions for power calculations. We show that the power to detect average treatment effects declines precisely with the quantity that identifies the novel treatment effects. A demonstration of the technique is provivded using a cash transfer program in Malawi.

O22|Index Insurance and Cash Transfers: A Comparative Analysis from Northern Kenya|Cash transfers and index insurance have become popular interventions by development agencies worldwide. But they operate in radically different ways. In principle, these could offer complementary or substitute means of improving households’ well-being, both through direct payments and through induced behavioral change. Surprisingly, little is known about these programs’ comparative impacts on participant behavior or well-being, nor about their prospective interactions. This paper exploits four years of household panel data from northern Kenya, where the government launched a Hunger Safety Net Program (HSNP) offering cash transfers just prior to the commercial launch of an index-based livestock insurance (IBLI) product. By exploiting the known selection mechanism behind HSNP participation and the randomization of IBLI extension education and premium discounts, we are able to make novel comparisons of the causal impacts of each type of program among the same population at the same time, which spans a catastrophic drought. We find that both programs benefit participants, but there is no evidence of positive synergies between the two programs. HSNP participation increases the likelihood that a household maintains mobility, an important pastoral production strategy, and improves child health, as indicated by a mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). IBLI coverage increases expenditures on livestock health services, milk production, MUAC, and income per adult equivalent. Standardizing the estimated benefits by total program costs reveals that the two programs perform comparably, while from a marginal cost perspective the IBLI program has impacts per unit of expenditure at least an order of magnitude greater than HSNP.
O22|Techno-Economic Factors Affecting Genetic Investment in Dairy Cattle in Egypt|Vertical expansion in Egyptian livestock is the only feasible approach for development, particularly, milk production. This is due to lack of natural range, enough feed supply and competition between food production and feed production in using the very limited water resources supply and irrigated agricultural land in Egypt. In addition, Egypt has a comparative advantage in milk production. However, the milk yield of the domestic cattle is still much below the world average. Vertical expansion means to raise the productivity, via genetic investment. The study used a field sample survey data to apply a designed mathematical investment flow model up to fifth calving of the dam's daughter, to test the impact of a set of technical and economic factors on the predicted economic rate of return (ERR) of the genetic improvement via an artificial insemination (A.I) program of the domestic dairy cattle. The results showed that (ERR) at the most probable level of both economic and productive variables was 23.3%, when A.I. of a sire's semen with PDM around 865 Kg of mill was applied, which was much higher than the average interest rate in Egyptian market (14%) and the inflation rate in milk price (11%). If the genetic improvement faced 10% increase in the number of services for conception, age at first calving and calving interval, the ERR decreased by 6%. An increase in the feed costs by 10% regressed the ERR by 7%. A 10% increase in the number of service for conception, age at first calving and the calving interval decreased the ERR by 3.1%, 2% and 1.1%, respectively. Such model is suitable for assessment of the feasibility of genetic improvement programs in developing countries
O22|Prostorová koherence národní a evropské regionální politiky: poznatky z České republiky a Slovenska<BR>[Spatial Coherence of National and European Regional Policy: The Insights from the Czech Republic and Slovakia]|This paper deals with the spatial relationship between national and European regional policies. Spatial coherence of these two types of policies in two CEE countries - in the Czech Republic and Slovakia - is discussed. Our findings point at a higher spatial coherence of national and European regional policy in Slovakia. Thus, there is a higher financial allocation per 1 inhabitant in the nationally delimitated areas of special interest in Slovakia compared with the Czech Republic. Three aspects are discussed in this regard. First, different strategies of the delimitation of the areas of special interest in the both countries are emphasised. Second, different strategies of the implementation of the areas of special interest in programming documents in the both countries are upheld. Third, the factor of territorial absorption capacity is mentioned. We claim that the three aspects should be considered in achieving a higher spatial coherence of national and European regional policies.
O22|The contribution of Action Research to policy learning: The case of Gipuzkoa Sarean|This article is about a six year policy learning process named Gipuzkoa Sarean in the Basque province of Gipuzkoa. In the article we reflect on how action research contributed to policy learning. The process consists of three stages: 2009-2011: Initiation of the project and development of a work method / 2011-2013: Government learning and organisational change / 2013-2014: Social learning and the shift to a new approach to territorial development. For each stage we describe the background and main goal of the research project, the participants in policy learning, the work method and agenda, the status and roles of policy makers and researchers and the results. Our reflections on-action are used to discuss the conditions for social learning. Our argument is that the distinction between practice and praxis is crucial for understanding the conditions for social learning. Our use of the concept praxis is inspired by Paulo Freire and we interpret it as the connection of reflection and action in the same phase of the process. If they are separated into theory and practice they do not create the conditions for social learning in a policy process. They might create outcomes, such as recipes for policy or political discourses, but not social learning.
O22|The Need of Project Capabilities in Project Based Organizations|Whereas in functional organizations projects are used to drive special business activities, in project based organizations the project is the main business activity. They are characterized by a flexible and innovative form of executing projects in a dynamic and uncertain environment. In this paper an overview is given about the special characteristics of project based organizations and their success factors. From this the need for project capabilities is derived, as they are the source to reach the success factors. The close connection between success factors of project based organizations and the establishment of project capabilities is therefore developed. Then the question of how project capabilities can be build is addressed. Especially explanatory and exploitative learning methods are examined for this. The paper draws special attention to theoretical frameworks for capability building. A thorough understanding of this topic shows the necessity of building capabilities and future specialized research for practical work.
O22|Main problems in the project management and the method of six thinking hats as possible solution|Nowadays, project management is divided in two thinking sides like fashion or passion. Both sides forget the main purpose of project management, to use PM methods for activities that have the nature of the project, which leads to problems. The traditional approach to PM establishes the main problems in areas like human attitudes, organizational shortcomings, supply’s gap, professional deficiencies, financial problems, time framework’s problems and technological issues. All are discussed in paper. The six thinking method used here could provide us looking at the problem from different angles, presented positive and negative arguments, which leads to a deeper understanding of problem. It is possible to solve problems also from other point of view, this is showed on more practical approach, where are solved problems like: client often changes the requirements, communication with client is very slow, delay on start of project and the main problem – spending lots of time by solving problems during the life of project.
O22|The Role of Human Resources in Project Management|This paper is about how Human Resource Management (HRM) impacts project management. Human Resources in Project Management focus on Project Team recruitment, organization and management until the end of a given project. Its role starts from defining core competencies which are going to be needed, to team building and motivation. The interest is to understand how an executive function can impact Project Management. It is as interesting as Human Resource is a function for which I feel a particular affection. The link between Human Resource Management and Project Management is strategic. Both of them are useful for company competitiveness. Human Resources are the key of every work done within a company as they represent people. Project Management is measured by the different project success that can represent benefit, innovation or any improvement. It appears that project success require success in team project management, which is the HR function. Three main processes are taken into account: selecting, training and managing. They represent the layers of the Human Resources overall role in Project Management. They are described and analyzed while raising their key issues that have to be faced.
O22|Connecting South Asia to Southeast Asia: Cross-Border Infrastructure Investments|Most of the trade between South Asia and Southeast Asia is by sea. However, with improved infrastructure and easier border crossing procedures, land traffic could grow to boost trade in goods, services, and tourism between the subregions. The purpose of the study is to analyze how to strengthen connectivity between the two subregions. Specifically, it is concerned with the role of cross-border transport infrastructure investments to improve connectivity. The author reviews all possible road and rail land corridors that would help create seamless transport connectivity. Missing gaps and corresponding transport infrastructure projects are identified, and projects are screened and prioritized. For the selected critical projects, the study recommends phased investments.
O22|Politiche per la montagna in Emilia-Romagna: valutazione di 13 progetti di sviluppo dell’Appennino Bolognese|This paper presents a summary of the evaluation process of 13 local development projects funded by the Carisbo Foundation in the Bologna Apennines during the period 2007-2009. The evaluation process was carried out in parallel with the implementation of the Framework Agreement, thus helping to spread a proper “culture of evaluation” among local authorities and private operators. This culture is needed to support the transition to a good governance model based on the accountability of the public entities entitled to carry out local development projects in mountain regions and on cooperation between all involved agents operating in these specific areas.
O22|Furthering the use and scope of the Project Implementation Profile (PIP): Critical success factors for small scale livestock production foreign aid projects|Success factors have been extensively studied in the field of project management. The PIP (Project Implementation Profile), designed by Pinto & Slevin, is often used as an assessment method enabling project managers to identify critical success factors either at the beginning or at the end of projects. The PIP has been used mainly in the fields of construction and hi-tech development. Recently, adaptations of the PIP have been tested in other fields including foreign aid projects. The aim of this paper is to study the applicability of the PIP in the case of a small scale livestock production project conducted in a rural area of the Democratic Republic of Congo. A case study approach was used to assess the relative importance of each of the criteria outlined by Pinto & Slevin and to identify dimensions specific to the field of foreign aid projects which were not considered in the PIP. Results indicated that the PIP by itself does not take into account all the factors which are critical to achieve success in this field. Two essential dimensions must be added to encompass all the critical success factors: 1) the benevolent nature of many foreign aid projects which precludes in part formalization within a strict contractual approach; 2) the added risk factors which must be controlled when dealing with livestock production and human well-being as outputs. An adapted version of the PIP is proposed with the aim of generalizing its use both as an assessment tool and as a foreign aid project design framework.
O22|Abandonment of Capital Investments and Survival of Small and Medium Enterprises: Evidence from Nigeria|This paper presents empirical evidence on the impact of abandonment of capital investments on the survival of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria. It employs mixed methodological framework to question the extent to which abandonment of capital investments affects the performance of SMEs in five districts in Lagos. The study adopted survey inferential design. A total of 250 questionnaires were administered to different sets of enterprises, out of which 220 valid responses were received representing 88 per cent. Moreover, judgmental sampling technique was adopted for the purpose of this study. To validate or give further support to the results from specific data sources, triangulation method was used. This method includes both qualitative and quantitative phases. Content validity was adopted. Data gathered from the questionnaire were analysed with the aid of descriptive statistical techniques (such as standard deviation and arithmetic mean) and inferential statistical techniques (Regression analysis and ANOVA). Furthermore, multivariate analysis of factor analysis and its constituent tests were equally employed. Findings related to the study clearly show that the performance of SMEs is characterised by numerous problems including: lack of proper and effective capital budgeting mechanism, failure to access loan, lack of funds, strict banking policies, unethical business practices, lack of stable business policy, among others. The study also discovers that poor capital budgeting practice impacts on the survival of SMEs in Nigeria. The main contribution of this paper to knowledge lies in capital budgeting decision and abandonment option. This has strengthened our understanding that abandonment of capital investments is a critical factor in explaining SMEs survival in Nigeria.
O22|Identifier et limiter les risques des interventions agricoles sur la nutrition|Agricultural development status impact individual nutrition through food, health and care practices. Many recent studies are focused on the positive side of the impact pathways. However, in some cases, those interventions may have negative outcomes on nutrition. We explore those potential negative outcomes based on a review of scientific papers and institutional reports as well as expert interviews. We identify six categories of risks related to incomes, prices, types of products, women social status and workload, sanitary environment and inequalities. ....French Abstract : Les interventions de développement agricole affectent la nutrition des individus via l’alimentation, la santé et les pratiques de soin.

O22|The harmony of programs package: Quasi-experimental evidence on deworming and canteen interventions in rural Senegal|This paper uses a unique and large-scale quasi-experimental data to study the effect of deworming and school meals programs as a package on educational outcomes pupils test scores aggregate, French or math; enrollment, promotion or dropout rates in rural Senegal. We extend the endogenous selection model la Heckman to incorporate a double-index selection mechanism. We also generalize the Roy model accordingly. We develop estimation strategies based on the full information maximum likelihood and the two-step method. We derive a wide and rich collection of treatment effects ranging from exclusive to relative effects including sequential and substitution effects. The results show that the combination of deworming and school meals programs is more beneficial to pupils achievements than taking programs separately. The sequence of implementation does matter. The two programs are complementary in increasing scores and promotion rates. However, they are substitutes in reducing dropouts. The cost-effectiveness analysis shows the deworming program is by far cheaper than the meals intervention. Implementing meals program before deworming is more cost-effective than the reverse. Lastly, unlike the deworming, meals program and the package deworming and meals have a welfare-enhancing effect on households.
O22|Development of a Methodology of Evaluation of Financial Stability of Commercial Banks|The field of evaluation of financial stability of commercial banks, which emanates from persistent existence of financial crisis, induces interest of researchers for over a century. The span of prevailing methodologies stretches from over-simplified risk-return approaches to ones comprising large number of economic variables on the micro- and/or macro-economic level. Methodologies of rating agencies and current methodologies reviewed and applied by the ECB are not intended for reducing information asymmetry in the market of commercial banks. In the paper it is shown that the Lithuanian financial system is bank-based with deposits of households being its primary sources, and its stability is primarily depending on behavior of depositors. A methodology of evaluation of commercial banks with features of decreasing information asymmetry in the market of commercial banks is being developed by comparing different MCDA methods.
O22|Toolkit to estimate the organizational structure of Arctic industrial complexes|"Severe climatic conditions, low population density, lack of infrastructure leave as the only possible nodular economic development of Arctic territories of the Russian Federation. In this case, a natural question arises: how to define points of growth, how to delineate those ""patches of economic activity""? In today's economic conditions, growth points for Arctic territories will be resource projects. Analysis of the mineral complex projects in terms of minerals markets, as well as alternative approaches of transportation and energy supply stands for the main objective of the study. Necessity of active use of administrative and financial resources of the state, interdependence of projects and other characteristics of the new Arctic industrial complexes allow a methodological analogy with the classical TPC-approach. Proposed by the author earlier the system of arctic aqua territorial production complexes in this paper develops in the direction of the internal structure justification. At the first stage priority projects were highlighted and second stage projects listed. Then different variants of their realization were modeled. The constructed simulation model allows a comparison of costs and effects for business, regions and Russian Federation as a whole. Investment costs certainly will need to be distributed between actors of regional development, as conditions of economic activity require a widescreen public-private partnership in the Arctic. For the convenience of variant evaluation a ""situation room"" (specific interface of the model) was designed, the calculation results were visualized on the map. For justification of state expenses into Arctic infrastructure serve geostrategic factors. However, share of state participation required in terms of the commercial attractiveness of the projects could be defined in the simulation model framework. In this study effectiveness of various instruments of state support was estimated, the amount of government subsidies for domestic raw material supplies from said objects was calculated. The model includes blocks of individual projects, as well as built relationships within industrial complexes. With its help options of internal structure of the Taimyr-Yakutsk ATPC were evaluated. The priority projects here are Tomtorskoe field of complex niobium and rare earth ores and Popigai field of industrial diamonds. Having a wide range of applications in high-tech industries, those could give rise to the Russia' innovative development. It was determined that the priority transport infrastructure projects should be: ports Uriing-Khaya, Hatanga, Yenisei-NSR system objects, on deposits should be organized decentralized energy supply - separate electric station with diesel fuel. Also found that using the redistribution of effects the competition of neighboring regions for investment resources should be neutralized - the Krasnoyarsk Territory (as the leading party) and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The author recommends the correction of development programs of the Russian Arctic regions based on the above aspects."
O22|Intra and extra regional openness: The role of ?trust? builders as Open Innovation Intermediaries|The role of intermediaries in innovation processes has been analyzed in the literature from a dual point of view of the firm`s performances. Being considered actors involved in the knowledge diffusion and technology transfer, intermediaries are considered collaborators of small and large enterprises, as active members of industrial policy. Intermediaries are supposed to be capable of developing a variety of activities such as partners identifying, technology selection, supplier's election, or counsel in decisions making process. Besides this, the state of the art has deeply analyzed the role of public and private organizations as intermediaries, focusing on different perspectives of the innovation process. A diversity of names can be identified in the literature to refer to these intermediaries. However, the performance of these players is considered fuzzy, taking into account the potential they could achieve. In this research, a case study is proposed, where the figure of Agents of Proximity is presented. These agents perform voluntary work in developing projects of technological optimization of the firms they work with. Firstly, in order to improve the individual competitiveness of those firms. Secondly, knitting relationships between firms settle in the region they work in, in order to improve the competitiveness of the territory. These agents are people, the economic players have confidence in, mainly because of the careers these proximity actors have developed. This figure is contrasted in the region of Durango, in the Basque country (Spain). The county has a strong specialization in the metal-mechanical industry, with a high orientation towards the automotive market. The crisis has highly impacted on the region with job destruction and SMEs closures. This has generated a inter-territorial cooperation movement between inner existing players of the county: Productive subsystem, -where the value chain firms can be identified-, Knowledge Generation Subsystem ?where 2 vocational trainings, the technological center AZTERLAN, and the Automotive Intelligence Center, AIC, are located. And Institutional Subsystem, where public development agencies and associations that strengthen social capital and regional values are included.
O22|Coherence of the EU cohesion policy and national regional policy: the case of the Czech Republic|There is a high research and political interest in regional disparities now. Regional disparities are at the heart of prominent theories of regional development as well as of the ambitious project of European integration. Moreover, regional policies at various spatial levels are formulated in order to reduce the problems arising from large regional disparities. However, the multi-level character of regional policies evokes the question of their coherence. It is noteworthy that such a question is frequently mentioned in scholar literature but with limited empirical evidences. The intent of this paper is to contribute to the discussion on the coherence of regional policies, using the Czech Republic as a case study. The EU cohesion policy has become the dominant source of funding for regional development in the Czech Republic after its accession to the European Union in 2004. In addition, there is a national regional policy in the Czech Republic which defines the so called regions with concentrated state aid at the district level. The goal of this paper is to assess the spatial coherence of these two policies. In other words, the regional pattern of the EU cohesion policy expenditures in the programming period 2007-2013 in the Czech Republic is mapped considering the position of the regions with concentrated state aid. Besides the overall assessment, the spatial pattern of the EU cohesion policy expenditures is decomposed thematically as well. The assessment is based on the database of more than forty-six thousand projects which were co-financed from the EU cohesion policy. The main findings of the research point at ambivalent spatial coherence of the EU cohesion policy on one hand and Czech national regional policy on the other. Thus, there is not a relatively higher allocation of the EU cohesion policy expenditures in the regions with concentrated state aid. This is true also for thematic decomposition, and especially for more progressive themes such as R&D, innovation and new technologies. Altogether, the findings suggest that additional measurements are necessary in order to increase the spatial coherence of the policies. Some suggestions related to the territorially based instruments of the EU cohesion policy for the programming period 2014-2020 are given.
O22|Neue Beteiligungs- und Steuerungsprozesse in der ländlichen Entwicklung: Phase I der Begleitforschung zum Modellvorhaben|In diesem Bericht werden die Zwischenergebnisse der Begleitforschung 2012 bis 2013 zum Modellvorhaben LandZukunft des Bundesministeriums für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft (BMEL) vorgestellt. Das Modellvorhaben läuft von 2012 bis Ende 2014 in vier aus ursprünglich 17 Landkreisen ausgewählten peripheren Regionen und verfolgt drei Kernziele: Erstens die Aktivierung sogenannter unternehmerischer Menschen für die Regionalentwicklung, zweitens die Erprobung des Instrumentes des Regionalbudgets und anderer neuer Finanzierungsinstrumente und drittens das Austesten der politischen Steuerung über individuell vereinbarte und vertraglich festgeschriebene Ziele. Darüber hinaus erhofft sich das BMEL von dem Modellvorhaben neue Erkenntnisse und Ideen, die auch in anderen Regionen übernommen werden können. Die Begleitforschung konzentriert sich in der ersten Phase auf die angestoßenen Beteiligungsprozesse und ihre Steuerung. Untersucht wird vor allem, wie sich der Wettbewerbsansatz sowie der Ansatz des 'Steuerns über Ziele' und die damit verbundene Stärkung regionaler Entscheidungsfreiheit auf die ländlichen Entwicklungsprozesse auswirken. Ein weiterer Schwerpunkt liegt zu diesem frühen Zeitpunkt der Umsetzung auf der Frage, inwiefern es gelingt, neue Akteure zu mobilisieren, welche individuellen und institutionellen Faktoren dabei eine Rolle spielen und welche Auswirkungen die Beteiligung auf ausgewählte Ziele und Projekte hat. Die Untersuchung beruht auf insgesamt 184 leitfadengestützten Interviews mit den Kreisverwaltungen und den begleitenden Büros in den 17 Wettbewerbsregionen und mit den meisten an LandZukunft beteiligten Akteuren in den vier ausgewählten Regionen. Ergänzend werden Dokumente zur Strategie der Regionen und zu den neu geschaffenen Organisationsstrukturen sowie Protokolle eigener teilnehmender Beobachtungen bei Sitzungen und anderen Treffen ausgewertet.

O22|Von Staaten, Märkten und Subventionen: Paradigmenwechsel in der Armutsbekämpfung?|Dieses Papier beleuchtet die Diskussion um Gestaltung und Wirksamkeit der bisherigen Entwicklungspolitik und liefert einen Ausblick für ihre Zukunft. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit erhält dabei die Rolle des Marktes in der Armutsbekämpfung auf der einen Seite und die des Staates und öffentlicher Subventionen auf der anderen. Am aktuellen Rand verläuft die Demarkationslinie in der entwicklungspolitischen Diskussion entlang der klassischen Lager von angebots- und nachfrageseitiger Wirtschaftspolitik. Während die eine Seite für massive Subventionen zur Armutsreduktion wirbt, sieht die andere darin eher die Ursache für verzerrende Effekte und schlägt die Bildung von Institutionen vor, die insbesondere marktwirtschaftliche Aktivitäten ermöglichen. Jenseits dieser zum Teil sehr ideologischen Debatte schließt sich dieses Papier dem sogenannten Dritten Weg an und argumentiert für ein neues Paradigma in der Armutsbekämpfung: Die wirksamsten Ansätze sollen durch evidenzbasierte wissenschaftliche Begleitung identifiziert und dann ausgeweitet werden. Am Ende eines solchen Paradigmenwechsels würde im Idealfall eine neue Form der erfolgsbasierten Konditionalität stehen.
O22|The New Transparency in Development Economics: Lessons from the Millennium Villages Controversy|The Millennium Villages Project is a high profile, multi-country development project that has aimed to serve as a model for ending rural poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. The project became the subject of controversy when the methodological basis of early claims of success was questioned. The lively ensuing debate offers lessons on three recent mini-revolutions that have swept the field of development economics: the rising standards of evidence for measuring impact, the “open data” movement, and the growing role of the blogosphere in research debates. In this paper, Michael Clemens and Gabriel Demombynes discuss how a new transparency is changing the debate about what works.
O22|Model Of The Project - Oriented Society|"In many national societies, projects and programmes are performed not only in companies but also in other organizations, such as municipal administrations, associations, schools and ever in families. The globalization of the economy, new technologies with ever-shorter product life cycles and the application of a new management paradigm, characterized by virtual organizations, „empowerment” and knowledge management, promote the use of project and programme management. The article describes the implementation of an integrated waste management in the county of Arges, in accordance with the requirements and provisions of European Community Directives, in order to preserve, protect and improve environmental quality in Arges (project ""Integrated management of solid waste in Arges"")."
O22|Hacia un desarrollo integral de la ciudad de Buenaventura y su área de influencia|El estudio consta de 3 componentes. El social, que caracteriza la población, los servicios sociales y los desafíos en materia de desarrollo humano de urgente solución en el municipio. El componente económico destaca la dinámica del puerto y los servicios asociados, el desempeño del comercio y el sector financiero y el potencial de las actividades pesquera y forestal, así como los proyectos de infraestructura contenidos en el programa presidencial “Buenaventura próspera”, para destacar la riqueza con que cuenta el municipio y su área de influencia y la necesidad de desarrollar actividades que generen trabajo y valor agregado en la región. El componente de conflictividades, adelantado por CERAC, analiza los conflictos y las tensiones presentes en el municipio así como la necesidad de fortalecer las instituciones para garantizar la seguridad y la gobernabilidad de Buenaventura. Se concluye con una propuesta analítica que busca identificar y jerarquizar los obstáculos al desarrollo integral de Buenaventura.
O22|Public gains from entrepreneurial research: Inferences about the economic value of public support of the Small Business Innovation Research program|Public support for innovation, chiefly through government programs such as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, has had a significant impact on fostering economic growth in the US. This collection synthesizes a decade of scholarship from Albert N. Link on the subject, specifically on small, technology-based entrepreneurial firms.
O22|Public gains from entrepreneurial research: Inferences about the economic value of public support of the Small Business Innovation Research program| This article presents a systematic analysis of the net economic benefits associated with the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. We offer a derivation of producer and consumer surplus to estimate economic benefits. Fundamental to the implementation of these models is a specific value of the elasticity of demand, but in its absence we estimate what its value would be when the benefit-to-cost ratio associated with public support of the SBIR program equals unity. We infer from these calculations, and from general knowledge about the ability of SBIR-funded firms to exploit their monopoly position, that the SBIR program likely generates positive net economic benefits to society.

O22|Approcci integrati e governance locale nelle strategie di sviluppo rurale: un framework per la futura programmazione|Within the scope of the last two stages of rural development programming, the Campania Region has introduced significant innovations in the field of integrated intervention strategies in rural areas by implementing an Integrated Rural Project (IRP). This programme led to a new organizational model for public intervention in rural areas. This key it has given the opportunity of trying out participatory/integrated development processes in rural areas (Leader method) which have now become an integral part of routine programming (Leader Axes and Collective Action Projects 2007-2013), through the management of integrated rural development policies by local partnerships. The strategic mission of IRPs has been that of intervening, by means of a partnership approach, in the main issues which limit competitive capacity within regional rural areas. The IRPs act as models for collective and integrated action for programmed intervention on a territorial basis. Their dual aim is to endorse a system of local governance and to promote integration and coordination between rural development policy and other policies. In light of what has been stated above, this paper aims to develop an impact assessment of integrated rural policy in the Campania region with the objective of evaluating: the overall levels of efficiency reached compared to ‘traditional’ programming models; the ‘quality’ of negotiation processes and of the new relationship networks which derive from them; models and best practices, in terms of financial/implementation efficiency and programmatic effectiveness, with a view to their transfer into the 2014-2020 programming period; the effective possibility that the model represents a concrete and effective opportunity for the promotion of selfgovernance on an intra-regional scale. Each of these elements has allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of the method on a territorial level and, consequently, the impact on the enhancement of the overall efficiency and effectiveness of locally implemented rural development strategies, on the reconfiguration of the local governance system and, more generally, on the involvement of rural communities in development processes. The methodological framework took the regional administrative databases as a starting point and carried out qualitative investigation through focus groups (constituted in each territorial reference environment of the 15 regional IRPs), made up of members of the local partnerships and beneficiaries of the Programme who were requested to express their opinion with regard to specific topics of discussion. The results of this study have allowed us to gain useful insights into the efficiency of expenditure and the effectiveness of rural development policies in terms of territorial readjustment and socio-economic impact. In the context of the present-day crisis, such results provide useful consideration for worthwhile scientific debate together with normative guidance for decision makers with a view to the next stage of rural development programming (2014-2020).
