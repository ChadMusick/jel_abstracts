P12|Do private enterprises outperform state enterprises in an emerging market? The importance of institutional context in entrepreneurship|Do private-owned enterprises (POEs) outperform state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in an emerging market? Due to political and social connections, SOEs have several advantages over POEs in emerging markets and transition economies, but we hypothesize that these advantages wane in pro-market institutional environments that prioritize market competition, rule of law, and the rewards to profitable enterprise. In this study, therefore, we explore how institutional quality moderates the relationship between privatization and entrepreneurs’ sales performance. To do this, we blend agency theory and entrepreneurial cognition theory with insights from institutional economics to develop a model of emerging market venture performance. Using data from the World Bank’s Enterprise Survey of entrepreneurs in China, our results suggest that POEs outperform SOEs but only in environments with high-quality market institutions. In environments with low-quality market institutions, SOEs outperform POEs.
P12|The Impact of Financialization on the Rate of Profit: A Discussion|The present work, by making use of the ‘integrated wage-goods sector’ methodology proposed by Gareg-nani, investigates some channels through which financialization may impact the normal rate of profit. We analyze the effect of a higher profit share in the financial sector, the technical innovations in the financial sector and rising household indebtedness. We find that none of them influences normal profitability, with the exception of one type of technical innovation. We subsequently critically discuss some Marxian strands of analysis that describe financialization as a temporary countertendency to supposed falling gen-eral profitability. We argue in favor of a separate analysis between growth caused by private borrowing and the study of a normal distribution. Finally, a recent attempt to read the ‘sixth’ countertendency to the falling rate of profit listed by Marx as an anticipation of the phenomenon of financialization is criticized, proposing an alternative interpretation.
P12|Patterns of Economic Growth in Dependent Market Economies: The Case of Central Eastern Europe|The development pattern of certain Central Eastern European Countries has always represented a special case within Europe?s overall economic growth as well as social progress. Current paper examines the main growth tendencies of the so-called dependent market economies (DMEs) and also provides an extended definition for latter model. In frames of the comparative analysis, the research is based on investigating the relationship between the presence and activity of TNCs and MNCs through their FDI inflow contribution to the destination countries, the performance of the main investor economies and trading countries and also the GDP growth of the DMEs. According to the evidence, in certain countries ? e.g. Hungary ? a dual economic structure has emerged strongly relying on the multinational sector successfully being integrated into the world economy and a weak domestic sector that is in most cases, not capable of selling its goods and services in a global market. The lack of high value added production and the constant reliance on cheap labour force may further deepen the diverging tendency compared to the developed economies. Our main hypothesis assumes that integrated peripheries ? due to certain asymmetric interdependencies ? are not likely to produce significant long-term economic convergence to the centre economies with the current conditions of global capitalism and a strongly FDI based growth path they have developed.
P12|A new societal contract|"This paper argues that the traditional societal contract that underlies the market economy has run its course and needs to be replaced by a new contract, based on a new conception of the ""empowering economy."" Whereas different societal contracts are relevant to different societies, there must be some features that all societal contracts will have in common, in order to address some basic human needs that every thriving society must satisfy and to promote popular approval for multilateral agreements to address multilateral problems. The paper proposes a new societal contract that promotes three building blocks of economic policies: (1) automatic stabilizers that reduce inequalities of economic power, (2) policies that focus not just on material prosperity, but also on personal and social empowerment and (3) policies that develop the human capabilities of cooperation and innovation."
P12|Are managerial capitalism and crony capitalism incompatible? The adaptation of the Spanish corporate elite to the capitalist system in the last century|"In the last century, Spanish economic and society have experienced remarkable transformations, as the consolidation of a democratic State of law, and the access to the reduced club of developed countries. Such transformations have also reached the corporate elite. Nevertheless, has the professionalization of the managers of large companies represented a break with the old practices of crony capitalism? To answer this question, the paper analyzes the profiles of the presidents and CEO of the largest Spanish corporations, between 1917 and today. The application of prosopographic method to different aspects of the social capital of managers, on nine selected dates, will allow to understand better the evolution process of the Spanish corporate elite. This process includes an increase in managerial capabilities, due to the formation and cosmopolitan capital; but despite the advance of managerial capitalism, this has not meant the end of the so-called crony capitalism, —characteristic of both the Restoration and the Franco dictatorship—, and in the last decades it seems that there is again an ""entrenchment"" movement by the new business elite to defend their own interest to the detriment of those of the country."
P12|From Financial to Managerial Capitalism. The slow adaptation of Spanish corporate elite|In the last century, Spanish society and economy have endured considerable social and economic transformations which have also affected the corporate elite. Has the professionalization of managers of large companies broke away from old practices of crony capitalism? We have analysed the profiles of managers and executives of the biggest limited liability companies in Spain from 1917 to present day in order to answer this question. Prosoprographic method applied to different social capital fields of managers allows for a better understanding of how the Spanish corporate elite evolved. The latter entails an increase of managerial skills, through training and cosmopolitan capital; nonetheless, progress in managerial capitalism has not put an end to typical aspects of crony capitalism, which was attributed to most of the twentieth century and the new business elite has uplifted a new “entrenchment” in the last decades to put their interests before those of the country as a whole.
P12|Familles actionnaires|Family firms account for a large proportion of listed companies worldwide. The governance mechanisms of family firms deal with the specificities of their agency conflicts. For example, agency conflicts between shareholders and managers can be mitigated when the managers are themselves family members. The costs of agency conflicts between the family blockholding and minority shareholders, related to potential private benefits, can be offset by more effective monitoring, while a specific agency conflict related to relations between the family at large and family shareholders can emerge. The governance mechanisms put in place seem effective, since family firms appear to perform better than non-family firms. But they are also less diversified, less innovative and more sensitive to the social climate in the company. Their financial decisions reflect their shareholders? concern to preserve their control, which involves, in particular, long-term relationships with other stakeholders. This article provides a review of research findings on these topics. Classification JEL?: G30, G32, L21, L25, P12.
P12|The Rise of Private Foundations as Owners of Swedish Industry: The Role of Tax Incentives 1862–2018|The tax system has at times favoured firm control through private foundations, which has been argued to inhibit high-impact entrepreneurship and economic growth. However, research has been hampered due to a lack of systematic historical tax data. The purpose of this study is threefold. First, we describe the evolution of tax rules for private foundations in Sweden between 1862 and 2018. Second, we calculate the marginal effective tax rate on capital income. Third, we examine the incentives to use private foundations as a means for corporate control by comparing the taxation of private foundations and of high-impact entrepreneurs. Tax incentives help explain why economically significant private foundations were founded between World War I and the 1960s.
P12|Brazilian Foreign Direct Investment in ECE - host country determinants|Outward Foreign Direct Investments (OFDI) from Emerging Multinational Enterprises (EMNEs) is a rather recent phenomenon that has significantly changed the patterns of the international capital markets, with important consequences also for the host countries’ economies. On the global scene Brazil was among the new significant emerging foreign investors, that has shown impressive investment growth in the 2000s. This paper investigates the host country determinants of Brazilian OFDI, with mainly (though not exclusively) focusing on the East Central European (ECE) region. Besides empirical interest on the main locational determinants of Brazilian FDI, we are also interested in the more theoretically oriented question whether Brazilian foreign investments follow the patterns of the established theories on FDI motivations.
P12|Is Trust in Companies Rooted in Social Trust, or Regulatory Quality, or Both?|While trust in the business sector is crucial for well-functioning markets, there is surprisingly little empirical work on its sources. Available research recognises social trust as a major force explaining confidence in political institutions. Regulation is frequently advocated to foster trust in companies as it is supposed to reduce scope for opportunistic behaviour. Based on individual level data from World Values Survey, European Values Studies and economic regulation data from the Economic Freedom of the World project the paper empirically investigates joint effects of social trust, intensity and quality of regulation on public trust in major companies. Our findings suggest that it is not the intensity of economic regulation per se which matters for trust in companies but that the impartiality with which rules are enforced is decisive, even when we control for social trust. Trust in business can be facilitated by an implicit guarantee of governments to fair and impartial treatment.
P12|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as Corporate Governance Model for State Owned Enterprises (SOE)|It is widely acknowledged that Corporate Social Responsibility is a modern trend among big corporations who are taking responsibility for supporting the environment and improving social wellbeing. Majority of the Big Corporations try to follow this trend and implement Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a corporate governance and business model in their corporate structures and activities. CSR underlines the social role of Corporations and promotes their involvement in improving the working conditions of employees, ensuring safety regulations and improving the environmental protection measures. At the same time, this corporate governance model does not discourage corporations from profitable economic conduct but advocates them to support the community with strengthening the vulnerable groups of society, supporting small businesses, providing trainings, coordinating activities with non-commercial entities, etc. Although, if the CSR is a free choice generally for commercial entities, it becomes somehow ?mandatory? for State Shareholding enterprises. These are enterprises where state is holding all or majority of shares. As these corporations are owned by the state, and therefore, indirectly by the society, corporate social responsibility should be a mandatory corporate governance model for such companies. This will enhance their role in serving public. However, in many countries State Owned Enterprises (SOE) lack transparency and openness which affects their accountability level as well. With low level of transparency, it is difficult to define the social and environmental benefits implemented by the SOE. The aim of this speech will be to highlight the importance of Corporate Social Responsibility for State Owned Enterprises. At the same time, the speech will provide new understanding of CSR, with characterizing CSR as a governance model which includes the transparency, openness and higher accountability of the corporations before community. Emphasizing, that state corporations should serve public not only in a social and environmentally safe way but also in a responsible, open and accountable manner.This speech will be presented as part of the findings of the Scientific Project. This work was supported by Shota Rustaveli National Science Foundation (SRNSF) [Grant Number: #217878; Project Title: Legal Regulation, Challenges and Recommendations for Effective Corporate Governance System in State Shareholding Enterprises]. The speech will be presented by the Head of the Project - Davit Maisuradze.

P12|"Beyond ""dependent development"" in a high-tech industry? The interplay between domestic institutions and transnational sectoral governance in the trajectories of emerging Polish IT firms"|The present study investigates the relatively successful development of the homegrown IT industry in Poland since the early 1990s. The case is theoretically interesting because it runs counter to the dominant perspective on the economic systems in postcommunist Central Europe, which emphasizes the region's dependency on foreign direct investment (FDI) for industrial development. The empirical analysis focuses on the industry's two key players, Asseco and Comarch, which are among Europe's largest enterprise IT (EIT) vendors. It uses rich historical data to reconstruct the firms' strategies regarding sales market operations, corporate finance, and productive organization. The study's main theoretical interest is to explore how the firms' successful development has been shaped by the interplay between home-country institutions and the governance structure of the transnational EIT industry. The analysis indicates, first, that the firms have benefited from a well-functioning local capital market, the domestic supply of high-skilled labor, and some characteristics of the home country sales market. Second, the study reveals that the firms' development has been conditioned by the ongoing modularization processes in the EIT sector. In their initially home market oriented operations, the analyzed firms focused on the downstream segments of the EIT value chain while sourcing the more high-tech components (e.g. databases) from collaborations with foreign suppliers. In general, the findings contribute to the discussions on catching-up processes in emerging countries, first, by demonstrating the developmental potential related to modularization processes in high-tech industries, and second, by drawing attention to how the globally fragmented production regimes intersect with country-specific institutional frameworks.
P12|Capitalism and Socialism: A Review of Kornai's Dynamism, Rivalry, and the Surplus Economy|Understanding the nature of capitalism has been a central theme of economics. The collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the global financial crisis spurred the reemergence of the political economy as a new frontier and the revival of interest in the nature of capitalism. Janos Kornai's book Dynamism, Rivalry, and the Surplus Economy: Two Essays on the Nature of Capitalism fills an important intellectual gap in understanding the dynamic nature of capitalism by comparing it with its mirror image, socialism. To further develop the themes contained in the book, serious challenges are posed theoretically and empirically, as well as in subjects, such as hybrid capitalism.
P12|The firm as a common. The case of the accumulation and use of capital resources in co-operative enterprises|Contemporary literature dealing with the governance of the exploitation of common-pool natural resources was initiated by Elinor Ostrom in 1990, and has been growing fast ever since. On the contrary, within the same research stream, the study of the presence and economic role of common resources in entrepreneurial-organizational is, to date, under-researched. This work endeavours some attempt to fill this gap by: first, spelling out a new-institutionalist framework for the analysis of the accumulation and governance of common capital resources within organizational boundaries; second, by considering co-operative enterprises as the organizational form that, on the basis of historical record, and of behavioural and institutional characteristics, demonstrated to be the most compatible with a substantial role for common and non-divided asset-ownership and with its governance thereof. The economic forces influencing the optimal level of self-financed common capital resources in co-operatives are enquired. Also their governance is brought under the spotlight, evidencing: (i) the constraints that need to be fulfilled, and the potential benefits arising out of their presence; (ii) the compatibility and mutual adaptability between democratic governance in co-operatives and the governance of non-divided assets.
P12|Communism - A survival analysis|Human generation try to fit into a 4 dimensional survival concepts comprising the Environment, Geography, Economic and Social dimensions, over centuries and their pedigree too progressed under these guidelines. Because of the divergent level of survival targets in the economic and social strata by each human being, wealth accumulation flows unequally among the people. Industrial revolution mechanised the human work, with cost reduction and quality/volume optimization and planted Capitalism in the world, creating a wedge in the wealth accumulation process. This inducted a class war between the owners of wealth versus the workers, who are hired and fired by them. Competition made the capitalist to realise the importance of labour and diluted their concept as “Socialism”. The disproportionate wealth accumulation among people seeded the concept of communism in the world. Communism originated by Marx in Germany, spread to Russia and was promoted by Lenin. Both assumed that the large volume of people in the world belong to the low wealth possessing worker class, will revolt towards equal wealth share, and Communism shall dominate the whole world soon. But both Marx and Lenin were “Social revolutionists” and lacked “futuristic management thoughts” on how the shared wealth will be recycled to grow more, and result in prosperity among the equally shared population ? With this limited thought, the USSR (1922) and the East Germany (GDR-1961) and were created, with the entire wealth of the nation pooled on the apex “State”, representing the entire population. The state became a monopoly and all the people were simple labourers, without any self possessions. The state utilised the labour like a commodity, without any motivation to use their original ideas and any incentive to improve the productive contribution spirit. As a result, the GDR collapsed in 1989 and the USSR dwindled in 1991, bringing an end to the 69 year old Communist concept. Also both started promoting the diametrically opposite Capitalist approach and established cooperation with the (imperialist) USA. Communism could have survived and continued as a guide for wealth and prosperity for all the nations and their people in the world, if the domestic population was considered as “superior” to the “state”. The national wealth owned by the “State” should have been invested in sectorial projects and entrusted to optimum group of people to work, manage and encouraged to meet a targeted quality volume. State should have met all needs of these groups of people. A reasonable share of the net gains should have been distributed in equal proportion to all the people involved, as an incentive. Below targets and loss should have been questioned and corrective action should have been taken. In addition, the productivity and management decision should have been oriented towards ‘socio-economic Development units”. The domestic investment should be made from domestic savings and domestic technology should be manned by the domestic labour.
P12|Startup as a partner of cooperation for big company in the agri-food industry: Analysis of forms of cooperation on examples|Currently obtaining and maintaining a competitive advantage require implementation of innovation in companies. This trend is mainly caused by the rapid development cycle of technologies. Thus, there is a question of adaptability especially regarding introducing innovation. It can be assumed that cooperation between entities at various stages of the business development is increasingly important and large enterprises from the agri-food industry are willing to interact with startups. This interaction may allow startups to overcome the difficulties that are emerging at the early stage of the development such as the problem of delivering the reliable proof of concept. The goal of this paper is an analysis of cooperation and use of the synergies between large enterprises and startups especially in order to address needs of innovation in the economy. The cooperation can take various forms, and this paper will discuss selected types of collaboration between large enterprises and startups, which are related to business acceleration activities, co-development, co-branding, acquisitions, and acqui-hire.
P12|The ordonomic approach to business ethics|'Ordonomics' is a research program that has been developed at the Chair of Economic Ethics at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. It holds that business actors (persons and organizations) can employ morality as a 'factor of production', and that business ethics can be based on a specific rational-choice analysis that is fully in line with the established tradition of economic thinking. With regard to practice, the main point is that ordonomics offers a guiding concept for creating win-win solutions that help business firms to do well by doing good. With regard to theory, ordonomics offers a conceptual framework for business ethics that makes ethics and economics coherent and mutually compatible with each other.
P12|Corporate Social Responsability – an European Approach through the Tourism SME’s Perspectives|Nowadays, companies face a big challenge in adopting a responsible behaviour towards the community and the environment throughout their business activities. We consider that Corporate Social Responsibility in tourism industry is still searching for consist ency in policies, programs and practices and responds to issues particularly related to sustainable tourism principles. Starting from the idea that small and medium sized enterprises can be exponents of responsibility, this paper propose to analyse tourism operators’ opinions regarding Corporate Social Responsibility and underlines its importance in tourism businesses. For achieving this, a quantitative research was used and a questionnaire on the micro, small and medium sized enterprises, representatives for tourism industry in eight EU countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania and France) was conducted. The tour operators’ opinions on CSR are significant for the development of trainings that they might attend in order to implement the social responsibility principles in their fields of activity.
P12|Les symbioses industrielles : un nouveau champ d’analyse pour l’économie industrielle|If industrial symbiosis can be defined as a commitment of independent firms in a collaborative chain to take advantage of trading materials and energy flows, it may also become an interesting field for industrial organization. The environmental issue and especially industrial ecology are a new step in the evolutionary process of industrial organization. From new theories (conventions, stakeholders, industrial districts) and new facts (study of metabolism, waste repurposing, circular economy), industrial ecology foreshadows the study of change as announced for the field of industrial organization.

P12|Adaptation and Influence: The Schumpeterian Perspective on Business-Politics Relations|This paper introduces Schumpeter’s views on the relationship between business and politics and argues that we can discern a distinct Schumpeterian perspective of business-politics relations. Schumpeter’s views about the pivotal role of entrepreneurs in economic development attracted substantial interest in economic sociology and in political economy. His views about the role of entrepreneurs in politics have so far however hardly been studied. The paper identifies the following four aspects as central to Schumpeter’s perspective of business-politics relations: (a) entrepreneurs and corporations drive economic change, (b) entrepreneurs and corporations are ineffective in defending their political interests and vulnerable to hostile movements, (c) the resulting divergence of the economic and the political impact of entrepreneurs and corporations makes capitalism socio-politically instable, and (d) the relationship of entrepreneurs and corporations to political institutions and public policies is primarily adaptive, rather than causative. The paper proposes a two-dimensional typology of business-politics relations that combines the Schumpeterian focus on adaptation with the Marxian focus on influence. These two dimensions - adaptation and influence - result in four ideal types: business-dominated social compromise, imposed social compromise, business dominance, and political confrontation. Examples from German welfare state history illustrate these four types. The paper suggests that the Schumpeterian and the Marxian perspective, while in contrast to each other, may be complementary and each perspective valid under different socio-political conditions.
P12|Financial market determinants of the real cost of funds to public corporations in the US: 2SLS and GMM findings|Purpose - The purpose of this study is to provide new empirical evidence on the impact of a variety of financial market forces on the ex post real cost of funds to corporations, namely, the ex post real interest rate yield on AAA-rated long-term corporate bonds in the USA. The study is couched within an open-economy loanable funds model, and it adopts annual data for the period 1973-2013, so that the results are current while being applicable only for the post-Bretton Woods era. The auto-regressive two-stage least squares (2SLS) and generalized method of moments (GMM) estimations reveal that the ex post real interest rate yield on AAA-rated long-term corporate bonds in the USA was an increasing function of the ex post real interest rate yields on six-month Treasury bills, seven-year Treasury notes, high-grade municipal bonds and the Moody’s BAA-rated corporate bonds, while being a decreasing function of the monetary base as a per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and net financial capital inflows as a per cent of GDP. Finally, additional estimates reveal that the higher the budget deficit as a per cent of GDP, the higher the ex post real interest rate on AAA-rated long-term corporate bonds. Design/methodology/approach - After developing an initial open-economy loanable funds model, the empirical dimension of the study involves auto-regressive, two-stage least squares and GMM estimates. The model is then expanded to include the federal budget deficit, and new AR/2SLS and GMM estimates are provided. Findings - The AR/2SLS and GMM (generalized method of moments) estimations reveal that the ex post real interest rate yield on AAA-rated long-term corporate bonds in the USA was an increasing function of the ex post real interest rate yields on six-month Treasury bills, seven-year Treasury notes, high-grade municipal bonds and the Moody’s BAA-rated corporate bonds, while being a decreasing function of the monetary base as a per cent of GDP and net financial capital inflows as a per cent of GDP. Finally, additional estimates reveal that the higher the budget deficit as a per cent of GDP, the higher the ex post real interest rate on AAA-rated long -term corporate bonds. Originality/value - The author is unaware of a study that adopts this particular set of real interest rates along with net capital inflows and the monetary base as a per cent of GDP and net capital inflows. Also, the data run through 2013. There have been only studies of deficits and real interest rates in the past few years.
P12|Determinants Of Financial Rewards From Industry–University Collaboration In South Korea|The external circumstances for universities have been changing rapidly. In order to be competitive, survive and flourish, universities have turned to external sources to generate revenues. The literature refers to this phenomenon as academic capitalism, defined as the involvement of colleges and their faculty in market-like behaviours, which has become a key feature of higher education finances in most countries. As a result, technology transfer, technological commercialisation, and patents via industry–university collaboration represent a source of financial rewards. This paper explores the determinants of financial rewards of universities sourced from academic engagement through industry–university collaboration in South Korea. We have found that technology transfer per employees working at technology licensing offices, participation of engineering faculty, patent approvals, and the number of firms with incubators within universities significantly contributes to university revenues. The following determinants of financial performance are unexpectedly not contributors to revenue: technological commercialisation using technology transfer, distinguished faculty and incentive rules for inventors. In the light of these findings, it appears that an entrepreneurial university program is likely to play a strong role in university finances in Korea.

P12|Are Cooperatives More Productive Than Investor-Owned Firms? Cross-Industry Evidence From Portugal|We analyse empirically whether cooperatives and investor-owned firms differ in terms of productive efficiency. Using rich Portuguese panel data covering a wide range of industries, we apply two different empirical approaches to estimate potential differences in productive efficiency. The results from our benchmark random-effects model show that cooperatives are significantly less productive, on average, than investor-owned firms, both at the aggregate level and for most of the industries considered. However, the results derived from a System-GMM approach, which is our preferred empirical strategy, are much less conclusive, and we cannot conclude that cooperatives are generally less efficient that investorâ€ owned firms. With either approach, though, we find no evidence that cooperatives are more productive than investorâ€ owned firms in any industry.
P12|A “Statute of the Firm” as an antitrust law during the Seventies. Guido Carli’s chairmanship of the Italian Industrial Association (Confindustria)|This paper aims to highlight a newsworthy initiative built up by the Italian Industrial Association which tried to give the Italian economy a forerunner “competition law”; however, in the Seventies Italy proved incapable of tying itself with rules of conduct, which were substituted, empowering an “external constraint”. We will firstly provide an economic and historical-institutional framework of that period; we will then describe the making and the contents of the “Statute of the Firm”, together with a critical analysis on it; finally, we will report some critics around the debate on this proposal, and why the Statute was rejected by entrepreneurs themselves.
P12|The SKY Model of Limited BlockChain in an App Ecosystem|Mobile App based market is rapidly becoming popular. As such, it is an opportunity to bring hassle-free transactions to people’s mobile phones. But the multi-billion dollar App market pays a great amount of money in transaction costs and banking services. This paper provides a solution by integrating BlockChain technology with Mobile-App based economy. We first describe the various concepts involved in BlockChain and App technology. Then we deliberate on how the two can be brought together without a glitch in either of the systems. This model is named as the SKY Model, each letter in the word SKY respectively standing for the initials of the authors. We also discuss the various merits of a BlockChain amalgamated with Mobile App based economy. We then go on to show how a decentralised economic system can be brought about on Mobile Apps through The SKY Model of Limited BlockChain.
P12|Entgrenzte Organisationen – begrenzte Beschaeftigtengesundheit? Arbeitspolitische Aushandlungen um Grenzverschiebungen und Grenzziehungen im Arbeits- und Gesundheitsschutz (Boundaryless organisations and their implications for employee health. Labour policy negotiations about boundaries in occupational health and safety)|Der Beitrag diskutiert die Reichweite und Bezugnahme der durch Normen und Vorgaben gesetzten Grenzen im Arbeits- und Gesundheitsschutz. Dafuer werden zum einen Grenzverschiebungen um den Standard des Arbeitsschutzes im Rahmen arbeitspolitischer Aushandlungen in seiner historischen Entwicklung aufgezeigt. Zum anderen werden Grenzziehungen zwischen verschiedenen Beschaeftigtengruppen identifiziert. Wie am Beispiel der stationaeren und haeuslichen Pflege gezeigt wird, kommen diese durch den Ausschluss von Leiharbeitskraeften und Werkvertragsnehmern von etablierten Arbeitsschutzstandards zustande. Ein Kennzeichen der Entgrenzung von Organisationen und Arbeit besteht demnach darin, dass prekaer Beschaeftigten mit geringen Sekundaermachtpotentialen vielerorts nur ein begrenztes Arbeits- und Gesundheitsschutzniveau zuteil wird. (The article discusses the scope and reference of occupational health and safety as set by legal standards and specifications. Firstly, we discuss the shifting boundaries of occupational health standards with special regard to the historical development of labour related negotiations. Secondly, we identify the boundaries separating different groups of employees. Through the examples of in-patient and home care, we show that these boundaries are established through the exclusion of temporary staff and contract workers from established safety standards. As a consequence, the article argues that many precarious workers with individual diminished power resources are subject to limited levels of occupational health and safety.)
P12|Entgrenzung von Organisation und Arbeit? Interorganisationale Fragmentierung als Herausforderung für Arbeitsrecht, Management und Mitbestimmung. Einleitung zum Schwerpunktheft|Die Artikel des Schwerpunktheftes setzen an verschiedenen inhaltlichen Dimensionen und Ebenen dieser Fragmentierung an: Auf der Arbeitsebene ist der Beitrag von Gabriele Fassauer und Silke Geithner angesiedelt, der die inner-organisatorische Bewaeltigung von Co-Konfiguration durch Auftragsmanager behandelt. Auf Basis der Taetigkeitstheorie beleuchten die Autorinnen die Co-Konfiguration zwischen Kunden und Produzenten, indem sie die Grenzarbeit von Auftragsmanagern im Zentrum interorganisationaler Leistungserstellung sichtbar machen, um den Anforderungen von Kunden, Zulieferern und den unternehmensinternen Arbeitsgruppen gerecht zu werden. Die Mitbestimmungspraxis von Betriebsraeten im Umgang mit quasi-externalisierter Arbeit ist Gegenstand von gleich zwei Aufsaetzen mit je unterschiedlicher Blickrichtung. Der Artikel von Markus Hertwig, Johannes Kirsch und Carsten Wirth zielt auf die Erkundung des Umgangs des Betriebsrats mit Onsite-Werkvertraegen in strukturationstheoretischer Perspektive. Fuer die Ernaehrungs- und Getraenkeindustrie zeigen sie verschiedene Praktiken auf, die in verschiedenen Typen des Umgangs von Betriebsraeten mit Onsite-Werkvertraegen verdichtet werden, die zwischen Kooperation und Konfrontation, zwischen Ablehnung und Akzeptanz angesiedelt sind. Karina Becker thematisiert aus einer sozialkritischen Perspektive den Gesundheits- und Arbeitsschutz fuer Werkvertragsbeschaeftigte in der Pflege. Dabei interessiert sie sich insbesondere fuer die rechtlichen Sekundaermachtpotenziale der Betriebsraete sowie deren etwaige Verschiebungen innerhalb des Feldes des Arbeits- und Gesundheitsschutzes. Auf diese Weise wird die Reichweite staatlicher Mindestschutzvorschriften im Betrieb bzw. im Haushalt als Verhandlungsgegenstand der Mitbestimmung thematisiert. Auf der Mesoebene zwischen Organisationen und (arbeits-)rechtlichem Rahmen setzen Isabell Hensel, Jochen Koch, Eva Kocher und Anna Schwarz mit einer interdisziplinaeren Einordnung online vermittelter Arbeitsauftraege und Werke an. Sie deuten neue Formen der Arbeitserbringung („Crowdworking“) in ihrer Vielgestaltigkeit, d.h. auch und gerade hinsichtlich von Potenzialen, die jenseits einer allfaelligen Prekarisierung angesiedelt sein koennen. Hierbei greifen sie zum einen auf die Organisations- und Managementtheorie zurueck, zum anderen benutzen sie das Arbeitsrecht, um das Spektrum von Crowdworking in einem Regelkreis aus Autonomie und Kontrolle, Flexibilitaet und Stabilitaet zu ordnen. Auf der Makroebene diskutiert Andreas Buecker die Regulierung der multipolaren Arbeitsbeziehungen und insbesondere des sog. drittbezogenen Personaleinsatzes, indem er bestehende Quellen des Arbeitsrechts (AEntG, MiloG, ArbSchG, BetrVG) auf Anwendbarkeit prueft, um regulative Luecken zu praezisieren. Zugleich thematisiert er die Rolle von Leitbildern im Diskurs der Rechtsfortbildung. Im Ergebnis argumentiert er fuer eine Fortentwicklung des Arbeitsrechts, um ueber den klassischen bipolaren Arbeitnehmerbegriff hinaus auch mehrpolige Rechtsbeziehungen erfassen zu koennen und die Betroffenen nicht schutzlos zu stellen. Hieran knuepfen zwei Debattenbeitraege an, um die derzeitige Konstruktion des Arbeitsrechts auf den Pruefstand zu stellen. Ebenso wie Buecker setzen sowohl Christiane Brors als auch Wolfgang Daeubler am grundsaetzlich bestehenden sozialen Schutzbedarf in mehrpoligen Arbeitsbeziehungen an, blicken aber gleichsam etwas optimistischer in die Zukunft. Brors haelt das zweipolige Arbeitsverhaeltnis nach wie vor fuer den richtigen Anker, um den Schutz abhaengig Beschaeftigter zu gewaehrleisten und zeigt auf, dass bestehende Ansaetze, insbesondere im Rahmen des Rechts der Leiharbeit, ausbaufaehig sind. AEhnlich sieht es Daeubler, der gleichermassen im Arbeitsrecht wie im Recht der Selbststaendigen ausbaufaehige Konstruktionen sieht. Deutlich wird dabei aber, dass gerade im letzteren Bereich der Gesetzgeber gefragt sein koennte, ueber den Typus der arbeitnehmeraehnlichen Person den Schutz von Selbststaendigen zu verbessern. Darueber hinaus macht Daeubler deutlich, dass gerade beim Crowdsourcing ein Problem in der Internationalitaet der Rechtsbeziehung liegen koennte.
P12|'You’ll (n)ever walk alone'. Innovative Wissensarbeit zwischen individualistischem Leistungsregime und kommunitaerer Teamkultur ('You’ll (n)ever walk alone'. Innovative knowledge work: Individual performance systems as opposed to communitarian team culture)|Im Fokus des Beitrages steht die Arbeitsregulation in wissensbasierten Unternehmen. Interessenvertretungen werden hier nicht nur damit konfrontiert, dass hochqualifizierte Beschaeftigte – Wissensarbeiter/innen – zur Selbstvertretung tendieren, sondern auch mit neuen integrativen Human Resource Strategien, in denen Commitment und Empowerment eine grosse Rolle spielen. Ob das Spannungsverhaeltnis zwischen individualistischer Leistungsorientierung und kommunitaerer Teamkultur – das Paradox der Wissensarbeit – hierdurch jedoch geloest werden kann, ist die Frage; ebenso wie die Vereinbarkeit mit traditionellen Institutionen der Interessenvertretung. Zur Analyse wird das Theoriekonzept der „institutionellen Logiken“ herangezogen, das uns Aufschluss ueber die in wissensbasierten Unternehmen vorherrschenden Spannungen und Interessenskonflikte geben soll. Am Beispiel von Pharma- und Biotech-Unternehmen wird gezeigt, wie widerspruechliche institutionelle Logiken entstehen und bearbeitet werden. Diskutiert werden mit Blick auf die empirischen Befunde auch die Chancen fuer eine Rekonfiguration kollektiver Formen der Arbeitsregulation. (This article examines the role of work regulation in knowledge-based firms. Collective interest representation is faced with a preference of knowledge workers for self-representation as well as the need to counteract integrative human resource strategies which support commitment and empowerment. Could these management strategies resolve the tension between an individualistic performance orientation and a communitarian team culture – the paradox of knowledge work? Or, does knowledge work fit well with traditional models of collective interest representation? Our analysis is based on the theory of institutional logics that offers a framework for investigating tensions and conflicting interests within knowledge-based firms. With reference to the example of pharmaceutical and biotech companies, the article describes how contradictory institutional logics develop and how they are applied. Our empirical findings provide a further discussion of possibilities for reconfiguring the collective representation of interests.)
P12|Risking Capitalism|The growing centrality of risk management in pro-market governance raises important questions regarding how risks are produced, and why? Who and what is included in, and excluded from, risk management, and why? And, what is the relationship between the rise of risk management and neoliberalism? Charting the relationship between risk, contemporary capitalism and its neoliberal modes of governance, Risking Capitalism, addresses these questions by examining - both analytically and empirically - diverse meanings and practices of risk management across a range of scales and themes, ranging from austerity to climate change to housing and debt. The authors investigate the relationship between shifts in contemporary capitalism and the ways in which neoliberal forms of risk management have emerged, been reproduced and normalized, and, transformed historically.
P12|Why the QWERTY phenomenon is not just in the theorists’ minds yet not pose a problem in reality|Researchers disagree about the relevance of the so-called QWERTY phenomenon, which simply means getting stuck in a bad equilibrium. Two contrasting perspectives exist in the academic sector. One camp argues that the higher quality of a product or service exerts a major influence on its market success. Consequently, an inferior market player should not persist, and the possibility of the QWERTY phenomenon is denied by this party. The opposite group emphasises the importance of network effects, which can lead to lock-ins in inferior situations. In this paper, we investigate this debate. We demonstrate that the missing consideration of the status quo bias in previous studies leads to a rejection of the QWERTY phenomenon. We give several examples of different industries with inferior market share leaders. However, we suggest that this phenomenon only causes temporary harm, and the lock-in could be overcome by a specific form of Schumpeterian creative destruction. Therefore, we claim that even if lockins exist, they pose no problems as long as innovative market participants have the opportunity to develop and introduce new business models.
P12|Public and Private Investment and Economic Growth in Zambia: A Dynamic Approach|This paper investigated the dynamic contributions of public and private investment to economic growth in Zambia during the 1970 to 2014 period. In the analysis, the paper also estimated the important indirect contribution of public investment to economic growth through its crowding effect on private investment. The study employed the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model in estimating the economic growth and private investment models. The empirical evidence from the study shows that private investment contributes more to economic growth than public investment in Zambia in the short run and long run. In addition, gross public investment, infrastructural and non-infrastructural public investment are found to crowd out private investment in the short run; while non-infrastructural public investment had a long run crowding out effect on private investment. The results imply that the long-run contributions of both private and public investment to economic growth in Zambia can be improved by raising the infrastructural public investment. Investimenti pubblici e privati e crescita economica nello Zambia: un approccio dinamico Questo studio analizza il contributo dinamico degli investimenti pubblici e privati alla crescita economica nello Zambia dal 1970 al 2014. In questa analisi è incluso anche l’importante contributo che gli investimenti pubblici portano alla crescita attraendo gli investimenti privati. Lo studio utilizza il modello ARDL (autoregressive distributed lag) per la valutazione della crescita economica e degli investimenti privati. Vi sono evidenze empiriche che gli investimenti privati contribuiscono più di quelli pubblici alla crescita economica nello Zambia, sia nel breve che nel lungo periodo. Inoltre importanti investimenti pubblici, infrastrutturali e non, risultano avere un effetto spiazzamento sugli investimenti privati nel lungo periodo. I risultati della ricerca implicano che i contributi degli investimenti sia privati che pubblici alla crescita economica nello Zambia possono essere migliorati aumentando gli investimenti pubblici nelle infrastrutture.
P12|Public and private investment and economic growth in Zimbabwe: An empirical test|This study performs an examination on the impact of public and private investment on economic growth and the crowding effect of public investment on private investment in Zimbabwe from 1970 to 2014. The study utilised the newly developed autoregressive distributed lag-bounds testing approach with better small sample properties than the traditional cointegration techniques. The results show that public investment has a higher short-run growth impact, but in the long run the private investment-led growth is more important. In addition, while gross public investment crowds out private investment, infrastructural public investment has a long-run crowding in effect. A non-infrastructural public investment was also reported to have a short-run crowding out effect on private investment. The results suggest that the productivity of public and private investment in Zimbabwe can be improved by cutting back on non-infrastructural public investment to basic minimum level while stimulating the growth in infrastructural public investment.
P12|“Corporate Scene Investigation”: A Praxeological Attempt to Sketch the Profile of the Entrepreneur in Modern Business|Mature capitalism and market economy realities become intelligible also by scrutinizing their “prodigal children”: modern business corporations. But these are not some undivided entities. Beyond the place in the global division of labour, they are fiefs of in-built specialization among the corporate governance stakeholders, each of them representing individual-based aggregations of pure catallactic functions. With an atomized, anonymous, asymmetrical and amalgamated ownership in a globalized capital market, with the multi-level directorship, delegated to harmonize profit-orientated investment interests, with creditors, but also with other suppliers of factors of production, modern corporations seem to have overshadowed both the real entrepreneurs-actors as well as the pure corresponding function. Our article is a (praxeo)logical exercise to pinpoint and reveal the realistic field of definition of the “entrepreneurship function” within the modern corporate spectrum, delimiting and portraying the entrepreneurial aspect out of the real characters that inhabit the corporate entourage (precisely said, of shareholders, managers, creditors). It seems that the modern literature on the law and economics of the firm has lost sight of the entrepreneur(ship), whose presence is felt but rarely positively identified. The endeavour to locate and isolate this, along with the associated incentives and logic of action is a task with some analytical merits. A thorough discrimination of the entrepreneurs’ position inside the corporate field and, respectively, of the “natural” vs. “allowed” decision spheres can generate sounder judgments about the wellstructured and poorly-structured companies (good vs. poor corporate governance) or about institutions found to be business (un)friendly (good vs. poor corporate law-making). We define “good governance” at the level of the corporate form the situation when incentives are aligned with rights and obligations, and the “good law” the norm which does not alter the common sense of property rights and freedom of contracting. Without knowing them, any legal organization of the corporate form will be fraught with problems.
P12|The Performance Of Large Enterprises In Manufacturing. The Case Of Romania|Manufacturing industry includes all processes related to the manufacturing of raw materials and /or some components and has 24 sub-sectors. In this paper, the goal of the research is the analysis of large manufacturing companies active in Romania, ie those companies that have a number of workers between 250 and 999 employees, in terms of economic and financial performance in 2008-2013 . For this purpose we analyzed operating income, profit / loss and operating margin to evaluate financial performance, and the evolution of exports and imports, gross added value and the number of workers to assess economic performances.
P12|Russia's Legal Transitions: Marxist Theory, Neoclassical Economics and the Rule of Law|We review the role of economic theory in shaping the process of legal change in Russia during the two transitions it experienced during the course of the twentieth century: the transition to a socialist economy organised along the lines of state ownership of the means of production in the 1920s, and the transition to a market economy which occurred after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s. Despite differences in methodology and in policy implications, Marxist theory, dominant in the 1920s, and neoclassical economics, dominant in the 1990s, offered a similarly reductive account of law as subservient to wider economic forces. In both cases, the subordinate place accorded to law undermined the transition process. Although path dependence and history are frequently invoked to explain the limited development of the rule of law in Russia during the 1990s, policy choices driven by a deterministic conception of law and economics also played a role.
P12|The social value of productive entrepreneurship|This book presents some of Zoltán J. Ács’ most important contributions since the turn of the the new millennium, with a particular intellectual focus on the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship. This approach was shaped by three major events: the rapid globalization that occurred in the first decade of the 21st century; research on the role institutions have played in economic development during the past few decades; and the spread of entrepreneurial activity around the world following the collapse of communism at the end of the 20th century. This entrepreneurial activity has given rise to many questions of theory, measurement and policy.
P12|The social value of productive entrepreneurship|As a critical contribution to the literature on social entrepreneurship, this paper provides structure and clarity to this concept, situating it within the context of charity and philanthropy as sources of social value creation. Identifying social entrepreneurship as creating both social and economic value, we discuss productive, unproductive, and destructive entrepreneurship in terms of social value creation. To illustrate these issues comparative case studies are presented on Microsoft Corporation and Grameen Bank. Even if their successes have been derived from different motivations, these highly innovative ventures have created significant economic and social value.

P12|Familias empresarias y grandes empresas familiares en América Latina y España: una visión de largo plazo|Son numerosos los libros y artículos que analizan las claves del éxito de las familias empresarias y grupos familiares que perduran en el tiempo, si bien la gran mayoría de los negocios registrados como empresas desaparecen en dos generaciones. Aunque esos datos pudieran hacer pensar en el fracaso de este tipo de empresas, a través del estudio de los mayores negocios familiares de ocho países de América Latina y España a lo largo de más de un siglo, esta obra pone de manifiesto que las familias empresarias desaparecen de una empresa y surgen en otras continuando con la actividad a lo largo de décadas en un continuo proceso de adaptación, diversificándose en sectores que presentan mayores expectativas de rentabilidad o seguridad, alterando para ello la denominación jurídica de los negocios, el organigrama o los esquemas de gobierno. Con la metodología propia de la historia empresarial que combina archivos públicos y privados, entrevistas con un enfoque interdisciplinar, y con la participación de veintidós especialistas de once países, este libro revela que en América Latina y España son las familias empresarias, a través de empresas independientes o grupos, la clave histórica de la riqueza de los territorios en los que se desarrollan. Esta monografía se acompaña por un portal, accesible a través del sitio web de la Fundación BBVA, en el que se presentan distintos recursos adicionales como un análisis estadístico y gráfico de los datos resultado de esta investigación, además de una base de datos con la información sobre los mayores negocios familiares en los nueve países analizados para el año 2010. El conjunto de esta obra proporciona una herramienta de utilidad para un público lector del ámbito académico, así como para consultores y gestores económicos.
P12|Scale, Scope and Survival: A Comparison of Cooperative and Capitalist Modes of Production|This paper draws on a comprehensive data set from Portugal to investigate the activities, internal characteristics and survival prospects of cooperatives and capitalist enterprises. Consistent with theory, high levels of market concentration and low entry costs were shown to be conducive to cooperatives. Cooperatives were found to be, on average, older and to operate with a larger, more highly educated and more productive labour force than do their capitalist counterparts. Finally, we show that cooperatives have a markedly higher probability of survival than do capitalist enterprises due, in part, to differences in industry of operation and internal characteristics.

P12|Revisiting Neoclassical Economic Growth: A Survey in the Literature|During the second half of the twentieth century economists have build newer models of economic growth that consider policy influences of growth and divergent outcomes among countries. These models address issues concerning economic growth, operation of financial markets, trade policy, government expenditures, and taxation. In this essay we have revisited the interdependence of political and economic institutions, taking the neoclassical growth model of Solow (1956) as a point of departure, which maintains that long run economic growth can be explained by capital accumulation, population growth and technological progress. We first discuss the evolution of the neoclassical school of economics in a historical context, and the role of various institutions in engendering economic growth. Subsequently the role of government spending, political stability, property rights and special interest groups (SIG’s) affect economic growth have been discussed, and how these institutions can explain different countries to grow at divergent rates and achieve different levels of wealth.
P12|The Politics of Industry in Nehru's India|The paper argues that the Indian Managing Agencies that controlled most industrial firms and their associated enterprises were themselves embodiments of pre-industrial forms of capital, accumulated through trading and moneylending. This militated against technological dynamism within the industrial firms because the managing agencies applied a profit maximising calculus across their various business activities, rather than in relationship to any individual firm. The group structure, in fact, facilitated the leakage of surpluses generated in industrial activity into the parallel speculative and money lending interests of the Managing Agents. After independence, the Government’s attempts to reform the industrial sector met resistance from politically influential businessmen who had supported the national anti-colonial movement. The British Government also interceded here. The social engineering that these reforms entailed, embodied in legislation, was thwarted by the combined pressures exerted by affected businessmen, but this should not prevent an appreciation of what the state was attempting.
P12|Crisis without End: Neoliberalism in a Globalized Environment Modeling the Historic Rise of Neoliberalism and its Systematic Role in Recent Economic Downturns|Since the 1970’s, both politically and theoretically, neoliberalism as an ideology has been on a persistent rise to the point where, in the twenty first century, it has garnered hegemonic dominance. Despite several recurring crises in countries since the ascendance of neoliberalism, we yet remain reluctant to point out the political economy philosophy as the root cause of the crises. Instead, many of the academics within Economics prefer to offer bouts of highly technical reasons for the downturn- this is especially true and almost solely applicable to those who practice within the ‘neoclassical’ conjecture of Economics. In a typical Marxian sense, one would have to look no further than the economic system to determine both economic and social outcomes of a country. What dictates that economic system however is the political philosophy of the leaders who guide the economic system- the policy makers. This paper attempts to show the neoliberal political philosophy, as the common thread for major crises within the last two decades. It also proposes a societal trinity for which change is driven through complexed interactions among the political, economic and social spheres.
P12|The Impact of Economic Freedom on the Unemployment Rate in O.E.C.D. Nations: An Exploratory Study Accepting the Validity of Okun’s Law - L’impatto della libertà economica sul tasso di disoccupazione nei paesi Ocse: uno studio esplorativo sulla base dell’accettazione della legge di Okun|This exploratory study empirically investigates the hypothesis that the higher the degree of economic freedom in a nation, the lower the unemployment rate in that nation, ceteris paribus. This hypothesis is based on the idea that greater economic freedom leads to greater real GDP growth, which in turn reduces the unemployment rate. As such, it represents a de facto acceptance (in principle) of Okun’s Law. The framework studied consists of a dataset for the member nations of the OECD (except Iceland) during the period 2003 to 2007, which precedes the Great Recession. The model in this exploratory study, which integrates a measure of the tax burden, a long term interest rate, and a measure of political stability, along with a measure of overall economic freedom, provides estimations finding that the unemployment rate is a decreasing function of the overall average level of economic freedom. Robustness testing, which involves narrowing the definition of the economic freedom measure and introducing a variable reflecting regulatory quality, leads to same conclusion, namely, that greater economic freedom reduces the unemployment rate. - Questo studio presenta una verifica empirica sull’ipotesi secondo cui, a parità di condizioni, maggiore è il livello di libertà economica in un paese, minore sarà il tasso di disoccupazione. Tale ipotesi si basa sull’idea che una maggiore libertà economica porti ad una maggior crescita del PIL reale, che a sua volta riduce il tasso di disoccupazione. Ciò rappresenta l’accettazione de facto della legge di Okun. Il modello si basa su un dataset per i paesi Ocse (esclusa l’Islanda) durante il periodo 2003-2007, cioè prima della grande crisi. Questo modello, che si basa su un indice di pressione fiscale, sul tasso di interesse a lungo termine e su un indicatore di stabilità politica, insieme a un indice della apertura economica generale, fornisce stime che evidenziano che il tasso di disoccupazione è una funzione decrescente del livello generale medio della libertà economica. I test di robustezza, che includono una definizione più ristretta di libertà economica e l’introduzione di una variabile che riflette la qualità dei controlli, porta alla stessa conclusione: una maggiore libertà economica riduce la disoccupazione.
P12|From Long Waves to Great Surges|This article maps the continuation of the late Chris Freeman’s work on long waves as well as my own contributions along those lines. It begins with a brief summary of the contents of his 2001 book with Francisco Louca, As Time Goes By: from the Industrial Revolutions to the Information Revolution, where they, first, theoretically make the case for long waves in the capitalist economy on the basis of ‘reasoned history’ and they, then, qualitatively describe each of the successive technological revolutions and the transformations they bring. Next, the article presents the reasons for my own abandonment of the term “long waves” for that of “great surges” followed by the research consequences of shifting the focus from the rate of economic growth to the patterns of diffusion of each set of revolutionary technologies. Finally it draws the implications for policy making of the recurring sequence thus identified, which is the purpose Chris Freeman always pursued himself and encouraged us all to pursue.
P12|From CSR to RSC|The task of this paper is to trace the academic discourse on corporate social responsibility (CSR) by discussing how CSR approaches and models relate profit goals and social goals of the corporation. I show that CSR approaches that dominate the academic discourse either instrumentalize the social, idealize the corporate, or separate the corporate from the social. Based on a critical political economy perspective I argue that it is necessary to consider mutual interrelations between profit goals and social goals. This perspective reveals an antagonism between the corporate and the social that points to the impossibility of CSR. Critical CSR research thus far has failed to draw the necessary conclusions from its own analysis: despite acknowledging the structural flaws of the concept of CSR, critics have hardly made any attempts to overcome it. I argue that despite its ideological character CSR contains a rational element. Realizing this rational kernel however requires going beyond CSR. I therefore suggest a new concept that turns CSR off its head and places it upon its feet.
P12|Labor in the Twenty-First Century:The Top 0.1% and the Disappearing Middle-Class|The ongoing explosion of the incomes of the richest households and the erosion of middle-class employment opportunities for most of the rest have become integrally related in the now-normal operation of the U.S. economy. Since the beginning of the 1980s, employment relations in U.S. industrial corporations have undergone three major structural changes â€“ summarized as â€œrationalization,â€ â€œmarketization,â€ and â€œglobalizationâ€ â€“ that have permanently eliminated middle-class jobs in the United States. From the early 1980s, rationalization, characterized by plant closings, terminated the jobs of high-school educated blue-collar workers, most of them well-paid union members. From the early 1990s, marketization, characterized by the end of a career with one company as an employment norm, placed the job security of middle-aged whitecollar workers, many of them college educated, in jeopardy. From the early 2000s, globalization, characterized by the movement of employment offshore to lower-wage nations, left all members of the U.S. labor force, whatever their educational credentials and work experience, vulnerable to displacement. Initially, these structural changes in employment could be justified as business responses to changes in technologies, markets, and competitors. Once U.S. corporations transformed their employment relations, however, they often pursued rationalization, marketization, and globalization to cut current costs rather than to reposition themselves to produce competitive products. Defining superior corporate performance as ever-higher quarterly earnings per share, companies turned to massive stock repurchases to â€œmanageâ€ their own corporationsâ€™ stock prices. Trillions of dollars that could have been spent on innovation and job creation in the U.S. economy over the past three decades have instead been used to buy back stock for the purpose of manipulating stock prices. Legitimizing this financialized mode of corporate resource allocation has been the ideology, itself a product of the 1980s and 1990s, that a business corporation should be run to â€œmaximize shareholder value.â€ Through their stock options and stock awards, corporate executives who make these resource-allocation decisions are themselves prime beneficiaries of the focus on rising stock prices as the sole measure of corporate performance. While rationalization, marketization, and globalization undermined stable and remunerative employment structures, the â€œfinancializationâ€ of the U.S. corporation entailed the distribution of corporate cash to shareholders through stock repurchases, often in addition to generous cash dividends, and, incentivizing these distributions, the stock-based remuneration of top corporate executives. In this essay, I review evidence on the fundamental structural changes related to rationalization, marketization, and globalization that, since the early 1980s, have eroded U.S. middle-class employment opportunities. Then, I analyze how, in many different ways and in many different industries, the financialized mode of corporate resource allocation has undermined the prosperity of the U.S. economy. I go on to show how justified by the ideology that companies should be run to â€œmaximize shareholder value,â€ this financialized behavior boosts the remuneration of top corporate executives, providing a major explanation for the increasing concentration of income among the top 0.1% of U.S. households that is, through the very way it is achieved, based on the systematic destruction of middle-class employment opportunities available to members of the U.S. labor force.
P12|Notes sur Jean-Baptiste Say. Conception de l'économie en général et position face à l'esclavage en particulier|This article proposes a critical analysis of Jean-Baptiste Say’s thought on the economy in general and more specifically, on slavery. The first part deals with his general ideas on the economy, and studies how he defines value, capital and equilibrium of supply and demand on the markets (Say’s law). The second part concentrates on a less known issue, that of the points of view he adopted on slavery (and on colonies), in order to examine their strengths as well as their limitations. Say’s liberal followers often remember the famous « Say’s law » and the glorification of capital but discard the anti-slavery theses, which nevertheless constitute an advocacy for the liberation of the forces of production to the benefit of a triumphant capitalism.

P12|Pouvoir et économie politique. L'apport de François Perroux à l'analyse positive de la firme|This article is a contribution to the economics of the firm that aims at showing the theoretical relevance of the arguments and conceptualizations proposed by the French economist François Perroux to analyze the capitalist firms in a positive perspective. At the opposite of the mainstream economics, the social and political dimensions constitute in the Perrouxian thought the two crucial ingredients that allow to accurately analyze the power relationships that characterize the dynamics and the government regime of firms. The Janus relationship between agonism and cooperation seems to be at the heart of intra-firm power processes. Code JEL : A10 ; B40 ; L10 ; L20 ; P12
P12|L’andamento dell’occupazione nelle cooperative italiane negli anni della crisi: alcune evidenze a livello regionale|"Le imprese cooperative rappresentano, come noto, un modello peculiare che è molto diverso da quello delle imprese capitalistiche. Tale modello si basa su un insieme di valori, universalmente riconosciuti dall’Alleanza internazionale delle cooperative, come la partecipazione aperta e volontaria, il controllo democratico dei soci, l’autonomia e l’indipendenza, i rapporti con la comunità locale. Questi valori sono diffusi in tutto il mondo e conferiscono a queste specifiche imprese un ""vantaggio cooperativo"". Questa ricerca intende verificare sulla base di dati empirici la migliore performance delle imprese cooperative nell’ultimo decennio e più in particolare durante la crisi attuale, evidenziando il loro contributo al mantenimento dei livelli occupazionali. Il lavoro è diviso in due parti. Nella prima parte, vengono sottolineate alcune peculiarità delle imprese cooperative (riguardo al totale e alle cooperative sociali) soprattutto con riferimento al ruolo dei soci che sono, nella duplice veste di lavoratori e imprenditori, profondamente coinvolti nelle strategie delle imprese. Nella seconda parte della ricerca è analizzata la performance occupazionale delle imprese cooperative (e di quelle sociali) sulla base di dati regionali desunti dai censimenti Istat 2001 e 2011 e da alcune indagini qualitative."
P12|Extending the Analysis of Spontaneous Market Order to Governance|How much do markets depend on the state? The founders of the Austrian School of Economics saw a lot of room for markets but believed that government rules and regulations are needed to create framework for markets. More recent research, however, has shown that rules and regulations underpinning some of the most advanced markets such as stock markets have emerged from the market. This article discusses how Austrian economic insights about the importance of competition (although not atomistic competition), entrepreneurship, and consumer sovereignty can be applied to governance itself.

P12|Effects of the matching fund program on IPO and bankruptcy of SMEs in Korea|Most small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Korea struggle in financing R&D. Thus, the Korea Core Industrial Technology Investment Association (KITIA) was established to implement a matching fund program (MFP) to help SMEs with this undertaking. Applicant firms to the MFP are reviewed first based on their technology levels and are required to attract financing from venture capitalists (VCs), before receiving funds from the MFP. This paper, based on KITIAs MFP applicant data from 2001 to 2004, evaluates the performance of the MFP in terms of the success rate of funded SMEs’ initial public offerings (IPOs) and bankruptcy rates in relation to those SMEs that could not attract matching funds. Propensity score matching was used to eliminate selection bias from the data in order to assess the actual treatment effect of the MFP. According to the result of logistic regression applied to the matched data, MFP apparently did not have significant effects on IPO success and bankruptcy. This implies that MFP needs to allow VCs more time to evaluate SMEs covering qualitative aspects as well. It is expected that this change of structure can provide better performance of MFP in terms of IPO success and bankruptcy of matched SMEs. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
P12|Innovation in State-Owned Enterprises: Reconsidering the Conventional Wisdom| A very well-established economic literature maintains that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are inefficient as compared to privately owned ones (POEs). In this paper, I argue that SOEs' inefficiency is not due to state ownership per se, but is rather caused conditions other than ownership, to which SOEs often — though not necessarily always — relate. In particular, I focus on dynamic efficiency — specifically, the production of technological innovation — of SOEs in manufacturing industries, where SOEs should contend with POEs in a competitive environment. I suggest that targeted measures, which are aimed at increasing managers' commitment to long-term investment strategies and at reducing corruption and political interference — albeit complex and difficult to implement — can be much more (positively) impactful on long-run technical progress than the simple privatization of companies. This leaves room for exploration and implementation of policies that might reconcile state ownership and market competition in industrial sectors.
P12|Thirty Years|"This paper takes a view of the history of ""Stato e Mercato"" as a journal, reconstructing how different topics and issues have been studied over time. What has been specific to ""Stato e Mercato"" is a sociological and political science approach topolitical economy that considers the role of both political institutions and socio-cultural factors in explaining the economic action and phenomena. Over time ""Stato e Mercato"" has focused on different issues: from the autonomous impact of the system of interest representation on public policies to local development, varieties of capitalism, the functioning of the welfare state and the social foundations of economic innovation. In the early 1980s the approach of ""Stato e Mercato"" was innovative because it used a comparative method and, in relation to the Italian debate, tried to influence the scientific debate in economic sociology and political science, as well as the internal debate in the political culture, in particular in that of the left-wing."
P12|Models of Capitalism and the Crisis|This paper argues that the political economy and neo-institutionalistliteratures are now at a critical juncture. The traditional emphasis on comparative studies of different models of capitalism may in fact be giving way to longitudinal analyses of long-term trends common to all advanced capitalist societies in an attempt to understand the origins and the actual features of the current economic crisis. The paper first discusses the strengths and weaknesses, as well as the analytical and normative aims, of comparative studies of models of capitalism that have dominated these literatures in the last decades. Then it turns to more recent analyses of longterm trends that aim to understand the crisis of all capitalist societies, irrespectiveof their differences. In doing so, it offers a new perspective on the unusual depth and persistence of the current crisis by stressing the repeated failures of both market and state regulation in ensuring a capitalist development that consistently produces both efficiency and equity. It concludes by discussing the reasons for the resilience of recipes that are clearly unable to resolve the crisis. This resilience of neo-liberal ideas cannot be understood without reference to the dramatic change in the power resources of groups and classes and to the unresolved problem of which new actors could become the carriers of alternative ideas to overcome the crisis.
P12|Taking Crisis Seriously: Capitalism on Its Way Out|"Advanced capitalism has been in a critical condition since the 1970sbut this was not taken seriously enough by the reformist Left. Looking back at the successive crises of inflation, public debt and financialization, and pointing to the related long-term trends of declining growth, rising inequality and growing overallindebtedness, it is suggested that now, finally, capitalism is beyond repair. Among other things, there is no political capacity in a global economy to protect the three ""fictitious commodities"" - labor, nature and money - from all-out commodification and, ultimately, destruction. Moreover, five disorders of contemporary capitalism are reviewed for which no remedy is in sight: stagnation, oligarchic redistribution, the plundering of the public domain, corruption, and international anarchy."
P12|The Social Conditions for Economic Performance|Good economic performance is usually taken to mean high growthrates, cutting-edge competitiveness, regardless of distributional consequences. Call that EP 1. I argue that a better policy objective is EP2 - achieving a fast enough growth of productivity, combined with a distribution of the proceeds of growth that the great majority of the population can expect their children and grandchildren to be better off than themselves.
P12|"The Cambridge History of ""Capitalism"""|This review essay of the two-volume Cambridge History of Capitalism (2014), edited by Larry Neal and Jeffrey G. Williamson, is divided into three parts. First, I describe three chapters from the second volume that I recommend for all economists to add depth to their understanding of the world economy today. Robert C. Allen analyzes the world distribution of income; Randall Morck and Bernard Yeung discuss the history of business groups; and Peter Lindert surveys private and public programs to help the poor. In each case, they analyze historical backgrounds that illuminate current issues. Second, I criticize the definition of capitalism used in these volumes as too expansive to be useful. I argue that this definition mars the essays in first volume by stimulating a fruitless search for capitalism in the millennium before the Industrial Revolution. Third, I describe the essays in this reference work starting from the most recent and ending with those about antiquity.
P12|Impact of Economic Freedom, Regulatory Quality, and Taxation on the Per Capita Real Income: An Analysis for OECD Nations and Non-G8 OECD Nations|This study of the impacts of economic freedom, regulatory quality, and the relative burden of taxation on the level of per capita real income/GDP among OECD nations over the 2003-2007 period adopts a modified version of the overall economic freedom index computed by The Heritage Foundation (2013), one with the fiscal freedom and business freedom indices removed. This study then provides PLS fixed effects estimates for five linear specifications/models. Each nation during this time frame can be regarded either as a nation per se or as a de facto “economic region” within the OECD. The analysis first focuses upon all of the OECD nations and then, as a robustness test, subsequently focuses only on non-G8 OECD member nations. The estimations in this study all provide strong empirical support for the three central hypotheses proffered here, namely: (1) the higher the overall degree of economic freedom; the higher the per capita real income (GDP) level; (2) the higher the level of regulatory quality, the higher the level of per capita real income (GDP); and (3) the higher the overall tax burden, expressed as a percent of GDP, the lower the level of per capita real income (GDP).
P12|Schumpeter y la Historia del Pensamiento Económico<BR>[Schumpeter and the History of Economic Thought]|The History Schumpeter´s of Economic Analysis, is a tour de forcé of scholarship. The display of erudition is 'truly unbelievable. How could one man have acquired and then digested so much knowledge? Not only does the History offer two thousand years of economics, from Aristotle to Paul Samuelson, but also it ranges most expertly over all the other social sciences, history and belles lettres as well. For more than 1,100 pages the prose flows on in a way that one has come to expect from Schumpeterthe fluent style, the vivid analogy, the striking metaphor, the arresting aside. Our goal is to present the central ideas of Schumpeter on the complex relationships between Economic History and Epistemology of Science. This design has three aspects that interest us: (a) its amplitude to conceive the economy as part of the overall development of scientific knowledge; (b) its relevance applied and the examples used by the author; (c) its currently facing tremendous methodological problems facing the economy with the other sciences.
P12|On the fundamentals of winning virtuous strategies creation toward leveraged buyout transactions implementation during private equity investment in conditions of resonant absorption of discrete information in diffusion - type financial system with induced nonlinearities|The authors perform an original research on the fundamentals of winning virtuous strategies creation toward the leveraged buyout transactions implementation during the private equity investment in the conditions of the resonant absorption of discrete information in the diffusion - type financial system with the induced nonlinearities at the influences by the Schumpeterian creative disruption processes in the free market economy. We propose that the money is a financial computing process, which is executed by the operating system, representing an exchange medium, at a computing device. We make a comprehensive academic literature review on the various aspects of modern financial engineering approaches to make the private equity investments and design the leveraged buyout and venture capital firms, funds and transactions in the finances. We highlight a private equity’s important role in the Schumpeterian creative destruction processes in the free market economy, discussing the leverage buyout transactions process and properties. We develop the MicroLBO software: 1) to create the winning virtuous strategies toward the LBO transactions implementation, and 2) to compute the direct/reverse LBO transaction probability number for the selected public/private companies. We formulate the Ledenyov theory on the winning virtuous strategies creation toward the LBO transactions implementation at the resonant absorption of discrete information in the diffusion - type financial economic system with the induced nonlinearities.
P12|On the fundamentals of winning virtuous strategies creation toward leveraged buyout transactions implementation during private equity investment in conditions of resonant absorption of discrete information in diffusion - type financial system with induced nonlinearities|The authors perform an original research on the fundamentals of winning virtuous strategies creation toward the leveraged buyout transactions implementation during the private equity investment in the conditions of the resonant absorption of discrete information in the diffusion - type financial system with the induced nonlinearities in particular, and at the influences by the Schumpeterian creative disruption processes in the free market economy in general. Going from the academic literature, we make a comprehensive review on the various aspects of modern financial engineering approaches to make the private equity investments and design the leveraged buyout and venture capital firms, funds and transactions in the finances. We highlight a private equity’s important role in the Schumpeterian creative destruction processes in the free market economy, discussing the leverage buyout transactions process and the accurate characterization of the leverage buyout transactions properties at the resonant absorption of discrete information in the diffusion - type financial system with the induced nonlinearities. We formulate the Ledenyov theory on the winning virtuous strategies creation toward the leveraged buyout transactions implementation during the private equity investment in the conditions of the resonant absorption of discrete information in the diffusion - type financial system with the induced nonlinearities.
P12|Role of the State in Economy and State Capitalism. The Case of Singapore|The article deals with problems of state capitalism. It can be defined as maximisation of political control over economy and society and it is used as the characteristics of systems which exist in China, Russia, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, etc. State capitalism used to be effective in early periods of development when resources had to be concentrated. Corporations under state ownership are also able to compete on global markets and take advantage of their size and political support. Singapore represents an original connection of economic freedom and authoritarian capitalism. It is based on a free-market foreign-oriented economy which stresses financial market development, infrastructure, education, macroeconomic surroundings and fiscal management. The state as an owner and creator of the institutional framework plays an important role.
P12|Employee financial participation in businesses: Is it worth discussing?|This paper is an overview of the achievements in the area of employee financial participation (EFP) during the last fifty years. It addresses the question of the extent to which EFP is relevant in today’s world. EFP is distinguished from participation in management (industrial democracy), and the various types of EP are discussed. The major arguments for EFP are presented and discussed critically. The evolution of major forms of EFP, the scale of their operation in several advanced economies, and the legal and tax incentives for EFP are described. The efforts of European Union bodies to popularise this idea in all member countries are illustrated. Showing that EFP has become a broadly recognised principle of modern management in thousands of enterprises, we consider opportunities for disseminating these solutions on a wider scale, in particular in Poland. Finally, a number of directions for further research on financial participation are considered.
P12|The Impact of Economic Freedom on Per Capita Real GDP: A Study of OECD Nations| This study of the impact of economic freedom on per capita real GDP among OECD nations over the 2002-2006 period, with each OECD nation during this time frame being treated as a de facto “economic region” within the OECD, finds strong initial support for the hypothesis proffered here, namely, the higher the degree of economic freedom, the higher the level of economic activity and hence the higher the per capita real GDP level. In particular, the per capita real GDP level in each of the nations (regions) in existence as OECD members (except Iceland) over the study period is shown, using fixed-effects PLS estimations, to be an increasing function of business freedom, freedom from corruption, investment freedom, monetary freedom, government size freedom, trade freedom, and property rights freedom. By contrast, these preliminary estimations find that labor freedom, financial freedom, and fiscal freedom do not exercise a statistically significant impact on per capita real GDP (income).
P12|I modelli di capitalismo|The paper analyzes the various systems of capitalism and the differences among the scheme of the principal countries. While the private ownership of the means of production is present in the most countries, there are differences in the activity played by the State, by the market and by the institutions. The effect of the different systems is reflected into the ownership structures of the firm, the corporate governance, the scope and coverage of the social welfare system, the role of financial markets and the employment level. The paper considers also the difficulties due to the globalization, the way to capitalism of transition and emerging countries. At the end, it analyzes the world perspective connected with the emerging economies, after the financial crisis of the last years.
P12|Contrôle et manipulation au cœur de la firme-monde ?|L’objectif de cette contribution est de questionner la nature des relations de pouvoir qui caractérisent le régime de gouvernement des grandes firmes modernes, appréhendées ici sous le vocable de « firmes-monde ». L’originalité de cet article exploratoire est double. D’une part, il ambitionne – après avoir rappelé ce qu’est une firme-monde – de mêler au sein d’une même analyse une réflexion sur le gouvernement interne (relation d’emploi) et une réflexion sur le gouvernement externe des firmes-monde (relation de sous-traitance internationale) en utilisant un prisme particulier : le pouvoir. D’autre part, il propose de développer un nouveau concept, celui de contrôlation (néologisme issu du mariage des deux lemmes : contrôle et manipulation) afin de dépeindre la complexité et la subtilité des régimes de gouvernement de ces firmes qui se fondent sur une véritable fragmentation et sur une tout aussi manifeste subversion des frontières régulatoires du capitalisme industriel.
P12|The U.S. economy today: Between systemic crisis and permanent war|This paper studies the U.S. economy from an original point of view: that of the links existing between crisis and war. The first part analyzes the workings of the current crisis, considered to be a “systemic” one. The second part places the U.S. economy at the very heart of this crisis. The third part emphasizes the limitations of the anti-crisis policies that are being implemented, as well as the “currency war” issue. Then, the central focus moves towards U.S. warfare as a permanent feature. In a fifth part, the author examines the control exercized by finance capital on the military sector, including military-industrial complex and privately owned military companies. And finally, it examines how these links between crisis and war exacerbe the current capitalist contradictions
P12|The Great Pyramids of America: A Revised History of US Business Groups, Corporate Ownership and Regulation, 1930-1950|Most listed firms are freestanding in the U.S, while listed firms in other countries often belong to business groups: lasting structures in which listed firms control other listed firms. Hand-collected historical data illuminate how the present ownership structure of the United States arose: (1) Until the mid-20th century, US corporate ownership was unexceptional: large pyramidal groups dominated many industries; (2) About half of these resembled groups elsewhere today in being industrially diversified and family controlled; but the others were tightly focused and had widely held apex firms; (3) US business groups disappeared gradually, primarily in the 1940s, and by 1950 were largely gone; Their demise took place against growing concerns that they posed a threat to competition and even to society; (4) The data link the disappearance of business groups to reforms that targeted them explicitly – the Public Utility Holding Company Act (1935) and rising intercorporate dividend taxation (after 1935), or indirectly – enhanced investor protection (after 1934), the Investment Company Act (1940) and escalating estate taxes. Banking reforms and rejuvenated antitrust enforcement may have indirectly contributed too. These reforms, sustained in a lasting anti-big business climate, promoted the dissolution of existing groups and discouraged the formation of new ones. Thus, a multi-pronged reform agenda, sustained by a supportive political climate, created an economy of freestanding firms.
P12|Новая Теория Капитализма: Узловые Моменты И Общая Логика<BR>[A New Theory of Capitalism: Nodal Moments and General Logic]|"A new theory of capitalism is suggested. Its key moments and general logic are presented. This theory is based on the distinction between two market types – the simple commodity market and the capitalist one. Disequilibrium and ""imperfect competition"" are admitted to be a functional norm of capitalism. Respectively, an equilibrium and ""perfect competition"" are admitted to be a functional anomaly; crises are considered as the result of such an anomaly. General principles and concrete measures of crisis-proof policy and crisis-proof behavior are suggested."
P12|Liberté toujours? Gerechtigkeit und Gemeinschaft in neoliberalen Arbeitsregimen am Beispiel der Amway GmbH (Liberté toujours? Justice and Community in Neoliberal Work Regimes. The Example of Amway Germany)|Freiheit und Selbstbestimmung sind zentrale Werte unserer heutigen Arbeitswelt: Die Beziehungen zwischen Organisationen und Arbeitskraeften werden marktorientierter, Beschaeftigungsrisiken muessen zunehmend von Individuen getragen werden und Unternehmertum wird zum Ideal arbeitnehmerischen Handelns. Am Beispiel einer qualitativen Fallstudie zur Amway GmbH untersuchen wir wie die mit einer individuellen Leistungsverantwortung verbundenen Gerechtigkeits- und Gemeinschaftsprobleme durch ein Unternehmen „geloest“ bzw. abgeschwaecht werden koennen. Wir kennzeichnen das diesbezuegliche Arrangement als einen „sozialen Kontrakt“, der entlang von vier Dimensionen eine Balance zwischen den Werten Freiheit, Gemeinschaft und Gerechtigkeit herzustellen versucht und diskutieren Besonderheiten und moegliche Verallgemeinerungen unserer Fallstudie. (Freedom and self-determination are central values in our current world of work: The relationships between organizations and employees get more market-oriented, individuals are increasingly required to cope with employment risks themselves, and entrepreneurialism has become the ideal for how people should work. This article draws upon a qualitative case study into the German branch of the Amway Corporation for discussing how neo-liberal work arrangements may lead to tensions and problems with the values of justice and community and how organizations seek to address and partially solve these tensions. We argue that Amway’s efforts of dealing with these tensions can be conceptualized as a ‘social contract’ and we discuss to what extent the Amway case can be generalized and the role social contracts play in addressing such tensions.)
P12|Capitalisme agraire en Indonésie : les marchés du travail et de la terre comme déterminants des rapports salariaux dans les plantations de palmier à huile|Avec la mondialisation des échanges s’observe à l’heure actuelle un mouvement rapide de développement du capitalisme agraire. Les grandes plantations, figure emblématique de cette forme de production agricole et héritage direct de la période coloniale, sont l’objet d’un intérêt politique accru dans plusieurs pays de la zone intertropicale. C’est le cas des grandes plantations de palmier à huile en Indonésie, dont le développement est largement soutenu par les gouvernements successifs depuis les années 1970. Cet article interroge les conditions de l’expansion de ces grandes plantations par l’analyse du rapport salarial et des ressorts de la stabilisation des ouvriers au sein des plantations. Il ressort d’une étude de terrain menée au sein de six grandes plantations que, dans ce contexte d’État social libéral paternaliste, les politiques sociales des compagnies de plantation sont directement influencées par le marché local du travail. Toutefois, l’étude des trajectoires d’accumulation des ouvriers montre que la demande en travail n’est pas l’unique facteur explicatif : dans les zones de front pionnier où sont mises en place de nouvelles plantations privées depuis les années 1980, l’accès à la propriété foncière est un second paramètre qui influe le rapport salarial. Le rôle majeur que jouent les compagnies dans la définition des protections sociales, ainsi que celui du foncier dans la constitution de protections complémentaires, explique les fortes disparités en termes de sécurité des ouvriers de plantation.
P12|La participación de los trabajadores en los ingresos de la empresa. Un análisis para la eficiencia<BR>[The participation of the workers in the income of the company. An analysis of efficiency]|En este trabajo se analiza la relación de empleo en una empresa capitalista convencional. Su punto de partida es el carácter de información privada que tiene el desempeño del empleado. Esto hace que la relación contractual entre el empresario y el trabajador conlleve un problema relativo al esfuerzo que el trabajador dedica a la empresa. En el presente trabajo se estudian dos posibles soluciones a dicho problema: la supervisión por parte del empresario y la participación en los ingresos de la empresa por parte del trabajador, comparando ambas soluciones con la de first-best. La principal conclusión de nuestro análisis es la superioridad técnica de la empresa participativa sobre la jerárquica debido al ahorro engastos de supervisión.
P12|Estructura corporativa e interlocking directorates en las mayores empresas españolas, 1917-1970|This paper analyzes some of the characteristics of Spanish capitalism between 1917 and 1970. For that purpose, we resort to the technique known as interlocking directorates and applies the methodology of social network analysis (SNA) to the board of directors of the 210 largest Spanish companies, in a benchmark dates (1917, 1930, 1948 and 1970). The results allow us to answer the questions of what has been the evolution of the Spanish business structure over the twentieth century and which sectors have been central to each of the moments analyzed. At the same time, we identify the main groups of companies, and the links established among them, assessing the role of financial sector in the national economic structure. Based on the relationships between the members of the Board of Directors and social capital theory, the second objective identifies the circle of Spanish economic power, quantifies the degree of cohesion, and follow its evolution over time, confirming its continuity / disappearance.
P12|Does Linking Worker Pay to Firm Performance Help the Best Firms Do Even Better?|"This paper analyzes the linkages among group incentive methods of compensation, labor practices, worker assessments of workplace culture, turnover, and firm performance in a non-representative sample of companies: firms that applied to the ""100 Best Companies to Work For in America"" competition from 2005 to 2007. Although employers with good labor practices self- select into the 100 Best Companies firms sample, which should bias the analysis against finding strong associations among modes of compensation, labor policies, and outcomes, we find that in the firms that make more extensive use of group incentive pay employees participate more in decisions, have greater information sharing, trust supervisors more, and report a more positive workplace culture than in other companies. The combination of group incentive pay with policies that empower employees and create a positive workplace culture reduces voluntary turnover and increases employee intent to stay and raises return on equity. Finding these effects in the non-representative ""100 Best Companies"" sample strengthens the likelihood that the policies have a causal impact on employee well-being and firm performance."
P12|Scale, Scope and Survival: A Comparison of Labour-Managed and Capitalist Modes of Production|This paper draws on a comprehensive data set from Portugal to address three central themes in the labour-managed rm (LMF) literature: the types of activity undertaken by LMFs, their scale of operation and their survival prospects. The data allow individual rms to be tracked over a 25 year period and for comparisons to be made with capitalist rms. We nd rst, that the industrial distribution of LMFs is markedly di¤erent to that of capitalist rms and to the standard characterisation of the pattern of LMF activity. Second, LMFs are, on average, more than twice the size of their capitalist counterparts and third, the survival prospects of LMFs considerably exceed those of capitalist rms.
P12|A imposição do caráter social da produção por meio da concorrência [Imposition of the social nature of production through competition]|The aim of this paper is to show that for Marx, the social character of capitalist production is imposed upon private producers through competition. One direct consequence of this type of resolution of the social nature of production is that social reproduction has a turbulent character that contrasts with equilibrium.
P12|Kommunisten, Kapitalisten und Konsumenten: ueber den Wandel der normativen Einstellungen chinesischer Unternehmer und Konsumenten seit 1978. (Communists, capitalists, and consumers: On the evolving norms of Chinese entrepreneurs and consumers since 1978)|Die chinesische Wirtschaftsreform seit 1978 hat den ethischen Diskurs vielfaeltiger gemacht. Im Spannungsfeld zwischen Kommunisten, Kapitalisten und Konsumenten entstehen zum Teil voellig neue Normvorstellungen und Wertebotschaften. Diese Entwicklung ist zum einen durch eine hohe Widerspruechlichkeit und Schnelllebigkeit gekennzeichnet. Andererseits beschreibt sie einen tiefgreifenden Wertewandel der chinesischen Konsumgesellschaft, auf den sich Unternehmen einstellen muessen. (Chinese economic reform since 1978 has pluralized the country’s ethical discourse. Communists, capitalists, and consumers compete against each other on the basis of newly emerging norms and values. This development is characterized by widespread inconsistencies and fast moving changes. At the same time, Chinese consumer society is undergoing a deep rooted transformation that business has to adapt to and deal with.)

P12|The Impact Of The Statement Of Gaap For Sme’S In South Africa| Even though various support initiatives for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have been introduced in recent times, there are also many limiting characteristics of SMEs, such as a lack of 'formality' in terms of accounting procedures. The introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) made it even more difficult for SMEs to adhere to accounting requirements. In 2007 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) proposed less stringent reporting requirements for SMEs with the release of the exposure draft on IFRS for SMEs and South Africa became the first country to formally adopt these reporting requirements as a Statement of GAAP. In this study the impact of these reporting requirements on SMEs are explored, based on the current South African SME’s reporting and disclosure practices. It was found that there is a considerable difference between the contents of the Statement of GAAP for SMEs and current reporting for SMEs.
P12|Italian Firms in History: Size, Technology and Entrepreneurship|The economic performance of a country depends, among other things, on the strategies and structures of its firms. In the framework that is designed by institutions and policies and determined by technology and macroeconomic cycles, entrepreneurs decide how to allocate available resources in order to face off competitors and to hook up with demand cycles. This paper looks at the evolution of the Italian economy across the last 150 years from a business history perspective. Analyzing Italian firms over the long-term cycles of the global economy and with respect to the different paradigms of the three industrial revolutions, we identify some structural features that explain successes and failures of the Italian economy. In doing this we explicitly connect the micro level of the business enterprise to the macro one of the national business system and explain the comparatively good performance of the Italian economy from the end of the 19th century to the 1970s. Over the last three decades this performance has turned negative, highlighting the role played by the small average size of firms and the failure of institutions to provide incentives for growth.
P12|The Kuznets curve: determinants of its shape and the role of finance|Purpose - This paper aims to study the importance of initial resource endowments, the savings rate, and financing opportunities for growth and the distribution of income. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is based on a theoretical model of accumulation and applies simulations. The frame of presentation is the so-called Kuznets curve. Findings - The paper shows under what circumstances the inverted U-shaped curve hypothesized by Kuznets emerges and clarifies the role of a functioning capital market for economic growth and the distribution of income. It turns out that when initial income disparities are high and the savings rate is low it cannot be taken for granted that economic growth leads to a more equal income distribution. The paper further shows that with an efficient capital market total income rises faster and further and inequality is always lower than without a functioning capital market. Research limitations/implications - Future research should help to identify the institutional and regulatory frameworks that promote a stable basic financial infrastructure. Originality/value - By drawing on the concept of a hydraulic society the interplay of key factors that drive economic growth and income inequality can be clarified.
P12|Welfare systems and social services during the systemic crisis of cognitive capitalism|The purpose of this article is to show that, contrary to neoliberal belief, social welfare services and spending should be recognised as the driving force behind a development dynamics based on knowledge-intensive production. In the first part, we shall briefly present the relationship between public debt and private debt. In the second part, we shall present a series of stylised facts which highlight the key role played by welfare state institutions in the genesis and development of a knowledge-based economy. In the third part, these general considerations will be corroborated through an international comparison between the Nordic welfare model and the Anglo-Saxon welfare model. This comparison reveals a strong positive correlation between the level of development of welfare state institutions and that of a knowledge-based economy.
P12|L’innovation de la communication dans le développement durable des ressources humaines|L’innovation de la communication dans le développement durable des ressources humaines développe une analyse des pratiques de la communication. Partant du constat que nous ne parlons pas forcément de la même chose quand nous parlons de communication il s’agit de présenter les concepts à partir d’un axe central: l’information n’est pas de la communication. Si la communication a un grand rôle dans l’évolution des organisations, elle ne peut pas tout. En rappelant les fondements de la communication nous montrons ce que peut être l’apport de la communication au développement des ressources humaines dans les organisations. La communication n’est pas un système unique, elle correspond bien à des besoins et à des règles. Elle ne peut s’appliquer d’une manière uniforme à tous les pays, toutes les organisations et toutes les personnes.
P12|Business Society and Corporate Social Responsibility: Comparative analysis in Russia and Japan|Comparative analysis of CSR allows characterizing both corporate society and market institutions. Even though transition economies have backwardness of corporate governance institutions and include premature CSR, Russian CSR, paradoxically speaking, can be regarded as hyper one, and specific stakeholders have played a decisive role in its establishment. The present paper empirically and descriptively analyzed evolution of the contemporary Russian CSR and described its characteristics. Observations made show that market-type changes are obvious in Russia, companies try to adapt to the market changes, but at the same time, the historical inertia is quite strong. Moreover, through a comparison of CSR in Russia and Japan it was proved that a certain type of hybrid CSR exists in both countries, due to the existence of path-dependence institutions and a new impact of globalization.
P12|Social Enterprises and Local Production Systems|This paper explores the relationship between social enterprises and local production systems, starting from the fact that today the industrial districts themselves are no longer able to ensure the territorial cohesion which had been a decisive factor in their success. There is a growing need to make use of social goods in a personalized way, often satisfied by the local nonprofit sector. The need is therefore for governance at the local level, with dialogue between the manufacturing system and the services for the population, extending to all the people involved.
P12|Appropriation des savoirs et prescription de la subjectivité dans le travail cognitif|Computer work is a kind of cognitive work resulting from a social partnership which has a complex relationship with the social knowledge that permanently updates it. Unlike the industrial work, computer work is indistinguishable by observation but is very heterogeneous in content. Its organization involves the formation of teams, networks and projects of all kinds, in a continuum from the development of customized software, consultancy to video games and simulations. The resulting product refers to an informational good subject to the vicissitudes of intellectual property and the organization of computer work to the appropriation of knowledge and the prescription of a type of subjectivity that radically alters production notions of the industrial paradigm.
P12|Marx’s social analysis of value and Big Pharma. Rethinking the social determinants of value in cognitive capitalism|By analyzing the capitalist dynamics at work in the knowledge-based economy, cognitive capitalism has shown that the classical laws of value creation do not hold anymore. Rethinking the laws of value, however, is no easy task. The first section of this paper reconsiders Marx’s analysis of value, and demonstrates that Marx struggled by trying to mix two distinct and incompatible conceptions of value: the embodied labour approach and the social analysis of value. The paper argues that the former must be abandoned and that we need to focus only on the latter in order to better understand how value is being produced. To analyze the social production of value in cognitive capitalism, the second part of this paper builds on the case of the global pharmaceutical sector.
P12|La logique financiaro-rentière des sociétés transnationales|A basic hypothesis of this paper is that TNCs constitute a category of their own, based upon a centralisation of financial assets and a specific organisational structure (with the core role held by the holding company). TNCs can be defined as financial groups with industrial activities. Their business model has been deeply reshaped, as regards both their strategy and the management of their assets. Intangible assets, which make up the bulk of large TNCs’ stock capitalization, are analysed in this paper with the concept of goodwill (Veblen) and fictitious capital (Marx).
P12|The Impact of Lean Six Sigma on the Overall Results of Companies|"Lean Six Sigma represents a management approach for driving innovating processes inside a company in order to achieve superior results. It involves a practical analysis based on facts, aiming the innovation and growth, not only the efficiency of processes. It is a long term process of gradual and continuous improvement. The application of Lean Six Sigma in companies led to attaining superior financial performance by addressing new needs, by differentiating the products and services or by adjusting the business lines to new processes. Quality is more than making things without errors. It is about making a product or service meet the individual perception of a customer about the quality or value. Therefore, in what regards Lean Six Sigma, the concern is not only to ""do the things right"" but also to ""do the right things right"". We focus on the impact of implementing the Lean Six Sigma approach on companies, seeking for what changes and benefits it brings. The key elements it aims at are achieving the best quality, the lowest cost, getting the shortest lead-time, stressing on waste elimination. The requirements of a company for its implementation and the strategy to obtain the maximum practical outcome are investigated. Furthermore, we conduct a comparison analysis with the other methods of the total quality management and see why Lean Six Sigma is a more desirable approach."
P12|RSE et théorie des parties prenantes : les impasses du contrat|Cet article traite de la théorie des parties prenantes et de ce qu’elle implique pour la recherche sur la RSE et les pratiques en la matière. Tout d’abord, certaines faiblesses conceptuelles et théoriques sont relevées. Nous soulignons ensuite l’enracinement de la théorie des parties prenantes dans le contractualisme : une conception de la firme en termes de nœuds de contrats entre parties prenantes, inspirée de la théorie des coûts de transaction, une justification plus philosophique par les théories du contrat social et de la justice comme équité, inspirée des travaux de Rawls. Nous pointons les problèmes théoriques que cet enracinement contractualiste soulève avant d’en questionner les implications sociopolitiques. Fonder la RSE sur des conceptions inspirées de la théorie des parties prenantes risque de conduire à un libéralisme élargi, au volontarisme en matière de RSE et en définitive à une moralisation limitée d’un capitalisme débridé.
P12|Medios económicos y disciplinarios para combatir el incumplimiento de los socios de participar en las actividades de las cooperativas agrarias<BR>[Comparatibility of economic and disciplinary measures against the breach the participation in the activities of agricultural cooperatives]|La voluntad de contribuir al logro de un proyecto común, la fidelidad a los objetivos colectivos y el propósito de cumplir los compromisos adquiridos deberían ser las motivaciones básicas del socio de una cooperativa. Sin embargo, en demasiadas ocasiones, algunos cooperativistas no aportan a la empresa colectiva las cuantías comprometidas, perjudicando así los intereses de la entidad y del resto de los socios. A pesar de que estos comportamientos suponen una infracción del deber básico de participar en las actividades de la cooperativa, resulta difícil sancionar a los infractores y, todavía más, reparar los perjuicios económicos que ocasionan. Por ello, planteamos aquí la exploración de una vía complementaria a la vía sancionadora prevista en nuestras leyes para combatir los incumplimientos del deber de participar en la actividad típica de la cooperativa, que se conoce como “actividad cooperativizada”.
P12|China o el triunfo del mercantilismo en la era de la globalización|"El artículo analiza la condición económica de China contemporánea desde una perspectiva keynesiano-monetaria. La discusión sugiere como postulado teórico-empírico que la condición suficiente para la compleción del proceso de transformación e inserción del imperio del centro"" en el economía globalizada como potencia del Primer Mundo es la consolidación del yuan como dinero mundial. Se muestra que el desarrollo capitalista nacional en un contexto de economía abierta exige una estrategia mercantilista cuya lógica implica la instrumentalización del mercado mundial en función del interés económico nacional. La experiencia histórica de los antiguos países socialistas y el arduo proceso de ""acumulación originaria de capital"" de China advierten que la compleción del mismo no es evidente y que se puede fracasar en el intento. Tal es el dilema económico de China."""
P12|Does cultural diversity increase the rate of entrepreneurship?|In the economic development literature, cultural diversity (for example, ethnolinguistic fractionalization) has been shown to have a negative impact on economic outcomes in many underdeveloped countries. We hypothesize that the impact of diversity on economic performance depends on the quality of a country's institutions. Under bad institutions diversity leads to conflict and expropriation, while under good institutions diversity leads to economic progress. A culturally diverse society or interaction among different cultures encourages exchange of, and competition between ideas and different world views. Under good institutions, this amalgamation of ideas and views leads to greater entrepreneurial initiatives. We show that higher levels of cultural diversity increase the rate of entrepreneurship in the presence of good institutions using evidence from the United States.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P12|Agency Problems and the Fate of Capitalism|Economics has firms maximizing value and people maximizing utility, but firms are run by people. Agency theory concerns the mitigation of this internal contradiction in capitalism. Firms need charters, regulations and laws to restrain those entrusted with their governance, just as economies need constitutions and independent judiciaries to restrain those entrusted with government. Agency problems distort capital allocation if corporate insiders are inefficiently selected or incentivized, and this hampers economic growth absent a legal system with appropriate constraints. However, political economy problems and agency problems in corporations may reinforce each other, compromising the quality of both corporate governance and government.
P12|A New Paradigma Of The Economical Agent. From Adam Smith’S Homo Economicus To Homo Generosus Based On Social Responsibility|Analyzed form outside, many actions of the economical agent seem to be impulse by the self interest. As a prototype of this kind of person we have the Homo economicus as Adam Smith described it. In a blitz portrait we identify some characteristics: he is perfect rational, perfect egoist, perfect free, perfect competitive and perfect social. The aim of this research is to permute the barycentre from Homo economicus based on self interest, to Homo generosus, based on social responsibility. As a support we have used the prison dilemma to illustrate the roll of cooperation instead self interest. This new coordination will be analyzed to the level of ethical system. Homo economicus is identified in ethics of consequences and the homo generosus in ethics of duty. In my vision, the prototype of homo generosus, is delineated under Kant’s categorical imperative: respectful, based on principles as subject and sovereign.
P12|Economic theory and social change: problems and revisions|Although many economists do a serious and respectable work, main stream economic theory contains an almost complete disregard for the importance of social, cultural and political structures which are the very foundation of the society. Worse than that, such disregard is developed into arrogance when representatives and textbook maintain the illusions of economic main stream science as value free, and sometimes it is even asserted that only if the economic system could be free from disturbing interferences from collective bodies it would function even without any ethical principle. Such testimonies of ignorance of historical and philosophical knowledge and lack of understanding of social structures are not maintained by serious researchers of economic science but are more to be seen as ideological statements. However these testimonies are unfortunately based on a very specific apprehension of both the society as well as space and time from the 18th century where the scientific discoveries and theories of Gallilei and Newton was turned into a mechanistic and idealistic philosophy. True is that Adam Smith did not fully accept such a view but alongside the philosophical approaches of Kant and Hegel the economic theory by the later writings of Marx and the Neo-classical theorists made economic science into a machinery which culminated with Walras, Pareto and Pigou although it was mathematically refined in the so called Arrow&Debreu model. A main cause of the limitations of economics is its closure and excessive specialization in the context of sometimes very sophisticated modeling, formally rigorous but elusive of crucial aspects of reality, the causes of which remain therefore outside the adopted explanatory framework, as exogenous factors. It seems to us that a treatment of economics seen as a part of social thought is essential to an adequate deepening of social change and hence of economic dynamics. This general view will oblige us to dedicate an accurate analysis to the method of investigation and interpretation of social reality, and will imply a detailed critical review not only on mainstream economics but also the alternative proposals of a growing number of schools of thought. We shall see that our more comprehensive vision than the habitual ones is not hostile to a rigorous formalization of the economic process able to give the due importance to crucial features of the modern dynamic economies. A more detailed exposition of this matter will be given in the paragraph on the structure of the book. It is difficult to tell anything about the educational prerequisites in order to grasps the content of this book. We are well aware that much of the content is fairly abstract. But acquaintance with abstract reasoning is valuable and is not necessarily limited to economists but we think and hope that also social and political scientists will enjoy the book, since we try to bring back economic science as a subset of sociological and political sciences, where it belongs. If students of philosophy should find something of interesting in our analysis, we would be very pleased.
P12|Cross-border acquisitions and shareholder wealth: Evidence from the energy and industry in Central and Eastern Europe|We look at the wealth generated for shareholders of energy assets in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) by the announcement of cross-border mergers or acquisitions involving a bidder from a Western industrialized country between 1995 and 2005. The impact on both the performance improvements at the firm level as well as on an industry and economic level of foreign ownership of the energy assets in CEE are discussed. The main driver behind the positive effect is the industrial relatedness in acquiring CEE energy assets, while bidder experience and the relative size of the acquired stake do not impact the results significantly.
P12|Organisational culture dimensions in Romanian finance industry|As part of the GLOBE project, this paper explores the societal and the organizational culture of the Romanian finance industry as reflected by middle managers’ opinion. The two culture levels are compared across nine cultural dimensions. The differences between the cultural manifestations (practices and values) are analyzed through comparing the middle managers’ answers to “what is” and “what should be” type questions at organizational and societal levels. The findings show some significant differences for the majority of the cultural dimensions examined both between culture levels (organizational versus societal) and culture manifestations (practices versus values).
P12|Strategy techniques for the times of high uncertainty|This paper sets out to propose the techniques that enable corporations to develop and to implement robust strategies under conditions of severe uncertainty. Through the correction of the traditional definition of stakeholders I found the general algorithm for achieving robustness in corporate strategies. This algorithm includes: (1) the clear definition of a limited set of the types of stakeholders, (2) the simplification of the sets of stakeholders’ claims and discovery of intrinsic benefits common for all stakeholders of a particular type, (3) defining the space of acceptance of corporate performance for each type of stakeholders, (4) finding a non-empty intersection of such spaces for all types of stakeholders.The use of these techniques is illustrated by the new strategy of LUKOIL – one of the major publicly traded oil companies.
P12|The demographic and economic transition in Central and Eastern Europe – Management implications|Although the population in Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) is still younger, on average, than in Western Europe, the CEEC also have to cope with challenges caused by the demographic shift towards an ageing, shrinking population. Some countries are ageing even faster than Western Europe. Apart from ageing, the CEEC also have to face problems caused by the economic transition. Based on neo-institutional organisation theory this paper looks at the management implications of these developments and points out strategies for Human Resources Management and Marketing in how to cope with upcoming challenges.
P12|Factors of effective strategy implementation: Empirical evidence from Slovenian business practice|The paper’s purpose is to add to the body of knowledge on strategy implementation by systematically studying the activities for and obstacles to strategy execution on a sample of 172 Slovenian companies. The results show that managers mostly rely on planning and organising activities when implementing strategies, while the biggest obstacle to strategy execution is poor leadership. Moreover, the results of multiple regression analysis reveal that greater obstacles to strategy execution in the forms of inadequate leadership skills and employees’ reluctance to share their knowledge have a negative influence on performance, while adapting the organisational structure to the selected strategy as an activity for strategy implementation has a positive influence on performance.
P12|The internationalization of Austrian firms in Central and Eastern Europe|We test and expand the Uppsala model with a sample of 109 Austrian companies active in the CEE region, representing 1,271 entries. On the one hand, our expansion of the model is based on collective learning of firms from a specific context, an issue largely neglected in IB research. On the other hand, we expand the model by including two further strategic, i.e. dependent, variables. The paper contributes to research by finding three distinct internationalization processes in CEE, two of them new to the Uppsala Model. Furthermore, the paper strongly supports our argumentation with regard to collective learning and thereby draws new conclusions on learning processes that take place within and between firms over time.
P12|Business practices in corporations of radio and television cable distribution programmes in Serbia|The legal and regulatory framework for business operation of companies for the cable distribution of radio and television programmes has been established as part of the telecommunication market liberalisation in the Republic of Serbia. This framework has encouraged the economic activity, demonstrating, however, certain weaknesses, primarily in respect of providing the service quality and consumer protection. Efficient operation of cable distribution systems is creating opportunities for regional cooperation in the overall sphere of telecommunications. Therefore, it needs to be addressed with adequate attention.
P12|The Dark Side of Shareholder Protection: Cross-country Evidence from Innovation Performance|Proponents of minority shareholder protection state that national legal institutions protecting small investors boost stock markets and, in turn, long-term countries’ performance. In this paper, we empirically challenge this argument. We perform three-stage least-square estimation on a sample of 48 countries over 1993-2006 and find that countries with stronger shareholder protection tend to have larger market capitalization but also lower innovation activity. We cope with stock market’s endogeneity and industry heterogeneity, and circumvent omitted variables bias, so that this finding is unlikely to be driven by misspecification problems. We interpret our estimation results arguing that stronger shareholder protection may depress, rather than encourage, the most valuable corporate productions, because it enables small and diversified shareholders to play opportunistic actions against undiversified stockholders, after specific investments are undertaken by the company; innovation activity, largely based on specific investing, is particularly exposed to this problem.
P12|Du paternalisme au managerialisme : les entreprises en quête de responsabilité sociale|This article confronts two attempts to form socially responsible organizations. The paternalism of the end of the 19th century introduced the owner as a father for his employees. The current Managerialism presents the managers as administrator citizens vis-à-vis their stakeholders. These two systems aim at the harmony of interests between social classes, the happiness of workers and the autoregulation of organizations. Corporate social responsibility marks an additional threshold of the organizational influence, not only in the management of human resources, but also in the relationship with the society. It marks also a change in the form of founder belief: yesterday religious, today administrative. Codes JEL : P12, L21, L23, L53
P12|Aux origines de l'entrepreneuriat social. Les affaires selon Jean-Baptiste André Godin (1817-1888)|Since the beginning of the 1990’s, the social entrepreneur has become a fundamental actor within capitalism. But, what is a social entrepreneur, one must ask? The question is debated and defies consensus. Is an entrepreneur social because he founds a nonprofit enterprise? If so, then how can he live in the free market economy? Alternately, is the entrepreneur social because he finances social ventures from profits? To illustrate this conundrum, consider 19th century French entrepreneur Jean-Baptiste André Godin (1817-1888) who was both a technological and a social innovator. He invented a new system of heating and also made a fortune creating a “familistère” according to the theory of Charles Fourier. The workers (who chose to do so) lived in the familistère, enjoying a large range of welfare activities (care, social insurance, etc). Their children were also educated by the enterprise. The economic strategy of Godin was rational because his enterprise was more profitable than others. Indeed, for many decades the familistère of Godin was the market leader. So, then, we must also consider a follow-on question: Is the social entrepreneur paternalistic? JEL codes: P12, 013, N83
P12|Stock Prices, Anticipations and Investment in General Equilibrium|We propose an objective for the firm in a model of production economies extending over time under uncertainty and with incomplete markets. We derive the objective of the firm from the assumption of initial-shareholders efficiency. Each shareholder is assumed to commu- nicate to the firm her marginal valuation of profits at all future events (expressed in terms of initial resources). In defining her own marginal valuation of the firm's profits, a shareholder takes into consideration the direct impact of a change in the value of dividends but also the impact of future dividends on the firm's stock price when she trades shares. To predict the impact on the stock price, she uses a state price process, her price theory. The firm computes its own shadow prices for profits at all date-events by simply adding up the marginal valuations of all its initial shareholders. The only restriction that we may want to impose on price theories is that they should be compat- ible with the observed equilibrium: given the equilibrium prices and production plans, a price theory must satisfy a no-arbitrage condition. With incomplete markets and no-short selling constraints, this restric- tion need not suffice to bring consistency in the individuals marginal evaluations. As a consequence, the existence of equilibria may require constraints on the firm's investment.
P12|The Growth of knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship in India, 1991-2007: Analysis of its evidence and the facilitating factors|There has been a marked improvement in India's overall economic performance since 1991. One of the outcomes of this improved performance is the growth of innovations in the country. This was accompanied by or caused by the emergence of a number of knowledgeintensive enterprises. The paper takes a critical look at the available quantitative evidence on the growth of knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship. It then looks at five facilitating factors for the emergence of this phenomenon in terms of the existence of increased market opportunities, availability of financial support schemes in the form of venture capital funds, existence and enlargement of a number of government programmes, a number of private sector initiatives and education and training leading to the supply of technically trained personnel. The paper concludes with certain policy suggestions for the continued sustenance of this activity.

P12|Behold the 'Behemoth'. The privatization of Japan Post Bank|"This paper analyzes the privatization process of the Japanese Post Bank (JPB), the largest bank in the world. We report some evidence in favour of the ""political view"" of SOB's and argue that, before privatization, postal savings banks served as vehicles for politicians to reallocate funds in exchange for private rents. We ask why politicians in Japan decided to privatize the postal savings system, predict how the privatization will proceed and study the expected results of the privatization process. We argue that there will be no level playing field in bank competition after the start of the privatization process and discuss possible out-comes of JPB privatization on financial stability in Japan."
P12|The Rise of A District Lead Firm: The Case of Wam (1968-2003)|In recent years a major evolution in several industrial districts in Italy has been the emergence of new hierarchical structures that led to the rise of lead firms. These are firms that - contrary to canonical district firms which tend to remain small - pursue size growth, invest in marketing, distribution and R&D, reorganize their subcontracting networks, and become international by establishing commercial subsidiaries and prodcution facilities abroad. However, despite their increasing importance, lead firms' histories remain largely unexplored. This paper contributes to fill this gap by examining the case of one of such lead firms: Wam, a company set up in 1968 in the mechanical engineering district of Modena, which at the beginning of the 21st century had become the world leader in the production of bulk material handling and dust filtration machinery. This paper in particular focuses on the strategy of growth and internationalization that this company has pursued and its effects in both the host nations and in its Italian ID of origin.
P12|Of Traders, Usurers and British Capital: Managing Agencies and the Dalmia Jain Case|The years between 1947 and 1966, covering the period from independence to the end of the third Five Year Plan, provided the arena for the most acute debates over the content of industrial development. Especially debated at the time was the form of industrial organisation that was appropriate for the private sector under a system of socially regulated industrialisation. In particular, the Managing Agency System, linking a closely held decision making organisation to joint stock companies came under extensive scrutiny. It has been suggested in the paper that by using the frame of joint stock companies as a means to aggrandisement, the Dalmia Jain Group had behaved in a qualitatively different way to the “straightforward” cases of tax evasion of Tatas, Birlas, and even the stock market speculation of Haridas Mundhra. By the late 1960s, the most backward forms of capital had been removed from control of industrial enterprises The tenaciousness of the struggle waged by usurer capital is only an indication of the complexity of the process of development of industrial capital in colonial societies.
P12|Instead of Managerialism: From What Goes on Inside Our Heads to What Our Heads (and Bodies) Go on Inside of – the World between Us (Review Essay: Theodore Taptiklis: Unmanaging: Opening up the Organization to its own Unspoken Knowledge)|Theodore Taptiklis is a former McKinsey & Company consultant who, over the course of a 40 year career in business and organizations, undertook a wide variety of roles, including board member, senior executive, strategist and change manager, business development manager, and worked also in a variety of line-management positions as both an employee and as a professional advisor. He characterizes his professional life during that time as a progression from, not only a position of arrogant certainty to one of increasing ignorance, but also as one from realizing the all-consuming pervasiveness and insidiousness of traditional management doctrine (managerialism) to the possibility of more authentic and liberating ways of experiencing organizational life. The starting point for this process of ‘unmanaging’ ourselves, he suggests, is what we can notice each moment in our experience of the activities occurring between us in our everyday lives – a move from understanding our own practices as outside observers of them to engaged participants within them.
P12|Mission-driven capitalism for small business owners in the U.S|The “use value” of assets in the classical paradigm allowed distinction between those held by capitalists and those held by rentiers. Most small businesses in the United States operate more akin to the model of rentiers than capitalists. Ironically, long run equilibrium in the Marshallian competitive system between total revenue and total cost describes both the small business and the nonprofit sectors. Nonprofits, of course, are mission driven, owned publically rather than privately, and governed by appointed boards of directors. It is argued that analogous to nonprofits, privately owned small businesses in the United States should become mission driven.
P12|Stock prices, anticipations and investment in general equilibrium|We propose an objective for the firm in a model of production economies extending over time under uncertainty and with incomplete markets. We derive the objective of the firm from the assumption of initial-shareholders efficiency. Each shareholder is assumed to communicate to the firm her marginal valuation of profits at all future events (expressed in terms of initial resources). In defining her own marginal valuation of the firm's profits, a shareholder takes into consideration the direct impact of a change in the value of dividends but also the impact of future dividends on the firm's stock price when she trades shares. To predict the impact on the stock price, she uses a state price process, her price theory. The firm computes its own shadow prices for profits at all date-events by simply adding up the marginal valuations of all its initial shareholders. If no restrictions are placed on individual price theories, the existence of equilibria may require financial constraints on a firm's investment when its shareholders are more optimistic than the market about the profitability of such investment. We then impose that price theories be compatible with the observed equilibrium: they should satisfy a no-arbitrage condition. We show by means of an example that, with incomplete markets and no-short selling constraints, this restriction on price theories is not enough to bring consistency in the individuals' marginal evaluations: a financial constraint on the firm's investment may still be needed to obtain an equilibrium
P12|The Growth of Knowledge-intensive Entrepreneurship in India, 1991-2007|There is enough consensus to show that India's economic performance since 1991 is a direct result of the economic liberalization measures that have been put in place. One of the outcomes of this improved performance is the growth of innovations in the country. This was accompanied by or caused by the emergence of a number of technology-based enterprises. This paper takes a critical look at the available quantitative evidence on the growth of knowledge or technologybased entrepreneurship. It then looks at five facilitating factors for the emergence of this phenomenon in terms of the existence of increased market opportunities, availability of financial support schemes in the form of venture capital funds, existence and enlargement of a number of government programmes, a number of private sector initiatives and education, and training leading to the supply of technically trained personnel. The paper concludes with certain policy suggestions for the continued sustenance of this activity.
P12|What is Globalisation and What is Not?: A Political Economy Perspective|Despite the widespread use of the concept there is neither a consistent theoretical construction nor a clear definition of globalisation. Although the debate between pro and anti globalisation scholars and activists is interesting, it largely fails to address globalisation as a fundamental structural transformation of modern capitalism from a historical perspective and tends to reduce it to a re-articulation of the old debate on states versus markets. The first aim of this paper is to provide a clearer definition of globalisation which will be helpful in assessing the validity of various arguments surrounding the concept of globalisation, including whether such a process exists. Then an alternative interpretation of globalisation viewed from a political economy perspective will be introduced. It will be argued that internationalisation in the form of increased trade and foreign direct investment is the nature of capitalist accumulation process, thus, cannot be impeded. This accumulation process necessarily creates its own ideological climate to facilitate acceptance of the doctrine and to justify the economic and social problems it creates. Finally it will argue that there is a globalisation tendency since increased internationalisation inevitably weakens the role of nation states by transferring some of their functions to newly created supranational states that are created by the dynamics of this internationalisation process.
P12|The Italian Corporate Network, 1952-1983: New Evidence Using the Interlocking Directorates Technique|The paper explores the structure of the Italian corporate network by focusing on the relationships between financial - banks, insurances and holdings - and industrial firms in Italy during the period 1952-83 through the analysis of the interlocks that existed between them. By an interlock is meant the link created between two firms when an induvidual belongs to the board of directors of both. The analysis is based on a database - Imita.db - containing data on over 130,000 directors of Italian joint stock companies for the years 1952, 1960, 1972 and 1983. After showing a descriptive statistics of the companies and the directors included in the database, the paper develops a network connectivity analysis of the system. This is integrated by a prosopographic study about the big linkers, defined as those directors cumulating the highest number of offices in each benchmark year. The paper confirms that the Italian corporate network maintained substantial peculiarities in the period investigated. In particular, it argues that interlocks played an important role in guaranteeing the stability of the positions of control of the major private companies and their connections with State-owned enterprises. In 1952 and 1960, the system, centred on the larger electrical companies, showed the highest degree of cohesion. That centre dissolved after the nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1962 and was replaced by a less strong and cohesive one, hinged on banks, insurances and the major finance companies. At the beginning of the 1980s the centre appeared to have been further reshaped with the marginalisation of state-owned enterprises.
P12|Considerations regarding tax optimization in implanted multinational enterprises through external growth for the automobile industry in Central Eastern Europe|The business strategy of multinational enterprises (MNEs) from the automobile industry implanted in Central-Eastern European (CEE) countries (Poland, Czech Republic and Romania) is an offensive one, global from operational perspective. Mainly it aims the extension of market share through horizontal growth, generally external type single-domain (Mergers and Acquisitions) and internal type (Greenfield investments) in a lower degree. These enterprises put in practice also a defending strategy for the owned market shares through increasing the efficiency of the production network at global level. This paper aims to present the less evident aspects of tax optimization of the applied business strategy by implemented MNEs in the automobile industry in CEE, and in this context, the necessity to establish transfer prices in accordance with the OECD recommendations, as an obligation assessed by the tax legislations of the considered countries, but also from the necessity of efficient run of these enterprises.
P12|National trade associations, economic development and globalization|In the post communism regime, the responsibility of economic development has largely been shifted to private sector. The increasing role of private sector enterprises introduced the new concepts of corporate social responsibility (CSR), democratization in business and finance, corporate culture, fair trade, good governance and economic freedom and participation. The ‘wealth maximization concept’ under the ‘extreme capitalism’, limited liability, separate entity, agency cost, professionalism, and competitiveness were redefined. The implementation of the separate entity concept and the code of corporate governance have become more important in the post communism regime. Now, problems in trade and investment are closely linked with the problems of unemployment, income distribution, poverty, macroeconomic growth, regional and infrastructure development, socio-cultural changes, political structure, and the rate of crimes in a country. Business related issues couldn’t be studied in isolation; they are integrated with the sociopolitical dimensions of an economy. In the present inclination of globalization where the word ‘countries’ is being silently replaced by ‘economies’, the role of trade bodies has became more important. The policy advocacy, research and to work as a leading and supreme think tank should be the core activities of the national and multilateral chambers of commerce. The power and role of the chambers in global polices has been studied and contemplated by various analysts. The role of trade associations, chambers of commerce, large corporations and the business groups in the economic development has become an important area of research which lead the drastic development in the literature of business economics. Now, Business Economics has become an important branch of the applied economics. To provide a forum for research and debates on the contemporary issues in Business Economics, the National Association of Business Economists are serving in the developing and industrialized countries. These associations have close association with the National Chambers of Commerce. Various economists have been analyzing on the productivity, importance and the role of the local chambers and the trade specific associations. Aldrich, Fiol, and Staber from Cambridge University, Arendt from University of Chicago, Axelrod, from New York, Benhabib from Princeton University, Dowling from Oxford University, Fombrun from Harvard Business School, Fukuyama from John Hopkins University, Gutmann from Harvard University, Harré from Cambridge University, Lehne from New York University, Olson from Harvard University, North from Cambridge University, Olson from Harvard University, and Shapiro from Oxford University are famous research scholars in the filed of business economics who have been serving on the role of large business houses and the business representative associations in the economic and socio political development and changes in the global business and financial environment. The paper covers the importance and background of the study, nexus of the chambers with the states and multilateral institutions and effects on socioeconomic development and policy Recommendations.
P12|Roles and Rules: Ambiguity, Experimentation and New Forms of Stakeholderism in Germany|A reified opposition between social cooperation (stakeholderism) and Neoliberal market solutions paralyzes political and scientific debate on reform in Germany today. This essay rejects that opposition by recasting the way in which each of the categories is understood. Pressure to become more flexible in many areas of work and organizational life has not given rise to a blanket embrace of “the market” on a local level. Instead, it has induced widespread experimentation with alternative forms of workplace and firm governance that involve continual and collaborative recomposition of stakeholder roles in and among firms and social actors. In other words, stakeholder governance is not disintegrating or giving way to the market in Germany. It is being redefined. Experimentation with roles and rules by creative actors drives the alternative analysis. The argument is developed empirically by a discussion of current local trends in the system of industrial relations.
P12|From Natural Order to Case. Money and Machineries|Political economy is characterized by two extreme and juxtaposed visions concerning the capitalistic system. Upheld both by Classic and Neoclassic, the hegemonic vision maintains that the economic system rests on either a natural order or moral principles that lead it towards a unique and stable configuration of (general) equilibrium. Money and machinery are the main institutions of the capitalist mode of production, but only the critical theories understood the different way of utilizing them by the capitalists, and that these institutions embodied the capitalist form of power.
P12|El crecimiento de las grandes empresas latinoamericanas desde los años '70|This article analyses the growth pattern shown by large Latin-American domestic-capital firms since the '70s. A framework is suggested for dealing with this issue from a conceptual point of view. This framework rests on the distinction between firms ability for founding the growth process, on the one side, from that of getting access to investment opportunities, on the other. The essay collects its raw material from a wide literature review but its main objective is to both arrange and integrate the empirical evidence into the suggested theoretical framework
P12|Social Entrepreneurship und Ordnungspolitik: Zur Rolle gesellschaftlicher Change Agents am Beispiel des Kruppschen Wohlfahrtsprogramms|Dieser Beitrag stellt mit Hilfe der Ordonomik einen systematischen Zusammenhang zwischen zwei unterschiedlichen Literaturen her, deren Fragestellungen zunächst inkommensurabel erscheinen: zwischen der akteurszentrierten Social Entrepreneurship- Literatur und der auf Institutionen ausgerichteten Ordnungspolitik. Das Argument des Beitrags lautet, dass Social Entrepreneurs als Regelunternehmer wichtige Governance- Beiträge leisten können, wenn es ihnen gelingt, neuartige und wechselseitig vorteilhafte Bindungsarrangements für sich und andere zu organisieren. Auf diese Weise können sie – komplementär zu staatlicher Koordination – als echte Change Agents zur Weiterentwicklung der institutionellen Rahmenordnung beitragen und damit genuine Ordnungsaufgaben erfüllen. Diese Argumentation wird in Auseinandersetzung mit dem historischen Beispiel des Kruppschen Wohlfahrtsprogramms entwickelt.

P12|Asymmetric Information and the Form of Enterprise: Capitalist Firms and Consumer Cooperatives|This paper examines the implication of different enterprise forms -- capitalist firm and consumer cooperative -- for the level of accident risks, assuming informational asymmetry between the firm and the outside trader. Our conclusion is that, in order to reduce accident risks, we should choose an enterprise form that gives the firm's management rights to those who would incur the most substantial loss in case of an accident. This result depends upon how effectively the mechanism of signaling works under the firms, given a certain distribution of expected losses over individuals.
P12|Business Groups and the Big Push: Meiji Japan's Mass Privatization and Subsequent Growth|Rosenstein-Rodan (1943) and others posit that rapid development requires a 'big push' -- the coordinated rapid growth of diverse complementary industries, and suggests a role for government in providing such coordination. We argue that Japan's zaibatsu, or pyramidal business groups, provided this coordination after the Meiji government failed at the task. We propose that pyramidal business groups are private sector mechanisms for coordinating and financing 'big push' growth, and that unique historical circumstances aided their success in prewar Japan. Specifically, Japan uniquely marginalized its feudal elite; withdrew its hand with a propitious mass privatization that rallied the private sector; marginalized an otherwise entrenched first generation of wealthy industrialists; and remained open to foreign trade and capital.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

Nous appréhendons la RSE comme constitutive de la concurrence inter-entreprises par la recherche d’avantages comparatifs. Le rapport salarial ne semble pas être transformé par la RSE, qui apparaît comme une tentative de légitimation de nature politique par les entreprises du nouveau rapport de force post-fordien.

P12|Entrepreneurship in China and Russia Compared| We compare results from a pilot study on entrepreneurship in China and Russia. Compared to non-entrepreneurs, Russian and Chinese entrepreneurs have more entrepreneurs in their family and among childhood friends, value work more relative to leisure and have higher wealth ambitions. Russian entrepreneurs have a better educational background and their parents were more likely to have been members of the Communist Party but Chinese entrepreneurs are more risk-taking and greedy and have more entrepreneurs among their childhood friends.

P12|Comparing Competitive Equilibria with Equilibria of Labor-Managed and Capital-Managed Economies in OLG Models|This paper compares a private ownership (competitive) economy, a labormanaged economy and a capital-managed economy in an overlapping-generations framework. Under standard and rather weak assumptions, the sets of equilibria for the two first economies are identical, in line with a result already shown in a static setting. We also prove that the set of competitive equilibria are included in the set of equilibria of capital-managed economies, but the converse is not true. However, using some smoothness assumptions, we show that an equilibrium of a capital-managed economy may be a competitive equilibrium.
P12|Piyasa ekonomisinde kapitalist davranış biçimi|Kapitalizmin ismi, piyasa ekonomisine dönüşürken üreticilerin tüketiciler karşısında ikinci planda kalacağı beklenmekteydi. Ancak, zaman içerisinde, piyasalarda rekabetçi dengenin tüketici tercihlerince belirleneceğini öngören genel beklentilerin aksine, görüldü ki üreticiler tüketicilere üstün gelmiştir. Bu nedenle, işadamlarını Adam Smith’in faziletli kapitalisti gibi toplam refahı artıracak mal ve hizmet üretimine yönlendirecek kamu düzenlemeleri etkili bir biçimde uygulanmalıdır.
P12|L’impresa tra dirigismo e mercato|This essay discusses the endemic weaknesses of Italian industry in a historical as well as analytical perspective. The main conclusion is that these weaknesses may not be determined by some hereditary shortcomings of character and skill of our entrepreneurial class, but rather by the economic and social policies that have been followed since the Constituent Assembly. In particular, the prevailing small size and strong concentration of ownership could mainly be a consequence of labour market rules introduced at the end of the 1960s, as well as the economic and social policies followed in order to permit those rules to survive, despite their inconsistency with the changing competitive environment.
P12|Who are Russia's Entrepreneurs?| Social scientists studying entrepreneurship have emphasized three distinct sets of variables: the institutional environment, sociological variables, and personal and psychological characteristics. We are conducting surveys in five large developing and transition economies to better understand entrepreneurship. In this short paper, using over 2,000 interviews from a pilot study in Russia, we find evidence that the three sets of variables matter: perceptions of the local institutional environment, social network effects, and individual characteristics are all important in determining entrepreneurial behavior.

P12|Mixed Markets in the Food Processing Industry| The food processing industry in Western countries operates in markets that usually are highly concentrated, consisting of a few cooperatives and investor-owned firms. However, in the literature some studies questioned whether the mixed market structure is a stable equilibrium, and suggestions are made that the cooperatives eventually will crowd out all investor-owned firms. To analyse the problem, the family of models of mixed markets is generalized and analysed. It is shown that a mixed market equilibrium may occur under quite general conditions. Also, it is shown that the investor-owned firm may serve as a yardstick of production to the cooperative, helping farmers achieve an increased payoff relative to a situation with a single coop in the market.
P12|Changes in the Japanese Postwar Corporate Governance System in the 1990s|The study deals with the specific features of Japanese corporate governance that can be summarized in: 1) insider control system with internal disciplining mechanisms based on lifetime employment and the employee ambition for promotion, and 2) internalized monitoring by external stakeholders through establishment of long-term interfirm relationships within a common grouping based on cross shareholding and corporate interconnectedness. The traditional corporate control mechanisms – internal and external – in Japanese companies until the 1990s have been analyzed, as well as the objectives of corporate managers in Japan. The changes in the corporate governance system have been traced both in the formal institutional framework and in economic practices. The changes in employment relations have been discussed as the basis of the internal disciplining mechanisms. In conclusion, the incompleteness of the changes in the corporate governance system, and the possible directions for its future development have been analyzed.
P12|The Structure of Italian Capitalism, 1952 1972: New Evidence Using the Interlocking Directorates Technique|The paper explores the structure of the Italian capitalsitic system by focusing on the relationships between financial - banks, insurances and holdings - and industrial firms in Italy during the period 1952-72 through the analysis of the interlocks that existed between them. By an interlock is meant the link created between two firms when an induvidual belongs to the board of directors of both. The analysis is based on a database - Imita.db - containing data on over 300,000 directors of Italian joint stock companies for the years 1952, 1960 and 1972. After showing a descriptive statistics of the firms and the directors included in the database, the paper develops a network connectivity analysis of the system. This is integrated by a prosopographic study about the big linkers, defined as those directors cumulating the ighest number of offices in each benchmark year. The paper confirms that Italian capitalism maintained substantial peculiarities in the period investigated. In particular, it argues that interlocks played an important role in guaranteeing the stability of the positions of control of the major private firms and their connections with State-owned firms. In 1952 and 1960, the system, centred on the larger electrical companies, showed the highest degree of cohesiveness. That centre dissolved after the nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1962 and was replaced by a less strong and cohesive one, hinged on banks and insurances.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P12|Formalization of ethics : the issue of standardization|"Beyond the presupposed cleavage between economics and ethics, the institutional dimension of economic ethics is to the emphasized. The question is : how can we define collective legal rules which concern the whole society ? The other great issue of ethics formalization is then the implementation on the level of firms. The firm can use a large scope of instruments in order to formalize economic ethics. The asset of ethical standards is that they represent a specific way of coordination. They bring positive effects such as the fall of coordination cost and the reduction of uncertainty. Ethical standards can be regarded as a way to get information. They are also a way to formalize a "" common morality "", or even an universal morality in a Kantian conception. The central issue, regarding ethical standards, remains its origin and its construction."

P12|Characteristics of the Japanese Enterprise Management|Après la fin de la deuxième conflagration mondiale, le Japon était un pays en ruine. L’économie japonaise avait été pratiquement détruite. Moins d’un demi-siècle durant, elle est devenue le deuxième pouvoir économique mondiale. L’une des explications du “miracle japonais” après guerre est constituée par la puissante floraison des entreprises japonaises dans le monde entier. Le management des entreprises japonaises met les ressourses humaines sur le premier plan, étant considérées comme les plus importantes ressourses d’une entreprise. Ce type de management embrasse une philosophie humaniste. L’homme se trouve au centre de toutes les préoccupations du management japonais et, KAISHA (entreprise, dans la langue japonaise) représente la grande famille de salariés japonais.
P12|The McKinsey Global Institute Productivity Studies: Lessons for Canada|The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) is a think tank based in Washington, D.C. founded in 1990 with the objective of analyzing international productivity levels from both economic and management perspectives. MGI uses microeconomic analysis on a sector-by-sector level to study the effects that industry decisions ultimately have on national productivity. For the most part the productivity drivers identified by MGI can be grouped into three broad areas: competitive factors (concentration, trade protection, deregulation, minimum wages, work rules, and zoning laws); managerial factors (best practice, human capital, capital intensity, and information technology); and demand factors (average income, cyclical factors, and consumer preferences). This paper examines these factors in an attempt to shed light on the causes of Canada-U.S. productivity differences at the industry level. Competitive factors may explain the poor productivity performance of the Canadian financial and cultural service industries relative to their U.S. counterparts, and likewise may explain the high productivity levels of some natural resource industries in Canada relative to the United States. Managerial factors, especially the implementation of new technologies and related processes, may be important in explaining the poor productivity growth in Canada relative to the United States in service industries such as retail trade. Given the similarities between Canada and the United States, the findings of the MGI studies cannot be indiscriminately applied to Canada-U.S. productivity differences at the industry level. However, the MGI studies do put forward a number of useful working hypotheses for analyzing these differences.
P12|Socio-Economic Development : A Politico - Financial Overview|"Do Financial accounting practices as per the political setup and their administrative strategies, pose problems to the pace of Socio-economic development of any nation ? This paper addresses this question with a preview to the dawn of human civilizations on earth, and mathematically cumulating the thoughts of Socio-economic development in four facets, from Individual to National level.

P12|Globalisation and Its Impact on Competitiveness: the Case of the British and German Pharmaceutical Industry|This paper assesses the degree of financial and economic globalisation of British and German pharmaceutical companies during 1990 and 2001 and explores the changing balance between globalisation and national embeddedness. It tries to explain both the much lower degree of globalisation of German as compared to British companies in 1990, as well as their catching up at the beginning of the 21st century. The paper suggests that the lesser degree of globalisation of German firms during most of the 1990s partly explains their slide in competitiveness during this period. The conclusion examines prospects for the future of firms in both economies. The paper draws on detailed industry data, as well as case studies of the major firms in the two national industries.
P12|Los recursos humanos y la aplicación de modelos de calidad: diferencias entre las empresas mercantiles y las cooperativas de trabajo asociado de Castilla-La Mancha|The substantial changes in the business environment are causing the idea of quality to emerge as one of the most important strategic challenges for companies. Still, however, companies in Castilla-La Mancha, much less worker co-operatives, have not yet discovered quality as a prime competitive tool. In this paper we see how trading companies and worker co-operatives show differences as regards how they conceive quality, and the types of benefits and inconveniences that can be obtained from applying quality models. In the same way, the two differ in their application of human resources practices (such as communication, training, creativity, participation and motivation) depending on whether they have implemented a quality system.

P12|Propping and tunneling|In countries with weak legal systems, there is a great deal of tunnelling by the entrepreneurs who control publicly traded firms. However, under some conditions entrepreneurs prop up their firms, i.e., they use their private funds to benefit minority shareholders. We provide evidence and a model that explains propping. In particular, we suggest that issuing debt can credibly commit an entrepreneur to propping, even though creditors can never take possession of any underlying collateral. This helps to explain why emerging markets with weak institutions sometimes grow rapidly and why they are also subject to frequent economic and financial crises.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P12|The vanishing hand: the changing dynamics of industrial capitalism| Alfred Chandler's portrayal of the managerial revolution of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries does not extend well into the late twentieth century, when widespread vertical disintegration began replacing the classical multi-unit managerial enterprise. This paper attempts to explain the new economy in a manner consistent with Chandler by providing an enlarged theoretical account of industrial evolution. In this account, clusters of Chandlerian firms appeared as a temporary episode within a larger Smithian process of the division of labor. Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.
P12|The Problem of Organisations in Hayekian Liberalism|Hayek founds his liberalism on the notion of order, principally used to construct his theory of spontaneous market order. After discussing the importance and the ambiguities of the distinction between spontaneous orders and organized orders, we show that one of the great weaknesses of this theory is that it could not integrate consistently the two types of order. Hayekian spontaneous market is incompatible with complex organizations (non-atomistic organized orders) and could be constituted only by simple organizations (atomistic organized orders). Our conclusion is not that the notion of spontaneous order is meaningless per se: only its theoretical construction by Hayek and the normative implications he derives from it are criticized here.
P12|Capital Redistribution and the Market Allocation of Firm-Ownership|This Paper studies the relationship between political wealth redistribution and the allocation of firm-ownership when production requires an unobservable input. The economy's wealth distribution affects the equilibrium interest rate and the allocation of entrepreneurial rents because wealth serves as a bonding device and determines agents’ ability and willingness to borrow. This leads to unconventional voting behaviour of the politically decisive middle class: the political preferences of middle and upper class voters coincide when redistribution only has an adverse interest-rate effect. Middle class voters vote with the lower class instead if redistribution enables them to get access to entrepreneurial rents. Technological change may in-duce dramatic changes in political outcomes and greater inequality pronounces the interest-rate effect and may lead to less redistribution.
P12|Market Opportunity and Organizational Grind - The two Sides of Entrepreneurship|In pursuing profit opportunities, entrepreneurs often use multi-person firms. Since employment contracts leave some discretion to the employees, organizational coherence requires that they are coordinated on the entrepreneurial business conception as their own frame of action. Accordingly, the entrepreneurial reorganization of production and trade implies two different coordinating tasks: the exploitation of market opportunities and the seeing through of the business conception in the firms= daily organizational grind. The former has been center stage in the Austrian school of economics. For the neglected latter task a cognitive theory is suggested which highlights an Austrian, or entrepreneurial, approach to the firm.
P12|Job Loss in the United States, 1981-1999|I examine changes in the incidence and consequences of job loss between 1981 and 1999 using data from the Displaced Workers Surveys (DWS) from 1984-2000. The overall rate of job loss has a strong counter-cyclical component, but the job loss rate was higher than might have been expected during the mid-1990's given the strong labor market during that period. While the job loss rate of more-educated workers increased, less-educated workers continue to have the highest rates of job loss overall. Displaced workers have a substantially reduced probability of employment and an increased probability of part-time employment subsequent to job loss. The more educated have higher post-displacement employment rates and are more likely to be employed full-time. The probabilities of employment and full-time employment among those reemployed subsequent to job loss in- creased substantially in the late 1990s, suggesting that the strong labor market has eased the transition of displaced workers. Those re-employed, even full-time and regardless of education level, suffer significant earnings declines relative to what they earned before they were displaced. The earnings decline increases dramatically with tenure on the lost job. Additionally, foregone earnings growth (the growth in earnings that would have occurred had the workers not been dis- placed), is an important part of the cost of job loss for re-employed full-time job losers. There is no evidence of a decline during the tight labor market of the last seven years in the earnings loss of displaced workers who are reemployed full-time.
P12|Loan-monitoring And Deposit-servicing By Commercial Banks In A Stationary Environment|We take up the hypothesis that risk premiums on equities are embodying the costs incurred by equity holders in monitoring the firms which they have invested in. This idea is a key ingredient in our construction of a two sector neoclassical model with widget producing firms and commercial banks. So-called user costs or interest rate spreads are key prices of commercial bank services in the model. Commercial banks produce deposit services (check-writing services or transactions services) and lending services to widget producers.
P12|Cooperatives vs. outside ownership|We are concerned with the design of a constitution for a firm - an ex ante contract which assigns residual rights of control (and possibly residual income rights) without reference to the issue to be decided. We focus attention on two polar constitutions: non-profit cooperatives and outside ownership. In the former, ownership is shared among a group of consumers on a one member, one vote basis. In the latter, all control rights and rights to residual income are allocated to an outsider. Ex post, agents are assumed to have asymmetric information, which rules out recontracting. We have two main results. First, in the case of perfect competition, an outside owner achieves the first-best; a cooperative typically does not, because the rent from any cost advantage relative to the market is used to shield members from competitive pressure, and the median voter's preferences may not reflect average preferences. Second, in the case where the members of a cooperative have common preference orderings they unanimously vote for the first-best; an outsider owner typically makes inefficient decisions, tailored to the marginal rather than to the average consumer.
P12|Ownership and Growth|This paper introduces state-owned enterprises into an endogenous-growth model with an expanding variety of inputs. It shows that, if state firms are less efficient than private firms in organizing labour and also in adopting new technology, the rate of innovation and, hence, also the rate of growth of output will be lower in the long run, ceteris paribus, because the rate of innovation is adversely affected. The model is tested on cross-section data for about 75 industrial and developing countries over the period 1978–92. We find that the size of state-owned sector is inversely related to total factor productivity and economic growth.
P12|Why Ownership Matters?: Politicization and Entrepreneurship in the Restructuring of Enterprises in Central Europe|This paper, base on a study of mid-sized firms in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, examines the sources of performance differences between state and privatized firms, particularly those that may be due to politicization and differences in the degree of entreprenurship. The paper presents empirical evidence that politicization of decision making is responsible for the observed inefficiencies in the cost behavior of state enterprises, but does not explain their inferior revenue performance, which is independent of the degree of state involvement.
P12|Cooperatives vs. Outside Ownership|We are concerned with the design of a constitution for a firm - an ex ante contract which assigns residual rights of control (and possibly residual income rights) without reference to the issue to be decided.

P12|Interrelationships and Causal Linkages Between Socioeconomic and Environmental Factors|The purpose of this study was to examine interrelationship and causal linkages between socioeconomic and environmental variables in OECD countries. To aid this study, a LISREL modelling tool was implemented. The findings of the study indicated that gross public debt increases with deterioration in air quality in North America, Asia and the Pacific, Central, Eastern and Atlantic regions of Western Europe. Energy consumption contributes to deterioration of air quality in all regions. Economic growth, measured by growth in GDP, accelerates deterioration of air quality in all regions except in Southern and Eastern regions of Western Europe. Increases in energy consumption and economic growth contribute to declines in gross public debt in most OECD countries. Spending for environmental protection contributes to reduced emission of CO2 in all regions of Europe except Asia/Pacific and North America. Expenditure for environmental protection causes increases in public debt in all regions. However, environmental expenditure exerts positive impact on economic growth in Asia/Pacific and Central Europe. Spending in environmental protection is associated with reduction in emissions of most pollutants except in North America and Asia/Pacific and Southern regions of Western Europe. The findings also indicated that in regions where emission of SO2 is the greatest, harvesting of forests increased while fish catches declined. Emission of NOx is associated with increases in agricultural production in most regions, except in Southern and Atlantic regions of Western Europe and North America. Emission of VOCs contributed to reduction in agricultural production in most regions except in Central regions of Western Europe. In summary, economic growth tends to significantly contribute to energy consumption and deterioration of air quality. However, the later can be improved through aggressive spending in environmental protection. Therefore, it is imperative to identify a strategy that would balance economic growth and energy consumption with improved environmental quality
P12|Why Capital (Usually) Hires Labor : An Assessment of Proposed Explanations|Enterprises owned or run by workers are probably as old as capitalism itself, but they have never occfupied more than a small sector of any developed market economy. In this paper, we ask why this is so.
P12|Restructuring Enterprises in Eastern Europe|The enterprise sectors of Eastern Europe are undergoing fundamental reform. This article evaluates alternative forms of corporate restructuring. It emphasizes differences in the sequence in which reforms are undertaken in different countries. In some countries, restructuring is being undertaken by the state before privatization; in some, restructuring is delegated to private-sector institutions before shares are offered to the public at large; and in others, public offers of shares are preceding restructuring. The article suggests that the recent theoretical literature on corporate ownership and vertical integration provides a useful framework for evaluating alternative sequences of reform. This points to four factors as being central to the reform process: contractual incompleteness between the state, investors and managers; complementarity between the assets of different stakeholders; the relative importance of assets; and the relative abilities of different stakeholders. The continuing role for the state in Eastern Europe is attributable to difficulties of contracting between the state and private firms and the complementarity between the assets of state and firms. The slow pace of privatization is due to poor public finances and inefficient bureaucracies. There is one country in which a substantial amount of restructuring has been undertaken by both the state and the private sector, however: East Germany. This paper documents in some detail the privatization process in East Germany. It notes that five parties have been central to the reform process: the state, the Treuhandanstalt, banks, Western companies and the incumbent management. It records a gradual transfer of control from the state to the management of firms. It argues that the central role played by banks and companies in restructuring reflects an important complementarity between their assets and those of former state-owned enterprises, and the fact that they can offer valuable advice to East German management. This raises the question of what East European countries that do not possess institutions with equivalent skills and resources should do. The experience of East Germany suggests that careful attention should be given to the governance of state agencies and private-sector institutions. The role of financial institutions in funding restructuring should be supplemented by non-financial companies providing management advice. Risk capital will not be available, initially, until East European enterprises have acquired adequate collateral or reputations. In the mean time, international agencies will play a central role in funding the transition.
P12|Inflation As Restructuring. A Theoretical and Empirical Account of the U.S. Experience|The thesis offers a new framework for inflation as a process of restructuring. Contrary to existing theories of inflation, which tend to take structure and institutions as given for the purpose of analysis, we argue that inflation could be understood only in terms of ongoing structural and institutional change. In the modern context of large-scale business enterprise, inflationary restructuring arises as an integral part of capital accumulation. On the aggregate level, inflation appears as stagflation, with the expansion of pecuniary values in the 'business' sphere depending on the strategic limitation of productive activity in the 'industrial' realm. This stagflationary interaction between 'business' and 'industry' is, in turn, linked (on the disaggregate level) to the dynamic formation and reformation of 'distributional coalitions' and the process of aggregate concentration. An empirical analysis of the U.S. experience between the early 1950s and the late 1980s reveals two regimes of inflationary restructuring: the first, which lasted until 1970, involved rapid increases in aggregate concentration with relatively modest stagflation, whereas the second, post-1970 regime consisted of stable (or even declining) concentration amidst severe stagflation.
P12|State Aid to Industry: Madras 1921-37|The State Aid to Industries Act passed in 1923 seemed to epitomise the spirit of the Indian Industrial Commission that active promotion of industry was a legitimate function of the government. But 12 years later the Public Accounts Committee of the Madras legislature held that the act had not served its purpose. The contest around the nature of the rules and the definition of enterprises eligible for state aid was the form in which the real contest between rising capitalist interests in India and the colonial administration was conducted
P12|Nature of Small Enterprise Development: Political Aims and Socio-Economic Reality|The political aim of the Government of India's small industries policy-the creation of a class of small capitalist entrepreneurs-required two measures to ensure its fulfillment.Firstly, the demarcating line between small and big capital had to be defined in a way that was both administratively easy to handle and captured in an acceptable manner the essential difference between 'small' and 'large' across a wide range of industries.Secondly, ways had to be devised to ensure against the entry of ineligible persons or conglomerates to the special provisions of the development schemes. This paper assesses the success of the Government's efforts in these directions
P12|Small Enterprises and the Crisis in Indian Development|"There was a socio-political as well as economic imperative for the conscious encouragement of small enterprises in India. The high degree of concentration of capital in the Indian economy at the time of Independence led to a serious situation as far as the stability of the existing social order was concerned. Added to this was a situation where the country had achieved independence under the pressure of a mass national movement. Although never seriously challenging the legitimacy of institutions of private property, this had generated and disseminated democratic ideas, viewing unfavourably the existence of extreme concentrations of income and wealth. The economic imperative facing the planners arose from the high degree of self-employment in the economy. According to the 1951 population census, over 58 per cent of the work force engaged in industry ""neither employed any one nor did they work for anyone"". If the mass of productive facilities already existing at the time of independence were to expand and grow, it was critical that the market for the goods which they produced should also grow. To generate a fast growing market for capital goods and intermediate goods, it was necessary for the planners to encourage a process of capital accumulation, leading to differentiation among the huge mass of self-employed persons. Thus, both the socio- political imperative of the development of a small industrial capitalist stratum, and the economic imperative of the encouragement of small industrial enterprises pointed to the need for a set of official policy measures and institutions which would aid these processes. What is of interest in the Indian case, however, is that these requirements were skilfully matched to the popular support for small industrialists and small enterprises which had been generated by democratic currents within the national movement in the pre-Independence period."

P12|Firm, Property and Governance: From Berle and Means to the Agency Theory, and Beyond|Over the last thirty years, the shareholder conception of corporate governance has established itself as the foundation of the power structure and management principles of the corporation. It is based on a specific theorization of the firm: agency theory. Our aim is to explain the full significance of this theorization, by considering the context in which it was developed and the project – of a fundamentally political nature – that it conveys. For that purpose, we return to the questions raised during the first half of the twentieth century, in the seminal book of Berle and Means and in subsequent works by Berle; questions of a much broader scope that the relationship between shareholders and managers. We will show that agency theory can be considered a response to the most important ideas advanced by Berle and Means, and then by Berle (and others), after the New Deal and the Second World War. Comparison of these two themes of reflection leads us to identify two theorizations, and two radically different conceptions of the firm and the corporation. To address these issues, we start by considering the questions raised in the early twentieth century about the nature of the corporation and the status of managers; and how, in response to these questions, Berle constructed a certain conceptualization of the corporation and of managerial capitalism; we shall then revisit the contract-based approach of Jensen and Meckling, to assess the theoretical and ideological content and show how it was actually strongly opposed to Berle’s vision. Lastly, by way of conclusion, we shall endeavor to show how the opposition between these two theorizations should be seen, above all, as an opposition between two theories that are both “performative” rather than positive, and that the apparent success of agency theory and the dominance of shareholder primacy in corporate governance can only be understood in an institutional and political perspective.
