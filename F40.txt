F40|Globalisation and Female Economic Participation in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study assesses the relationship between globalisation and the economic participation of women (EPW) in 47 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 1990-2013. EPW is measured with the female labour force participation and employment rates. The empirical evidence is based on Panel-corrected Standard Errors and Fixed Effects regressions. The findings show that the positive effect of the overall globalisation index on EPW is dampened by its political component and driven by its economic and social components, with a higher positive magnitude from the former or economic globalisation. For the most part, the findings are robust to the control for several structural and institutional characteristics. An extended analysis by unbundling globalisation shows that the positive incidence of social globalisation is driven by information flow (compared to personal contact and cultural proximity) while the positive effect of economic globalisation is driven by actual flows (relative to restrictions). Policy implications are discussed with some emphasis on how to elevate women’s social status and potentially reduce their victimisation to male dominance.

F40|Natural Resource Exports, Foreign Aid and Terrorism|Linkages between foreign aid, terrorism and natural resource (fuel and iron ore) exports are investigated in this study. The focus is on 78 developing countries with data for the period 1984 to 2008. The generalised method of moment is employed as empirical strategy. Three main foreign aid variables are used for the analysis, namely: bilateral aid, multilateral aid and total aid. The corresponding terrorism variables employed are: domestic terrorism, transnational terrorism, unclear terrorism and total terrorism. The following findings are established. First, the criteria informing the validity of specifications corresponding to iron ore exports do not hold. Second, there is evidence of convergence in fuel exports. Third, whereas the unconditional impacts of aid dynamics are not significant, the unconditional impacts of terrorism dynamics are consistently positive on fuel exports. Fourth, the interaction between terrorism and aid dynamics consistently display negative signs, with corresponding modifying aid thresholds within respective ranges. Unexpected signs are elicited and policy implications discussed. Given the unexpected results, an extended analysis is performed in which net effects are computed. These net effects are constitutive of the unconditional effect from terrorism and the conditional impacts from the interaction between foreign aid and terrorism dynamics. Based on the extended analysis, bilateral aid and total aid modulate terrorism dynamics to induce net positive effects on fuel exports while multilateral aid moderates terrorism dynamics to engender negative net effects on fuel exports. The research improves extant knowledge on nexuses between resources, terrorism and foreign aid.
F40|Trade and credit: revisiting the evidence|This paper explores the effects of bank lending shocks on export behavior of Spanish firms. For that purpose, we combine Balance of Payments data on exports at the firmproduct-destination level with a matched bank-firm dataset incorporating information on the universe of corporate loans from 2002 to 2013. Armed with this dataset, we identify bankyear specific credit supply shocks following Amiti and Weinstein (2018) and estimate their impact on firms’ exports at the product-destination level. According to our estimates, credit supply shocks have sizable effects on both the intensive margin (amount exported) and the extensive margin of trade (decision to export).
F40|Financial Deepening, Terms of Trade Shocks and Growth in Low-Income Countries|This paper contributes to the literature by looking at the possible relevance of the structure of the financial system—whether financial intermediation is performed through banks or markets—for macroeconomic volatility, against the backdrop of increased policy attention on strengthening growth resilience. With low-income countries (LICs) being the most vulnerable to large and frequent terms of trade shocks, the paper focuses on a sample of 38 LICs over the period 1978-2012 and finds that banking sector development acts as a shock-absorber in poor countries, dampening the transmission of terms of trade shocks to growth volatility. Expanding the sample to 121 developing countries confirms this result, although this role of shock-absorber fades away as economies grow richer. Stock market development, by contrast, appears neither to be a shock-absorber nor a shock-amplifier for most economies. These findings are consistent across a range of econometric estimators, including fixed effect, system GMM and local projection estimates.
F40|Does the Number of Countries in an International Business Cycle Model Matter?|Until the 1990s, standard models with two large open economies (i.e. the U.S. and Europe) provided plausible representations of the world economy. However, with the emergence of many countries such as China since then, this approach no longer seems reasonable. In line with this change to the global economic environment, there also have been changes in cross-country correlations: the output correlation between the U.S. and Europe has risen, and their consumption correlation has slightly fallen. Accordingly, this paper adds many countries to a standard model to show that doing so can capture the transition in the cross-country correlations. By analytical investigation, I first show that as the number of countries in a simple model increases, the output correlation rises and the consumption correlation falls. A quantitative analysis with a more general model also shows that when the model has more countries, it yields a higher output correlation and a smaller consumption correlation.
F40|Sovereign Bonds since Waterloo|This paper studies external sovereign bonds as an asset class. We compile a new database of 220,000 monthly prices of foreign-currency government bonds traded in London and New York between 1815 (the Battle of Waterloo) and 2016, covering 91 countries. Our main insight is that, as in equity markets, the returns on external sovereign bonds have been sufficiently high to compensate for risk. Real ex-post returns averaged 7% annually across two centuries, including default episodes, major wars, and global crises. This represents an excess return of around 4% above US or UK government bonds, which is comparable to stocks and outperforms corporate bonds. The observed returns are hard to reconcile with canonical theoretical models and with the degree of credit risk in this market, as measured by historical default and recovery rates. Based on our archive of more than 300 sovereign debt restructurings since 1815, we show that full repudiation is rare; the median haircut is below 50%.
F40|Bilateral Trade Imbalances|In standard quantitative models, bilateral trade imbalances are determined by aggregate trade imbalances, expenditure and production patterns, and trade wedges. We calibrate such a model using recent data on incomes, factor endowments, and sector-level expenditures, outputs and bilateral trade flows for 40 economies and the rest of the world. Large pairwise asymmetries in trade wedges are needed for the model’s bilateral-trade predictions to match the data. They account for 21-35% of the standard deviation of bilateral trade imbalances. Aggregate imbalances play a minor role, while more than 50% of the variation is explained by international differences in production and expenditure patterns.
F40|Small Firms and Domestic Bank Dependence in Europe’s Great Recession|The paper studies the role of small businesses (SME) in the transmission of the Eurozone crisis to member countries and whether regions or countries with many SMEs were less able to share risk. Our analysis draws attention to domestic bank dependence—defined as the share of domestic private credit originated by domestic banks—as a key variable modulated the impact of shocks on bankdependent SMEs and thus on the real economy. We argue that Eurozone banking integration in the years after the creation of the single currency was lopsided in the sense that, until 2008, cross-border lending between banks increased markedly while foreign banks’ lending to the real sector stayed relatively flat. Hence, SMEs remained very dependent on domestic banks for credit, in spite of high levels of banking sector integration between Eurozone countries. Our results suggest that domestic bank dependence made countries, regions, and sectors with many SMEs more vulnerable to global banking sector shocks and, at the same time, provided little risk sharing.
F40|Empowering Central Bank Asset Purchases: The Role of Financial Policies|This paper contributes to the debate on the macroeconomic effectiveness of expansionary non-standard monetary policy measures in a regulated banking environment. Based on an estimated DSGE model, we explore the interactions between central bank asset purchases and bank capital-based financial policies (regulatory, supervisory or macroprudential) through its influence on bank risk-shifting motives. We find that weakly-capitalised banks display excessive risk-taking which reinforces the credit easing channel of central bank asset purchases, at the cost of higher bank default probability and risks to financial stability. In such a case, adequate bank capital demand through higher minimum capital requirements curtails the excessive credit origination and restores a more efficient propagation of central bank asset purchases. As supervisors can formulate further capital demands, uncertainty about the supervisory oversight provokes precautionary motives for banks. They build-up extra capital buffer attenuating non-standard monetary policy. Finally, in a weakly-capitalised banking system, countercyclical macroprudential policy attenuates banks risk-taking and dampens the excessive persistence of the non-standard monetary policy impulse. On the contrary, in a well-capitalised banking system, the macroeconomic stabilisation with central bank asset purchases outweigh the marginal financial stability benefits with macroprudential policy.
F40|Natural Resource Exports, Foreign Aid and Terrorism|Linkages between foreign aid, terrorism and natural resource (fuel and iron ore) exports are investigated in this study.

The research improves extant knowledge on nexuses between resources, terrorism and foreign aid.
F40|Foreign exchange reserves as a tool for capital account management|Many recent theoretical papers have argued that countries can insulate themselves from volatile world capital flows by using a variable tax on foreign capital as an instrument of monetary policy. But at the same time many empirical papers have argued that only rarely do we observe these cyclical capital taxes used in practice. In this paper we present a small open economy framework where the central bank can engage in sterilized foreign exchange intervention. When private agents can freely buy and sell foreign bonds, sterilized foreign exchange intervention has no effect. But we analytically prove that when private agents cannot freely buy and sell foreign bonds, that is, under acyclical capital controls, optimal sterilized foreign exchange intervention is equivalent to an optimally chosen tax on foreign capital. Numerical simulations of the model show that a variable capital tax is a reasonable approximation for sterilized foreign exchange intervention under the levels of capital controls observed in many emerging markets.
F40|Capital Controls as Macro-prudential Policy in a Large Open Economy|The use of international capital flow controls has become increasingly popular in academic and policy circles. But almost all the recent literature studies the case of a small economy, ignoring the spillover effects of capital controls to the rest of the world. This paper re-examines the case for capital controls in a large open economy, where domestic financial constraints may bind following a large negative shock. We consider both ex-ante capital controls (prudential) and ex-post controls (crisis management). In a large open economy, there is a tension between the desire to tax capital inflows to manipulate the terms-of-trade and tax capital outflows for either prudential or crisis management purposes. When capital controls are chosen non-cooperatively, we show that ex-post capital controls are unsuccessful in alleviating financial constraints in a crisis, and ex-ante capital controls are unsuccessful at reducing financial instability before the crisis. Non-cooperative capital controls leave the crisis-hit country even worse off than in an environment with unrestricted capital flows. In addition, a non-cooperative equilibrium with capital controls actually increases the likelihood of a financial crisis occurring. By contrast, capital controls can be effective under international cooperation and can significantly ease financial constraints when applied ex-post for crisis management and reduce the likelihood of a crisis when used ex-ante for prudential purposes.
F40|The Seniority Structure of Sovereign Debt|Sovereign governments owe debt to many foreign creditors and can choose which creditors to favor when making payments. This paper documents the de facto seniority structure of sovereign debt using new data on defaults (missed payments or arrears) and creditor losses in debt restructuring (haircuts). We overturn conventional wisdom by showing that official bilateral (government-to-government) debt is junior, or at least not senior, to private sovereign debt such as bank loans and bonds. Private creditors are typically paid first and lose less than bilateral official creditors. We confirm that multilateral institutions like the IMF and World Bank are senior creditors.
F40|Decomposition of economic growth in the Russian Federation through 2024|In 2018, the growth rate of GDP in Russia (2.3 percent) represents a record high of per annum economic growth rate since 2012. This year-end result is notably above the estimates offered by a majority of international financial organizations (the IMF, World Bank, the OECD), as well as by Russian banking analysts and experts. The volume of GDP in nominal terms surged above RUB 100 trillion, to RUB 103,626.6 billion (or approximately USD 1,657 billion when recalculated at the annual average RUB-to-USD rate). Growth was also displayed by most of the basic indicators: thus, the industrial production index in 2018 gained 2.9 percent, freight turnover – 2.9 percent, retail trade turnover – 2.6 percent. Special note should be made of the movement pattern of fixed investment: according to preliminary estimates released by Rosstat, its annual growth index amounted to 4.3 percent. Considering the fact that, in 2017, the amount of fixed investment in constant prices increased by 4.8 percent, it can be said that over the period 2017–2018, the investment sphere indeed experienced intense growth; however, the main contribution to that growth was made either by budget-funded investments (the completion of building construction projects in preparation for the World Cup; the construction of the bridge to the Crimea; the Sabetta Airport and Seaport; and infrastructure in the city of Moscow), or investments by state-owned companies (Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline; Yamal LNG; etc.).
F40|Russia’s economy and regional spillovers|This paper looks at how the Russian economy has developed under the leadership of Putin and how it spills over to its neighbours in the CIS region. It stresses the importance of international oil prices as a determinant of policies and outcomes in Russia and highlights how this has impacted macroeconomic performance during Putin’s different terms in office. Although Russia is not an economic superpower globally, the size and importance of Russia for the CIS region is significant and thus oil price changes also drive the economic development of non-fuel exporting CIS countries to a significant degree.
F40|Russia’s macroeconomy—a closer look at growth, investment, and uncertainty|This paper looks at economic growth and its fundamental determinants in Russia over the last decades. It starts by showing that, contrary to the views of some political commentators, growth is highly important for the popularity of president Putin. Furthermore, regular models of growth are relevant to Russia and other transition countries over the last two decades and one important determinant of growth is investments in physical capital. This in turn is correlated with FDI, which is also key for Russia’s strategy to modernize and diversify its economy away from oil, gas and minerals extraction. However, FDI is negatively impacted by the policy uncertainty that Russia generates both by domestic and foreign policy. Reforming institutions on paper will not be enough to reverse the trend of declining FDI but has to be accompanied by a regime that refrains from policy actions at home and abroad that add to the significant macroeconomic volatility that is already created by large swings in international oil prices.

These findings are robust across fixed effect, System GMM and local projection estimates.
F40|Trade Diversion and Trade Deficits: The Case of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement|We study whether tariff preferences conferred on South Korean goods through the implementation of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) drew U.S. import demand away from other U.S. trading partners through the phenomenon known as trade diversion. In the two years following the implementation of KORUS, trade diversion was particularly strong for U.S. imports of consumption goods and for trade partners who already had free trade agreements with the U.S. Our estimates of trade diversion sum to $13.1 billion in 2013 and $13.8 billion in 2014. Notably, these estimates of trade diversion are roughly of the same magnitude as the increase in the U.S. bilateral goods trade deficit with South Korea. Thus, while increased U.S. imports from South Korea may have increased the U.S.-South Korea bilateral trade deficit, the fact that KORUS diverted U.S. import demand away from other trading partners implies new U.S. imports from Korea stimulated by the KORUS did not expand the overall U.S. trade deficit.

F40|Capital Controls as Macro-prudential Policy in a Large Open Economy|The literature on optimal capital controls for macro-prudential policy has focused on capital controls in a small open economy. This ignores the spillover effects to the rest of the world. This paper re-examines the case for capital controls in a large open economy, where domestic financial constraints may bind following a large negative shock. There is a tension between the desire to tax inflows to manipulate the terms of trade and tax outflows for macro-prudential purposes. Non-cooperative capital controls are ineffective as macro-prudential policy. Cooperative policy will ignore terms-of-trade manipulation and thus cooperative capital controls yield more effective macro-prudential policy.
F40|Does a Currency Union Need a Capital Market Union? Risk Sharing via Banks and Markets|We compare risk sharing in response to demand and supply shocks in four types of currency unions: segmented markets; a banking union; a capital market union; and complete financial markets. We show that a banking union is efficient at sharing all domestic demand shocks (deleveraging, fiscal consolidation), while a capital market union is necessary to share supply shocks (productivity and quality shocks). Using a calibrated model we provide evidence of substantial welfare gains from a banking union and, in the presence of supply shocks, from a capital market union.
F40|Monetary Policy in Perspective Conventional Economy and Islamic Economics|This article describes the perspective of differences between monetary policy in conventional economics and Islamic economics. By using a negation approach, this study concludes that Islamic monetary policy offers an economic system that is more resistant to monetary crises because the Islamic monetary system does not use an interest rate system so that it can stabilize prices more and be able to control inflation compared to the conventional monetary system.
F40|Economic Complexity, Human Capital and Income Inequality: A Cross-Country Analysis|This paper investigates the relationship between economic complexity, a measure of economic structures, and income inequality. Using a cross-country OLS regression, we show that countries with economic structures geared toward complex products enjoy a lower level of inequality. Human capital is found to magnify this correlation. Different measures of human capital also have differentiated interaction effects. Concerns about the endogeneity bias of OLS estimates motivate us to estimate a dynamic panel data model, using a system GMM estimator. We find that an increase in economic complexity provokes higher inequality.
F40|Corporate Leverage, Vulnerability And Implications For Bank Stability: Firm Level Evidence From India|Since the early 2000s overseas borrowing by Indian corporates has gained prominence and has emerged as one of the principal channels of debt flows, changing the pattern of corporate leverage in India. Consistent with the trend in other EMEs, foreign currency borrowing by Indian corporates have assumed prominence, aided primarily by the steady liberalization of the capital account on the one hand and higher international liquidity, on the other hand, leading to a sustained increase in leverage of Indian corporates. This paper analyzes the trends and consequences of corporate leverage of a sample of 825 non-financial firms that have borrowed consistently form international capital markets during 2004 and 2017. In particular, employing the Arellano Bond dynamic GMM technique, it investigates the changing contours of corporate vulnerability arising from the rising leverage and foreign currency debt of these corporates. Further, this paper investigates whether the vulnerabilities in the real sector of the economy get spill over to the financial sector, impairing the asset quality of the Indian banks. The findings of the study indicate that higher leverage of the firms has increased the vulnerability of these firms over time, particularly in the post-global financial crisis period, and that firms? distress increased with higher foreign borrowings. Further, it was also evident that bigger firms were more distressed compared to the smaller size firms, profitable firms were less vulnerable, and that export earning of firms were inadequate to provide a buffer in case of a sudden depreciation of the Indian rupee and could render these firms vulnerable to default. The results of the study also indicated that corporate default (of distressed firms), would erode the Indian banks? asset quality increasing the stress in the banking system. Hedging, whether through natural hedges or financial instruments will be key to protect firms with foreign currency borrowing against severe currency fluctuations. Strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals, together with close monitoring of foreign currency leverage and stricter credit appraisals by banks? is critical for reviving growth in the real sector and boosting the banking sector fundamentals.
F40|Financial and Fiscal Interaction in the Euro Area Crisis : This Time was Different|This paper highlights the anomalous characteristics of the Euro Area `twin crises' by contrasting the aggregate macroeconomic dynamics in the period 2009-2013 with the business cycle fluctuations of the previous decades. We report three stylised facts. First, the contraction in output was marked by an anomalous downfall in investment, while consumption, savings and unemployment followed their historical relation with GDP. Second, households and financial corporations debts, and house prices deviated from their pre-crisis trends. Third, the jump in the public deficit GDP ratio in 2008-2009 was unprecedented and so was the fiscal consolidation that followed. Our analysis points to the financial nature of the crisis as a likely explanation for these facts. Importantly, the `anomaly' in public deficit is in large part explained by extraordinary measures in support of the financial sector, which show up in the stockflow adjustments and reveal a key interaction between the fiscal and the financial sectors.
F40|Financialization made in Germany: A review|This article examines the spread of financialization in Germany before the financial crisis. It provides an up-to date overview on the literature on financialization and reviews which of the phenomena typically associated with financialization have emerged in Germany. In particular, the article aims to clarify how the prevailing institutional structure and its changes had contributed to or had countervailed the spread of financialization and how it had shaped the specific German variant of financialization. For this end, it combines the rich literature on Germany's institutional structure with the more macroeconomic oriented literature on financializaton. With the combination of those different perspectives the article sheds light on the reasons for the spread of financialization and the specific forms it has taken in Germany.
F40|Does the application of smart beta strategies enhance portfolio performance? The case of Islamic equity investments|Traditionally, passive portfolios are structured using an easy to implement market capitalization method albeit highly skewed towards large cap stocks. The introduction of smart beta strategies has allowed passive investors to structure equity portfolios using alternative strategies such as fundamental-weighting, equal-weighting, and low-risk weighting strategies. This paper investigates whether constrained portfolios such as Shariah-compliant equity portfolios (SCEPs) can benefit by adopting smart beta strategies. The sample consists of equities from the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, Middle East, Indonesia, and Malaysia for the period January 2003 to December 2016. The empirical findings suggest that smart beta SCEPs outperform not only conventional market capitalization weighted portfolios but also SCEPs following a market capitalization-weighted strategy. Higher risk-adjusted returns and lower drawdown as a result of following smart beta strategies highlights the importance of considering smart beta portfolio weighting strategies for passive investors. The supremacy of smart beta strategies indicate the value proposition for investors and fund managers alike. We also found that geographical location affects the performance of smart beta SCEPs; countries with a Muslim majority report higher cardinality and lower drawdowns. The results remained robust with alternative Shariah screening guidelines and empirical estimation methodology.
F40|The Role of Ownership and Governance Mechanism in Sukuk Financing by Malaysian Firms: An Application of A Double Selection Model|After controlling for the double selection bias in a sequential three-equation model of the decisions to issuance, to choose a Sukuk structure, and the volume of Sukuk engagements, we find robust evidence suggesting that ownership structure and governance mechanisms play a significant role in controlling agency costs through issuance of Sukuk. In line with monitoring hypothesis, we find that higher government ownership positively influences the decisions to participate, issue a debt-like Sukuk and volume thereof. Similarly, in line with complementarity hypothesis, the empirical evidence suggests that firms with higher board of directors’ independence are more likely to participate in issuing Sukuk with higher volumes. We also find that ethnicity, in the form of a higher proportion of Malay/Muslim members on the board of directors, does not influence the initial decision on whether or not to issue Sukuk. However, once the decision to issue Sukuk is made, firms with higher institutional ownership or a higher proportion of Malay/Muslim board members are more likely to issue equity-like Sukuk
F40|Nonlinear and Asymmetric Exchange Rate Pass-Through to Consumer Prices In Nigeria: Evidence from a Smooth Transition Autoregressive Model|This paper examines the nonlinearities and asymmetries in the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to consumer prices in Nigeria using quarterly time series data from 1986 to 2013 and the nonlinear smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) method. The standard literature assumes linearity and symmetry in the ERPT to consumer prices in a developing country, despite the importance and presence of potential asymmetries and nonlinearities which are generated by the presence of various factors such as menu costs, capacity constraints, market share objectives and production switching. This study develops a partial equilibrium microeconomic mark-up model to investigate asymmetric and nonlinear behaviour in the ERPT. The study confirms the presence of nonlinear ERPTs due to different inflation levels. The results also show asymmetric ERPTs in the appreciation and depreciation of exchange rates. The magnitude of the ERPT also depends on the size of the exchange rate change. The ERPT is higher during depreciation than during the appreciation episodes of the Naira; nonlinearity is more prevalent during the high inflationary period of the 1990s than in other periods. The policy implication of the results is that the government, despite temptations to do so, should avoid the devaluation of the Naira during high inflation periods in order to reduce the impact on consumer prices and the associated costs.
F40|Exchange Rate Pass-through to Consumer prices: Nigerian experience from 1986-2013|This paper examines the level and speed of exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to consumer prices in Nigeria using a partial equilibrium microeconomic mark-up model with quarterly time series data from 1986 to 2013 applying the vector error correction model (VECM) incorporating structural breaks in exchange rates. It assesses the level of long-run ERPT, the speed of adjustments to the long-run equilibrium and the level of short-run ERPT. The results show high and statistically significant ERPT in the long-run in Nigeria. However, the short-run results show slow and insignificant adjustments of prices to its long-run equilibrium trend. The impulse response analyses also support the cointegration results showing the near zero response of consumer prices to exchange rate shocks. The variance decomposition results demonstrate the contribution of external shocks whereby the exchange rate shocks made some modest contribution to the domestic prices. The strong policy implication of these empirical results is that exchange rate stability plays a crucial role in controlling domestic consumer price inflation in Nigeria and comprable economies.
F40|India's Outward Foreign Direct Investment: Growth Drivers|Robust inward and outward flow of direct investments signals ever-increasing integration of an economy with the global world. The emergence of outward foreign direct investment from the developing countries has gathered significant interest from research scholars. Overseas investments encourage economic co-operation between home and the host countries. Over the past two decades India has been in the limelight for its ever rising overseas investments and integration with global world. The study aims to identify country-specific macroeconomic growth drivers that encouraged Indian overseas investments since 1991 till 2015 using Dunning?s OLI framework. The results substantiate significant impact of country-specific growth drivers on Indian overseas investments.
F40|Real interest rates, exchange rates and the ZLB: on Secular Stagnation|What are the drivers of low real rates? What are the implications of the Zero Lower Bound for economic policy? To discuss these questions, we introduce a full general equilibrium model of the world economy within a simple (2 period) intertemporal structure. The model is simple enough to allow for full analytical solution yet sufficiently complex to allow us to address the impact of anticipated future productivity slow down, aging, structural reform and fiscal policy on real interest rates if markets clear and on aggregate economic activity if they do not (because of the ZLB). We extend both the equilibrium model and the ZLB variant to a more-goods-per-period structure to address (real) exchange rate policy and the macroeconomic impact of trade tariffs, like Trump's current trade war, on global economic activity.
F40|The Exchange Rate and Export Variety: A cross-country analysis with long panel estimators|This paper studies how the number of product categories exported by countries is related to the level and the volatility of the exchange rate. In contrast with previous works studying bilateral export variety between countries, this paper looks at aggregate, country-level export variety. I find that export variety is positively related to a weaker exchange rate and negatively related to exchange rate volatility. These relationships seem to be stronger for goods with higher technological intensity. Using disaggregated trade data for a long panel of countries, this paper investigates these relationships by employing an econometric methodology that allows for heterogeneous coefficients across countries and discusses two sources of bias that are often overlooked. The findings suggest that previous studies might be understating the effect of the level of the exchange rate on export variety. The results are robust to using different samples, datasets, variable definitions and estimators (including more traditional fixed effects and dynamic GMM estimators).
F40|Measuring Economic Openness|A Review of Existing Measures and Empirical Practices This paper surveys existing measures of economic openness understood as the degree to which non-domestic actors can or do participate in a domestic economy. We introduce a typology of openness indicators which distinguishes between ‘real’ and ‘financial’ openness as well as between ‘de facto’ and ‘de jure’ measures of openness, and show that this classification indeed captures different dimensions of economic openness. The main contribution of the paper is to supply a comprehensive and novel data set of openness indicators available for interested researchers. Based on this effort, we analyse some trends in economic openness over time and provide a correlation analysis across indicators. Finally, we explore the practical implications of choosing from different openness measures within a growth regression framework and highlight that researchers should make the choice of the indicator based on explicit theoretical justifications that correspond to their specific research questions.
F40|Current account imbalances: Possibilities for Trade Policy Action under the Auspices of the WTO – a German Perspective|Since 2011, Germany has consistently been the country posting the largest current account surpluses in the world. In recent years, this has led to a number of calls from economists and policy-makers in and outside Germany, and from international institutions and organisations, asking the Federal Government to take action to reduce the surplus. These calls have tended to focus on recommendations for action to strengthen private and public-sector investment and real wage growth in Germany. As current account imbalances have long become a global phenomenon, we would like to open a discussion on how this issue could be dealt with under multilateral trade policy.
F40|Underdevelopment and unregulated markets: Seven reasons why unregulated markets reproduce underdevelopment|After World War II only a few developing countries were able to catch up to real GDP per capita levels prevailing in developed countries. These successful countries in almost all cases came from Asia and did not follow the free market doctrine in the tradition of the Washington Consensus. There must be theoretical explanations as to why underdevelopment is reproduced and most countries in the world do not catch up. This essay reviews different economic approaches which attempt to explain the lack of convergence. A first group of approaches focuses on the lack of sufficient productivity development (free trade, global value chains, negative terms of trade effects, abundance of scarce resources, premature deindustrialization); the second group focuses on problems to trigger sufficient growth (distorted financial systems, high restrictions on macroeconomic demand management). Countries can suffer from several of these factors, which can explain why development is only possible with the support of comprehensive government policies.
F40|Financialisation, distribution & the macroeconomic regimes before & after the crisis: A post-Keynesian view on Denmark, Estonia & Latvia|"Since the early 1980s, financialisation has become an increasingly important trend in developed capitalist countries, with different beginnings, speed and intensities in different countries. Rising inequality has been a major feature of this trend. Shares of wages in national income have declined and personal income inequality has increased. Against this background unsustainable demand and growth regimes have developed and dominated the major economies before the crisis: the ""debt-led private demand boom"" and the ""export-led mercantilist"" regime. The current paper applies this post-Keynesian approach on the macroeconomics of finance-dominated capitalism to three Baltic Sea countries, Denmark, Estonia and Latvia, both for the pre-crisis and the post-crisis period. First, the macroeconomics of finance-dominated capitalism are briefly reiterated. Second, the financialisation-distribution nexus is examined for the three countries. Third, macroeconomic demand and growth regimes are analysed, both before and after the crisis."
F40|Can foreign aid dampen the threat of terrorism to international trade? Evidence from 78 developing countries|The study investigates whether development assistance can be used to crowd-out the negative effect of terrorism on international trade. The empirical evidence is based on a panel of 78 developing countries for the period 1984-2008 and Quantile Regressions. The following main findings are established. First, bilateral aid significantly reduces the negative effect of transnational terrorism on trade in the top quantiles of the trade distribution. Second, multilateral aid also significantly mitigates the negative effect of terrorism dynamics on trade in the top quantiles of the trade distributions. It follows that it is primarily in countries with above median levels of international trade that development assistance can be used as an effective policy tool for dampening the adverse effects of terrorism on trade. Practical implications are discussed.

F40|The costs of trade protectionism: evidence from Spanish firms and non-tariff measures|The rise in non-tariff protectionist measures has been associated to the weakness in global trade over the last few years. We investigate the effect of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) on exports growth over the period 2009-2013 using administrative data at the firm-product-destination level in Spain. According to our findings, non-tariff protectionist measures significantly reduce exports growth at the product-destination level. Moreover, NTBs also hinder exports growth at the firm level and negatively affect other firm outcomes such as productivity growth. In contrast, the impact of liberalizing non-tariff measures is not statistically significant.
F40|Central Bank Reputation and Inflation-Unemployment Performance: Empirical Evidence from an Executive Survey of 62 Countries|Although there is a well-established theoretical literature that links central bank (CB) reputation with inflation performance following Barro and Gordon, there is little empirical work testing the relationship rigorously. This paper empirically tests the impact of reputation on inflation-unemployment performance using a novel set of data on CB reputation--an annual local business manager survey on central bank policy covering 62 countries during 1995-2016. This paper finds that CB reputation is a significant determinant of inflation: the results of an FE panel and Arellano-Bond difference GMM model show that high-reputation CBs have achieved better inflation performances over the past 20 years with lower levels of inflation than others, holding the output gap and unemployment rate constant. This result remains robust to various control variables including money growth, past inflation levels, exchange rates, and financial crisis dummies. This paper also finds that high CB reputation is associated with a tight anchoring of inflation expectations to inflation targets in inflation-targeting countries. The effects of reputation on the volatility of inflation and unemployment rates are found to be not robust. This paper offers evidence of the opposite-direction causality as well that goes from high inflation to decreased CB reputation.
F40|The Effects of Export Diversification on Macroeconomic Stabilization : Evidence from Korea|This paper studies whether export diversification mitigated the negative effect of the global financial crisis on exports using the Korean case. Specifically, we use annual data on the exports of 24 Korean manufacturing industries from 2000 to 2016 and examine whether the negative effect of the crisis on exports was less prevalent in industries that were more diversified in terms of country and product. We also examine whether export competitiveness, measured by the revealed comparative advantage index by industry, had a mitigating effect on trade during the crisis. In order to study these issues, we use a panel regression with a fixed-effect model for 24 Korean manufacturing industries. From our empirical analysis, we find that country diversification weakened the negative impact of the global financial crisis on Korea¡¯s exports, but neither product diversification nor export competitiveness did so.
F40|Commodities and International Business Cycles|I introduce commodities and countries¡¯ different commodity trade structures into an otherwise standard two-country model to analyze international business cycles between the U.S. and commodity-exporting countries. In the model, only the foreign country (the commodity-exporting country) produces commodities and exports them to the home country (the U.S., the commodity-importing country). The model produces international business cycle statistics that are closer to the data than a standard model. In particular, the output correlation between the two countries increases and the consumption correlation falls compared to the standard model. Notably, unlike standard models, this model yields an output correlation that exceeds the consumption correlation, which mitigates the ¡°quantity anomaly¡± that was previously noted in the literature. Commodity consumption and the complementarity between commodities and noncommodity goods in consumption play key roles in generating this result.
F40|New Marshall-Lerner Conditions for an Economy with Outward and Two-Way Foreign Direct Investment|The international debate about trade imbalances often puts the focus on the role of domestic GDP/foreign GDP and the role of real exchange rate changes – with respect to the latter adjustment channel, the standard question is whether or not the Marshall-Lerner condition is fulfilled. While recent trade literature has focused on exchange rate pass-through the role of FDI has not been much discussed. With outward foreign direct investment (FDI) and inward FDI becoming increasingly important, the question about the real exchange rate impact on the trade balance has to be restated as imports are proportionate to real gross national income and this indeed implies a new Marshall-Lerner condition. It is shown that with outward cumulated FDI, the modified condition is stricter than the traditional case and with both outward FDI and inward FDI, the elasticity requirement is ambiguous. “FDI globalization” might go along with unpleasant trade imbalance problems so that additional empirical research is needed as well as stronger international policy cooperation as high trade balance deficits/high trade balance surplus positions could be rather difficult to correct through exchange rate adjustments only. Looking at the import elasticities for all partner countries of the US – or country x – together is quite misleading for policymakers.
F40|The Great Recession and a Missing Generation of Exporters|The collapse of international trade surrounding the Great Recession has garnered significant attention. This paper studies firm entry and exit in foreign markets and their role in the post-recession recovery of U.S. exports using confidential microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau. We find that incumbent exporters account for the vast majority of the decline in export volumes during the crisis. The recession also induced a missing generation of exporters, with large increases in exits and a substantial decline in entries into foreign markets. New exporters during these years tended to have larger export volumes, however, compensating for the decline in the number of exporting firms. Thus, while entry and exit were important for determining the variety of U.S. goods that were exported, they were less important for the trajectory of aggregate foreign sales.
F40|Somatic distance, cultural affinities, trust and trade|Somatic distance, or differences in physical appearance, proves to be extremely important in the gravity model of bilateral trade in conformity with results in other areas of economics and outside of it in the social sciences. This is also true quite independently of survey evidence about bilateral trust. These findings are obtained in a sample of the 15 members of the European Economic Association in 1996. Robustness tests also show that somatic distance has a more reliable influence on bilateral trade than the other cultural variables. The article finally discusses the interpretation and the breadth of application of these results.
F40|The international transmission of monetary policy|This paper presents the novel results from an internationally coordinated project by the International Banking Research Network (IBRN) on the cross-border transmission of conventional and unconventional monetary policy through banks. Teams from seventeen countries use confidential micro-banking data for the years 2000 through 2015 to explore the international transmission of monetary policies of the United States, euro area, Japan, and United Kingdom. Two other studies use international data with different degrees of granularity. International spillovers into lending to the private sector do occur, especially for US policies, and bank-specific heterogeneity influences the magnitudes of transmission. The effects are supportive of the international bank lending channel and the portfolio channel of monetary policy transmission. They also show that the frictions that banks face matter; in particular, foreign currency funding and hedging considerations can be a key source of heterogeneity. The forms of bank balance sheet heterogeneity that differentiate spillovers across banks are not uniform across countries. International spillovers into lending can be large for some banks, even while the average international spillovers of policies into nonbank lending generally are not large.
F40|International Value-Added Linkages in Development Accounting|We generalise the traditional development-accounting framework to an open economy setting. In addition to factor endowments and productivity, relative factor costs emerge as a source of real-income variation across countries. These are determined by bilateral trade frictions (which underpin the patterns of “international value-added linkages”) and the global distribution of factor endowments and final expenditures. We use information on endowments, trade balances and value-added trade to back out the relative factor costs of 40 major economies in a theory-consistent manner. This reduces the variation in “residual” TFP required to explain the observed per-capita income differences by more than one half.
F40|Is Hard Brexit Detrimental to EU Integration? Theory and Evidence|In the struggle between the forces of free trade and the restrictive influence of insularism the latter recently seems to have the upper hand. This is illustrated by the referendum of June 23, 2016 where the United Kingdom (UK) voted to leave the European Union (EU). In this paper we evaluate the consequences of this event for EU integration. In particular, we analyze how the extent of EU economic integration would change once the UK leaves the Union. To that end we develop an integration benchmark that consists of the steady state production equilibrium characterized by arbitrage pricing and perfect factor mobility. We apply metrics to measure the distance between this benchmark and the data. We find that the integration in the EU is incomplete and its trend is non-linear while Brexit would not bring negative consequences to its development..

Robustness tests also show that somatic distance, as well as co‐ancestry, has a more reliable influence on bilateral trade than the other customary cultural variables. The article finally discusses the interpretation and breadth of application of these results.
F40|Do global value chains amplify global imbalances?|This paper addresses the impact of countries' participation in global value chains (GVCs) on their current account balances. Relying on a panel of 57 advanced and emerging countries, we do not find evidence that GVC participation directly raises economies' current account positions. On the contrary, we show that backward participation makes a negative contribution to current account balances: our results contradict the speculation that current account imbalances of downstream countries are likely to benefit more from GVC participation than economies which are located further upstream. Moreover, we show that there is no significant indirect effect of GVC on the current account operating through the exchange rate. Finally, our findings indicate that whereas GVC participation boosts exports, this increase is not accompanied by improvements in price competitiveness, nor by higher levels of saving rates.
F40|Elementos para una política pública frente a la crisis de Venezuela|La inmigración de ciudadanos venezolanos se ha convertido en uno de los retos más importantes que enfrenta la economía colombiana en el presente. Se estima que para fines de 2018 había más de 1.200.000 ciudadanos venezolanos con vocación de permanencia en el país. Semejante flujo migratorio tiene importantes efectos en dimensiones tan relevantes como los salarios, el empleo, la distribución del ingreso, el crecimiento económico y las finanzas públicas. En este trabajo se hace un análisis del impacto económico del fenómeno migratorio venezolano. En este trabajo se hace un análisis del impacto económico del fenómeno migratorio venezolano hacia Colombia en el pasado reciente, analizando sus causas, su magnitud, sus características, y sus implicaciones económicas en el corto y el mediano plazo. Además de dimensionar los costos para el fisco nacional de atender las necesidades básicas de los migrantes, con base en la teoría y la experiencia internacional se identifican los efectos favorables que podría tener la migración en el mediano plazo, y se formulan recomendaciones de política para minimizar sus costos.
F40|Colombia y la deuda externa: revisión de las medidas de cumplimiento en el contexto de la crisis de los 80´s|El elevado endeudamiento externo contraído por los países emergentes latinoamericanos como herramienta complementaria del ahorro interno, desencadenó la crisis de la deuda en los años 80´s. Colombia, a diferencia de sus países vecinos, impulsado por las bonanzas cafeteras y por niveles de gasto inferiores, logró sobreponerse y superar parcialmente la crisis internacional, evitando reestructurar la deuda bajo las condiciones impuestas por entes multilaterales. El gobierno nacional debió entablar relaciones particulares con la banca privada, en busca de créditos sindicados que le garantizaran la liquidez necesaria para continuar efectuando los pagos de la deuda y no declarar una posible moratoria. Colombia, firmó un total de 4 créditos sindicados, permitiendo estos la refinanciación requerida. El país sobresalió como un caso de excepción. ***** The high external debt contracted by the emergent Latin-American countries, as complementary tool of the internal saving, triggered the Crisis of the debt in the Eighties.Colombia, unlike his neighbouring countries, stimulated by the coffee prosperity and by low levels of expense, managed to superimpose and to excel partially the international crisis, avoiding restructuring the debt under the conditions imposed by multilateral entities. Colombian government, begun particular relations with the private banking, in search of unionized credits, which were guaranteeing the necessary liquidity to continue effecting the payments of the debt and to not declare a possible moratorium. Colombia, signed a total of 4 unionized credits, allowing the needed refunding. The country stood out as an exceptional case.
F40|Real interest rates, exchange rates and the ZLB: on Secular Stagnation|What are the drivers of low real rates? What are the implications of the Zero Lower Bound for economic policy? To discuss these questions we introduce a full general equilibrium model of the world economy within a simple (2 period) intertemporal structure. The model is simple enough to allow for full analytical solution yet sufficiently complex to allow us to address the impact of anticipated future productivity slow down, aging, structural reform and fiscal policy on real interest rates if markets clear and on aggregate economic activity if they do not (because of the ZLB). We extend both the equilibrium model and the ZLB variant to a more-goods-per-period structure to address (real) exchange rate policy and the macroeconomic impact of trade tariffs, like Trump's current trade war, on global economic activity.

F40|Wealth of the Nation: Scotland’s Productivity Challenge - Technical Appendix|This note provides technical background information on some contents of the report Wealth of the Nation: Scotland’s Productivity Challenge (Kelly et al.,2018). The report shows that Scotland’s productivity performance is only middling in the OECD: Scotland would need to close a productivity gap of 20% to reach the top quartile of most productive OECD countries. It also illustrates that this gap can be attributed to a relatively low capital stock and low Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in equal measure. In this note, we make transparent the data and assumptions underlying these calculations.
F40|Global trade finance, trade collapse and trade slowdown: a Granger causality analysis|This research paper provides a causality assessment on the linkage between declines in world trade finance and the world trade collapse in the period following the Financial Crisis of 2008 and 2009 as well as the ensuing global trade slowdown. The paper performs Granger Causality tests on two time series: World trade (volume data acquired from the CPB World Trade Monitor) and World trade finance (transaction data acquired from SWIFT), using global monthly data from January 2007 to May 2017. In the short run, Granger causality always runs one-way from world trade finance to world trade. We always find two-way Granger causality for lags longer than two years. Importantly Granger causality never runs one-way from world trade to world trade finance. Given the short-term nature of trade finance, we conclude that world trade finance Granger-causes world trade.
F40|Financial Deepening, Terms of Trade Shocks, and Growth Volatility in Low-Income Countries|This paper contributes to the literature by looking at the possible importance of the structure of the financial system—whether financial intermediation is performed through banks or markets—for macroeconomic volatility, against the backdrop of increased policy attention on strengthening growth resilience. With low income countries (LICs) being the most vulnerable to large and frequent terms of trade shocks, the paper focuses on a sample of 38 LICs over the period 1978-2012 and finds that banking sector development acts as a shock absorber, dampening the transmission of terms of trade shocks to growth volatility. Expanding the sample to 121 developing countries confirms this result, although this role of shock-absorber fades away as economies grow richer. Stock market development, by contrast, appears neither to be a shock absorber nor a shock amplifier for most economies. These findings are robust across fixed effect, System GMM and local projection estimates.
F40|Granger Causality Between Local Government Expenditure and Economic Growth in Indonesia|Objective - This study examines the causal relationship between government expenditure and economic growth in West Kalimantan between 2009 and 2015. This research resulted in the enactment of Wagner's Law and/or Keynes's Theory in West Kalimantan leading the local government to take the right policies as an effort towards improving economic development. Methodology/Technique - By using panel data that combines time series data and cross-site data, it will be estimated by the Granger causality test which begins with a stationary test and co-integration test. Based on the co-integration tests, the results suggest that there is a long-term relationship between government expenditure and economic growth. Meanwhile, based on the Granger causality test, there is no reciprocal relationship between government expenditure and economic growth. Findings - A direct relationship in the form of the influence of government expenditure on economic growth in West Kalimantan. Novelty - These results are in line with the Keynes's Theory through its national income function.
F40|Globalization and Exchange-Rate Pass-Through in Europe: Is There a Link?|This paper assesses the impact of globalization on Exchange-Rate Pass-Through into import prices in three core eurozone countries characterized by different degrees of openness. We looked at various indicators of globalization and used data since 1983 to find evidence of a generalized link between globalization and Exchange-Rate Pass-Through. In particular, factors related to trade integration, such as an increase in the import penetration rate or lower trade tariffs, reduce the degree of Exchange-Rate Pass-Through. However, the rising prominence of China in European imports does not contribute to the decline in pass-through. Overall, our findings show that while Exchange-Rate Pass-Through is incomplete, it remains significant even when controlling for the effects of trade globalization.
F40|Propriétés cycliques des transferts de fonds des migrants marocains|Le phénomène de transferts de fonds suscite un débat passionnant au sein de la classe politique, des chercheurs et des universitaires. Ceci est dû au fait qu’il touche à des aspects humains, économiques et financiers. Les transferts de fonds sont considérés comme étant une source de financement importante pour la majorité des pays en développement. Le Maroc n’échappe pas à cette logique. Il est, en effet, l’un des pays qui reçoit le plus de transferts de fonds dans le monde. L’objet de cet article est d’étudier les propriétés cycliques des transferts de fonds vers le Maroc. En utilisant des filtres économétriques adéquats et pertinents ainsi que des données trimestrielles nous arrivons à mettre en lumière des aspects empiriques importants des transferts de fonds. En effet, les transferts de fonds constituent un enjeu majeur pour l’économie marocaine, de même, jouer les rôles importants de stabilisateur et d’amortisseurs. Remittances raise a fascinating debate in the political class, researchers and academics. This is because they affect human, economic and financial aspects. In Morocco, remittances are considered an important source of funding. It is, indeed, one of the countries that receive the most remittances in the world. The aim of this paper is to study the cyclical properties of remittances to Morocco. Using appropriate data and relevant econometric filters we can highlight important empirical aspects of remittances. Indeed, remittances constitute a major challenge for the Moroccan economy as well, play important roles in stabilizing and as a shock absorber
F40|Remittances, Dutch Disease, And Competitiveness: A Bayesian Analysis|The paper studies symptoms of Dutch disease in the Pakistani economy arising from international remittances. An IV Bayesian analysis is carried out to take care of the endogeneity and uncertainty due to the managed float of Pakistani Rupee. We find evidence for both spending and resource movement effects in both the short and the long-run. These impacts are stronger and different from those the Official Development Assistance and the FDI exert. We find that while aggregate remittances and the remittances from Persian Gulf contribute to the Dutch disease in Pakistan, those from North America and Europe do not.
F40|Dealing with Time-inconsistency: Inflation Targeting vs. Exchange Rate Targeting|Abandoning an objective function with multiple targets and adopting a single mandate is an effective way for a central bank to overcome the classic time-inconsistency problem. We show that the choice of a particular single mandate depends on a country's level of trade openness. Both inflation targeting and nominal exchange rate targeting come with their own costs. We show that the costs of inflation targeting are increasing in a country's level of trade openness while the costs of exchange rate targeting are decreasing in trade openness. Thus a relatively closed economy will prefer an inflation targeting mandate and a very open economy will prefer an exchange rate target. Empirical results show that as central banks become less credible they are more likely to adopt a pegged exchange rate, and crucially the empirical link between central bank credibility and the tendency to peg depends on trade openness.
F40|Household Credit, Global Financial Cycle, and Macroprudential Policies: Credit Register Evidence from an Emerging Country|We analyze the effects of macroprudential policies on local bank credit cycles and interactions with international financial conditions. For identification, we exploit the comprehensive credit register containing all bank loans to individuals in Romania, a small open economy subject to external shocks, and the period 2004-2012, which covers a full boom-bust credit cycle when a wide range of macroprudential measures were deployed. Although household leverage is known to be a key driver of financial crises, to our knowledge this is the first paper that employs a household credit register to study leverage and macroprudential policies over a full economic cycle. Our results show that tighter macroprudential conditions are associated with a significant decline in household credit, with substantially stronger effects for FX loans than for local currency loans. The effects on FX loans are higher for: (i) ex-ante riskier borrowers proxied by higher debt-service-to-income ratios and (ii) banks with greater exposure to foreign funding. Moreover, tighter macroprudential policy has stronger dampening effects on FX lending when global risk appetite is high and foreign monetary policy is expansionary. Finally, quantitative effects are in general larger for borrower rather than lender macroprudential policies. Overall, the results suggest that macroprudential policies are effective in mitigating bank risk-taking in household lending over the local bank credit and global financial cycles, and therefore have important implications for policy and bank risk management.
F40|Portfolio Composition and Valuation Effects in Emerging Market Economies| The increase in cross-border assets and liabilities of nations with globalization, implies small asset price and currency movements create large wealth changes. The national net external position is increasingly driven by valuation effects, which the current account does not capture. We analyze valuation effects for a group of seven emerging economies, namely Brazil, Colombia, India, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Peru and Turkey for the time period 2005:Q1-2015:Q4 by scrutinizing their external asset portfolio while controlling for country fundamentals. Both asset and liability categories of Direct Investment equity are found to positively impact valuation. Equity liabilities and debt assets of Portfolio Investment positively influence valuation. Debt liabilities of all kinds of investment negatively impact valuation. Countries with stronger currency tend to gain through valuation effects. An appreciated real effective exchange rate is associated with higher valuation gains. We also found non-linear effects of the composition of external debt portfolio by interacting external portfolio and country characteristics. The external portfolio selection of emerging economies (with more in Direct Investment equity liabilities and Portfolio Investment debt assets) in the period has shielded them from global volatility, and enabled valuation gains.
F40|Smooth Breaks And Nonlinear Mean Reversion In Real Interest Parity: Evidence From East Asian Countries|This study aims to explore the empirical validity of the real interest rate parity (RIP) hypothesis for East Asian countries using Japan as the base country. To this end, we employ the recently proposed unit root tests of Christopoulos and Leon-Ledesma (2010) that account for both multiple smooth structural breaks of unknown form and nonlinear mean reversion in the series. Our empirical results uncover overwhelming evidences in favor of the RIP hypothesis for the whole countries in our sample. More specifically, through a Fourier approximation, it is observed that all real interest rate differentials display a mean reverting behavior around an infrequently smooth-breaking mean, with the breaks being in accordance with the financial reforms and economic crises witnessed by the countries. Moreover, the degree of mean reversion appears to vary nonlinearly with the size of real interest rate appreciations and depreciations.
F40|Granular Comparative Advantage|Large firms play a pivotal role in international trade, shaping the export patterns of countries. We propose and quantify a granular multi-sector model of trade, which combines fundamental comparative advantage across sectors with granular comparative advantage embodied in outstanding individual firms. We develop an SMM-based estimation procedure, which takes full account of the general equilibrium of the model, to jointly estimate these fundamental and granular forces using French micro-data with information on firm domestic and export sales across manufacturing industries. We find that granularity accounts for about 20% of the variation in realized export intensity across sectors, and is more pronounced in the most export-intensive sectors. In turn, idiosyncratic firm dynamics accounts for a large share of the evolution of a country's comparative advantage over time. Governments face strong incentives to target trade policy at large individual foreign exporters, and to use lenient antitrust regulation at home to substitute for beggar-thy-neighbor trade policy.
F40|Exchange Rates and Uncovered Interest Differentials: The Role of Permanent Monetary Shocks|We estimate an empirical model of exchange rates with transitory and permanent monetary shocks. Using monthly post-Bretton-Woods data from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, we report four main findings: First, there is no exchange rate overshooting in response to either temporary or permanent monetary shocks. Second, a transitory increase in the nominal interest rate causes appreciation, whereas a permanent increase in the interest rate causes short-run depreciation. Third, transitory increases in the interest rate cause short-run deviations from uncovered interest-rate parity in favor of domestic assets, whereas permanent increases cause deviations against domestic assets. Fourth, permanent monetary shocks explain the majority of short-run movements in nominal exchange rates.
F40|Exchange Rate Pass-Through to Consumer Prices and the Role of Energy Prices|A group of researchers has asserted that the rate of exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to domestic prices has declined substantially over the last few decades. We revisit this claim of a downward trend in the rate of ERPT to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) by employing the vector autoregressive (VAR) model for the U.S. macroeconomic data under the current floating exchange rate regime. Our VAR approach that nests the conventional single equation method reveals very weak evidence of ERPT during the pre-1990 era. On the other hand, we observe statistically significant evidence of ERPT during the post-1990 era, which sharply contrasts with previous findings. After statistically confirming a structural break in ERPT to the total CPI via Hansen's (2001) test procedure, we seek the source of the structural break using the disaggregate level CPIs, which pinned down a key role of energy prices in explaining the emergence of the break. The dependency of the U.S. energy consumption on imports has increased since the 1990s. This change magnifies the effects of the exchange rate shock on domestic energy prices, resulting in greater responses of the total CPI via this energy price channel.
F40|Can foreign aid dampen the threat of terrorism to international trade? Evidence from 78 developing countries|The study investigates whether development assistance can be used to crowd-out the negative effect of terrorism on international trade. The empirical evidence is based on a panel of 78 developing countries for the period 1984-2008 and Quantile Regressions. The following main findings are established. First, bilateral aid significantly reduces the negative effect of transnational terrorism on trade in the top quantiles of the trade distribution. Second, multilateral aid also significantly mitigates the negative effect of terrorism dynamics on trade in the top quantiles of the trade distributions. It follows that it is primarily in countries with above median levels of international trade that development assistance can be used as an effective policy tool for dampening the adverse effects of terrorism on trade. Practical implications are discussed.

F40|Decomposition of Russia’s GDP growth rates in 2016–2019|In his Annual Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly on 30 November 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin underscored Russia’s goal to catch up with the world average growth rates by 2019–2020. As a reminder, the IMF projects 3.7% for the average annual growth rate of the global economy in the coming three years. Earlier in November, Russia’s Ministry of Economic Development (MED) updated its forecast for Russia’s socio-economic development for 2017–2019[1] whereby a 0.6% decline is projected for Russia’s GDP in 2016, while its baseline scenarios (see below) predict that economic growth rates will be barely higher than 2% by 2020 amid low crude oil prices and a lack of structural reforms.
F40|Would a euro's depreciation improve the French economy?|In this paper, we use a Micro-Macro mo del to evaluate the e ects of a euro's depreciation on the French economy, both at the macro and micro level. Our Micro-Macro model consists of a Microsimulation mo del that includes an arithmetical mo del for the French fiscal system and two behavioral mo dels used to simulate the eff ects on consumption b ehavior and lab or supply, and a multisectoral CGE model which simulates the macro economic e ects of a reform or a shock. The integration of the two mo dels is made using an iterative (or sequential) approach. We find that a 10% euro's depreciation stimulates the aggregate demand by increasing exports and reducing imports which increases production and reduces the unemployment rate in the economy. At the individual level, we nd that the macro economic shock reduces poverty and, to a lesser extent, income inequality. In particular, the decrease in the equilibrium wage, determined in the macro mo del, slightly reduces the available income for people who have already a job, while the reduction in the level of unemployment permits to some individuals to find a job, substantially increasing their income and, in many cases, bringing them out of poverty.
F40|Reconsidering the scarcity factor in the dynamics of oil markets: An empirical investigation of the (mis)measurement of oil reserves|This paper sheds light on the importance of the (mis)measurement of oil reserves in the market dynamics. Using proven oil reserves from three different institutional data sources and for two groups of oil-exporting countries (OPEC members and OECD major oil-exporting countries), we demonstrate that estimates of oil reserves from different institutions are likely to be driven by some common factors for the OPEC panel, which is not the case for the non-OPEC panel. The implications of these results from panel cointegration analysis can be seen in two ways. First, any discussion of the sources of reserves data seems not to be relevant since OPEC has an influence on the measure of its reserves whatever the energy agency that assesses them. Second, the literature dealing with the oil curse and the associated policy responses should consider oil reserves as an endogenous variable for the resource abundance.
F40|The Long Memory of Equity Volatility: International Evidence|This paper examines long memory volatility in international stock markets. We show that long memory volatility is widespread in eighty-two countries and that the degree of memory can be related to macroeconomic variables such as inflation, unemployment rates, interest rates or stability of a country measured by jumps. The relationships hold both in the time-series and the cross-sectional dimension. We also find that developed countries possess longer memory in volatility than emerging and frontier countries.
F40|A Sovereign Wealth Fund for a Non-Oil Producing Country: The Case of Japan|A sovereign wealth fund (hereafter SWF) would be an effective tool for preserving Japan’s national wealth in the medium to long run under a declining, aging population and for coping with external shocks in the short run. Japan is a typical non-oil producing, developed country that relies significantly on international trade. Its energy dependency rate remains around 93%, and its food sufficiency rate is less than 40%. Despite its high dependence on foreign producers, Japan’s asset holdings are still distinctly biased toward domestic assets denominated in Yen. Indeed, nation-wide foreign equity holdings are approximately 30% in Japan, while those of the UK and Germany exceed 45%. The same pattern holds in the allocation of bonds. The relative foreign asset allocation of Japan remains lower than European levels in part because of the high volatility in exchange rates and the often observed, persistent appreciation of the Yen against the US dollar. Because of this exchange rate risk, international asset allocation is not optimal. After reviewing the economics of a SWF for non-oil producing countries, we propose that Japan establish a SWF as a means of preserving its wealth for future generations
F40|Domestic Antidotes to Sudden Stops| Sudden Stops in net capital flows can be prevented when the actions of domestic investors offset a reduction in foreign lending. This paper presents evidence that while sudden stops in gross inflows—i.e., a tightening of the external borrowing constraint—are associated with global conditions and therefore, are largely outside of the control of local policymakers, domestic factors such as low levels of liability dollarization, exchange rate flexibility, inflation targeting regimes, and a solid institutional background are important to prevent these episodes from becoming sudden stops in net capital flows. Under these favorable local conditions, domestic investors may perceive reduced risk in bringing in resources at the time of an external shock, thus insulating the country from this shock.
F40|Capital Controls and the Cost of Debt|Abstract Using a panel data set for international corporate bonds and capital account restrictions in advanced and emerging economies, we show that restrictions on capital inflows produce a substantial and economically meaningful increase in corporate bond spreads, with a one-standard-deviation increase in our capital controls index increasing spreads by up to 35 basis points. The effect of capital controls on inflows differs across firms and across countries; the effect is particularly strong for firms that face more restricted access to alternative sources of external financing. Our findings establish a novel channel through which capital controls affect economic outcomes.
F40|The Volatility of Capital Flows in Emerging Markets: Measures and Determinants|Capital flow volatility is a concern for macroeconomic and financial stability. Nonetheless, literature is scarce in this topic. Our paper sheds light on this issue in two dimensions. First, using quarterly data for 33 emerging markets and developing economies over the period 1970Q1-2016Q4, we construct three measures of volatility, for total capital flows and key instruments. Second, we perform panel regressions to understand the determinants of volatility. The measures show that, after a period of sharp rise during the Global Financial Crisis, the volatility of most instruments is back to pre-crisis levels but are prone to bouts, having increased significantly during global shocks like the taper tantrum episode. Capital flow volatility thus remains a challenge for policy makers. The regression results suggest that push (external) factors are generally more important than pull (domestic) factors in explaining the volatility of capital flows. However, certain pull factors have become relevant since the Global Financial Crisis.
F40|Financial Crisis, Banking Sector Performance and Economic Growth in the European Union|This paper uses static and dynamic panel estimates in a sample including all 28 European Union countries during the last decade and provides empirical evidence on the important role that well-functioning EU banking institutions can play in promoting economic growth.In order to analyse the possible differences arising after the outbreak of the recent international financial crisis, the estimations consider two panels: one for the time period 1998-2012 and another for the subinterval 2007-2012.Considering only the years after the crisis (2007-2012), the variation of the Net Interest Margin was in line with the GDP while the variations of the Equity to Total Assets Ratio and the Equity to Liabilities Ratio contrast the GDP growth rate. These differences between the two considered time panels reflect the reactions of the European banking institutions to the recent financial crisis, as they, in general, adopted a less risky performance and decided to give particular emphasis to the traditional banking activities: receiving deposits and providing credit to finance the productive investment, in order to promote economic growth. Crisi finanziarie, attività del settore bancario e crescita economica nell’Unione Europea Al fine di illustrare l’importante ruolo che le istituzioni bancarie europee potrebbero svolgere nella promozione della crescita economica se ben gestite, questo studio utilizza un campione che include dati panel sia statici che dinamici relativi a tutti i 28 paesi dell’Unione in riferimento all’ultimo decennio. Al fine di analizzare le possibili differenze sorte dopo l’irrompere delle recenti crisi finanziarie, le stime prendono in considerazione due serie di dati: una relativa al periodo 1998-2012 e un’altra relativa all’intervallo 2007-2012. I risultati ottenuti ci consentono di confermare l’importanza delle variazioni sui capitali finanziari, sulla liquidità e sui profitti in rapporto alla crescita economica.Queste differenze rilevate all’interno dei due periodi considerati riflette le reazioni delle istituzioni bancarie europee alle recenti crisi finanziarie in quanto hanno, in generale, adottato politiche meno rischiose privilegiando le attività più tradizionali: raccolta del risparmio e concessione del credito per finanziare gli investimenti produttivi al fine di promuovere la crescita economica.
F40|Investigating first-stage exchange rate pass-through: Sectoral and macro evidence from euro area countries|In this paper, we evaluate the first-stage pass-through, namely the responsiveness of import prices to the exchange rate changes, for a sample of euro area (EA) countries. Our study aims to shed further light on the role of microeconomic factors vs. macroeconomic factors in influencing the extent of the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT). As a first step, we conduct a sectoral analysis using disaggregated import prices data. We find a much higher degree of pass-through for more homogeneous goods and commodities, such as oil and raw materials, than for highly differentiated manufactured products, such as machinery and transport equipment. Our results confirm that cross-country differences in pass-through rates may be due to divergences in the product composition of imports. The higher share of imports from sectors with lower degrees of pass-through, the lower ERPT for an economy will be. In a next step, we investigate for the impact of some macroeconomics factors or common events experienced by EA members on the extent of pass-through. Using the System Generalized Method of Moments within a dynamic panel-data model, our estimates indicate that decline of import-price sensitivity to the exchange rate is not significant since the introduction of the single currency. Our findings suggest instead that the weakness of the euro during the first three years of the monetary union significantly raised the extent of the ERPT. This outcome could explain why the sensitivity of import prices has not fallen since 1999. We also point out a significant role played by the inflation in the Eurozone, as the responsiveness of import prices to exchange rate fluctuations tends to decline in a low and more stable inflation environment. Overall, our findings support the view that the extent of pass-through is comprised of both macro- and microeconomic aspects that policymakers should take into account.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><smal<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F40|Re-examining the real interest rate parity hypothesis (RIPH) using panel unit root tests with asymmetry and cross-section dependence|Abstract This paper investigates the validity of the real interest rate parity hypothesis (RIPH) using a panel unit root approach. For this purpose, first we estimate the possible nonlinear data-generating processes of the real interest rate differential series and using these estimates determine which panel unit root test is better for analyzing the RIPH. To this end, smooth transition autoregressive and threshold autoregressive (TAR) models are estimated for two different panels of countries: G7 and post-Soviet transition economies. The results show that the data displays both strong asymmetry and high transition speed. Therefore, secondly, we propose a new panel unit root test where the alternative is stationary with asymmetric TAR adjustment, and provide their empirical power properties. Finally, we demonstrate that our newly proposed test is able to provide conclusive evidence in favor of the RIPH in contrast to the other panel unit root tests considered.
F40|The Impact of Economic Globalization on the Shadow Economy in Egypt|This study examines the economic globalization and the shadow economy nexus in Egypt. Using time series data from 1976 to 2013, the impulse response analysis shows that the response of the shadow economy in Egypt to positive shocks in economic globalization is negative and statistically significant for the first three years following the shock. This finding is obtained by controlling for several intermediary channels in globalization-shadow economy nexus such as education, government spending, industrial production, and labor force participation. Our results show the importance of promoting economic globalization by reducing the costs of doing business and trade in dealing with sizable shadow economy in Egypt.
F40|International Monetary Relations: Taking Finance Seriously|In this essay, we highlight the interactions of the international monetary system with financial conditions, not just with the output, inflation, and balance of payments goals usually discussed. We review how financial conditions and outright financial crises have posed difficulties for each of the main international monetary systems in the last 150 years or so: the gold standard, the interwar period, the Bretton Woods system, and the current system of floating exchange rates. We argue that even as the world economy has evolved and sentiments have shifted among widely different policy regimes, there remain three fundamental challenges for any international monetary and financial system: How should exchange rates between national currencies be determined? How can countries with balance of payments deficits reduce these without sharply contracting their economies and with minimal risk of possible negative spillovers abroad? How can the international system ensure that countries have access to an adequate supply of international liquidity—financial resources generally acceptable to foreigners in all circumstances? In concluding, we evaluate how the current international monetary system answers these questions.
F40|Institutions and Political Party Systems: The Euro Case|This paper argues that institutions and political party systems are simultaneously determined. A large change to the institutional framework, such as the creation of the euro by a group of European countries, will realign -after a transition period- the party system as well. The new political landscape may not be compatible with the institutions that triggered it. To illustrate this point, we study the case of the euro and how the party system has evolved in Southern and Northern European countries in response to it.
F40|Macro needs micro|An emerging consensus on the future of macroeconomics views the incorporation of a role for financial intermediation, labour market frictions, and household heterogeneity in the presence of uninsurable unemployment risk as key needed extensions to the benchmark macro framework. I argue that this is welcome, but not sufficient for macro—and international macro—to tackle the menu of issues that have been facing policy-makers since the recent global crisis. For this purpose, macro needs more micro than the benchmark set-up has been incorporating so far. Specifically, artificial separations between business cycle analysis, the study of stabilization policies, and growth macro, as well as between international macroeconomics and international trade, must be overcome. I review selected literature contributions that took steps in this direction; outline a number of important, promising directions for future research; and discuss methodological issues in the development of this agenda.
F40|Financial Globalisation Dynamic Thresholds for Financial Development: Evidence from Africa|Abstract We investigate whether financial development benefits from financial globalisation are questionable until certain thresholds of financial globalisation are attained. The empirical evidence is based on (i) data from 53 African countries for the period 2000–2011 and (ii) interactive Generalised Method of Moments with forward orthogonal deviations. The following findings are established. First, thresholds of Net Foreign Direct Investment Inflows as a percentage of GDP (FDIgdp) from which financial globalisation increases money supply are 20.50 and 16.00 for below- and above-median sub-samples of financial globalisation, respectively. Second, FDIgdp thresholds from which financial globalisation increases banking system activity and financial system activity for below-median sub-samples of financial globalisation are 13.81 and 13.29, respectively. Third, for financial size, there is evidence of: (i) a positive threshold of 21.30 in the full sample and (ii) consistent increasing returns without a modifying threshold for the above-median sub-sample. Policy implications are discussed.
F40|Institutions and Political Party Systems: The Euro Case|This paper argues that institutions and political party systems are simultaneously determined. A large change to the institutional framework, such as the creation of the euro by a group of European countries, will realign – after a transition period – the party system as well. The new political landscape may not be compatible with the institutions that triggered it. To illustrate this point, we study the case of the euro and how the party system has evolved in Southern and Northern European countries in response to it.
F40|Russia-EU28 and Russia-China trade interdependence vs. the competitiveness of the Russian economy|Research background: The actual position of a country in the international division of labour is determined by the competitiveness of its trade, the structure of which may both reveal and perpetuate the comparative advantages possessed. This is particularly true for Dutch disease economies such as Russia. Recently, economic literature has seen a growing interest in the topic of Russia’s economic relations with the European Union and China. This article is meant to be the author’s contribution to this discussion. Purposes of the article: (1) to discuss the existing trade interdependence between Russia and EU28, and Russia and China; (2) to try to assess the extent to which the current structure of Russian trade with these two partners corresponds with the competitiveness of the Russian economy. Methodology/methods: An in-depth analysis of Russia-EU28 and Russia-China trade interdependencies in 2007-2015 has been conducted, with emphasis on the categories of goods within the spectrum from low-tech to high-tech, according to the OECD classification. Furthermore, in order to analyse Russia’s competitive profile with regard to the same categories of goods, Balassa’s methodology of revealed comparative advantages has been applied. Findings & Value added: In the recent years, a growing importance of China in Russian trade can be observed, being the effect of dynamic growth of Chinese economy, cooling political relations between Moscow and Brussels and the drop in petroleum prices in international markets. Sadly, the existing structure of Russian trade with EU28 and China seems likely to preserve its traditional competitive advantages in the medium-low-tech goods and petroleum, which, in turn, will only further exacerbate the negative effects of the so-called Dutch disease affecting the Russian economy.
F40|Determinants of Net Exports in Polish and Czech Manufacturing: A Sectoral Approach with Error Correction Model|Growth model in CEE countries has based on a massive inflow of direct foreign investments, especially in manufacturing, from the onset of the transformation. This resulted in a substantial share of manufacturing goods in total exports and a high ranking position of some CEE countries among the most industrialized economies in the world. The main objective of this paper is to compare the determinants of the international competitiveness, measured by the net exports of the manufacturing sectors in the Czech and Polish economies, by using the database of 13 manufacturing sub-sectors in 1995-2011. The authors research the question of how much foreign and domestic demand, the level of labour costs, the level of sector innovation intensity, the level of sector openness to foreign markets as well as sectoral labour productivity influence the changes in trade balance. Our approach is based on employing an error correction model and SURE model to disaggregated sectoral manufacturing data. The results of the analysis conducted show substantial differences in the roles particular variables play in explaining the net exports in individual sectors. For the majority of Polish and Czech manufacturing sub-sectors, generation of positive trade balance is determined by relative demand growth. An increasing labour productivity influences heavily a positive trade balance of Polish goods in majority of sub-sectors, however, a key factor in Czech sub-sectors is decreasing unit labour costs. The results of the analysis indicate mostly a greater impact of the researched factors on net exports in long rather than short term and the better capacity of the Czech economy to correct deviations from the equilibrium.
F40|On Using Exchange Rate for Promoting Exports|The report says that there are well known explanations in contemporary economic literature which explain this counterproductive impact of depreciation.
F40|On the Relationship between Globalisation and the Economic Participation of Women in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study assesses the relationship between globalisation and the economic participation of women (EPW) in 47 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 1990-2013. Two indicators are used to measure EPW, namely, the: female labour force participation and employment rates. The empirical evidence is based on Panel-corrected Standard Errors and Fixed Effects regressions. The findings show that the positive effect of the overall globalisation index on EPW is dampened by its political component and driven by its economic and social components, with a higher positive magnitude from the former or economic globalisation. For the most part, the findings are robust to the control for several structural and institutional characteristics: varying conditioning information sets, changes in the growth of urban population, government consumption, legal systems, resource wealth, health, technological advancement, political strife and conflicts, income levels and levels of industrialisation. An extended analysis by unbundling globalisation shows that the positive incidence of social globalisation is driven by information flow (compared to personal contact and cultural proximity) while the positive effect of economic globalisation is driven by actual flows (relative to restrictions). Policy implications are discussed.
F40|A Survey on Inequality-Adjusted Human Development in Africa|The survey puts some structure on recent empirical studies from the African Governance and Development institute (AGDI) on inclusive development published between 2016 and 2017 for the most part. The emphasis is exclusively on the inequality adjusted human development index (IHDI) because of the sparse scholarly literature on the indicator which was first published in 2010. The review provides relationships between the IHDI and inter alia: foreign aid, globalisation, information and communication technology, business dynamics and knowledge economy, software piracy, finance, health worker migration and the feasibility of common cross-country policies aimed at improving the IHDI. The survey is of policy relevance because inclusive human development is fundamental to Africa’s growth agenda in the post-2015 sustainable development era.
F40|Moves Towards an Islamic Common Market: Evaluation of the Potentials|The Organization of Islamic Cooperation members had proposed the establishment of an Islamic Common Market among themselves in the early 1970s. This notion currently listed among the core objectives of the Organization and, to this end, the members adopted the TPS agreement in 1990. This study provides the first systematic and comprehensive evaluation of the TPS signatories’ potential to increase trade by applying five different trade indexes suggested in the literature. The findings reveal different characteristics of the TPS countries and shed light on their potential for enhancing economic cooperation. In general, the results are in favor of the establishment of a Preferential Trade Agreement among the TPS signatories.
F40|Inflation Convergence In East African Countries|The paper investigates inflation convergence in five East African Countries: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, as they aspire to form a monetary union by 2024 under the umbrella of the East African Community. Based on various panel unit root tests, we find that inflation rates in these countries have been converging. An explanation for the convergence is also provided from the perspective of a Global Vector Autoregressive (GVAR) model, which attributes this convergence to a similarity in terms of the nature of shocks affecting EAC countries as well as the role of foreign factors as drivers of inflation given that inflation has been low and less volatile in industrial and emerging countries since the early 1990s.
F40|Assessing marginal, threshold, and net effects of financial globalisation on financial development in Africa|This paper contributes to the extant literature by simultaneously accounting for variations in financial development and financial globalisation in the assessment of hypothetical initial financial development conditions for the rewards of financial globalisation. For this purpose, we examine marginal, threshold and net effects of financial globalisation on financial development throughout the conditional distributions of financial development. The empirical evidence is based on contemporary and non-contemporary quantile regressions with data from 53 African countries for the period 1996–2011. Financial globalisation is measured with net foreign direct investment inflows, whereas financial development entails all dimensions identified by the Financial Development and Structure Database of the World Bank. The findings consistently reveal (i) positive marginal effects, (ii) unfeasible financial globalisation positive thresholds and (iii) negative financial globalisation net effects. The second and third findings are fundamentally due to marginal effects of low positive magnitude. Policy implications are discussed.
F40|Fuel Exports, Aid and Terrorism|This study employs interactive quantile regressions to assess the conditional role of foreign aid in reducing the potentially negative effect of terrorism on fuel exports in 78 developing countries for the period 1984-2008. Bilateral and multilateral aid indicators are used whereas terrorism includes: domestic, transnational, unclear and total terrorism dynamics. Interactive quantile regressions are used. The following findings are established. First, the effects of terrorism are both positive and negative across quantiles and specifications, with the impact most apparent in the highest and lowest quantiles. Second, while bilateral aid consistently decreases (increases) fuel exports at the top (bottom) quantiles, multilateral aid regularly decreases fuel exports in the top quantiles. Third, for negative thresholds in the 50th quartile and 90th decile, interaction effects between bilateral aid and terrorism dynamics are overwhelmingly not significant. Conversely, for transnational terrorism, the interaction effects between multilateral aid and terrorism dynamics significantly have negative thresholds. The hypothesis of a positive threshold is only confirmed for transnational terrorism and multilateral aid at the 90th decile. Justifications for unexpected signs and implications for fuel export policy and the management of multinational companies are discussed. This study contributes to the literature on the role of external flows in reducing the negative externalities of terrorism on development outcomes.
F40|Openness, ICT and Entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study has examined how information and communication technology (ICT) influences openness to improve the conditions of doing business in sub-Saharan Africa. The data is for the period 2000-2012. ICT is proxied with Internet and mobile phone penetration rates whereas openness is measured in terms of financial and trade globalisation. Ten indicators of doing business are used, namely: (i) cost of business start-up procedures; (ii) procedure to enforce a contract; (iii) start-up procedures to register a business; (iv) time required to build a warehouse; (v) time required to enforce a contract; (vi) time required to register a property; (vii) time required to start a business; (viii) time to export; (ix) time to prepare and pay taxes and (x) time to resolve an insolvency. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments with forward orthogonal deviations. While we find substantial evidence that ICT complements openness to improve conditions for entrepreneurship, the effects are contingent on the dynamics of openness, ICT and entrepreneurship. Theoretical and practical policy implications are discussed. The inquiry is based on two contemporary development concerns: the need for policy to leverage on the ICT penetration potential in the sub-region and the relevance of entrepreneurship in addressing associated issues of population growth such as unemployment.
F40|The Role of Openness in the Effect of ICT on Governance|The study investigates how openness influences information and communication technology (ICT) penetration for improved government quality in sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000-2012. Openness is measured in terms of trade and financial globalisation whereas ICT is proxied with mobile phone and internet penetration rates. Ten bundled and unbundled governance indicators are used. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments with forward orthogonal deviations. The main findings are: First, financial openness has an edge over trade openness when combined with ICT to affect both economic and institutional governance. Second, mobile phones have an edge over internet penetration in complementing (i) trade openness for economic governance and (ii) financial openness for institutional governance. Third, net effects on political governance are consistently negative. Taken together, in the short-run, openness-driven ICT policies are more rewarding in terms of economic and institutional governance than political governance. Fourth, catch-up in governance is facilitated by the interaction between openness and ICT. Contributions of these findings to literature are discussed.
F40|International Competitiveness of Czech Manufacturing - A Sectoral Approach with Error Correction Model|The main objective of this paper is to find the determinants of the international competitiveness of the manufacturing sectors of the Czech economy, using the database of 13 manufacturing subsectors in 1995-2011, with the aid of ECM model. The authors research the question of how much foreign and domestic demand, the level of labour costs, the level of sector innovation intensity, the level of sector openness to foreign markets as well as sectoral labour productivity influence the changes in their trade balance. The results of the analysis conducted show substantial differences in the roles particular variables play in explaining the net exports in individual sectors. The results of the analysis indicate mostly a greater impact of the researched factors on net exports in long rather than short term.
F40|Disentangling the channels from birthdate to educational attainment|This paper uses a large multi-country database with data from the OECD PISA program to disentangle the effects of birthdate on educational performance. As far as age effects are concerned, we conclude that children are disadvantaged because they are the youngest in class (relative age effect), not because they are young per se. Our findings go against delaying mandatory school entry as a general policy, as there is no gain from a rise in entry age - keeping age differences among students constant - to make up for the shortening of length of schooling. Such an evidence that postponing school entry postpones learning is more marked for children belonging to disadvantaged households. In contrast, the relative age effect does not interact with family background, and remains stable across school entry age cohorts. The size of this effect, measured at the age 15 is not large, but its interaction with early grade retention and tracking may enhance long-term effects. Finally, we do not detect an association between birthdate and achievement originating in unobservable characteristics of students.
F40|Currency Manipulation|Many central banks manage the stochastic behavior of their currencies' exchange rates by imposing pegs relative to a target currency. We study the effects of such currency manipulation in a multi-country model of exchange rate determination with endogenous capital accumulation. We find that the imposition of an exchange rate peg relative to a given target currency increases the volatility of consumption in the target country and decreases the volatility of the target currency's exchange rate relative to all other currencies in the world. In addition, currency pegs affect the formation of capital across sectors and countries. For example, an economically smaller country (such as Saudi Arabia) pegging its currency to an economically large country (such at the U.S.) decreases capital accumulation in the larger country and increases its real and nominal interest rate
F40|Dealing with time-inconsistency: Inflation targeting vs. exchange rate targeting|Abandoning an objective function with multiple targets and adopting single mandate can be an effective way for a central bank to overcome the classic time-inconsistency problem. We show that the choice of a particular single mandate depends on an economy’s level of trade openness and the credibility of the central bank. We begin with reduced form empirical results which show that as central banks become less credible they are more likely to adopt a pegged exchange rate, and crucially, the tendency to peg depends on trade openness. Then in a model where the central bank displays “loose commitment” we show that as central bank credibility falls, they are more likely to adopt either an inflation target or a pegged exchange rate. A relatively closed economy would adopt an inflation target to overcome the time-inconsistency problem, but a highly open economy would prefer an exchange rate peg.
F40|Exchange Rates, International Trade and Growth: Re-Evaluation of Undervaluation|This paper shows that a regional bias resulting from trade integration alters the transmission of a country’s monetary policy by shifting the burden of the exchange rate adjustment towards the less integrated trading partners. I first develop a simple model which illustrates how a concentration of trade flows among regional trading partners affects the sensitivity of the trade balance to the terms-of-trade. In particular, the trade balance becomes less sensitive to the terms-of-trade vis-a-vis regional partners and more sensitive to the terms-of-trade vis-a-vis the other country. I then test the implication of the model using a panel of 133 countries between 1985 - 2010 that includes information on Regional Trade Agreements (RTA). I find that movements in the terms-of-trade vis-a-vis non-RTA members affect a country’s trade balance, while movements vis-a-vis RTA partners do not.
F40|Determinants of Islamic Banking Growth: An Empirical Analysis|This paper examined the determinants of growth rate in Islamic banking using annual time series data. We apply several econometrics methods including Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and survey based indicators. We use the World Bank Enterprise Survey data to supplement our answers. Our results support the view that high oil prices, stable domestic prices, higher educated populace and greater presence of capital resources have positive effects on growth in Islamic banking. Our findings revealed that instability adversely affect Islamic banking growth. We found no clear conclusion on the impact of economic growth, greater presence of Muslim population and presence of sharia in the legal system of the country on Islamic banking growth. The major constraints impeding Islamic banking growth include regulations, tax rates, and skilled labor force. The findings call for urgent policy measures in the medium and longterm, which includes price stability, regional stability, tax reform, revamp the education system and increase sensitization of Islamic finance. Secondary school education should be encouraged to address skilled labor force. Women participation in the labor force needs to be encouraged in order to enhance greater sensitization.
F40|The Volatility of Capital Flows in Emerging Markets; Measures and Determinants|Capital flow volatility is a concern for macroeconomic and financial stability. Nonetheless, literature is scarce in this topic. Our paper sheds light on this issue in two dimensions. First, using quarterly data for 65 countries over the period 1970Q1-2016Q1, we construct three measures of volatility, for total capital flows and key instruments. Second, we perform panel regressions to understand the determinants of volatility. The measures show that the volatility of all instruments is prone to bouts, rising sharply during global shocks like the taper tantrum episode. Capital flow volatility thus remains a challenge for policy makers. The regression results suggest that push factors can be more important than pull factors in explaining volatility, illustrating that the characteristics of volatility can be different from those of the flows levels.
F40|A wavelet transformation approach to crude oil price and CZK/USD exchange rate dependence|In this paper, we contribute to the literature on the dependency between oil price returns and CZK/USD exchange rate returns. Oil price is one of the most important determinants for an explanation of the long-term behaviour of exchange rates, especially for USD dollar. The oil shock transmission mechanism is through the exchange rate channel and so the deeply understanding of this process is essential not only for investors but also for monetary authority. We utilised wavelet transform analysis so that we can analyse the dependency in the time-frequency domain. Our analysis finds that the connection between returns time series changes in time and scales. The major implications of our findings are important for effective monetary policies aimed at controlling inflationary pressures.
F40|Does SADC constitute an optimum currency area? Evidence from generalised purchasing power parity|The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has ambitious plans of economic integration for the region. It is planning to introduce a common currency and a regional central bank by the year 2018. As advocated by the optimal currency area (OCA) theory, lower transaction costs, stable prices, efficient resource allocation and improved access to goods, labour and financial markets are some of the benefits accrued from monetary unions. Relinquishing monetary and exchange rate policies are cited as the main costs of joining such a union. It is argued that sufficient and sound economic bases should be in place for a monetary union to be effective and yield the desired result. The primary objective of this paper was to determine whether SADC constitute an OCA. The study employs the generalised purchasing power parity (GPPP) framework consistent with OCA theory on price (inflation rate) and exchange rate. The method included Johansen cointegration test, vector error correction model and Pedron`s panel cointegration test. The findings of the study suggest that GPPP holds in SADC. This can be interpreted as existence of similarities of fundamental macroeconomic factors that drive real exchange rates in the region. This evidence suggests that bilateral real exchange rates in the SADC region share a common stochastic trend in the long-run. However, the differences in the size of coefficients of normalised long-run cointegrating equation suggest that the aggregate demand patterns in the region are dissimilar and indicate asymmetries in exchange rate adjustment process to disequilibrium in the region. Other economic concerns such as business cycle synchronisation, and convergence of key macroeconomic variables including budget deficit, government debt and foreign reserves cover should be thoroughly investigated before the said economic union is implemented.
F40|FDI Flows to Latin America: A Pooled and Cointegration Analysis, 1980-2014|This paper estimates a pooled (fixed-effects) FDI investment function that seeks to identify some of the major economic and institutional determinants of net FDI flows to nine major Latin American countries during the 1980-2014 period. First, it develops a conceptual framework of analysis that seeks to identify some of the major economic and institutional determinants of FDI. Second, the paper gives an overview of FDI flows to Latin America during the 1990-2015 period, with particular emphasis on their contribution to the financing of gross capital formation. Third, an empirical model for FDI flows to Latin America is outlined and an economic rationale is provided for the included variables and their expected signs. Fourth, the estimates from a panel regression designed to explain the variation in FDI flows to Latin America during the 1980-2014 period suggests that market size (proxied by real GDP), credit provided by the private banking sector, government expenditures on education, and the level of economic freedom as measured by the Fraser Institute have a positive and significant effect. On the other hand, public investment spending, the volatility of real GDP and the real exchange rate have a negative and significant effect on FDI flows. The panel unit root tests on the residuals of the relevant panel regressions also suggest that there is a stable, long-term relationship among the included variables; i.e., the selected variables in the reported regressions are cointegrated over the relevant time period. Finally, the paper summarizes the major findings and offers some policy prescriptions for attracting FDI flows to the region and enhancing their positive direct and indirect effects.
F40|Endividamento Público e Crescimento Econômico: Evidências Para Países em Desenvolvimento|This paper analyzes the relationship between total public indebtedness and real per capita GDP growth in developing countries. Initially, an effort is made to review the literature, both empirically and theoretically, to understand the possible mechanisms for linking public indebtedness to economic growth. Afterward, empirical exercises are carried out by a panel composed of 69 countries in a 25-year interval (1988 - 2012). The first exercise is a descriptive statistics analysis where we find evidence of a negative relationship between the level of indebtedness and economic growth. After this, a brief econometric analysis is done estimating an augmented growth model with the debt variable via the pooled OLS estimator. The econometric results seem to confirm the existence of a negative linear relationship between public indebtedness and economic growth. Finally, evidence of non-linearity is also found in the relationship between indebtedness and economic growth, when the interaction between debt and interest rates or inflation are taken into account
F40|Tradability Index: A Comprehensive Measure for the Tradability of Output|This paper describes the main features of a measure for the specialisation in producing tradable output which is labelled tradability index. It is based on the assumption that all sectors produce goods and services that are tradable but to varying degrees. Therefore, while all sectors produce tradable output, the extent of the tradability varies across sectors depending on their export orientation at the global level. Combined with the economic structure of countries, the tradability of sectors can be used to calculate the tradability index. This technical paper explains the basic concepts of the tradability index and provides information on the underlying data.
F40|Export market shares – a trivial concept?|The European Commission and euro area central banks use different methods to calculate export market shares and rely on different data sources to do so. Thus, the resulting evidence varies considerably over time, prompting different economic policy conclusions with respect to the development of export competitiveness – which is an undesirable fact. This paper presents methods and data sources used to derive export market shares with a view to explaining these differences. We conclude that the export market share concept is trivial only at a first glance because it can be implemented in a number of ways none of which would appear to be the single best practice.
F40|On the Relationship between Globalisation and the Economic Participation of Women in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study assesses the relationship between globalisation and the economic participation of women (EPW) in 47 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 1990-2013. Two indicators are used to measure EPW, namely, the: female labour force participation and employment rates. The empirical evidence is based on Panel-corrected Standard Errors and Fixed Effects regressions. The findings show that the positive effect of the overall globalisation index on EPW is dampened by its political component and driven by its economic and social components, with a higher positive magnitude from the former or economic globalisation. For the most part, the findings are robust to the control for several structural and institutional characteristics: varying conditioning information sets, changes in the growth of urban population, government consumption, legal systems, resource wealth, health, technological advancement, political strife and conflicts, income levels and levels of industrialisation. An extended analysis by unbundling globalisation shows that the positive incidence of social globalisation is driven by information flow (compared to personal contact and cultural proximity) while the positive effect of economic globalisation is driven by actual flows (relative to restrictions). Policy implications are discussed.

F40|Fuel Exports, Aid and Terrorism|This study employs interactive quantile regressions to assess the conditional role of foreign aid in reducing the potentially negative effect of terrorism on fuel exports in 78 developing countries for the period 1984-2008. Bilateral and multilateral aid indicators are used whereas terrorism includes: domestic, transnational, unclear and total terrorism dynamics. Interactive quantile regressions are used. The following findings are established. First, the effects of terrorism are both positive and negative across quantiles and specifications, with the impact most apparent in the highest and lowest quantiles. Second, while bilateral aid consistently decreases (increases) fuel exports at the top (bottom) quantiles, multilateral aid regularly decreases fuel exports in the top quantiles. Third, for negative thresholds in the 50th quartile and 90th decile, interaction effects between bilateral aid and terrorism dynamics are overwhelmingly not significant. Conversely, for transnational terrorism, the interaction effects between multilateral aid and terrorism dynamics significantly have negative thresholds. The hypothesis of a positive threshold is only confirmed for transnational terrorism and multilateral aid at the 90th decile. Justifications for unexpected signs and implications for fuel export policy and the management of multinational companies are discussed. This study contributes to the literature on the role of external flows in reducing the negative externalities of terrorism on development outcomes.
F40|The Role of Openness in the Effect of ICT on Governance|The study investigates how openness influences information and communication technology (ICT) penetration for improved government quality in sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000-2012. Openness is measured in terms of trade and financial globalisation whereas ICT is proxied with mobile phone and internet penetration rates. Ten bundled and unbundled governance indicators are used. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments with forward orthogonal deviations. The main findings are: First, financial openness has an edge over trade openness when combined with ICT to affect both economic and institutional governance. Second, mobile phones have an edge over internet penetration in complementing (i) trade openness for economic governance and (ii) financial openness for institutional governance. Third, net effects on political governance are consistently negative. Taken together, in the short-run, openness-driven ICT policies are more rewarding in terms of economic and institutional governance than political governance. Fourth, catch-up in governance is facilitated by the interaction between openness and ICT. Contributions of these findings to literature are discussed.

F40|Decentralized multinational banks and risk taking: the spanish experience in the crisis|This paper analyses the effects of decentralized multinational banks, characterized by the large autonomy of the affiliates that the banking group has abroad, on bank’s risk, using Spanish confidential supervisory data. Having activity abroad, in countries whose business and financial cycles may be less than perfectly correlated with those of the home country can generate more stability in the results of the consolidated banking group. Such isolation should be greater for multinational and decentralized banks. On the other hand, the international activity of banks may be associated to more risk taking as distance can hinder the ability of a bank’s headquarters to monitor its subsidiaries or because of the more limited knowledge of the host country that the group has. Which effect dominates is an empirical matter which could be taken into account in capital requirements and when carrying out stress-tests. We provide empirical evidence of the relevance of the model of entry into foreign markets, international geographic diversification and business co-movements between the Spanish and the host economy on bank’s ex-post risk. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that geographic diversification reduces risk.
F40|Monetary policy transmission with two exchange rates and a single currency : The Chinese experience|In emerging market economies, transmission of monetary policy through the foreign exchange market is complicated by the coexistence of financial restrictions and arbitrages. Using China as an example, we show that the coexistence of exchange rate interventions, capital controls and an on-shore-offshore exchange rate differential makes the long run equilibrium in the currency market nonlinear. Disturbances to this nonlinear long run equilibrium could offset the impact of monetary policy actions on domestic price stability. Omitting such nonlinearity leads to biased inference on the effectiveness of monetary policy.
F40|Managing real exchange rate for economic development :empirical evidences from developing countries|This paper analyses macroeconomic policies capable of influencing the long-run real exchange rate (RER). In this vein, it identifies economic policy tools that can devalue RER, covering a theoretical issue neglected by the economic literature, which argues that competitive exchange rate enhances growth. After discussing the “Trilemma”, we identify those variables that could affect RER without constraining monetary policy or exchange rate regime choice. In what follows, we model the probability of achieving an undervalued (small or large) RER for a sample of 14 developing countries from 1980 to 2010 (30 years) by applying econometric techniques for discrete choice and censored data. Afterwards, we compare the results for Latin-American nations with Asian ones. They suggest that competitive exchange rate requires different approaches depending on the region. Moreover, Latin American countries need to take on additional policies so that interventions in the Foreign Exchange Market become effective.
F40|The impact of economic globalization on the shadow economy in Egypt|This study examines the economic globalization and the shadow economy nexus in Egypt. Using time series data from 1976 to 2013, the impulse response analysis shows that the response of the shadow economy in Egypt to positive shocks in economic globalization is negative and statistically significant for the first three years following the shock. This finding is obtained by controlling for several intermediary channels in globalization-shadow economy nexus such as education, government spending, industrial production, and labor force participation. Our results show the importance of promoting economic globalization by reducing the costs of doing business and trade in dealing with sizable shadow economy in Egypt.
F40|Public Debt Sustainability and Defaults|We offer a new methodology for the assessment of public debt sustainability in a stochastic economy when sovereign default taken into account. The default threshold differs from the no-Ponzi condition and depends on the post-default debt recovery rule. We distinguish sustainability and unsustainability conditions, related to alternative scenarios on the future sequence of shocks. We highlight the role of the debt recovery ratio on the whole dynamics of public debt. When a sovereign default occurs, the sustainability of the post-default debt is ensured when the haircut is sufficiently large. Lastly we provide an explanation of serial defaults.
F40|What Does Trade Openness Measure?|An empirical measure of trade openness is defined as the ratio of total trade to GDP, and represents a convenient variable routinely used for cross‐country studies on a variety of issues. However, the effects that the crude measure captures remain ambiguous, making it difficult to interpret the empirical results. Drawing on several strands of the literature, this study examines the informational content of the trade openness measure using intranational and international data. We find that, even for fully integrated economies within a country, trade openness is approximately half as variable as it is for segmented diverse countries around the world. The information it conveys is better characterized as the extent of the economic remoteness and idiosyncratic distribution of sectoral production. The cross‐country variation of trade openness derives more from the variability in GDP than trade.
F40|External debt and monetary policy autonomy|During a time of rising world interest rates, the central bank of a small open economy may be motivated to increase its own interest rate to keep from suffering a destabilizing outflow of capital and depreciation in the exchange rate. Empirically, this paper shows that this is especially true for a small open economy with a current account deficit, which relies on foreign capital inflows to finance this deficit. In addition, the method of current account financing has a large effect on whether or not the central bank will opt for exchange rate and capital flow stabilization during a time of rising world interest rates. A current account deficit financed mainly through reserve depletion or the accumulation of private sector debt will cause the central bank to pursue de facto exchange rate stabilization, whereas a current account deficit financed through equity or FDI will not. Quantitatively, reserve depletion of about 7% of GDP will motivate the central bank with a floating currency to adjust its interest rate in line with the foreign interest rate to where it appears that the central bank has an exchange rate peg.

El presente artículo muestra de manera empírica que esto es especialmente cierto para una economía abierta pequeña con un déficit en cuenta corriente, la cual depende de la entrada de capital extranjero para financiar su déficit. Asimismo, el método de financiación de cuenta corriente tiene un efecto importante sobre si el banco central optará o no por la estabilización de la tasa del cambio y flujo de capital durante un periodo de alza de tasa de interés mundial. Un déficit de cuenta corriente financiado fundamentalmente con el agotamiento de la reserva o la acumulación de deuda procedente del sector privado ocasionará que el banco central busque de facto la estabilización de la tasa de cambio, mientras que un déficit de cuenta corriente que se financie mediante la venta de acciones o inversión extranjera directa no lo hará. Desde el punto de vista cuantitativo, un agotamiento de la reserva de un 7% del PIB motivará que el banco central con moneda flotante ajuste su tasa de interés en línea con la tasa de interés extranjera con la que parezca que el banco central tiene fijado un tipo de cambio.
F40|Value Added in Motion: Determinants of Value Added Location within the EU|"In this paper we approach the determinants of value added location across European countries, from the recent developments to the 2035 horizon. In the first part of the paper, using detailed trade data, we show how competitiveness, demand and export composition have shaped the market shares of European countries, hence the location of production in Europe. Variance and covariance analysis point to the specificity of two countries: the overall market share development seems to be significantly affected by aggregate demand conditions in Germany and Italy. We then turn to trade in value added and observe that bigger countries tend to report a higher share of domestic value added because they can count on more efficient national value chains or a higher diversity of goods upstream. Interestingly, such evidence does not apply to Germany, or Poland, which exhibit a more dynamic insertion in international value chains. In the second part of the paper, we present the main prospects for the allocation of labour (i.e. migration), value added and the macro-economic effects of energy prices across European countries up to year 2035. The projections presented in the paper aim to summarize the main results obtained by other researchers within the ""Value Added in Motion (VAM)"" project."
F40|Financialisation, Debt and Inequality: Export-led Mercantilist and Debt-led Private Demand Boom Economies in a Stock-flow consistent Model|In the era of financialisation, increasing income inequality could be observed in most developed and many developing countries. Despite these similar developments in inequality, the growth performance and drivers for growth differed markedly among countries, allowing clusters of different growth regimes to be identified. Among them are two extreme types: the debt-led private-demand boom and the export-led mercantilist economies. Whereas the former rely mainly on credit-financed household consumption in order to compensate for the potential lack of demand (associated with the depressing effect of financialisation), the latter rely on net exports as the main driver of aggregate demand. Using a stock-flow consistent model it will be demonstrated how increasing inequality, depending on a countries institutional structure and regulatory framework, affects growth differently, explaining the occurrence of both regime types.
F40|Drivers of the Post-Crisis Slump in the Eurozone and the US|The Global Crisis led to a sharp contraction and long-lasting slump in both Eurozone and US real activity, but the post-crisis adjustment in the Eurozone and the US shows striking differences. This column argues that financial shocks were key determinants of the 2008-09 Great Recession, for both the Eurozone and the US. The post-2009 slump in the Eurozone mainly reflects a combination of adverse aggregate demand and supply shocks, in particular lower productivity growth, and persistent adverse shocks to capital investment linked to the poor health of the Eurozone financial system. Mono-causal explanations of the persistent slump are thus insufficient. Adverse financial shocks were less persistent for the US.
F40|International Value-Added Linkages in Development Accounting|Development accounting evaluates how much of the variation in per-worker incomes across countries can be attributed to quantifiable factor endowments, and how much is due to unobserved TFP differences. We use a standard trade model to generalise the development accounting framework to a setting in which countries are open to trade, and consume both domestic and foreign value added. In addition to differences in factor endowments and TFPs, the generalised framework highlights differences in relative factor costs as source of real-income variation across countries. In turn, countries' relative factor costs are determined by their trade linkages, and the international distribution of factor endowments and expenditures. We use information on value-added trade from international input-output tables for 40 major economies in the period 1995-2011 to back out their relative factor costs in a model-consistent manner. Incorporating this information into the development accounting equation reduces the variation in unobserved TFPs required to explain the distribution of per-worker incomes among our sample countries by more than one half. Our findings suggest that the large international TFP differences found in traditional development-accounting exercises are in part due to their implicit assumption that countries are closed.
F40|The effect of a Chinese slowdown on inflation in the euro area and the United States|We investigate the effect of a Chinese slowdown on inflation in the euro area and the United States using the NiGEM multi-country model. We construct different scenarios including a fall in Chinese aggregate demand, a commodity price slump, financial market corrections and a devaluation of the renmimbi. While the commodity slump has the strongest impact on inflation, the demand and exchange rate shocks also play a role; on the contrary, financial turbulences have minor effects. Finally, we study the extent to which monetary policy in advanced economies can succeed in reflating the economy following such a Chinese slowdown. The room for central bank interventions is large.
F40|Existence and uniqueness of equilibrium in a distorted dynamic small open economy|We provide a set of sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of recursive equilibrium for a class of small open economies with distortion. The second welfare theorem is not available in this framework and usual approach for studying optimal neoclassical growth models is also not applicable.
F40|Social and Economic Diagnostics of Foreign Economic Activity of the Rostov Region|Social and economic diagnostics is a new scientific trend to research regional market phenomena and processes. Its emergence is traditionally connected with the synthesis of methodological economic researches and applied methods and procedures systems engineering, sociology, management, mathematical statistics and cybernetics. The word “diagnostics” means detection, determining the state of the researched object. The analysis of the scientific reserve on the problem of regional economy diagnostics testifies about the possibility to adapt it to the research of the foreign economic activity development of the region.
F40|On Using Exchange Rate for Promoting Exports|In recent years, Pakistani exports suffered large setback and especially textile exports decreased significantly. Some economists are suggesting devaluation1 of Pakistani Rupee to improve the exports [Javed, et al. (2016)]. Many countries including Pakistan have experimented devaluation in the past to boost exports, but most of these experiment did not bring desired results and a significant change in the balance of trade could not be observed. For example, value of Pakistani rupee declined by 20 percent during 1981-82 and by 34 percent during 2007-09. No improvement in trade could be observed after each episode of depreciation, on contrary, the gap between exports and imports widened. There are well known explanations in contemporary economic literature which explain this counterproductive impact of depreciation. However, analysing the impacts of depreciation and/or devaluation in context of trade only is never justifiable. The depreciation of local currency has serious implications for many other important economic indicators including external debt, tax revenue, budget deficit, current account deficit and domestic inflation. For H[DPSOHDRQHSHUFHQWUHGXFWLRQLQYDOXHRIORFDOFXUUHQF\µFDXVHV¶DQLQFUHDVH in external debt by the same percentage, measured in local currency. Due to this increase in the external debt, the amount needed for debt servicing shall also increase which increases the budget deficit and the current account deficits. The suggestion of depreciation could be supported only if the sum of expected gains from all kinds of its impacts are positive. Given the complexity of all this estimation, one can focus on external debt and balance of trade. The effect of depreciation on external debt can be easily counted, and the improvement in trade must be more than the increase in external debt to justify depreciation. Taking into account all these factors, particularly the debt factor, it could be easily seen that net impacts of devaluation are negative and extremely harmful for the Pakistan Economy.
F40|Exchange rates and the Swiss economy|Safe haven capital inflows and other factors have caused the Swiss franc to appreciate and posed challenges for policymakers. We find that these exchange rate changes do not affect the volume of exports from Switzerland’s most advanced sectors, pharmaceuticals and watches, but do matter for exports of medium-high-technology products such as capital goods and machinery. We also report that appreciations do not affect stock prices and goods prices for the pharmaceutical and watch industries but cause both stock and goods prices to tumble for the capital goods and machinery sectors. We draw many policy lessons from these findings for Switzerland and for the rest of the world.
F40|Trade Policy and Structural Reforms at the Zero Lower Bound: Lessons Learned and Suggestions for Europe|Calls for market reforms to help improve economic performance have become a mantra in European policy discussions. In the recent years, fears of a new wave of protectionism reopened the debate on the macroeconomic effects of raising tariff and non-tariff barriers. In this policy paper, we evaluate the consequences of such policy options for economies in a liquidity trap - i.e. at times of major slack and binding constraints on monetary policy easing (such as when the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is binding). First, we analyse the consequences of protectionism through the lens of a benchmark business cycle model. We show that raising trade barriers has contractionary effects both domestically and abroad. Such detrimental effects are larger in a liquidity trap. We conclude that Europe should not engage in protectionism, even in response to an increase in the level of tariffs imposed by a major trading partner (such as the U.S.). We then review recent trends in product and labor market regulation across the European Union members. Using results from the academic literature, we argue that market reforms in Europe are unlikely to induce significant deflationary effects, suggesting that the inability of monetary policy to deliver interest rate cuts might not be a relevant obstacle to reform. While coordinated structural reforms across the EU members would maximise short- and long-term gains, legal considerations of the implementation of reforms across countries pose challenges to the harmonisation process.
F40|Conditional linkages between iron ore exports, foreign aid and terrorism|Abstract We employ interactive quantile regressions to assess conditional linkages between foreign aid, iron ore exports and terrorism from a panel of 78 developing countries for the period of 1984–2008. The following main findings are established. First, it is primarily in the countries with the highest level of iron ore exports that terrorism affects exports. Second, bilateral aid has an impact on iron ore exports, while the evidence for such a relationship between multilateral aid and iron ore exports is limited. Third, there is limited support for the main hypothesis motivating this line of inquiry, notably that foreign aid can be used to mitigate a potentially negative effect of terrorism on resource exports. The results suggest that bilateral aid is more relevant at mitigating the negative effects of domestic and total terrorism on iron ore exports.
F40|The Comparative Inclusive Human Development of Globalisation in Africa|Abstract This study examines the impact of globalisation on inclusive human development in 51 African countries for the period 1996–2011 with particular emphasis on income levels (low income vs. middle income), legal origins (English common law vs. French civil law), resource wealth (oil-rich vs. oil-poor), landlockedness (landlocked vs. unlandlocked), religious domination (Christianity vs. Islam) and political stability (stable vs. unstable). The empirical evidence is based on instrumental variable panel Fixed effects and Tobit regressions in order to control for the unobserved heterogeneity and limited range in the dependent variable. Political, economic, social and general globalisation variables are used. Six main hypotheses are investigated. The findings broadly show that middle income, English common law, oil-poor, unlandlocked, Christian-oriented and politically-stable countries are associated with comparatively higher levels of globalisation-driven inclusive human development. Puzzling findings are elucidated and policy implications discussed.
F40|Globalization and Inclusive Human Development in Africa|This study extents the literature on responses to a recent World Bank report on the African poverty tragedy by assessing the effect of globalisation on inclusive human development in 51 African countries for the period 1996–2011. Political, economic, social and general globalisation variables are used. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) and Instrumental Quantile Regressions (IQR). While estimated coefficients are not significant in GMM results, for IQR, globalisation positively affects inclusive human development and the favourable effect is higher in countries with high initial levels of inclusive development. The main economic implication is that in the post-2015 development agenda, countries would benefit more from globalisation by increasing their levels of inclusive development.
F40|On the Neutrality of Money in CEE (EU Member) States: A Panel Cointegration Analysis|The concept of money neutrality is an important pillar of the mainstream economic literature. It implies that autonomous changes in the money supply have no influence on real macroeconomic variables in the long run. The goal of this paper is to test the validity of (long-run) money neutrality proposition in the CEE (EU member) states. The empirical research is based on panel cointegration analysis which utilises annual data on real output and broad (M2) as well as narrow (M1) monetary aggregates over the 1995–2013 period for 11 ex-socialist EU countries. The results suggest that the money neutrality proposition could be rejected in both cases when narrow or broad measure of money supply is applied, meaning that an active monetary policy could and should be used as a stabilisation instrument as well as in stimulating real economic activity.
F40|Międzynarodowa pozycja inwestycyjna netto krajów Unii Europejskiej w latach 2006–2014 / Net international investmnet position of the countries of European Union in the years 2006–2014|The aim of the study is to evaluate changes in the net international investment position in the European Union in the years 2006–2014 in the context of compliance within the framework of the announced process of macroeconomic disturbances. It was reviewed of the most important theoretical concepts. The goal of the article is a critical analysis of the literature of the subject and analysis of statistical data regarding the international investment position of countries for the period 2006–2014. On this basis, it was made an attempt to assess the current movement behavior of the MPI net balance in the EU. In the EU there are significant differences in capital flows measured by the net international position. The outbreak of the crisis in 2008 caused changes in trend in the development of the capital structure in MPI. During 2006–2014 increased the absolute value of the assets and liabilities of MPI. In most EU countries deepens the negative balance of financial flows of international investment position to GDP of the countries.
F40|Does Trade Liberalization Affects International Trade Tax Revenue? Evidence from Dynamic Panel Threshold Method|This paper examines the relationship between trade liberalization and trade tax revenues applying an advanced dynamic panel threshold technique. The empirical analysis is based on a large panel-dataset including 103 developing countries for the period 1993-2012. The empirical finding results indicate that the relationship between trade liberalization and trade tax revenue is non-liner and also provide evidence of a Laffer effect. In particular, we find that additional trade liberalization has a negative impact on trade tax revenue, but this negative effect will disappear at the higher levels of trade liberalization. The results point to harness the benefits of trade liberalization without having worry a lot about its impact on trade tax revenues.
F40|Currency Integration of the New EU Member Countries|The study analyzes the process of monetary integration of the New Member Countries from the moment of their accession to the European Union. The focus of investigation is on the nominal convergence (the fulfillment of the Maastricht criteria) and on the satisfaction of the Optimum Currency Area criteria by the New Member States. More specifically, the trade integration, the financial integration, the output structure and the labor markets of the New Member States are explored from the standpoints of the Optimum Currency Area theory and in the context of the already accomplished or forthcoming membership of the New Member States in the Euro Area. The experience of the NMS, which have already adopted the Euro, is also reviewed.
F40|Breaking down world trade elasticities: a panel ECM approach|This paper exhaustively analyses the recent decline of international trade elasticities to output growth. We extend an empirical model of import demand functions to account not only for transitory factors, such as relative prices and import intensity-adjusted measures of demand (I-O Tables), but also for habitually neglected permanent factors such as protectionism, vertical integration (i.e. Global Value Chains) and foreign direct investment (FDI). Dealing with a non-stationary heteregenous panel of 27 countries, we estimate a panel Error Correction Model from 1960 to 2015 in order to break down world trade elasticities. Our main findings evidence: i) the presence of panel (cointegrating) structural changes in the trade-to-GDP relationship in 2000 and 2009, private consumption being a source of disruption; ii) although investment and exports are the most sensitive, import-intensive components of demand, this is far from being transitory, which is clearly weighing on the current slowdown; iii) the relevant contribution of GVCs shows a procyclical pattern, questioning the permanent nature of the current levelling-off of vertical integration processes. The lack of progress in reducing import tariffs and the usual discarded, complementary relationship between FDI and imports have a residual role. All in all, our results have substantial policy implications, as they reinforce the idea of a historical break towards a new ‘normal’ trading phase.
F40|Adjusting the external adjustment: cyclical factors and the Italian current account|We investigate the role of cyclical factors in the adjustment of Italy’s external balance from 2010, developing a model that infers the potential levels of domestic demand and of imports and exports from an exogenous measure of potential output, in an internally coherent fashion and also taking composition effects into account. According to our results, in 2015 Italy’s cyclically-adjusted current account surplus came to about 0.5 percentage points of GDP; the overall external rebalancing of the Italian economy has largely been of a non-cyclical nature, with a positive contribution from the decline in the prices of energy commodities. By applying our methodology to the other major euro-area countries, we find that current account imbalances over the recent period are amplified when assessed in cyclically-adjusted terms.
F40|Agricultural Commodity Price Shocks and Their Effect on Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa|Commodity price shocks are an important type of external shock and are often cited as a problem for economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper quantifies the impact of agricultural commodity price shocks using a near vector autoregressive model. The novel aspect of this model is that we define an auxiliary variable that can potentially capture the definition of a price shock that allows us to determine whether the response of per capita Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in sub-Saharan Africa to these price shocks is asymmetric. We find that there is evidence of such asymmetric responses to commodity price shocks.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F40|Deconstructing the Gains from Trade: Selection of Industries vs Reallocation of Workers|In a Ricardian model with CES preferences and general distributions of industry efficiencies, the sources of the welfare gains from trade can be precisely decomposed into a selection and a reallocation effect. The former is the change in average efficiency due to the selection of industries that survive international competition. The latter is the rise in the weight of exporting industries in domestic production, due the reallocation of workers away from less-efficient non-exporting industries. This decomposition, which is hard to calculate in the general case, simplifies dramatically if industry efficiencies are Fréchet distributed, providing easy-to-quantify model-based measures of these two effects. Under this assumption, we also show that when the gains from trade are small, it is the selection effect that matters most; as the gains from trade rise and the size of the export sector grows, so does the importance of the reallocation effect.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F40|Characteristics Of The Romanian Cif Imports During The Period 01.01.-31.12.2015|The aim of this paper is to analyze the Romanian CIF imports during the period 01.01.-31.12.2015. My research goal is to identify the most important section of CIF imports during the analyzed period and the main structural modifications in evolution of the Romanian imports. The expected results are to know the most important import section of the Combined Nomenclature, the structural modification in evolution of these industries and the most important partner countries.

F40|L’internationalisation du renminbi : enjeux et limites des réformes institutionnelles|The internationalization of the Renminbi (RMB) has been drawing attention from both political scientists and economists, since the end of 2000s. Available data indicate a strong growth of RMB usage at the international level. This article has two main objectives. First, it aims to describe the qualitative evolutions of the Chinese currency by analysing the changes in the institutional framework of RMB. The second section deals with the ambitions of and obstacles to the Chinese strategy of internationalisation of its currency. For these purposes, this article focuses on the rich literature on this topic. Given that China?s monetary upheaval involves a conflicting process both at the domestic and international levels, it generates tensions with other rival powers, first and foremost the United States. This article examines the willingness and ability of China to overcome hurdles to achieve further the internationalisation of its currency. Classification JEL: E42, F31, F33, F40, F55.
F40|Asymmetric Trade Liberalizations and Current Account Dynamics|In this paper, I show a strong positive correlation between the value-added share of manufacturing in 2000 and current account balances in 2007 for the Euro area countries. I propose asymmetries in the timing of trade liberalizations as a new mechanism affecting the dynamics of the current account. I build intuition using a simple model. Then, I use an international business cycle model to show how the asymmetric dynamics of trade costs in manufacturing and services in 2000-2007 can partially explain the rise in the German surplus. Lastly, I provide broad empirical support for the key predictions of the theory.
F40|Did Chinese Outward Activity Attenuate or Aggravate the Great Recession in Developing Countries?|Using data on Chinese large-scale overseas investment and project contracts by sector, we analyze whether Chinese outward activity (COA) before the crisis worsened or alleviated the contractionary phases in developing countries. We find that, on average, COA did not increase vulnerability to the global recession. However, both the sectoral targeting and the size of the pre-crisis engagement matter: While COA in clearly to financial markets tied sectors implied an aggravation, substantial precrisis investment in the energy, metals and transportation industries implied an attenuation of the slump.
F40|Competitive Devaluations in Commodity-Based Economies: Colombia and the Pacific Alliance Group|This paper investigates whether there is an S-Curve in Colombia using bilateral and disaggregated quarterly data for the period 1991-2014. More precisely, the short-run effects of a depreciation on the TB are analysed in 27 industries covered by the PAG Free Trade Agreement. The S-Curve found in sectors representing 30% of total industrial production suggests that in these cases competitive devaluations have a positive effect on the TB in the short run. However, the regression analysis using both OLS and FE methods shows that sizable ones are needed to produce the desired effects on trade flows. Our findings have important policy implications: since only large competitive devaluations can restore TB equilibrium, industrial restructuring would appear to be a more sensible strategy, though this cannot be achieved in the short run and is instead a medium/long-term goal.
F40|Liquidity and the International Allocation of Economic Activity|This paper introduces a framework to study the linkages between the financial market for liquid assets and the international allocation of economic activity. Private assets’ liquidity properties -their usefulness as collateral or media of exchange in financial transactions – affect assets’ values and interest rates, with consequences on firm entry, production, aggregate productivity, and total market capitalization. In a closed economy, the liquidity market increases the size and productivity of the sector of the economy that generates liquid assets. In an open economy, however, cross-country differences in financial development - as measured by the degree of liquidity of a country’s assets - generate an allocation of real economic activity that favors the country that supplies the most liquid assets. In such a setting, trade liberalization magnifies the gap in economic activity between the countries.
F40|International Reserves, External Debt Maturity, and the Reinforcement Effect for Financial Stability|This paper studies how the maturity structure of external debt is affected by international reserves and how they reinforce financial stability through a more crisis-resilient maturity structure. We show in an illustrative theoretical model that reserves lengthen the maturity of external debt via a flattening of the yield curve. Using data of 66 emerging and developing countries and applying different econometric approaches, we find robust evidence that reserves increase the share of long-term (LT) relative to short-term (ST) external debt. Results hold for private and public external debt individually. Taking reserves and their effect on the debt maturity structure together, they reinforce financial stability.
F40|Efectos macroeconómicos de la integración económica de México al TLCAN|El objetivo del trabajo es analizar los efectos macroeconómicos de la incorporación de México al Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte (TLCAN). Se revisan las posiciones teóricas respecto a la integración y, de acuerdo con la evidencia empírica de los indicadores macroeconómicos seleccionados, se muestran las condiciones subyacentes, antes y después, de la incorporación de la economía mexicana al TLCAN, cuyos efectos muestran resultados ambivalentes. Se concluye que, dado la ambivalencia presentada, los mecanismos e instrumentos de la integración si bien son eficaces para crear y mantener procesos de crecimiento económico sostenidos y generar requisitos mínimos de fortalecimiento competitivo de las industrias nacionales y de complementariedad de la inversión extranjera directa, sus efectos sobre el bienestar quedan limitados por el acompañamiento de la política económica implementada.
F40|On The Role Of Exports For Economic Growth At A Global Level Through A Lmm Approach|At a theoretical level, exports benefit a country’seconomy through contributing to aggregate demand and through positive externalities such as knowledge spillovers and economies of scale. In this research, we take a global approach and investigate the impact of a country’s exports importance at a macroeconomic level for its economic growth through the Linear mixed-effects method(LMM). We include 186 countries in our analysis and find that generally there is statistically significant evidence that the level of aggregate exports affects economic growth, but this relationship is both time and country specific. Thus, although countries that employ policies to encourage exports experience higher economic growth, on average, this positive relationship is stronger in some countries than in others, and even absent or negative in some instances. For a more thorough analysis, we also identify the group of developed G7 countries and that of developing CEE economies and estimate the relationship in comparative perspective. Results confirm that the positive impact of exports on growth is generally higher for CEE countries, for which exports seem to be the main factor to exert a positive influence on growth as opposed to the developed G7 economies, which seem to depend more on investments for growth.
F40|The post-crisis slump in the Euro Area and the US: Evidence from an estimated three-region DSGE model|The global financial crisis (2008–09) led to a sharp contraction in both Euro Area (EA) and US real activity, and was followed by a long-lasting slump. However, the post-crisis adjustment in the EA and the US shows striking differences—in particular, the EA slump has been markedly more protracted. We estimate a three-region (EA, US and Rest of World) New Keynesian DSGE model (using quarterly data for 1999–2014) to quantify the drivers of the divergent EA and US adjustment paths. Our results suggest that financial shocks were key drivers of the 2008–09 Great Recession, for both the EA and the US. The post-2009 slump in the EA mainly reflects a combination of adverse aggregate demand and supply shocks, in particular lower productivity growth, and persistent adverse shocks to capital investment, linked to the continuing poor health of the EA financial system. Adverse financial shocks were less persistent for the US. The financial shocks identified by the model are consistent with observed performance indicators of the EA and US banking systems.
F40|Measuring openness to trade|In this paper we derive a new measure of openness—trade potential index—that quantifies the potential gains from trade as a simple function of data. Using a standard multicountry trade model, we measure openness by a country׳s potential welfare gain from moving to a world with frictionless trade. In this model, a country׳s trade potential depends on only the trade elasticity and two observable statistics: the country׳s home trade share and its income level. Quantitatively, poor countries have greater potential gains from trade relative to rich countries, while their welfare costs of autarky are similar. This leads us to infer that rich countries are more open to trade. Our trade potential index correlates strongly with estimates of trade costs, while both the welfare cost of autarky and the volume of trade correlate weakly with trade costs. Thus, our measure of openness is informative about the underlying trade frictions.

F40|Revisiting the role of inflation environment in exchange rate pass-through: A panel threshold approach|This paper sheds new light on the role of inflation regimes in explaining the extent of exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) into import prices. In order to classify the 24 developing countries included in his study, Barhoumi (2006) chose an arbitrary threshold of 10% to split the sample between high and low inflation regimes. For more accuracy, our study uses a panel threshold framework where a grid search is used to select the appropriate threshold value. In a larger panel-data set including 63 countries over the 1992–2012 period, we find that there are two threshold points identified by the data, allowing us to split our sample into three inflation regimes. When estimating the ERPT for each group of countries, we point out a strong regime-dependence of pass-through to inflation environment, that is, the class of countries with higher inflation rates experiences the higher degree of ERPT.
F40|Modelling the long-run economic impact of leaving the European Union|We model the long-term implications of leaving the EU for the UK economy using NiGEM, the National Institute's large scale structural global econometric model. We examine a scenario in which the UK has no free trade agreement with the EU, focusing on four key shocks: a permanent reduction in the size of the UK's export market share in EU member countries, an increase in tariffs, a permanent reduction in inward FDI flows and the repatriation of the UK's projected net contributions to the EU budget. We calibrate the size of the shocks on a synthesis of the academic evidence. We explain how each of these four shocks is implemented in NiGEM, as well as examining the key mechanisms by which they are propagated through the model. The export market share channel is the main mechanism by which leaving the EU leads to declines in GDP and consumption relative to the long-run baseline, accounting for a long-run decline in GDP of 2.1% relative to the baseline value, out of a total projected reduction in GDP relative to the baseline of 2.7%.
F40|Sticky prices and deviations from the Law of One Price: Evidence from Mexican micro-price data|This paper uses a novel dataset of weekly sampled store-level prices to study the impact of sticky prices on the volatility and persistence of intranational deviations from the Law of One Price (LOP). The volatility of LOP deviations is found to be increasing both on the distance separating two locations and on the degree of price stickiness. Sticky prices are also found to be systematically related to the persistence of LOP deviations: Half-lives of LOP deviations are systematically larger for goods with stickier prices. These observations are shown to accord well with the predictions of a dynamic general equilibrium model featuring real market segmentation and Calvo pricing. I also find evidence of remarkably fast convergence to the LOP (average half-lives of LOP deviations are in the order of 3–6weeks) and show that previously reported convergence estimates may be afflicted by a positive temporal aggregation bias.
F40|Credit booms, banking crises, and the current account|A number of papers have shown that rapid growth in private sector credit is a strong predictor of a banking crisis. This paper will ask if credit growth is itself the cause of a crisis, or is it the combination of credit growth and external deficits? This paper estimates a probabilistic model to find the marginal effect of private sector credit growth on the probability of a banking crisis. The model contains an interaction term between credit growth and the level of the current account, so the marginal effect of private sector credit growth may itself be a function of the level of the current account. We find that the marginal effect of rising private sector debt levels depends on an economy's external position. When the current account is in balance, the marginal effect of an increase in debt is rather small. However, when the economy is running a sizable current account deficit, implying that any increase in the debt ratio is financed through foreign borrowing, this marginal effect is large.
F40|Sovereign debt and reserves with liquidity and productivity crises|During the recent financial crisis, emerging economies have kept accumulating both sovereign reserves and debt. To account for this empirical fact, we model the optimal portfolio choice of a sovereign that is subject to liquidity and productivity shocks. We determine the equilibrium level of debt and its cost by solving a contracting game between sovereign and international lenders. Although raising debt increases the sovereign exposure to liquidity and productivity crises, the simultaneous accumulation of reserves can mitigate the negative effects of such crises. This mechanism rationalizes the complementarity between debt and reserves.
F40|Effects of exchange rate variations on bilateral trade with a vehicle currency: Evidence from China and Singapore|Using a testable gravity-type bilateral trade model derived from an underlying demand and supply model, this paper explores the effects of exchange rate variations on bilateral trade in an exchange rate regime with a vehicle currency. The introduction of the vehicle currency allows us to figure out whether variations in the trade volume due to the fluctuation of the bilateral exchange rate are primarily due to changes in demand or in supply, or both. More specifically, in this theoretical framework, the appreciation of one country's currency against the vehicle currency is expected to promote its imports, but the effect of revaluation of the country's currency against the vehicle currency on its exports is ambiguous. Moreover, high volatility of the exchange rate of one country's currency against the vehicle currency is also expected to depress its import volume. From the empirical point of view, the decomposition of the bilateral exchange rate of two currencies into the bilateral rates of these two currencies against the vehicle currency provides a new alternative to avoid the econometric problem of potential reverse causality in assessing the effects. Through compiling a novel monthly bilateral-trade dataset between China and Singapore over 21 years or 252 months, we empirically test the predictions of our model, which get robust support from the results.
F40|How time preferences differ: Evidence from 53 countries|We present results from the first large-scale international survey on time preference, conducted in 53 countries. All countries exhibit hyperbolic discounting patterns, i.e., the immediate future is discounted more than far future. We also observe higher heterogeneity for shorter time horizons, consistent with the pattern reviewed by Frederick, Loewenstein, and O’Donoghue (2002). Cultural factors as captured by the Hofstede cultural dimensions (Hofstede, 1991) contribute significantly to the variation of time discounting, even after controlling for economic factors, such as GDP, inflation rate and growth rate. In particular, higher levels of Uncertainty Avoidance are associated with stronger hyperbolic discounting, whereas higher degrees of Individualism and Long Term Orientation predict stronger tendency to wait for larger payoffs. We also find the waiting tendency is correlated with innovation, environmental protection, crediting rating, and body mass index at country level after controlling for county wealth. These results help us to enhance the understanding of differences across financial markets and economic behavior worldwide.
F40|Financial openness, the financial accelerator and sectoral dynamics|This paper studies the role of financial openness and the financial accelerator in the sectoral dynamics generated in a small open economy following capital inflow. The results show that where the financial accelerator exists, capital inflow in response to a foreign interest rate shock ultimately results in intersectoral resource transfer that is favorable to the nontradable sector under different monetary policies; the magnitude of the expansion in the nontradable sector being greater under a higher degree of financial openness. The study also finds that, in comparison to CPI inflation targeting, nontradable inflation targeting is better at mitigating resource transfers toward production of nontradables, and at reducing and stabilizing both nontradable inflation and CPI inflation. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the financial accelerator mechanism matters for the effectiveness of monetary policy in addressing dynamics pertinent to the Dutch disease phenomenon, such that CPI inflation targeting is only effective in such a scenario where the financial accelerator is non-existent, and that nontradable inflation targeting operates more effectively in the absence of the financial accelerator as well.
F40|Holes in the Dike: the global savings glut, U.S. house prices and the long shadow of banking deregulation|We explore empirically how capital inflows into the US and financial deregulation within the United States interacted in driving the run-up (and subsequent decline) in US housing prices over the period 1990-2010. To obtain an ex ante measure of financial liberalization, we focus on the history of interstate-banking deregulation during the 1980s, i.e. prior to the large net capital inflows into the US from China and other emerging economies. Our re- sults suggest a long shadow of deregulation: in states that opened their banking markets to out-of-state banks earlier, house prices were more sensitive to capital inflows. We provide evidence that global imbalances were a major positive funding shock for US wide banks: different from local banks, these banks held a geographically diversified portfolio of mort- gages which allowed them to tap the global demand for safe assets by issuing private-label safe assets backed by the country-wide US housing market. This, in turn, allowed them to expand mortgage lending and lower interest rates, driving up housing prices.
F40|A provincial view of global imbalances: regional capital flows in China|Abstract We model capital flows among Chinese provinces. A version of the present value model of the current account (PVMCA) with non-tradable goods and a savings wedge accounts for around 80% of the variation in inter-provincial capital flows over the 1986–2010 period. The PVMCA also allows us to identify the channels of external adjustment in capital flows at the province-level: variation in intertemporal prices (domestic and international interest rates, the provincial real exchange rate) and intertemporal variation in quantities (output, investment and government spending). We find that cross-province variation in the importance of these channels is correlated with the importance of private and state-owned enterprises and demographic factors. We discuss implications of our results for global imbalances in capital flows.
F40|Financialisation and the financial and economic crises: theoretical framework and empirical analysis for 15 countries|This chapter analyses the long-run effects of financialisation and of the recent financial and economic crises for 15 countries. In order to provide a theoretical framework, we first outline three types of regimes under the conditions of financialisation, namely a debt-led private demand boom, an export-led mercantilist, and a domestic demand-led regime. We then take a look at the sectoral financial balances of the main macroeconomic sectors and at the growth contributions of the demand aggregates for each of the 15 countries, focusing in particular on the trade cycle before the crises. This enables us to cluster these countries according to the typology of regimes and describe the development dynamics among various groups, which were complementary and often mutually reinforcing, in the years leading up to the crises. Subsequently, we focus on the period following the outbreak of the crises and, by considering transmission mechanisms and main obstacles to recovery, analyse how countries in each of these clusters were affected. Finally, we focus on the regime shifts that have taken place in the course of the crises and we discuss the implications of these recent developments for the world economy.
F40|Aging, international capital flows and long run convergence|This paper analyses how the economic, demographic and institutional differences between two regions -one developed and called the North, the other emerging and called the South- drive the international capital flows and explain the world economic equilibrium. To this end, we develop a simple two-period OLG model. We compare closed-economy and open-economy equilibria. We consider that openness facilitates convergence of South’s characteristics towards North’s. We examine successively the consequences of a technological catching-up, a demographic transitionand an institutional convergence of pension schemes. We determine the analytical solution of the dynamics of the world interest rate and deduce the evolution of the current accounts. These analytical results are completed by numerical simulations. They show that the technological catching-up alone leads to a welfare loss for the North in reason of capital flows towards the South. If we add to this Örst change a demographic transition, the capital demand is reduced in the South whereas its saving increases in reason of a higher life expectancy. These two effects contribute to reduce the capital flows from the North to the South. Finally, an institutional convergence of the two pension schemes reduces the South’s saving rate which increases the capital flow from the North to the South.
F40|Financialisation, debt and inequality: Scenarios based on a stock flow consistent model|In the era of financialisation, increasing income inequality could be observed in most developed and many developing countries. Despite these similar developments in inequality, the growth performance and drivers for growth differed markedly among countries, allowing clusters of different growth regimes to be identified. Among them two extreme types: the debt-led private-demand boom type and the export-led mercantilist type. Whereas the former relies mainly on creditfinanced household consumption in order to compensate for the potential lack of demand (associated with the depressing effect of financialisation), the latter relies on net exports as the main driver of aggregate demand. After a short review of the different channels through which financialisation is expected to affect a countries development, a theoretical discussion on the conditions that tend to support the occurrence of either of the two regimes will build the base for the following model exercise. With the help of a stock-flow consistent model it will be demonstrated then how increasing inequality, depending on a countries institutional structure and regulatory framework, affects growth differently, explaining the occurrence of both regime types. Based on the insights of the theoretical discussion and the model results, a foresight exercise will be performed examining how further increase in inequality might affect development of economies around the world but particularly of the Euro area.
F40|Economic fundamentals and monetary policy autonomy|During a time of rising world interest rates, the central bank of a small open economy may be motivated to increase its own interest rate to keep from suffering a destabilizing outflow of capital and depreciation in the exchange rate. This is especially true for a small open economy with a current account deficit, which relies on foreign capital inflows to finance this deficit. This paper will investigate the underlying structural characteristics that would lead an economy with a floating exchange rate to adjust their interest rate in line with the foreign interest rate, and thus adopt a de facto exchange rate ”peg”. Using a panel data regression similar to that in Shambaugh (QJE 2004) and most recently in Klein and Shambaugh (AEJ Macro 2015), this paper shows that the method of current account financing has a large effect on whether or not the central bank will opt for exchange rate and capital flow stabilization during a time of rising world interest rates. A current account deficit financed mainly through reserve depletion or the accumulation of private sector debt will cause the central bank to pursue de facto exchange rate stabilization, whereas a current account deficit financed through equity or FDI will not. Quantitatively, reserve depletion of about 7% of GDP will motivate the central bank with a floating currency to adjust its interest rate in line with the foreign interest rate to where it appears that the central bank has an exchange rate peg.
F40|Breaking down world trade elasticities: a panel ECM approach|This paper exhaustively analyses the recent decline of international trade elasticities to output growth. We extend an empirical model of import demand functions to account not only for transitory factors, such as relative prices and import intensity-adjusted measures of demand (I-O Tables), but also for habitually neglected permanent factors such as protectionism, vertical integration (i.e. Global Value Chains) and foreign direct investment (FDI). Dealing with a non-stationary heteregenous panel of 27 countries, we estimate a panel Error Correction Model from 1960 to 2015 in order to break down world trade elasticities. Our main fi ndings evidence: i) the presence of panel (cointegrating) structural changes in the trade-to-GDP relationship in 2000 and 2009, private consumption being a source of disruption; ii) although investment and exports are the most sensitive, import-intensive components of demand, this is far from being transitory, which is clearly weighing on the current slowdown; iii) the relevant contribution of GVCs shows a procyclical pattern, questioning the permanent nature of the current levelling-off of vertical integration processes. The lack of progress in reducing import tariffs and the usual discarded, complementary relationship between FDI and imports have a residual role. All in all, our results have substantial policy implications, as they reinforce the idea of a historical break towards a new ‘normal’ trading phase.
F40|Exposure to international crises: trade vs. financial contagion|I identify new patterns in countries’ economic performance over the 2007-2014 period based on proximity through distance, trade, and finance to the US subprime mortgage and Eurozone debt crisis areas. To understand the causes of the cross-country variation, I develop an open economy model with two transmission channels that can be shocked separately: international trade and finance. The model is the first to include a government and heterogeneous firms that can default independently of one another and has a novel endogenous cost of sovereign default. I calibrate the model to the average experiences of countries near to and far from the crisis areas. Using these calibrations, disturbances on the order of those observed during the late 2000s are separately applied to each channel to study transmission. The results suggest credit disruption as the primary contagion driver, rather than the trade channel. Given the substantial degree of financial contagion, I run a series of counterfactuals studying the efficacy of capital controls and find that they would be a useful tool for preventing similarly severe contagion in the future, so long as there is not capital immobility to the degree that the local sovereign can default without suffering capital flight.

F40|Do Oil Endowment and Productivity Matter for Accumulation of International Reserves?|We develop a dynamic stochastic optimization model with oil price shocks to show that countries with certain combinations of oil endowment and productivity have strong precautionary incentives to accumulate foreign reserves in response to oil price shocks. Using the Simulated Method of Moments to estimate the model we demonstrate how oil price shocks are absorbed by changes in foreign reserves which, in turn, leads to less variation in aggregate consumption. Along with productivity and oil endowment, we also consider as determinants of reserves holding conventional variables such as trade- to-GDP ratio and capital openness. Overall, our results suggest that productivity and oil endowment are potentially important determinants of foreign reserves that for some countries should be considered as complements to conventional determinants.
F40|Fewer but Better: Sudden Stops, Firm Entry, and Financial Selection|We combine the real business cycle small open economy framework with the endogenous growth literature to study the productivity cost of a sudden stop. In this economy, productivity growth is determined by successful implementation of business ideas, yet the quality of ideas is heterogeneous and good ideas are scarce. A representative financial intermediary screens and selects the most promising ideas, which gives rise to a trade-off between mass (quantity) and composition (quality) in the entrant cohort. Chilean plant-level data from the sudden stop triggered by the Russian sovereign default in 1998 confirms the main mechanism of the model, as firms born during the credit shortage are fewer, but better. A calibrated version of the economy shows the importance of accounting for heterogeneity and selection, as otherwise the permanent loss of output generated by the forgone entrants doubles, which increases the welfare cost by 30%.
F40|Efficient Bailouts?|We develop a quantitative equilibrium model of financial crises to assess the interaction between ex post interventions in credit markets and the buildup of risk ex ante. During a systemic crisis, bailouts relax balance sheet constraints and mitigate the severity of the recession. Ex ante, the anticipation of such bailouts leads to an increase in risk-taking, making the economy more vulnerable to a financial crisis. We find that moral hazard effects are limited if bailouts are systemic and broad-based. If bailouts are idiosyncratic and targeted, however, this makes the economy significantly more exposed to financial crises.

F40|Decomposition of Russia’s GDP growth rates, 2015–2016|Russia’s officials made multiple statements in 2015, saying Russia had hit the bottom of its recessionary valley. For example, a few top members of Russia’s government and representatives of the Russian business community (in particular, First Vice-Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov and Sberbank CEO/Chairman German Gref) said in May 2015 the current crisis in Russia had reached its peak and the economy was expected to see some recovery. In late 2015, Russia’s Minister of Economic Development Alexey Ulyukaev said the recession was over and the bottom was hit. At the same time, Russia’s Ministry of Economic Development (MED) and some other international organizations – such as Bank of America, JP Morgan, IMF and World Bank – upgraded (not for long though) their 2015 forecast for Russia. The Ministry of Economic Development made similar statements, in particular in July and October 2015. Andrei Klepach, Chief Economist of Vnesheconombank, questioned these statements, noting in late August that the bottom was still to be reached, and he expected Russia to continue facing a downturn in investment and construction sectors, while budget and consumer demand ceased to be the drivers of positive growth rates in economy. As early as December, Herman Gref predicted that Russia’s economy would face a downturn in 2016, and then it might “decay” unless across-the-board reforms are undertaken
F40|Russia’S Foreign Trade In October 2015|In 2015, the RF foreign economic activity was subject to a set of negative factors: signifi cant reduction of prices on all tradable commodities, contraction of external demand due to slowdown of the world economy, compression of domestic demand due to a fall of income and investment. Consequently, contraction of the Russian foreign trade turnover has turned out to be stronger in 2015 than during 2009 crisis.
F40|Russia’S Foreign Trade In November 2015|Deteriorating global market environment in November 2015 has determined further decline of major Russian foreign trade indicators. Growth of the Russian export volume failed to off set the fall of the global commodity prices. Various trade barriers introduced by foreign countries hamper Russia’s foreign economic activity.
F40|Russia’S Foreign Trade In December 2015|In December 2015, Russian foreign trade outlook was determined by a reduction of the world prices on commodities, mainly on oil, and correlated with it ruble’s depreciation. Import volume was shrinking by higher rates compared to export decline rates due to slowdown of economic growth and ruble’s devaluation as well as amid imposed international trade sanctions. As a result, in 2015 trade balance remained positive.

F40|Dynamics Of Production And Foreign Trade Of Russia|Export and import value indices were synchronous in their decline throughout the past year, 2015. The behavior of exports was naturally shaped by the plunge of prices of raw materials (even though their physical volume remained roughly the same), while the declining value of imports was caused by the shrinkage, by one quarter, of their physical volume and the slight decline of the average dollar prices of inward moving goods, including due to the US dollar’s rise against practically all world currencies. In January 2016, the shrinkage of imports and exports continued; more particularly, the plunge of exports was deeper, and the balance of trade hit its record low of the last few years – $ 8.5bn.
F40|The Way Flows Of Food Products Changed In The Wake Of Embargo|In 2015, export supplies of foodstuﬀ s to Russia from the countries subject to embargo decreased by 66% compared to 2013. However, the negative eﬀect on the economy of these countries was limited. Total export of foodstuﬀs in monetary terms fell barely by 7% and it was redirected to other countries. In the overall export pattern, the share of foodstuﬀs has even increased.
F40|Decomposition Of Gdp Growth Rates In 2016-2019: In Expectation Of Structural Changes|Calculations of decomposition of the RF GDP growth rates in 1999–2015 and the MED’s forecast for 2016–2019 show that in current conditions cyclical components related to the domestic business cycle’s entering the positive phase are the only source of economic growth. However, they alone are insufﬁcient to ensure growth rates of 4% or more. To achieve that, it is important to increase structural economic growth rates, too. In particular, with the aggregate factor productivity to be retained at the present level it is necessary to a ract to the economy further labor resources of about 4.5m people and Rb 40 trillion worth of additional investments in capital assets in 2016–2018.
F40|Trade Restrictions Hamper World Trade Growth|World trade growth rates have signiﬁ cantly slowed: in 2015, the volume of world trade went up by 2.8% and according to the WTO forecast will remain at the same level throughout 2016. As a result, the current year will be the ﬁ h year in a row when the trade turnover will increase by less than 3%. Furthermore, during the period from 1990 through 2008 the average indicator remained at the level of 5%.
F40|Внешняя Торговля|Внешнеэкономическая деятельность РФ в 2015 г. оказалась под воздействием комплекса негативных факторов: значительное снижение цен на все сырьевые товары, сокращение внешнего спроса в результате замедления роста мировой экономики, сокращение внутреннего спроса под влиянием снижения доходов населения и инвестиционной активности. В результате сокращение объема российского внешнеторгового оборота в 2015 г. оказалось более сильным, чем в кризисный 2009 г.
F40|Финансовые Рынки|Декабрь ознаменовался падением цен на нефть до минимумов 2008 г. Вслед за нефтью подешевел индекс ММВБ (-5,7%), а также почти все отраслевые индексы (кроме транспортной и химической отраслей) и почти все «голубые фишки» (кроме ВТБ). По сравнению с прошлым отчетным периодом среднедневной оборот биржи сократился на 7,8%, капитализация снизилась на 7,7%. Акции Норильского Никеля вытеснили ЛУКОЙЛ из тройки лидеров по дневному обороту. Продолжается отток средств из фондов, ориентированных на российские активы. Наблюдалось ухудше- ние конъюнктуры внутрироссийского рынка корпоративных облигаций ввиду внешнего неблагоприятного фона, что не привело к традиционному повышению сезонной деловой активности. Тем не менее умеренно позитивной динамикой отличались такие ключевые показатели рынка, как объем и индекс рынка корпоративных облигаций; на высоком уровне оставалась активность инвесторов и эмитентов. Основными негативными явлениями стали повышение (хотя и незначительное) средневзвешенной ставки доходности эмиссий и ухудшение ситуации с исполнением эмитентами своих обязательств перед держателями облигаций.
F40|Внешняя Торговля|Ухудшение конъюнктуры мирового рынка в ноябре 2015 г. обусловило продолжение падения основных показателей российской внешней торговли. Рост физических объемов российского экспорта не смог компенсировать падения мировых цен на сырьевые товары. Ведение внешнеэкономической деятельности в РФ осложняется наличием многочисленных торговых барьеров, введенных зарубежными странами.
F40|Внешняя Торговля|В декабре 2015 г. ситуация в российской внешней торговле определялась продолжившимся снижением мировых цен на сырьевые товары, главным образом на нефть, и связанным с ним ослаблением рубля. Стоимостный объем импорта сокращался более высокими по сравнению с объемами экспорта темпами под влиянием замедления экономического роста и произошедшего ослабления рубля, а также в условиях действия международных торговых санкций. В результате сальдо торгового баланса в 2015 г. осталось положительным.
F40|Финансовые Рынки|Цена на нефть марки Brent, достигнув минимума в 28,2 доллара за баррель в прошлом отчетном периоде (с 23 декабря 2015 по 26 января 2016 г.), в нынешнем (с 27 января по 25 февраля 2016) увеличилась более чем на 11%. Этот рост сопровождался увеличением индекса ММВБ (+5,8%), а также почти всех секторальных индексов. «Голубые фишки» также в основном продемонстрировали положительную динамику. Акции Сбербанка стали лидером по доходности среди высоколиквидных бумаг, а их доля в общем обороте биржи превысила одну треть. Продолжается отток средств из фондов, ориентированных на российский рынок. С начала года он составил уже 336,3 млн долл. Classification-JEL:G1, G3, G15
F40|Начало Функционирования Зоны Свободной Торговли Евразийского Экономического Союза И Социалистической Республики Вьетнам|С 5 октября 2016 г. начнет действовать Соглашение о свободной торговле между Евразийским экономическим союзом и Социалистической Республикой Вьетнам. Документ, предполагающий упрощение доступа на свои рынки в рамках взаимной торговли стран-участниц, позволит значительно увеличить их товарооборот. Ценность этого Соглашения состоит также в отработке переговорных практик и механизмов реализации подобных соглашений для ЕАЭС.
F40|Особенности Российского Экспорта И Импорта В Январеавгусте 2016 Года|В отличие от импорта, динамика которого демонстрирует признаки стабилизации (в июне-августе 103,2% от аналогичных показателей 2015 г.), экспорт продолжает падение (в июне-августе 85,2% от аналогичных показателей 2015 г.). Динамика экспорта в летние месяцы 2016 г. объяснялась рядом факторов: для сырьевых товаров – снижением мировых цен (относительно лета 2015 г.) при достаточно стабильных объемах производства и экспортных поставок; для товаров средней степени переработки – снижением мировых цен относительно 2015 г., которое частично компенсировалось ростом физических объемов экспорта; для машин и оборудования – закрытием отдельных рынков сбыта (в частности, продолжающимся сжатием украинского рынка для российских поставщиков), сильным сокращением спроса со стороны стран СНГ (Казахстан, Азербайджан, Белоруссия).
F40|Отмена Таможенных Льгот В Оэз Калининградской Области|1 апреля 2016 г. заканчивается переходный период для ряда предприятий, пользующихся таможенными льготами при вывозе товаров, изготовленных на территории ОЭЗ в Калининградской области на остальную территорию Евразийского экономического союза (ЕАЭС).
F40|Динамика Производства И Внешней Торговли России|Стоимостные объемы экспорта и импорта синхронно снижались в течение прошедшего 2015 г. Динамика экспорта была естественным образом обусловлена снижением цен на сырье при примерном сохранении физических объемов, а снижение стоимостных объемов импорта было обусловлено снижением на четверть физических объемов и небольшим снижением средних долларовых цен поставок ввозимой продукции, в том числе за счет укрепления доллара практически ко всем мировым валютам. В январе 2016 г. падение импорта и экспорта продолжилось, при этом спад экспорта оказался более значимым, а сальдо торговли достигло минимального значения за последние годы - 8,5 млрд долл.
