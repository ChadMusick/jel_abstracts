K37|The Effect of Initial Placement Restrictions on Refugees' Language Acquisition in Germany|This paper analyzes the effect of a recently introduced policy reform on participation in integration courses and on certiﬁed language proﬁciency levels among refugees in Germany. The residence rule restricts initial residence for refugees with a permanent residence permit. Given that treatment intensity varies distinctly across states, I utilize this quasi-experiment and apply a difference-in-differences approach. Using an innovative data-set, the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees, I ﬁnd that stricter statutory provisions have a positive effect on the probability to complete a language course and on the level of certiﬁed language proﬁciency. The results indicate that this effect is driven partly by spatial mismatch.
K37|Equal treatment for highly qualified labour migrants|According to EU-law, third country national labour migrants shall be treated equally to local workers with regard to wages. The aim of this working paper is to clarify whether Swedish law meets this demand with regard to highly qualified labour migrants. The analysis reveals that the combined effect of entry conditions and the content of the collective agreements applicable in the sectors where highly qualified labour migrants work makes it difficult to safeguard that they are treated equally with comparable national workers. The study also demonstrates that Swedish law does not provide highly qualified labour migrants with any robust means to enforce equal treatment. Hence, it is not likely that Swedish law complies with EU law, at least not for those workers employed by an entity in Sweden. For labour migrants intra-corporate transferred or posted to Sweden in other ways the EU law demands are less clear.
K37|The Refugee Crisis and the Reinvigoration of the Nation State: Does the European Union Have a Common Asylum Policy?|The European Union officially proclaims to have a common asylum policy. However, the common treaties leave a great deal of discretion to the individual member countries, which allow them to regulate refugee migration while still upholding international treaties. Member countries have authority over border controls, the processing of asylum applications as well as economic benefits provided to refugees. We show that the differences in refugee flows are so extensive and systematic that the existence of a common EU asylum policy is debatable. The commitments made by the member countries are largely voluntary, and asylum policy is mainly determined at the national level. The discrepancies between the member countries strongly signal that the European Union may not be an optimal region for a common asylum policy. An asylum policy should instead be determined at the national level concordant with the regional and local level, where integration measures are implemented in practice. Meanwhile, the European Union can play an important role through refugee aid to afflicted countries, treaties with third countries, rescue actions in the Mediterranean and control of the external EU borders.
K37|Immigrants' Deportations, Local Crime and Police Effectiveness|This paper analyzes the impact of immigrant deportations on local crime and police efficiency. Our identification relies on increases in the deportation rate driven by the introduction of the Secure Communities (SC) program, an immigration enforcement program based on local-federal cooperation which was rolled out across counties between 2008 and 2013. We instrument for the deportation rate by interacting the introduction of SC with the local presence of likely undocumented in 2005, prior to the introduction of SC. We document a surge in local deportation rates under SC, and we show that deportations increased the most in counties with a large undocumented population. We find that SC-driven increases in deportation rates did not reduce crime rates for violent offenses or property offenses. Our estimates are small and precise, so we can rule out meaningful effects. We do not find evidence that SC increased either police effectiveness in solving crimes or local police resources. Finally, we do not find effects of deportations on the local employment of unskilled citizens or on local firm creation.
K37|The Political Economy of Immigration Enforcement: Conflict and Cooperation under Federalism|We study how the shared responsibilities over immigration enforcement by local and federal levels in the US shape immigration enforcement outcomes, using detailed data on the Secure Communities program (2008-2014). Tracking the movement of arrested unlawfully present immigrants along the several steps of the immigration enforcement pipeline, and exploiting a large shift in federal enforcement priorities in mid 2011, we disentangle the three key components of the variation in deportation rates: federal enforcement efforts, local enforcement efforts, and the composition of the pool of arrestees. This decomposition allows us to recover the local (county) level response to changes in federal enforcement intensity. Among urban counties, 80 percent, mostly Democratic but with small shares of Hispanics, exhibit strategic substitutabilities. The inverse relationship between federal and local efforts allowed most counties to reduce opposition to the policy, and was accompanied by an increased alignment of local and federal preferences. The federal level was very effective in directing its enforcement efforts towards counties where it expected local collaboration, but conflict was mostly driven by a change in the types of unlawfully present immigrants it prioritized for removal.
K37|Immigrant Naturalisation, Employment and Occupational Status in Western Europe|Does citizenship facilitate access to employment and higher status jobs? Existing case studies have produced mixed results across mostly single case studies in Europe and North America. To investigate whether this heterogeneity depends on varying institutional and socio-economic conditions, in this paper we analyse the labour market outcomes of immigrants who have naturalised in 13 West European countries. Our empirical analysis draws on data from the 2014 European Labour Force Survey Ad Hoc Module on immigrants. In order to cope with the selective nature of the naturalisation process, we employ a bivariate probit model that accounts for unobserved characteristics of naturalising immigrants. Our main results show a positive relationship across these destination countries between citizenship and the probability of employment for both immigrant men and women, as well as between citizenship and occupational status for men. Liberalising the access to citizenship does not diminish the positive returns on employment from naturalisation. For immigrant men there is evidence of a trade-off between easier access to citizenship and the returns on occupational status.
K37|Social Integration of Immigrants and the Attitude of the Native Population in European Countries|In this paper, I focus on the relationships between the attitude of the native population towards immigrants and immigration (ATII) in 20 European countries and the level of social integration and perceived discrimination of first and second generation immigrants in those countries. The stringency of naturalization policies in the host countries is also taken into consideration as a mechanism of the development of these relationships. The results confirm that a country’s naturalization policies fairly represent most ATII indicators, and that immigrants feel less discriminated against in more welcoming societies. However, no systematic relationship was revealed between the attitude of the native population and the social integration of immigrants. On the other hand, the results suggest lower perceived discrimination and higher social integration of first generation immigrants in countries where the naturalization status of immigrants is more secured, and the possibility of dual nationality is more restricted. The results also show that the perceived discrimination of immigrants does not decline with the duration of residence in the host countries, but the latter revealed a positive relationship with the social integration of immigrants.
K37|More Opportunity, More Cooperation? The Behavioral Effects of Birthright Citizenship on Immigrant Youth|Inequality of opportunity, particularly when overlaid with racial, ethnic, or cultural differences, increases the social distance between individuals, which is widely believed to limit the scope of cooperation. A central question, then, is how to bridge such divides. We study the effects of a major citizenship reform in Germany — the introduction of birthright citizenship on January 1, 2000 — in terms of inter-group cooperation and social segregation between immigrant and native youth. We hypothesize that endowing immigrant children with citizenship rights levels the playing field between them and their native peers, with possible spill-overs into the domain of social interactions. Our unique setup connects a large-scale lab-in-the-field experiment based on the investment game with the citizenship reform by exploiting the quasi-random assignment of citizenship rights around its cut-off date. Immigrant youth born prior to the reform display high levels of cooperation toward other immigrants, but low levels of cooperation toward natives. The introduction of birthright citizenship caused male, but not female, immigrants to significantly increase their cooperativeness toward natives. This effect is accompanied by a near-closure of the educational achievement gap between young immigrant men and their native peers.
K37|Impeding or Accelerating Assimilation? Immigration Enforcement and Its Impact on Naturalization Patterns|Naturalization bestows economic benefits to immigrants, their families and communities through greater access to employment opportunities, higher earnings, and homeownership. It is the cornerstone of immigrant assimilation in the United States. Yet, less than 800,000 of the estimated 8.8 million legal permanent residents eligible to naturalize do so on a yearly basis. Using data from the 2008-2016 American Community Survey, we analyze how the expansion of interior U.S. immigration enforcement affects naturalization patterns. We find that the intensification of interior enforcement increases migrantsâ€™ propensity to naturalize and accelerates their naturalization, possibly in response to increased uncertainty about future immigration policy. Yet, the impacts are highly heterogeneous. For eligible-to-naturalize immigrants living in mixed-status householdsâ€”households with at least one unauthorized member, we find the opposite effects. Intensified enforcement makes them less likely to naturalize or to delay their status adjustment, possibly to avoid any contact with immigration officials. Understanding how immigration policy influences naturalization decisions is important given the benefits to naturalization and the potential to counter the adverse impacts of tougher enforcement on the 16 million individuals, many of them U.S. citizens, residing in mixed-status households.
K37|Should I Stay or Must I Go? Temporary Protection and Refugee Outcomes|We study a Danish reform in 2002 that lowered the ex ante probability of refugees receiving permanent residency by prolonging the time period before they were eligible to apply for permanent residency. Assignment to the new rules was completely determined by the date of the asylum application and the reform was implemented retroactively. We formulate a simple search and matching model to derive predictions that can be tested using our data. Then we study the effects on educational and labor market outcomes and find that the reform significantly increased enrollment in formal education, especially for females and low skilled individuals. In terms of employment and earnings, coefficients are in general negative but non-significant. Other outcomes of interest are also studied. The reform had a negative impact on criminal activity driven by a reduction among males. There are no effects on health outcomes and significant but relatively small negative effects on childbearing for females. The results do not seem to be driven by selection, since the reform had no significant effect on the share that stayed in Denmark in the long run.
K37|Spillover Effects of Stricter Immigration Policies|We evaluate the importance of spillover effects of national migration policies by estimating the effect of stricter rules on family reunification in Denmark in 2002 on migration to neighboring countries. We reach two main conclusions. First, we show that stricter rules for reunification lead to a clear and significant increase in emigration of Danish citizens with immigrant background. Most of the emigrants left Denmark for Sweden, a neighboring country in which reunification was possible. Second, we demonstrate that a significant fraction of the individuals that came to Sweden to reunite with a partner left the country again; within two (eight) years around 20% (50%) had left, with the absolute majority leaving for Denmark. Our results indicate that potential spillover effects from national migration policies should be taken into account when forming migration policy.

The Behavioral Effects of Birthright Citizenship on Immigrant Youth|Inequality of opportunity, particularly when overlaid with racial, ethnic, or cultural differences, increases the social distance between individuals, which is widely believed to limit the scope of cooperation.

K37|The Labor Market Effects of Immigration Enforcement|This paper examines the effects of reducing the supply of low-skilled immigrant workers on the labor market outcomes of domestic workers. We use temporal and geographic variation in the introduction of Secure Communities (SC), a county-based immigration enforcement policy, combined with data over 2005-2014 from the American Community Survey to estimate a difference-in-difference model with geographic and time fixed effects. We find evidence that SC had a negative impact on the employment of low-skilled non-citizen workers, who are likely to be directly affected by the policy. Importantly, we also find that SC negatively impacted the employment of citizens working in middle to high-skill occupations. This is the first paper to provide quasi-experimental evidence on the labor market effects of immigration enforcement policies on citizens across the occupational skill distribution, which is of paramount importance given the current immigration policy debates.
K37|The Effect of Increasing Immigration Enforcement on the Labor Supply of High-Skilled Citizen Women|Recent decades have seen a surge in local interior immigration enforcement. In this paper we examine a little discussed, but potentially important, spillover effect of enforcement policies: changes in high-skilled citizen women's labor supply due to changes in the cost of outsourcing household production. Undocumented immigrants disproportionately supply household services - e.g. as maids, cooks, child care workers, and gardeners - so the price of outsourcing these services is expected to rise in response to enforcement. Combining data on the timing and location of these enforcement policies, with data on labor supply from the American Community Survey over 2005-2012, we implement a difference-in-difference approach with location and year fixed effects to take advantage of the staggered implementation of these policies. We find that an increase in intensity of immigration enforcement in a local area reduced the labor supply of citizen college- educated women with children. Several results suggest that changes in the price of outsourcing are driving these results: 1) we see an increase in time spent on household production tasks among mothers in the American Time Use Survey, 2) we confirm that there is an increase in the wages of household workers, and 3) we see no similar effects for high-skilled men or women without children. This indicates there are important unintended consequences of enforcement policies on high-skilled citizen mothers' ability to work.
K37|Labor Market Impacts of States Issuing of Driving Licenses to Undocumented Immigrants|Twelve U.S. states, plus the District of Columbia, have recently enacted measures granting undocumented immigrants access to driving licenses. We exploit the state and temporal variation in the issuing of state driving licenses to undocumented immigrants to estimate its impact on these population's employment outcomes. Using 2013 through 2017 data from the monthly Current Population Survey and its Outgoing Rotation Groups, we show that likely undocumented women increase their labor supply in response to the availability of driver licenses. Their work propensity rises by 4.2 percentage points, aligning it to that of their male counterparts. In addition, those at work raise their weekly hours of work by 4 percent. Overall, their real hourly wages drop by 3 percent. We find no similar impacts among likely undocumented men –a result consistent with a standard labor supply model predicting a greater response from individuals with a larger elasticity. Additionally, we find no apparent impacts on the labor supply and wages of similarly skilled Hispanic native-born women. At a time when anti-immigrant sentiments are at an all-time high, understanding how these policies impact targeted groups and similarly skilled native populations is crucial for maintaining an informed immigration policy debate.
K37|Fear and the Safety Net: Evidence from Secure Communities|This paper studies how changes in deportation fear induced by the roll-out of Secure Communities (SC), a far-reaching immigration enforcement program, affected the demand for safety net programs in the United States. We estimate the spillover effect of SC on the take-up of federal means-tested programs by Hispanic citizens, who are not themselves eligible for removal. We find significant declines in SNAP and SSI enrollment, particularly among mixed-citizenship status households. The response is muted for Hispanic households residing in sanctuary cities. Our results are most consistent with network effects that perpetuate fear rather than lack of benefit information, measurement error, or stigma.
K37|Skill Selection and American Immigration Policy in the Interwar Period|Abstract The Age of Mass Migration came to an end in the interwar period with new American immigration restrictions, but did this end affect some potential migrants more than others? I use previously unanalysed data from passenger lists of ships leaving Bremen, one of the major European ports of emigration, between 1920 and 1933, to identify occupations and skill levels of individual migrants. The main focus of the paper is on the role that policy played in influencing the selection of migrants. I study the American quota laws of 1921, 1924, and 1929, and find that increasingly strict quotas led to an increase in the skill level of migrants as well as a shift from agricultural to manufacturing workers first, and from manufacturing to professional workers later.
K37|The Effect of Immigration Enforcement on Crime Reporting: Evidence from the Priority Enforcement Program|Weak trust between immigrants and law enforcement may undermine law enforcement agencies' ability to keep communities safe. This paper documents that an immigrant's willingness to report crime is affected by immigration enforcement policies. I analyze the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which was launched by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency in 2015. Under PEP, ICE focused enforcement efforts on immigrants convicted of serious crimes and shifted resources away from immigration-related offenses, thereby lowering the cost to immigrants of reporting crime to the police. I use incident-level data from the Dallas Police Department that include the name and ethnicity of all complainants to show that the number of incidents reported by Hispanic individuals increased by 10 percent after the launch of PEP. The results of this study suggest that reducing immigration enforcement of individuals who do not pose a threat to public safety can potentially be one way to enhance trust between immigrant communities and the police.
K37|Immigrant crime and legal status: evidence from repeated amnesty programs|Do general amnesty programs lead to reductions in the crime rate among immigrants? We answer this question by exploiting cross-sectional and time variation in the number of immigrants legalized by the enactment of repeated amnesty programs between 1990 and 2005 in Italy. We address the potential endogeneity of the ‘legalization treatment’ by instrumenting the actual number of legalized immigrants with alternative predicted measures based on past amnesty applications patterns and residential choices of documented and undocumented immigrants. We find that, in the year following an amnesty, regions in which a higher share of immigrants obtained legal status experienced a greater decline in non-EU immigrant crime rates, relative to other regions. The effect is statistically significant but relatively small and not persistent. In further results, we fail to find any evidence of substitution in the criminal market from other population groups—namely, EU immigrants and Italian citizens—and we observe a small and not persistent reduction in total offenses.
K37|Family Unification, Siblings, and Skills|Recently proposed immigration reforms would constitute a major break in the 40-year-old U.S. admissions policy favoring family members. Although emphasizing the importance of the nuclear family, the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform and a house subcommittee on immigration recommend eliminating immigration preferences to other close relatives, including the brothers, sisters, and adult children of U.S. citizens. Under the proposed system, those relatives could not obtain U.S. visas unless they qualified because of specific job skills. Using Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) data on admissions criteria matched to 1990 Census data, we examine the effect of family admissions on immigrant education, self-employment, and earnings. Of particular relevance to the current debate, we also examine the effect of one of the family-based admission categories recommended for elimination -- the preference category that admits the siblings of U.S. citizens. We find that family-based immigrants, in general, have low initial earnings but high earnings growth relative to immigrants admitted on the basis of occupational skills. The earnings growth of immigrants is particularly high in cohorts with relatively high sibling admissions. Furthermore, sibling admissions are positively associated with immigrant self-employment. We also find that immigrant education levels are positively associated with sibling admissions and that the flows of occupation-based immigrants and immigrants admitted under the sibling category are intimately connected, particularly for immigrants from regions of the world where economic opportunities are limited for highly educated individuals. The results on earnings growth, self-employment, and education suggest that eliminating the sibling category may be counterproductive. More generally, the paper adds to our basic knowledge about the complex interactions of admission categories, human capital investment, and earnings growth.
K37|Kaum noch Asylsuchende, dafür viele qualifizierte Erwerbszuwanderer: Aktuelle Zahlen zur Zuwanderung aus den Westbalkanländern|Die Zuwanderung aus den Westbalkanländern nach Deutschland hat sich in den letzten Jahren stark verändert. War sie in der ersten Hälfte des Jahrzehnts sehr stark von Asylsuchenden geprägt, die kaum eine Chance auf einen Flüchtlingsstatus in Deutschland hatten, spielen diese quantitativ heute kaum noch eine Rolle. Die Gesamtzahl der Asylbewerber aus den sechs Ländern Albanien, Bosnien und Herzegowina, Kosovo, Mazedonien, Montenegro und Serbien war zwischen den Jahren 2010 und 2015 sehr stark von 13.000 auf 144.000 angestiegen, lag aber im Jahr 2017 mit rund 20.000 wieder deutlich niedriger. In den Monaten Januar bis August des Jahres 2018 waren es sogar insgesamt nur noch 6.600, sodass der Jahreswert etwa auf dem Niveau des Jahres 2010 liegen dürfte. Dafür ist die Zahl der Personen mit Aufenthaltstiteln zur Erwerbstätigkeit aus den Westbalkanländern zwischen den Jahren 2015 und 2017 um rund 30.000, von 12.000 auf 42.000, gestiegen. Gleichzeitig hat auch die Zahl der sozialversicherungspflichtig Beschäftigten Personen aus Albanien, Bosnien und Herzegowina, dem Kosovo, Mazedonien und Serbien sehr stark von 183.000 im März 2015 auf 268.000 im März 2018 zugenommen. Dabei handelt es sich zu bedeutenden Teilen um qualifizierte Fachkräfte. So übten 162.000 dieser Personen im März 2018 eine Tätigkeit aus, die in der Regel eine mindestens zwei- bis dreijährige Berufsausbildung erfordert. Auch der Beschäftigtenanteil an der Gesamtbevölkerung aus den Westbalkanländern im erwerbsfähigen Alter ist in den letzten Jahren stark gestiegen. Allerdings ist eine Aussage zum Beschäftigungsniveau schwierig, da sich die Bevölkerungszahlen aus den Westbalkanländern zwischen den beiden amtlichen Statistiken der Bevölkerungsfortschreibung und der Ausländerstatistik stark unterscheiden. Diese positive Entwicklung dürfte großenteils auf die Verschärfungen im Asylsystem für Personen aus den Westbalkanländern in der Mitte des Jahrzehnts und die Vereinfachung des Arbeitsmarktzugangs mit der sogenannten Westbalkanregelung (§ 26 Abs. 2 BeschV) im Oktober 2015 zurückzuführen sein. Allerdings ist davon auszugehen, dass mit der Westbalkanregelung, wie ursprünglich intendiert, im eigentlichen Sinn nicht nur eine Alternative zum Asylantrag geschaffen wurde. Die heutigen Erwerbsmigranten sind tendenziell nämlich viel höher qualifiziert als die früheren Asylsuchenden und gehören anderen Bevölkerungsschichten in den Herkunftsländern an. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist auch nicht davon auszugehen, dass mit einer Übertragung der Westbalkanregelung auf andere Flüchtlingsherkunftsländer ohne weitere Maßnahmen die Asylzugangszahlen maßgeblich reduziert werden könnten. Auch ist mit Blick auf die Qualifikationsstruktur der Erwerbszuwanderer zu beachten, dass das Wohlstandsgefälle zwischen Deutschland und Westbalkanländern zwar groß ist, die Bevölkerung dort aber dennoch ein im internationalen Vergleich relativ hohes Qualifikationsniveau aufweist.
K37|The deterrence effect of immigration enforcement in transit countries: Evidence from Central American deportees|Immigration enforcement cooperation between final destination and transit countries has increased in the last decades. However, the question whether these measures are successful in deterring undocumented migrants has not been previously explored by the empirical literature. This paper examines whether the Southern Border Plan, an immigration enforcement program implemented by the Mexican government in 2014, has curbed intentions of unauthorized migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to migrate to the United States. Combining surveys from Central American and Mexican deportees and using a DiD approach, I find that increased enforcement in Mexico decreases the likelihood of attempting repeated unauthorized crossings. The results indicate that in the short-run the cooperation between destination and transit countries could be effective in deterring undocumented migrants.
K37|Clicking on Heaven's Door: The Effect of Immigrant Legalization on Crime|"We estimate the effect of immigrant legalization on the crime rate of immigrants in Italy by exploiting an ideal regression discontinuity design: fixed quotas of residence permits are available each year, applications must be submitted electronically on specific ""click days,"" and are processed on a first come, first served basis until the available quotas are exhausted. Matching data on applications with individual-level criminal records, we show that legalization reduces the crime rate of legalized immigrants by 0.6 percentage points on average, on a baseline crime rate of 1.1 percent."
K37|A Property Rights Approach to Temporary Work Visas|Rules for temporary labor visas in the United States are criticized on three grounds: for failing to allocate visas efficiently, for failing to adequately protect domestic workers, and for exposing migrant workers to exploitation. We argue that it is possible to address all three problems by reconfiguring the property rights associated with the visas and carefully designing the mechanism for allocating those rights. Our core insight is to unbundle the two rights that today are typically combined: the firm's right to employ a foreign worker and the worker's right to reside and work in the country during that time. A three-pronged approach--auctioning abstract precontract visas to firms, allowing their trade on a secondary market, and transferring the visa's ownership to the worker upon signature of the employment contract--has the potential to improve the efficiency of visa allocation, to better shield domestic workers, and to protect foreign workers from exploitation.
K37|The Changing Family Structure of American Children with Unauthorized Parents|Tougher immigration enforcement has been responsible for 1.8 million deportations between 2009 and 2013 alone, most of them involving fathers and heads of household. We exploit the geographic and temporal variation in intensified enforcement to gauge its impact on children's propensity to live without their parents in households headed by relatives or friends, or in households singly headed by their mothers with absentee spouses. Given the emotional, cognitive and long run socioeconomic costs of being raised without parents or in a single-headed household, gaining a better understanding of the collateral damage of heightened enforcement on the families to which these children belong is well warranted.
K37|Substantial Labor Market Effects of the Residency Status: How Important Are Initial Conditions at Arrival for Immigrants?|This paper uses information on the legal status upon arrival to study long-term labor market effects, whereas selection and potential outmigration are taken into account by a large set of methods. I find that immigrants arrived with a job commitment in Germany achieve a longterm income advantage of 18.6% relative to other migrant groups, while language skills and ethnic networks can be excluded as transmission channels. Thus, a better linkage between job vacancies in the host country and the labor supply of potential migrants in the home country prevents mismatches and unrealistic expectations of potential migrants towards the host country.
K37|Border Communities Understanding on The Human Trafficking in Indonesia-Malaysia Border Region: Case Study in Sambas District, West Kalimantan|"""Objective – The aim of this study is to determine the understanding of people in the periphery of Indonesia-Malaysia border on safe migration and human trafficking. Methodology/Technique – This study used survey methodology with quantitative and qualitative approaches. The quantitative approach was used to determine the general data about the knowledge of the society – regarding the content and objectives of the campaign– as campaign target groups. Qualitative approach is also used to measure the Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) of the informant. The population of this study are the head of the family or the breadwinner of the family who have productive age as family member(s). Data sampling technique were collected by using purposive sampling. This study was conducted in Sambas district, West Kalimantan Province. Findings –The results showed that among 150 respondents, only 68 people, or approximately 45.3% of them know the terminology of trafficking. The respondents were able acknowledged trafficking when it was replaced with the phrase “perdagangan orang” (trafficking in Bahasa, literally means the selling of people). There were 71 people or about 47% of respondents aware of what can be categorized as trafficking in persons, namely: fraud, use of violence, forgery, threatened with violence, abuse of power, confinement and kidnapping. Novelty – Based on the findings that migrant workers from the border areas, especially at region of Sambas a are vulnerable to human trafficking, due to their very limited knowledge about the crime of Trafficking in Persons and this will suggest for further educational development initiative by authorities in those areas."""
K37|On the Implications of Immigration Policy Restricting Citizenship: Evidence from the Dominican Republic|In 2010, an amendment to the Dominican constitution weakened the concept of jus soli citizenship by denying Dominican nationality to individuals born on Dominican soil to irregular immigrants. A few years later, in 2013, the Dominican High Court denationalized large numbers of individuals by reinterpreting language in the prior constitution to, in effect, apply the newer citizenship requirements retroactively to 1929. We gauge the impacts of changes to Dominican citizenship laws on Haitian immigrants and their descendants, to whom, many believe, these policies were directed. We find that the constitutional amendment affected informal employment of some Haitians and their descendants. Furthermore, the High Court's ruling resulted in a significant reduction in the share of Haitian-descendant youth registered in school. Non-attendance was attributed primarily to lack of appropriate documents. Given the rise of nationalist sentiments and discussions to further restrict and revoking citizenship in various regions of the world today, it is important to further explore how these policies ultimately impact targeted and vulnerable populations.
K37|Interstate Mobility Patterns of Likely Unauthorized Immigrants: Evidence from Arizona|A growing literature has documented the displacement effects of tougher interior immigration enforcement measures; yet, we still lack an understanding of where the displaced populations are choosing to relocate. In this paper, we address this question using Arizona as a case study. Specifically, we examine the destinations of Mexican non-citizens leaving Arizona for other states in the union following the adoption of tougher enforcement measures using two different groups of control states: one consisting of all states that had not adopted similar measures, and another one derived using the synthetic control method. We find that Mexican non-citizens who migrated from Arizona to other U.S. states went, primarily, to New Mexico and California. Other destination states differed with the control group being used, underscoring the sensitivity of this type of analysis to the choice of control group. Furthermore, the trajectories of Mexican non-citizens leaving Arizona overlapped with those of non-Hispanic natives, hinting on the role that socioeconomic and political factors, in addition to potential complementarities between immigrants and natives, might have played in explaining the destinations of Mexican non-citizens leaving Arizona after 2007.
K37|Immigration Enforcement and Foster Care Placements|Tougher immigration enforcement has been responsible for approximately 1.8 million deportations between 2009 and 2013 alone. Children enter the foster care system when their parents are apprehended, deported and unable to care for them. We find that the average increase in interior immigration enforcement over the 2001 through 2015 period contributed to raising the share of Hispanic children in foster care anywhere between 15 and 21 percent. The effects appear to be driven by the implementation of police-based local initiatives linked to deportations, as in the case of the Secure Communities program. Given the revival of police-based immigration enforcement by President Donald Trump, further analyses of its consequences on families are well warranted.

K37|The Effects of Immigration Quotas on Wages, the Great Black Migration, and Industrial Development|This paper exploits the exogenous and differential immigrant supply shocks caused by the immigration quota system in the 1920s to identify the causal effects of the immigration restriction on the US manufacturing wages, the Great Migration, and industrial production between 1920 and 1930. I find that the immigration restriction significantly increased manufacturing wages and encouraged the southern black population to migrate to the North. I also find that the decline in the immigrant supply constrained the growth of the scale of manufacturing production and discouraged technology adoption of electrification.
K37|Responding to Refugee Crises in Developing Countries: What Can We Learn From Evaluations?|Displacement is at a historic high, with over 65 million individuals currently displaced. The world is facing a refugee crisis that is unprecedented in scale. A large number of evaluations look at different aspects of programming in response to refugee crises in developing countries. This paper covers the key areas and priority topics related to forced displacement identified by the Development Assisstance Committee Temporary Working Group on Refugees and Migration. It draws from evaluation findings to highlight key lessons and recommendations for positive change going forward.Key topics covered in the paper include: lessons on bridging the gap between humanitarian and development programming; efforts to strengthen international response to protracted crises; lessons on whole-of-government approaches in refugee contexts; learning from work in urban settings; improving access to employment and quality education; new financing mechanisms for refugee crises in middle income countries; and lessons on financing in response to the Syria crisis. The paper highlights the evaluation work of DAC members and aims to help strengthen the evidence base to improve response to situations of displacement in developing countries.
K37|Responding to Refugee Crises: Lessons from evaluations in Ethiopia and Uganda as countries of destination|"This working paper is a case study on Ethiopia and Uganda as countries of destination for refugees. The case study looks at the approaches adopted in Ethiopia and Uganda to promote refugee self-reliance and enable refugees to work to earn income. It compares outcomes in the countries, with a specific focus on access to employment and business creation, including legal and socio-economic barriers. The case study draws from a number of evaluations of efforts by the international community to support Ethiopian and Ugandan initiatives. The case study was undertaken as part of a wider research project on learning from evaluations to improve responses to refugee crises in developing countries and supports the synthesis paper ""Responding to Refugee Crises in Developing Countries: What Can We Learn From Evaluations?"""
K37|Responding to Refugee Crises: Lessons from evaluations in South Sudan as a country of origin|"This working paper is a case study on South Sudan as an important refugee country of origin. The case study looks at issues of forced displacement in South Sudan and underscores the linkages between internally displaced persons and South Sudanese refugees. The case study highlights the importance of under­standing local contexts and root drivers of conflict and displacement. It reviews evaluations of programmes in South Sudan, including past efforts at state building and refugee resettlement to look at learning within the international community. The study was undertaken as part of a wider research project on learning from evaluations to improve responses to situations of forced displacement and supports the synthesis paper ""Responding to Refugee Crises in Developing Countries: What Can We Learn From Evaluations?"""
K37|Responding to Refugee Crises: Lessons from evaluations in Afghanistan as a country of origin|"This working paper is a case study on Afghanistan as a refugee country of origin. The case study looks at whole-of-government efforts by OECD member countries in Afghanistan, specifically looking at how states have co-ordinated development, diplomatic and defence resources in a refugee country of origin. The case study also examines efforts by the international community to promote stability and state building objectives. The case study was undertaken as part of a wider research project on learning from evaluations to improve responses to situations of forced displacement and supports the synthesis paper ""Responding to Refugee Crises in Developing Countries: What Can We Learn From Evaluations?"""
K37|Benefit and Cost of Visa relaxation -Empirical Analysis on the Impact of Visa waiver-|In spite of a heated debate over immigration policies in the world, the effects of visa, which is one of the representative tool for immigration control, are uncertain for some aspects. This paper analyzes whether visa relaxation has impacts on both legal foreign visitors and illegally overstayed foreigners focusing on Japanese visa waiver program. The empirical analyses show that visa waiver will increase both legal travelers and illegally overstayed foreigners while it may have a bigger effect on legal visitors than overstayed foreigners.
K37|The Economics Of Forced Displacement: An Introduction|Forced displacement - defined as the displacement of refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) due to violence – has reached an unprecedented scale and global attention during the past few years, particularly in the aftermath of the Syrian refugee crisis in 2011 and the European Union’s migration crisis in 2015. As this plight gained momentum, economics found itself unprepared to answer the basic questions surrounding refugees and IDPs. Few economists or institutions were working on forced displacement. Economic theory or empirics had little to offer in terms of articles published in journals. Data were found to be scarce, unreliable or inaccessible. Can economics rise to the challenge? Is the economics of forced displacement different from neoclas-sical economics? Can we use off the shelves models to study forced displaced populations? What are we missing to do the economics of forced displacement? What are the data constraints that limit economists in this work? This paper provides a first non-technical introduction to these topics. We argue that the modelling of utility, choice, risk and information in a short-term setting is the key to address the problem. Neoclassical economics lacks some of the theoretical ingredients that are needed but recent developments in game theory, neuroeconomics and behavioral economics have opened new horizons that make the task of modelling forced displacement within reach. Empirics is clearly limited by the scarcity of quality data but an example shows how welfare economists can start working with existing data. Economists have no excuse to maintain the status quo and should get on with the work on forced displacement.
K37|Immigrant Fertility in the Midst of Intensified Enforcement|This paper exploits the temporal and geographic variation in the implementation of local and state immigration enforcement measures to identify their impact on undocumented immigrants’ fertility. Using data from the 2005 through 2014 American Community Survey, we find that a one standard deviation increase in the intensity of immigration enforcement lowers the childbearing likelihood of likely undocumented women by 6.3 percent. This effect appears driven by police-based measures and, the fact that is present among intact families, families headed by a likely undocumented couple, as well as among the poorest families, suggests the importance of limited income resources, along with increased uncertainty emanating from an intensified fear of deportation, on likely unauthorized women’s fertility. Given immigrants’ critical contribution to the sustainability of the welfare state and the spread-out embracement of a piece-meal approach to immigration enforcement, further exploration of this impact is warranted and recommended.
K37|Undocumented youth in limbo: the impact of America’s immigration enforcement policy on juvenile deportations|Abstract The surge in unaccompanied minor crossings between 2011 and 2014 led to an overwhelming increase in the number of juvenile deportation proceedings, which coincided with a peak in intensified immigration enforcement at the state and local levels. Using data on juvenile deportation proceedings, we examine how tougher immigration enforcement might have influenced judicial rulings on these cases and, ultimately, these youths’ ability to stay in the country. We find that the average increase in immigration enforcement over that period is associated with a 15% reduction in the share of juvenile cases ending with permission to stay. The result underscores the importance of the immigration policy context in which courts operate on their rulings, even if immigration law is within the jurisdiction of the Federal government. Given the gravity of the circumstances these children are escaping, further attention to how the piecemeal approach to immigration enforcement might impact the protection of their humanitarian rights is warranted.
K37|Eckpunkte eines modernen Zuwanderungsrechts|Deutschland braucht ein modernes Einwanderungsrecht. Einerseits ist das Land vor dem Hintergrund von demografischem Wandel und Fachkräfteengpässen zunehmend auf gut ausgebildete Personen aus Drittstaaten angewiesen, um Wachstum und Wohlstand zu sichern. Andererseits machen sich viele vorwiegend niedrigqualifizierte Personen ohne Dokumente auf den Weg nach Deutschland, was zu Wanderungsbewegungen führt, die besser gesteuert werden sollten. Dabei hat das Land mit dem Aufenthaltsgesetz an sich bereits ein Zuwanderungsgesetz. Allerdings ist der institutionelle Rahmen an vielen Stellen nicht zeitgemäß. Das Kernproblem ist, dass die zuwanderungsrechtlichen Regelungen zu großen Teilen sehr komplex gefasst sind und große Interpretationsspielräume zulassen. In Kombination mit der dezentralen Organisation von Auslandsvertretungen und Ausländerbehörden hat dies zur Folge, dass der Ausgang der Verfahren und die Verfahrensdauern für die beteiligten Personen - neben den Zuwanderungsinteressierten selbst sind dies etwa auch in Drittstaaten rekrutierende Unternehmen - häufig nur schwer absehbar sind. Dies kann auf zuwanderungsinteressierte Fachkräfte abschreckend wirken, wohingegen unpräzise oder schwer verständliche Informationen über die Zugangswege Personen ohne Chancen auf einen Aufenthaltstitel darin bestärken können, sich auch ohne gültige Papiere auf den Weg zu machen. Eine deutliche Liberalisierung der Zugangswege nach Deutschland ist nach aktuellem Stand nur in zwei Bereichen geboten. Zum einen sollte vor dem Hintergrund der zu erwartenden starken Auswirkungen des demografischen Wandels für Personen, die zwar noch keine Stellenzusage vorweisen können, vor dem Hintergrund ihrer Qualifikationen und weiteren persönlichen Eigenschaften aber eine gute Integration erwarten lassen, ein neuer potenzialorientierter Zugangsweg geschaffen werden. Zum anderen sollte jungen Menschen aus Drittstaaten der Zugang zur beruflichen Bildung in Deutschland erleichtert werden.
K37|The Economics of Temporary Migrations|Many migrations are temporary -- a fact that has often been ignored in the economic literature on migration. Such omission may be serious in that expected migration temporariness can impart a distinct dynamic element to immigrants' economic behavior, generating possible consequences for nonmigrants in both home and host countries. In this paper, we provide a thorough examination of the various aspects of temporary migrations that matter for the analysis of economic phenomena. We demonstrate the extent of temporary migrations in population movements. We show how temporariness can affect the various economic choices and how better data have improved both the measurement of nonpermanent migrations and the analyses of various aspects of migrant behavior. We propose a general theoretical framework for modeling temporary migration decisions, based on which we outline the various motives for temporariness while simultaneously reviewing related literature and available data sources. We discuss the possible consequences of migration temporariness for nonmigrants in both home and host countries. (JEL F22, F24, J11, J61, K37, O15)
K37|Alternative Strategies to Manage Weather Risk in Perennial Fruit Crop Production| Fruit producers in the Eastern United States face a wide range of weather-related risks during the growing season, and many of these events have the capacity to largely impact yields and profitability. This research examines the economic implications associated with responding to these risks for sweet cherry production in three different systems: using high tunnels to protect the crop, purchasing revenue insurance products, and employing weather insurance schemes. The analysis considers a distribution of revenue flows and costs using detailed price, yield, and weather data between 1984 and 2013. Our results show that the high tunnel system generates the largest net return if significant price premiums exist for earlier and larger fruit. Under most conditions, the results also indicate that net returns for the system that uses revenue-based crop insurance exceed those for the system that uses weather insurance products.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K37|Effects of the Alabama HB 56 Immigration Law on Crime: A Synthetic Control Approach| The act of Alabama HB 56, passed in 2011 is considered to be the strictest anti-illegal immigration bill in the United States. This paper evaluates the impact of this policy on crime, by using the synthetic control method to create a counterfactual Alabama. The results provide suggestive evidence of heterogeneous causal effects of Alabama HB 56 on crime. Compared to the synthetic group, the violent crime rate increased as a response to Alabama HB 56, while there was no significant change in property crime rate after the act. A placebo test was also performed to demonstrate the robustness of the results.
K37|Why Birthright Citizenship Matters for Immigrant Children: Impacts on Parental Educational Choice|Immigrant children often face educational disadvantages that stem from their parents’ decision- making. For example, in many immigrant-receiving countries, immigrants are less likely than the native-born to enrol their children in preschool programs or enable them access to higher education. Thus, a key question is how to get immigrant parents to provide their children with similar educational opportunities as children in native families. This paper examines whether the introduction of birthright citizenship in Germany caused immigrant parents to adapt their educational choices for their offspring. We employ a difference-in-differences strategy which exploits a birth date cut-off determining whether a child became eligible for birthright citizenship or not. We find that the policy caused immigrant parents to (i) send their children to preschool more often; (ii) enrol their children earlier in primary school; and (iii) adjust their secondary school track choices in a way that enables their children better access to higher education.
K37|Can selective immigration policies reduce migrants' quality?|Destination countries can adopt selective immigration policies to improve migrants' quality. Screening potential migrants on the basis of observable characteristics also influences their self-selection on unobservables. We propose a model that analyzes the effects of selective immigration policies on migrants' quality, measured by their wages at destination. We show that the prevailing pattern of selection on unobservables influences the effect of an increase in selectivity, which can reduce migrants' quality when migrants are positively self-selected on unobservables. We also demonstrate that, in this case, the quality-maximizing share of educated migrants declines with the scale of migration.
K37|Unintended effects of the Alabama HB 56 immigration law on crime: A preliminary analysis|The Alabama HB 56 act passed in 2011 is the strictest anti-illegal immigration bill in the United States. Using the synthetic control method to create a counterfactual Alabama, this paper provides suggestive evidence that Alabama HB 56 led to an increase in violent crime rates, but had no significant impact on property crime rates.
K37|(Why) are immigrants unhappy?|Abstract Recent studies suggest that migrants may be less satisfied with their ‘new’ lives than members of the host population and worry that this may be driven by cultural factors, such as feelings of not belonging. Motivated by this concern, this paper analyses the life satisfaction of immigrants once settled in the host country. We rely on the German Socio-Economic Panel’s immigrant sample for the years 1984–2010 and find that while immigrants are less satisfied than natives, this difference can be explained by factors related to economic integration, such as the details of their employment conditions, rather than cultural factors such as feelings of not belonging, which often loom large in the public mind.

K37|Does granting citizenship to immigrant children affect family outmigration?|Abstract This study examines the effect of birthright citizenship on the outmigration behavior of migrant families in Germany. Using the introduction of birthright citizenship on 1 January 2000 and cohort-level data from the German Microcensus from 2001 to 2006, I exploit the differential treatment of birth cohorts around the enactment date to conduct a regression discontinuity analysis. Comparing the outmigration behavior of foreign-citizen families with children born in Germany directly before and after the cutoff, I find evidence that granting citizenship to immigrant children reduces the likelihood that their parents leave the country again.
