I31|Natural disasters and mental health: A quantile approach|This article investigates heterogeneity in the effect of experiencing natural disasters on mental health. Using Australian longitudinal data, we find that home owners generally show a reduction in mental health score after a disaster. There is a strong negative effect in the lowest two quantiles of the distribution for non-owners.
I31|Inequality during the nutritional transition: Hospital diets in Mediterranean Spain (Valencia, 1853-1923)|Unequal access to food is one of the main issues in nutritional history, but scarcity of sources has hampered the quantification of this phenomenon. This work proposes using hospital diets to address this gap. We have used records from 1853 to 1923 concerning hospital diets in the psychiatric section of the Hospital General de Valencia (Spain) and we have inferred the actual intake of nutrients for six groups of patients and members of staff. The results reveal considerable differences in terms of diet and nutrition. While the most-favoured group (nuns and well-off patients) had by 1853 reduced their relative intake of cereals and increased that of meat, in line with the general trend of the nutritional transition, the poor and orphans were still behind the trend by 1923. On the other hand, hospital staff were on a high-calorie diet that was adequate for undertaking heavy tasks, yet still suffered from a significant deficit in nutrient intake. These inequalities indicate that the nutritional transition was an uneven and non-linear process, with substantial differences according to social groups.
I31|Social Shock Sharing and Stochastic Dominance|Since the seminal paper of Atkinson and Bourguignon (1982), little decisive progress has been achieved in developing empirically efficient stochastic dominance criteria for multidimensional social welfare analysis. By proposing new axioms of 'Social Shock Sharing', this paper provides new intuitive justifications to imposing sign restrictions on partial derivatives of individual von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions. These new breakthrough findings are exploited to derive necessary and sufficient stochastic dominance criteria for multidimensional social welfare comparisons, up to the sixth order, at least. Equivalent results are derived in terms of multidimensional poverty conditions. Empirically powerful discriminatory criteria are obtained by combining all social shock sharing axioms up to some high order and by deriving a dimension reduction property. An application to Egypt at the beginning of the XXIst century demonstrates the practical substantial gain in discriminating power of the approach by revealing a unambiguous continual improvement in bivariate income-education social welfare over the studied period.
I31|Have Econometric Analyses of Happiness Data Been Futile? A Simple Truth about Happiness Scales|Econometric analyses in the happiness literature typically use subjective well-being (SWB) data to compare the mean of observed or latent happiness across samples. Recent critiques show that com-paring the mean of ordinal data is only valid under strong assumptions that are usually rejected by SWB data. This leads to an open question whether much of the empirical studies in the economics of happiness literature have been futile. In order to salvage some of the prior results and avoid future issues, we suggest regression analysis of SWB (and other ordinal data) should focus on the median ra-ther than the mean. Median comparisons using parametric models such as the ordered probit and logit can be readily carried out using familiar statistical softwares like STATA. We also show a previously as-sumed impractical task of estimating a semiparametric median ordered-response model is also possi-ble by using a novel constrained mixed integer optimization technique. We use GSS data to show the famous Easterlin Paradox from the happiness literature holds for the US independent of any paramet-ric assumption.
I31|The Non-Standard Monetary Policy Measures of the ECB: Motivations, Effectiveness and Risks|This paper examines the challenges faced by the European Central Bank since the outbreak of the global financial crisis. From 2008 to 2014, the need to preserve the correct functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and ensure the supply of credit to the private sector stretched the limits of conventional monetary policy. In 2015, the risk of deflation led the ECB to start a large scale asset purchase programme. The analysis is largely based on a review of the many studies that Banca d’Italia staff has produced on the factors that have brought inflation to unprecedented low levels in 2014 and on the effects of the asset purchase programme.
I31|El Sistema Pensional en Colombia|En el documento se describe el sistema pensional colombiano. Luego de la reforma de la Ley 100 mejoraron las afiliaciones, lo cual implica un aumento también de las cotizaciones y la cobertura de los pensionados en el futuro. En la actualidad la cobertura de las pensiones es apenas 23% y menos de 1,5 millones de personas. Esto se debe, en parte, a la existencia de un mercado laboral con un sector informal amplio (47,3%). Las mayores tasas de reemplazo del sistema público con respecto al privado ocasionan traslados del segundo al primero, lo que pone más presión en las finanzas públicas. Por lo anterior, se propone establecer un sistema de 3 pilares vigente en otros países como Chile. Actualmente, por nivel de ingreso, cerca de 80% de los cotizantes corresponde a personas con menos de 2 SMMLV; sin embargo, un alto monto de los subsidios del RPM se destina a la población con mayores ingresos. El gasto en transferencias con cargo a la Nación fue de 3,4% del PIB y el pasivo pensional fue cercano al 130% del PIB. Teniendo en cuenta las anteriores consideraciones, en este documento se plantea la necesidad de una reforma pensional que mejore la cobertura, aumente las transferencias a la población más pobre y no incremente los requerimientos de presupuesto de la Nación. **** ABSTRACT: The document describes the Colombian pension system. After the reforms of the Law 100, affiliations improved which also implies an increase of the contributions and the coverage of the pensioners in the future. At present, the coverage of pensions is only 23% and less than 1,5 million people. This is partly due to the existence of a labor market with a broad informal sector (47,3%). The public system has higher replacement rates than the private one causing transfers from the second to the first, which puts more pressure on public finances. Therefore, this document proposes to establish a 3 pillars scheme that exists in other countries like Chile. Currently, by level of income, about 80% of contributors correspond to people who earn less than 2 SMMLV, but substantial RPM subsidies goes to the population with the highest income. Pension transfers in charge of the Nation were 3,4% of GDP and pension liabilities were close to 130% of GDP. Taking into account the above considerations, this document raises the need for a pension reform that improves coverage, increases transfers to the poorest population and does not increase the Nation's budget requirements.
I31|Social Capital and Health: A Meta-Analysis|This study investigates the extensive empirical literature on social capital and health using meta-analysis. Our final sample consists of 12,459 estimated effects taken from 450 studies. Our main result is that the overall mean size of the effect of social capital on health is very small, though it is statistically significant. This low association follows from a relatively large share of individually insignificant estimates, combined with the large sample sizes that characterize this literature. Furthermore, despite an extensive theoretical literature concerned with delineating different kinds of social capital, we find few systematic empirical differences. While cognitive social capital has a significantly stronger association with health than structural social capital, especially for mental health, the difference is empirically minor. There is no evidence of significant differences between bonding, bridging, and linking social capital.
I31|Employee wellbeing: the impact on productivity and firm performance|Does having happier staff mean higher productivity and improvements in companies' bottom line? A study of over 1.8 million employees across 73 countries by Christian Krekel, George Ward and Jan-Emmanuel De Neve detects a strong positive correlation between employee wellbeing, productivity and firm performance.
I31|Employee Wellbeing, Productivity and Firm Performance|Does higher employee wellbeing lead to higher productivity, and, ultimately, to tangible benefits to the bottom line of businesses? We survey the evidence and study this question in a meta-analysis of 339 independent research studies, including the wellbeing of 1,882,131 employees and the performance of 82,248 business units, originating from 230 independent organisations across 49 industries in the Gallup client database. We find a significant, strong positive correlation between employees' satisfaction with their company and employee productivity and customer loyalty, and a strong negative correlation with staff turnover. Ultimately, higher wellbeing at work is positively correlated with more business-unit level profitability.
I31|Childhood Circumstances and Young Adulthood Outcomes: The Role of Mothers’ Financial Problems|We here consider the cognitive and non-cognitive consequences on young adults of growing up with a mother who reported experiencing major financial problems. We use UK data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to show that early childhood financial problems are associated with worse adolescent cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes, controlling for both income and a set of standard variables, and in value-added models controlling for children’s earlier age-5 outcomes. The estimated effect of financial problems is almost always larger in size than that of income. Around one-quarter to one-half of the effect of financial problems on the non-cognitive outcomes seems to transit through mother’s mental health.
I31|Widening the high school curriculum to include soft skill training: impacts on health, behaviour, emotional wellbeing and occupational aspirations|"From 2020 Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education will be compulsory in UK schools for adolescents, however less is known about how it can be taught in a an effective manner. We examine, through a randomised trial, the impact of an evidenced based health related quality of life (HRQoL) curriculum called Healthy Minds that ran in 34 high schools in England over a four-year period. We find robust evidence that Healthy Minds positively augments many physical health domains of treated adolescents. We also find some evidence that Healthy Minds positively affects behaviour, but has no impact on emotional wellbeing. We find notable gender effects, strongly favouring boys. We also present evidence that Healthy Minds changes career aspirations, with those exposed to treatment being less likely to choose competitive work and more likely to choose work that involves ""people-skills"". Overall our work illustrates the potential for later childhood interventions to promote HRQoL and develop the career aspirations of adolescents."
I31|Quantifying the intangible impact of the Olympics using subjective well-being data|Hosting the Olympic Games costs billions of taxpayer dollars. Following a quasi- experimental setting, this paper assesses the intangible impact of the London 2012 Olympics, using a novel panel of 26,000 residents in London, Paris, and Berlin during the summers of 2011, 2012, and 2013. We show that hosting the Olympics increases subjective well-being of the host city's residents during the event, particularly around the times of the opening and closing ceremonies. However, we do not _nd much evi- dence for legacy e_ects. Estimating residents' implicit willingness-to-pay for the event, we do not _nd that it was worth it for London alone, but a modest wellbeing impact on the rest of the country would make hosting worth the costs.
I31|Time use, unemployment, and well-being: an empirical analysis using British time-use data|We use nationally representative data from the UK Time-Use Survey 2014/2015 to investigate how a person’s employment status is related to time use and cognitive and affective dimensions of subjective well-being. We find that unemployed persons report substantially lower levels of life satisfaction than employed persons. When looking at specific types of activities, the unemployed enjoy most of the activities they engage in less than the employed. However, the employed consider working to be one of the least enjoyable activities. They also spend a large share of their time at work and with work-related activities, while the unemployed spend more time on leisure and more enjoyable activities instead. When looking at duration-weighted average affective well-being over the entire waking time of the day, our results suggest that the benefit of having to spend less time at work outweighs the negative emotional effect of unemployment during leisure episodes, such that the unemployed experience, on average, more enjoyment during the day than the employed.
I31|Fair long-term care insurance|The study of optimal long-term care (LTC) social insurance is generally carried out under the utilitarian social criterion, which penalizes individuals who have a lower capacity to convert resources into well-being, such as dependent elderly individuals or prematurely dead individuals. This paper revisits the design of optimal LTC insurance while adopting the ex post egalitarian social criterion, which gives priority to the worst-off in realized terms (i.e. once the state of nature has been revealed). Using a lifecycle model with risk about the duration of life and risk about old-age dependence, it is shown that the optimal LTC social insurance is quite sensitive to the postulated social criterion. The optimal second-best social insurance under the ex post egalitarian criterion involves, in comparison to utilitarianism, higher LTC benefits, lower pension benefits, a higher tax rate on savings, as well as a lower tax rate on labor earnings.
I31|Education, Political Discontent, and Emigration Intentions: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in Turkey|We exploit the 1997 school reform that increased compulsory schooling from 5 to 8 years to investigate the causal effect of education on emigration intentions. Our IV estimates indicate that an additional year of schooling increases the probability of reporting the intention to emigrate by 24 percentage points. Moreover, we provide evidence that the identified effect of education on emigration intentions does not operate through financial dissatisfaction but rather through displeasure at a bleak political environment that better educated people are more keenly aware of.
I31|The Baby Year Parental Leave Reform in the GDR and Its Impact on Children's Long-Term Life Satisfaction|This article investigates the effects of an increase in paid parental leave — twelve months instead of six months — on children’s long-term life satisfaction. The historical setting under study, namely the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), allows us to circumvent problems of selection of women into the labor market and an insufficient or heterogeneous non-parental child care supply, which are issues many other studies on parental leave reforms face. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) we analyze the birth cohorts from 1980 to 1989 at adult age, and apply a difference-in-difference design making use of the very specific timing of the GDR’s parental leave reforms in 1976 and 1986. We find significant and robust positive parental leave effects on life satisfaction. We also analyze whether the increase in life satisfaction is driven by a positive development of personality, health factors, schooling or labor market outcomes. Our results suggest that the increase in life satisfaction might be partially explained by personality development for individuals from low socioeconomic backgrounds and boys. For individuals from high socioeconomic backgrounds, it might be driven by a better health.
I31|Comparison Is The Thief Of Joy. Does Social Comparison Affect Migrants’ Subjective Well-Being?|This paper contributes to the growing strand of literature that investigates migrants’ subjective wellbeing by analysing how the social comparison with two reference groups (natives and other migrants) within the host country affects migrants’ life satisfaction. Using data from six rounds of the European Social Survey, we constructed two measures of economic distance that compare each migrant’s situation with the average of the group of natives and the group of migrants with similar characteristics. Our results indicate that when the disadvantage between the migrant and the reference groups becomes smaller, migrant’s life satisfaction increases. The effect of the social comparison with natives appears larger than the social comparison with migrants and, in both cases, it is stronger for individuals with higher levels of education. We also show that social comparison is stronger for second generation migrants than for first generation migrants and, within this latter group, it intensifies as length of stay in the host country increases. Overall, the role of social comparison seems crucial to understanding patterns of integration in an enlarged Europe.
I31|Análisis Cualitativo de Sinergias entre Estrategias de Protección Social y de Desarrollo Productivo: El Papel de la Estrategia Unidos y Familias en Acción en el Marco del Programa Familias en su Tierra|Este documento presenta el análisis cualitativo de complementariedades y sinergias entre los programas de protección social Estrategia Unidos y Familias en Acción, y el programa de inclusión productiva Familias en su Tierra, diseñados e implementados en Colombia por Prosperidad Social. Este estudio hace parte del Proyecto “Mejorando la Articulación entre Programas de Desarrollo Rural y Protección Social” financiado por el Fondo Internacional de Desarrollo Agrícola -FIDA-. El análisis se desarrolló a partir de la aplicación de 43 entrevistas semi-estructuradas a beneficiarios y no beneficiarios de estos programas en dos zonas del país: Montes de María y Urabá Antioqueño. Los resultados ofrecen luces sobre varios mecanismos a través de los cuales los programas alcanzan sus objetivos, así como los canales a partir de los cuales es posible la generación de complementariedades o sinergias entre programas de protección social e intervenciones de índole productivo. Los resultados cualitativos también complementan y permiten explicar los resultados del análisis cuantitativo.
I31|Indicador de Bourguignon y Chakravarty de pobreza multidimensional en Colombia|La pobreza es uno de los problemas sociales más importantes alrededor del mundo, un análisis preciso de este fenómeno es esencial en el planteamiento de políticas públicas encaminadas al mejoramiento de las condiciones de vida y el bienestar de los individuos. El objetivo central de este documento es proponer una medición alternativa de la pobreza multidimensional en Colombia, para ello se estimará el indicador de Bourguignon y Chakravarty, identificando a los hogares pobres a partir de dimensiones, variables y parámetros de estimación no utilizados en la metodología convencional. Uno de los resultados principales es que, si bien la incidencia de la pobreza se redujo notablemente de 2010 a 2016, la brecha y la severidad de la pobreza multidimensional no disminuyeron en la misma magnitud. Por lo tanto, millones de hogares colombianos no han presentado cambios significativos en su nivel de vida y bienestar. *** Poverty is one of the most important social problems around the world. It means that this issue should be essential in public policy and different strategies must be proposed in order to improve people’s lives and their welfare. The aim of this paper is to propose an alternative methodology of measurement of multidimensional poverty in Colombia, considering the Bourguignon and Chakravarty indicator and non-conventional dimensions and variables to identify poor households. One of the primary results is that even though headcount ratio of multidimensional poverty reduced remarkably from 2010 to 2016, gap and severity of multidimensional poverty did not decline in the same magnitude. Therefore, there are millions of households with several deprivations whose quality of live has not changed recently.
I31|Well-being, Political Decentralisation and Governance Quality in Europe| European nations allocate public sector resources with the general aim of increasing the well-being and welfare of their citizens through a fair and efficient distribution of these public goods and services. However, “who” delivers these goods and services and “how well” they are delivered are essential in determining outcomes in terms of well-being. Drawing on data from the European Social Survey database, this paper uses Amartya Sen’s social welfare index framework—accounting for the trade-off between the maximization of public sector resources and an equitable distribution of these resources—to examine the influence of political decentralisation (“who” delivers the resources) and whether this influence is moderated by governance quality (“how well” they are delivered) on individual subjective well-being. The findings of the econometric analysis reveal that decentralisation does not always lead to higher well-being, as the benefits of political decentralisation are highly mediated by the quality of national governance. In countries with high governance quality, political decentralisation results in a greater satisfaction with health provision, while in lower quality governance countries, a more decentralized government can increase the overall satisfaction with life, the economy, government, democracy and the provision of education, but not necessarily with health-related services.
I31|When Dad Can Stay Home: Fathers' Workplace Flexibility and Maternal Health|While workplace flexibility is perceived to be a key determinant of maternal labor supply, less is known about fathers' demand for flexibility or about intra-household spillover effects of flexibility initiatives. This paper examines these issues in the context of a critical period in family life-the months immediately following childbirth-and identifies the impacts of paternal access to workplace flexibility on maternal postpartum health. We model household demand for paternal presence at home as a function of domestic stochastic shocks, and use variation from a Swedish reform that granted new fathers more flexibility to take intermittent parental leave during the postpartum period in a regression discontinuity difference-in-differences (RD-DD) design. We find that increasing the father's temporal flexibility reduces the risk of the mother experiencing physical postpartum health complications and improves her mental health. Our results suggest that mothers bear the burden from a lack of workplace flexibility-not only directly through greater career costs of family formation, as previously documented-but also indirectly, as fathers' inability to respond to domestic shocks exacerbates the maternal health costs of childbearing.
I31|Transition from plan to market, height and well-being|Using newly available data, we re-evaluate the impact of transition from plan to market in former communist countries on objective and subjective well-being. We find clear evidence of the high social cost of early transition reforms: cohorts born around the start of transition are shorter than their older or younger peers. The difference in height suggests that the first years of reforms in post-communist countries were accompanied by major deprivation. We provide suggestive evidence on the importance of three mechanisms which partially explain these results: the decline of GDP per capita, the deterioration of healthcare systems, and food scarcity. On the bright side, we find that cohorts that experienced transition in their infancy are now better educated and more satisfied with their lives than their counterparts. Taken together, our results imply that the transition process has been a traumatic experience, but that its negative impact has largely been overcome.
I31|Escalation and Well-being|Escalation is a key characteristic of many consumption behaviors that has not received the theoretical attention it deserves. The aim of this paper is to propose both a definition and a theoretical treatment of escalation in consumption. We shall define escalation as the attempt to engage in consumption acts that are “more intense” on a measurable quantitative or qualitative, objective or subjective, scale (more difficult ski slopes, stronger drugs, harder sex, better restaurants, riskier games, etc.), even if, previously, the subject preferred less intense consumption behaviors. Further, this evolution in preferences also occurs if the budget constraint does not change. We will find endogenous and exogenous theoretical microfoundations for escalation in models of hedonic adaptation, desire for novelty, acquisition of consumption skills, rising aspirations, positional effects, and envy. However, we will also discuss the possibility that the tendency to escalate is a specific innate behavior inherent to human nature. Finally, we will propose a preliminary theoretical formalization of such behavior and indicate the possible implications of taking escalation into adequate consideration.
I31|Social Exclusion, Ambiguity and (IR)rationality|This working paper extends the methodology of non-smooth aï¬€ective portfolio theory (APT) for eliciting (IR)rational preferences of investors endowed with continuous quasilinear utility functions, where assets are portfolios of risky and ambiguous state-contingent claims. The elicitation is a solution of the aï¬€ective Afriat inequalities;see technical appendix 1. Solving the smooth aï¬€ective Afriat inequalities is Np-hard; see technical appendices 2, 3, and 4. The proposed extension is a methodology for the elicitation of (IR)rational preferences of individuals endowed with random continuous quasilinear utility functions deï¬ ned over ï¬ nite subsets of discrete social goods as a refutable model of social exclusion in the incomplete markets for social goods; see technical appendices 5 and 6. The methods of elicitation are generalized estimating equations (GEE) and alternating logistic regression (ALR); see technical appendices; 7 and 8.
I31|The Day after the Bomb: Well-being Effects of Terrorist Attacks in Europe|We study the non-monetary costs of the terrorist attacks occurred in France, Belgium and Germany between 2010 and 2017. Using four waves of the European Social Survey, we find that individuals' well-being is significantly reduced in the aftermath of a terrorist attack. We explore possible mechanisms for this effect, finding that terrorist attacks determine a reduction in generalized trust, institutional trust, satisfaction with democracy and satisfaction with the government. Terrorist attacks are also found to increase negative attitudes towards migrants and perceived discrimination. However, contrary to expectations, the negative impact of terrorism on well-being is less strong for Muslim immigrants. We posit that this occurs because immigrants benefit more than natives from the institutional reaction following the attacks.
I31|Parental Child Care Time, Income and Subjective Well-Being: A Multidimensional Polarization Approach for Germany|Neither market income nor consumption expenditure provides an adequate picture of individual standard of living. It is time which enables and restricts individual activities and is a further brick to a more comprehensive picture of individual well-being. In our study we focus on a prominent part of time use in non-market services: it is parental child care which contributes not only to individual but also to societal well-being. Within a novel approach we ask for multidimensional polarization effects of parental child care where compensation/substitution of time for parental child care versus income is interdependently evaluated by panel estimates of society’s subjective well-being. The new interdependent 2DGAP measure thereby provides multidimensional polarization intensity information for the poor and the rich and disentangles the single time and income contribution to subjective well-being ensuring at the same time the interdependence of the polarization dimensions. Socio-economic influences on the polarization pole risk and intensity will be quantified by two stage Heckman estimates. The analyses are based on the German Socio-Economic Panel with 21 waves and robust fixed effects estimates of subjective well-being as well as the German Time Use Surveys 1991/92 and actual 2012/13 with detailed diary time use data. The empirical results discover the interdependent relations between parental child care and income under a common evaluation frame and contribute to the question of dimension specific targeted policies in a multidimensional polarization approach. Prominent result: compensation between parental child care time and income proved to be significant, but there are multidimensional regions with no compensation, where parental child care time deficit is not compensated by income. Interdependent multidimensional polarization by headcount and intensity increased significantly over the twenty years under investigation with remarkable risk and intensity differences between the polarization poles with different disentangled parental child care time and income contributions to subjective well-being.
I31|The Role of Body Weight for Health, Earnings, and Life Satisfaction|Based on the German Socio-Economic Panel, the influence of the body mass index on health, earnings and satisfaction is analysed by gender. Basic results are: health worsens, income declines and satisfaction is poorer with higher body mass index. If control variables are added, estimates are split by gender and different effects of over- and underweight people are determined, the health estimates show nonlinear effects but the direction of action is unchanged. Effects on earnings differ. Underweight women earn more and overweight less than others. For normal-weight men the income is on average higher than for over- and underweight men. This is also confirmed for self-employed persons. The pattern for employees is equal to the total sample. No effects on life satisfaction can be found except for underweight men. They reveal less satisfaction. Only in the public sector the sign of the coefficient changes. The results for eastern Germany are different with respect to satisfaction. Overweight women are less satisfied than others while this is not confirmed for underweight men from eastern Germany. When interdependencies are taken into account and matching procedures are applied, the outcome matches to that of independent and unmatched estimates. However, no clear-cut disadvantage in income of underweight men can be found. Stable coefficients result for the health estimates while satisfaction results fluctuate. Underweight women and especially underweight men tend to less happiness. For overweight men the influence is ambiguous but more speaks in favour of a less level of satisfaction. Overweight women seem to be happier.
I31|Optimism, pessimism and life satisfaction: an empirical investigation|This empirical investigation into life satisfaction, using nationally representative German panel data, finds a substantial association with an individual’s thoughts about the future, whether they are optimistic or pessimistic about it. Furthermore, including individuals’ optimism and pessimism about the future substantially increases the explanatory power of standard life satisfaction models. The thoughts that individuals have about the future contribute substantially to their current life satisfaction. In particular, the reduction in life satisfaction experienced by individuals who report being pessimistic is greater than that for well-understood negative events like unemployment. These effects are attenuated but remain substantial after controlling for individual fixed effects, statistically matching on observable variables between optimistic and pessimistic individuals, and addressing the potential endogeneity of optimism and pessimism to life satisfaction. Moreover, these effects are robust to controlling for future life events that may be anticipated.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
I31|Undoing Gender with Institutions. Lessons from the German Division and Reuniﬁcation|Using the 41-year division of Germany as a natural experiment, we show that the GDR’s gender-equal institutions created a culture that has undone the male breadwinner norm and its consequences. Since reuniﬁcation, East Germany still differs from West Germany not only by a higher female contribution to household income, but also because East German women can earn more than their husbands without having to increase their number of housework hours, put their marriage at risk or withdraw from the labor market. By contrast, the norm of higher male income, and its consequences, are still prevalent in West Germany.
I31|Experienced Well-Being and Labor Market Status: The Role of Pleasure and Meaning|This paper examines experienced well-being of employed and unemployed workers. We use the survey-adapted day reconstruction method (DRM) of the Innovation Sample of the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP-IS) to analyze the role of the employment status for well-being, incorporating complete time use. Summarizing the average share of pleasurable minutes, we generate the P-index. We show that - in contrast to evaluative life satisfaction - the average unemployed experiences more pleasurable minutes due to the absence of working episodes. Hence, we examine working episodes in depth. While working is among the activities with the highest propensities for an unpleasant experience, it is also among the most meaningful activities. We show that meaning is a central non-monetary determinant for a pleasurable work episode and find that pleasure during work and job satisfaction in general have the same association with meaning.
I31|Leben in Schleswig-Holstein: subjektive Einschätzungen als Teil der Wohlfahrtsmessung|"In recent years, the debate about alternative measures of welfare (“beyond GDP”) has con-siderably gained momentum in Germany. This was the case not only on the national level: The demand for such measures has risen on the federal states level, too. For that reason, and in the context of a study whose main purpose was to calculate the Regional Welfare Index (RWI) for Schleswig-Holstein (SH), we also analyzed survey data from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for SH and – in order the compare and classify the results – for the rest of Germany. The observation period ranges from 1984 to 2014 (SOEP v31). The research topics include satisfaction (life in general/specific areas; current/anticipated), concerns, im-portance, interest for politics and feelings. The evaluation shows among other findings that… – overall life satisfaction in SH has increased significantly in recent years, – the people in SH are on average a little more satisfied than in the rest of Germany, – the trust in the future in SH reached in 2014 its highest level, – people in SH are less concerned about economic issues, but more concerned about ""peacekeeping"", ""health"" and ""environmental protection"", – social aspects are particularly important to people in SH, – the importance of social engagement in 2014 is as highly valued in SH as never be-fore, – people in SH were happier in 2014 than in the medium-term average. At the end of this contribution, the trends of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Region-al Welfare Index (RWI) and the current general life satisfaction are compared. They differ significantly from each other Die Debatte um (andere) Indikatoren zur Messung gesellschaftlicher Wohlfahrt und eines „guten Lebens“ hat in den vergangenen Jahren deutlich an Fahrt aufgenommen. Und das nicht nur auf Bundesebene. Auch auf der Ebene der Bundesländer wächst die Nachfrage nach solchen Indikatoren. Im Rahmen einer Studie zur Berechnung des Regionalen Wohlfahrtsindex (RWI) wurden deswegen auch subjektive Befragungsdaten des Sozio-Ökonomischen Panels (SOEP) für das Bundesland Schleswig-Holstein (SH) ausgewertet.1 Neben SH-spezifischen Auswertungen wurden zur Einordnung der Ergebnisse auch bundesdeutsche Werte (exkl. SH) berechnet. Betrachtet werden für den Zeitraum 1984-2014 (SOEP v31) die Bereiche Zufriedenheit (allgemein/Bereiche), Sorgen, Wichtigkeit, Interesse für Politik und Gefühle.Die Auswertungen ergeben unter anderem, dass…– die allgemeine Lebenszufriedenheit in SH in den letzten Jahren deutlich gestiegen ist;– die Menschen in SH im Durchschnitt etwas zufriedener sind als im Rest Deutschlands;– die Zukunftszuversicht in SH im Jahr 2014 Höchstwerte erreichte;– die Menschen in SH sich weniger Sorgen um wirtschaftliche Themen, dafür mehr Sorgen um „Friedenserhaltung“, „Gesundheit“ und „Umweltschutz“ machen;– den Menschen in SH soziale Aspekte besonders wichtig sind;– die Wichtigkeit von gesellschaftlichem Engagement im Jahr 2014 in SH so hoch eingeschätzt wurde wie nie;– die Menschen in SH im Jahr 2014 häufiger glücklich waren als im mittelfristigen Durchschnitt.Schließlich werden die Entwicklungen des Bruttoinlandsprodukts (BIP), des Regionalen Wohlfahrtsindex (RWI) und der allgemeinen Lebenszufriedenheit in SH für den Zeitraum 1999-2014 miteinander verglichen. Bei diesem Vergleich zeigen sich deutliche Unterschiede."
I31|Wie (in)stabil ist die Lebenszufriedenheit? Eine Sequenzanalyse mit Daten des Sozio-oekonomischen Panels (SOEP)|Die vorliegende Studie befasst sich mit der Analyse der Stabilität der Lebenszufriedenheit, auf Basis der Paneldaten des sozio-oekonomischen Panels (SOEP). Benutzt wird das neuartige Konzept der longitudinalen Entropie und so können bereits in der Literatur vorliegende Analysen zur (In)Stabilität der Lebenszufriedenheit ergänzt und vertieft werden. Es wird gezeigt, dass Persönlichkeitseigenschaften, wie Neurotizismus, Extraversion und Verträglichkeit, aber auch weitere psychologische und soziologische Variablen, wie die negative und positive Reziprozität, das Vorliegen einer Scheidungserfahrung oder eine geringe Bildung eine signifikante Wirkung auf die Stabilität der langfristigen Lebenszufriedenheit aufweisen. Dies stellt das lange Zeit herrschende, aber zunehmend kritisierte Paradigma der Set Point Theorie mit zusätzlicher Evidenz in Frage. Diese Theorie behauptet eine langfristig vorliegende Stabilität der Lebenszufriedenheit, bedingt durch die genetisch determinierte Persönlichkeit eines Menschen, seiner Erziehung und frühen Lebenserfahrungen. Es wird auch deutlich, dass weitergehende Forschung notwendig ist, um Erklärungen für mittel- und langfristige Schwankungen der Lebenszufriedenheit zu finden.
I31|The Biological Standard of Living in Urban Bolivia, 1880s – 1920s: Stagnation and Persistent Inequality|Based on almost 5.000 direct observations on National Identification Cards, this paper offers the first estimation of the evolution of average heights in urban Bolivia for the decades 1880s-1920s. The analysis focuses on men aged 19-50 years registered in the city of La Paz. Despite city’s growing economic importance and modernization, average heights remained stagnant around 163 cm. This level is not so different to that found in the still disperse available evidence for rural Bolivia. Furthermore, there is evidence of inequalities throughout the period under study: those men who were indigenous, illiterate or worked in manual occupations were persistently shorter than non-indigenous, literates and non-manual workers, respectively. In coincidence with recent studies on Latin America, these findings suggest that the boost in exports and the regained dynamism of the economy that took place at the onset of the 20th century were not accompanied by improvements in biological standards of living.
I31|Population Structure and the Human Development Index|Abstract This paper provides an alternative way of measuring human development that takes explicitly into account the differences in the countries’ population structures. The interest of this proposal stems from two complementary elements. First, that there is an enormous diversity in the population structures of those countries analysed in the Human Development Reports, particularly the shares of old people in the population. Second, that demographic characteristics are relevant in the evaluation of development possibilities. We propose to change the way of measuring health, education and material wellbeing, in order to take into account those differences in the population structures. Regarding the health component, we substitute Life Expectancy at Birth by Life Potential (the average life expectancy of the current population); concerning education, we change the average between Mean Years of Schooling and Expected Years of Schooling by the Education Potential (a variable that mimics life potential in this context). As for the material well-being, we propose using the Gross National Income per adult, instead of per capita, while keeping logs in the evaluation. The resulting indicator, called Demographically Adjusted Human Development Index, is the geometric mean of the three new variables suitably normalised. We analyse empirically the effect induced by these changes in the evaluation of human development by comparing this way of measurement with the conventional Human Development Index (HDI) for 168 countries.
I31|Retirement and Unexpected Health Shocks|Is retirement good for your health? We complement previous studies by exploring the effect of retirement on unexpected health evolution. Using panel data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey (2001-2014), we construct measures of the mismatch between individual expected and actual health evolution (hereafter “health shocks”). In our approach, reverse causation running from health shocks to retirement is highly unlikely, because we look at shocks that happen after retirement, and those shocks are, by definition, unanticipated. We find that retirement decreases the probability of negative shocks (by approximately 16% to 24% for men and 14% to 23% for women) while increasing the likelihood of positive shocks (by 9% to 14% for men and 10% to 13% for women). This result is robust to the use of different lead-lag structures and of alternative measures of health change. Our findings are thus consistent with a positive impact of retirement on health.
I31|The Causes and Consequences of Early-Adult Unemployment: Evidence from Cohort Data|We here use the employment-history data from the British Cohort Study to calculate an individual’s total experience of unemployment from the time they left school up to age 30. We show that this experience is negatively correlated with the life satisfaction that the individual reports at age 30, so that past unemployment scars. We also identify the childhood circumstances and family background that predict this adult unemployment experience. Educational achievement and good behaviour at age 16 both reduce adult unemployment experience, and emotional health at age 16 is a particularly strong predictor of unemployment experience for women. Both boys and girls reproduce on average their parents’ unemployment, so that adult unemployment experience is transmitted between generations. We uncover evidence of a social-norm effect: children from less-advantaged backgrounds both experience more adult unemployment but are less affected by it in well-being.
I31|The Future in Mind: Aspirations and Forward-Looking Behaviour in Rural Ethiopia|Poor people often do not make investments, even when returns are high. One possible explanation is that they have low aspirations and form mental models of their future opportunities which ignore some options for investment. This paper reports on a field experiment to test this hypothesis in rural Ethiopia. Individuals were randomly invited to watch documentaries about people from similar communities who had succeeded in agriculture or business, without help from government or NGOs. A placebo group watched an Ethiopian entertainment programme and a control group were simply surveyed. In addition, the number of people invited was varied by village to assess the importance of peer effects in formation of aspirations. Six months after screening, aspirations had improved among treated individuals and did not change in the placebo or control groups. Treatment effects were larger for those with higher pre-treatment aspirations. We also find treatment effects on savings, use of credit, children's school enrolment and spending on children’s schooling, suggesting that changes in aspirations can translate into changes in a range of forward-looking behaviours. There are also treatment effects on measures from psychology and sociology, including locus of control, which theory predicts should behave in similar ways to aspirations. Most effects are robust to corrections for multiple testing. Peer effects results in further impact on educational spending and induce more work and less leisure. The result that a one-hour documentary shown six months earlier induces actual behavioural change suggests a challenging, promising avenue for further research and poverty-related interventions.
I31|Social Shock Sharing and Stochastic Dominance|Since the seminal paper of Atkinson and Bourguignon (1982), little decisive progress has been achieved in developing empirically efficient stochastic dominance criteria for multidimensional social welfare analysis. By proposing new axioms of 'Social Shock Sharing', this paper provides new intuitive justifications to imposing sign restrictions on partial derivatives of individual von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions. These new breakthrough findings are exploited to derive necessary and sufficient stochastic dominance criteria for multidimensional social welfare comparisons, up to the sixth order, at least. Equivalent results are derived in terms of multidimensional poverty conditions. Empirically powerful discriminatory criteria are obtained by combining all social shock sharing axioms up to some high order and by deriving a dimension reduction property. An application to Egypt at the beginning of the XXIst century demonstrates the practical substantial gain in discriminating power of the approach by revealing a unambiguous continual improvement in bivariate income-education social welfare over the studied period.
I31|Gender Differences in Competitiveness: Experimental Evidence from China|Experimental evidence from both the lab and the field shows that women on average have a lower propensity to enter a competitive environment. In this paper, we investigate gender differences in competitiveness using a lab-in-the-field experiment and a subject pool consisting of Chinese adults. China provides an interesting environment to study in this regard since the country has promoted gender equality for a long time and the gender gap in earnings is small in a cross-country comparison. However, in many respects, China is still a patriarchal society. Our experimental results show that women perform equally well as men in a piece-rate task and significantly better in a competitive payment environment. Despite this, men are more than twice as likely to voluntarily choose a competitive environment. This gender difference cannot be explained by differences in risk preferences or overconfidence.
I31|When Dad Can Stay Home: Fathers’ Workplace Flexibility and Maternal Health|While workplace ﬂexibility is perceived to be a key determinant of maternal labor supply, less is known about fathers’demand for ﬂexibility or about intra-household spillover eﬀects of ﬂexibility initiatives. This paper examines these issues in the context of a critical period in family life—the months immediately following childbirth—and identiﬁes the impacts of paternal access to workplace ﬂexibility on maternal postpartum health. We model household demand for paternal presence at home as a function of domestic stochastic shocks, and use variation from a Swedish reform that granted new fathers more ﬂexibility to take intermittent parental leave during the postpartum period in a regression discontinuity diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences (RD-DD) design. We ﬁnd that increasing the father’s temporal ﬂexibility reduces the risk of the mother experiencing physical postpartum health complications and improves her mental health. Our results suggest that mothers bear the burden from a lack of workplace ﬂexibility—not only directly through greater career costs of family formation, as previously documented—but also indirectly, as fathers’ inability to respond to domestic shocks exacerbates the maternal health costs of childbearing.
I31|New ways to measure well-being? A first joint analysis of subjective and objective measures|Our study is, to our knowledge, the first joint analysis of subjective and objective measures of well-being. Using a rich longitudinal data from the mothers pregnancy until adulthood for a birth cohort of children who attended school in Örebro during the 1960s, we analyse in a first step how subjective (self-assessed) and objective (cortisol-based) measures of well-being are related to each other. In a second step, life-course models for these two measures are estimated and compared with each other. Despite the fact that our analysis is largely exploratory, our results suggest interesting possibilities to use objective measures to measure well-being, even though this may imply a greater degree of complexity.
I31|Presidential Elections, Divided Politics, and Happiness in the U.S|We examine the effects of the 2016 and 2012 U.S. presidential election outcomes on the subjective well-being of Democrats and Republicans using large-scale Gallup survey data and a regression discontinuity approach. We use metrics that capture two dimensions of well-being – evaluative (life satisfaction) and hedonic (positive and negative affect) – and document a significant negative impact on both dimensions of well-being for Democrats immediately following the 2016 election and a negative but much smaller impact for Republicans following the 2012 election. However, we found no equivalent positive effect for those identifying with the winning party following either election. The results also vary across gender and income groups, especially in 2016, with the negative well-being effects more prevalent among women and middle-income households. In addition, in 2016 the votes of others living in the respondent’s county did not have a large impact on individual well-being, although there is some suggestive evidence that Democrats in more pro-Trump counties suffered a less negative effect, while Republicans in less pro-Trump and more typically urban counties were actually negatively impacted by the election outcome. We also find evidence that being on the losing side of the election had negative effects on perceptions about the economy, financial well-being, and the community of residence. Lastly, the evaluative well-being gaps between the different party affiliations tend to persist longer, with those in expected life satisfaction lasting until at least the end of 2016, while the hedonic well-being gaps typically dissipate within the two weeks following the election.
I31|Men without work: Why are they so unhappy in the US compared to other places?|The global economy is full of paradoxes. Despite progress in technology, reducing poverty, and increasing life expectancy, the poorest states lag behind, and there is increasing inequality and anomie in the wealthiest ones. A key driver of such unhappiness in advanced countries is the decline in the status and wages of low-skilled labor. A related feature is the increase in prime-aged males (and to a lesser extent women) simply dropping out of the labor force, particularly in the U.S. This same group is over-represented in the “deaths of despair.” There is frustration among this same cohort in Europe and it is reflected in voting trends in both contexts. Prime-aged males out of the labor force in the U.S. are the least hopeful and most stressed and angry compared to the same group in other regions, including the Middle East. Our aim is to better understand this cohort as part of a broader need to rethink our growth models and to explore policies that encourage the participation of able workers in the new global economy and can provide incentives for community involvement and other forms of engagement for those who can no longer work.
I31|Effects of Maternal Work Incentives on Adolescent Social Behaviors|This study exploits variations in the timing of welfare reform implementation in the U.S. in the 1990s to identify plausibly causal effects of welfare reform on a range of social behaviors of the next generation as they transition to adulthood. We focus on behaviors that are important for socioeconomic and health trajectories, estimate effects by gender, and explore potentially mediating factors. Welfare reform had no favorable effects on any of the youth behaviors examined and led to decreased volunteering among girls, increases in skipping school, damaging property, and fighting among boys, and increases in smoking and drug use among both boys and girls, with larger effects for boys (e.g., ~6% for boys compared to 4% for girls for any substance use). Maternal employment, supervision, and child’s employment explain little of the effects. Overall, the intergenerational effects of welfare reform on adolescent behaviors were unfavorable, particularly for boys, and do not support longstanding arguments that limiting cash assistance leads to responsible behavior in the next generation. As such, the favorable effects of welfare reform for women may have come at a cost to the next generation, particularly to boys who have been falling behind girls in high school completion for decades.
I31|Child Socio-Emotional Skills: The Role of Parental Inputs|Informed by the psychological literature and our empirical evidence we provide new insights into the technology of socio-emotional skill formation in middle childhood. In line with economic evidence, increasing parental inputs that enrich the child home environment and reduce stress has larger returns for children with higher socio-emotional skills in early childhood (complementarity), but only for levels of inputs that are high. For low levels of inputs, i.e. levels implying a stressful home environment, an increase has a higher return for children with lower socio-emotional skills in early childhood (substitutability). Consequently, well targeted policies can reduce middle childhood socio-emotional gaps.
I31|Inequality and Welfare Dynamics in the Russian Federation during 1994-2015|The Russian Federation offers the unique example of a leading centrally planned economy swiftly transforming itself into a market-oriented economy. This paper offers a comprehensive study of inequality and mobility patterns for Russia, using multiple rounds of the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Surveys over the past two decades spanning this transition. The findings show rising income levels and decreasing inequality, with the latter being mostly caused by pro-poor growth rather than redistribution. The poorest tercile experienced a growth rate that was more than 10 times that of the richest tercile, leading to less long-term inequality than short-term inequality. The analysis also finds that switching from a part-time job to a full-time job, from a lower-skill job to a higher-skill job, or staying in the formal sector is statistically significantly associated with reduced downward mobility and increased income growth. However, a similar transition from the private sector to the public sector is negatively associated with income growth.
I31|The curvature properties of social welfare functions|This paper characterizes the curvature properties of applied social welfare functions. We choose as an example a general and non-abbreviated social welfare function introduced by Jorgenson and Slesnick (1983) that is frequently used in empirical work. We investigate the regularity of social preferences necessary to maximize social welfare with respect to prices and to guarantee that the social welfare function is well-behaved and suitable for theoretically plausible microsimulations. We use the notion of generalized convexity to define the necessary conditions for the social welfare function to be convex with respect to prices.
I31|The dimension, nature and distribution of economic insecurity in European countries: A multidimensional approach|Economic insecurity is a key well-being outcome because the anticipation of future economic distress reveals itself as a true threat to current well-being. Insecurity has been shown to affect quality of life and to change an individual’s consumption, fertility, labor supply and even political support decisions to mitigate risk. This paper provides evidence on the dimension, nature and distribution of economic insecurity for 27 EU countries during a whole decade by using a multidimensional individual approach that considers both objective and subjective indicators. The young, the less educated and the unemployed living in households with dependent children have significantly higher levels of economic insecurity everywhere. However, insecurity affects the population in the middle-class only in some countries but not in others, and the level of insecurity in liberal regimes is more linked to large income losses than elsewhere. The role of objective versus subjective dimensions is larger in post-transition Eastern European regimes than in longstanding capitalist countries.

I31|The Role of Body Weight for Health, Earnings and Life Satisfaction|Based on the German Socio-Economic Panel, the influence of the body mass index on health, earnings and satisfaction is analysed by gender. Basic results are: health worsens, income declines and satisfaction is poorer with higher body mass index. If control variables are added, estimates are split by gender and different effects of over- and underweight people are determined, the health estimates show nonlinear effects but the direction of action is unchanged. Effects on earnings differ. Underweight women earn more and overweight less than others. For normal-weight men the income is on average higher than for over- and underweight men. This is also confirmed for self-employed persons. The pattern for employees is equal to the total sample. No effects on life satisfaction can be found except for underweight men. They reveal less satisfaction. Only in the public sector the sign of the coefficient changes. The results for eastern Germany are different with respect to satisfaction. Overweight women are less satisfied than others while this is not confirmed for underweight men from eastern Germany. When interdependencies are taken into account and matching procedures are applied, the outcome matches to that of independent and unmatched estimates. However, no clear-cut disadvantage in income of underweight men can be found. Stable coefficients result for the health estimates while satisfaction results fluctuate. Underweight women and especially underweight men tend to less happiness. For overweight men the influence is ambiguous but more speaks in favour of a less level of satisfaction. Overweight women seem to be happier.
I31|Parental Child Care Time, Income and Subjective Well-Being: A Multidimensional Polarization Approach for Germany|Neither market income nor consumption expenditure provides an adequate picture of individual standard of living. It is time which enables and restricts individual activities and is a further brick to a more comprehensive picture of individual well-being. In our study we focus on a prominent part of time use in non-market services: it is parental child care which contributes not only to individual but also to societal well-being. Within a novel approach we ask for multidimensional polarization effects of parental child care where compensation/substitution of time for parental child care versus income is interdependently evaluated by panel estimates of society's subjective well-being. The new interdependent 2DGAP measure thereby provides multidimensional polarization intensity information for the poor and the rich and disentangles the single time and income contribution to subjective well-being for targeted policies ensuring at the same time the interdependence of the polarization dimensions. Socio-economic influences on the polarization pole risk and intensity will be quantified by two stage Heckman estimates. The analyses are based on the German Socio-Economic Panel with 21 waves and robust fixed effects estimates as well as the German Time Use Surveys 1991/92 and actual 2012/13 with detailed diary time use data. Prominent result: compensation between parental child care time and income proved to be significant, but there are multidimensional regions with no compensation, where parental child care time deficit is not compensated by income. Interdependent multidimensional polarization by headcount and intensity increased significantly over the twenty years under investigation with remarkable risk and intensity differences.
I31|Have Econometric Analyses of Happiness Data Been Futile? A Simple Truth About Happiness Scales|Econometric analyses in the happiness literature typically use subjective well-being (SWB) data to compare the mean of observed or latent happiness across samples. Recent critiques show that comparing the mean of ordinal data is only valid under strong assumptions that are usually rejected by SWB data. This leads to an open question whether much of the empirical studies in the economics of happiness literature have been futile. In order to salvage some of the prior results and avoid future issues, we suggest regression analysis of SWB (and other ordinal data) should focus on the median rather than the mean. Median comparisons using parametric models such as the ordered probit and logit can be readily carried out using familiar statistical softwares like STATA. We also show a previously assumed impractical task of estimating a semiparametric median ordered-response model is also possible by using a novel constrained mixed integer optimization technique. We use GSS data to show the famous Easterlin Paradox from the happiness literature holds for the US independent of any parametric assumption.
I31|The Impact of Bullying Victimisation on Mental Wellbeing|We investigate the impact of nine types of adolescent (verbal, physical, indirect) school/domestic bullying on life satisfaction, and two mental health outcomes (emotional symptoms and hyperactivity/inattention) using the Understanding Society dataset during 2009-13. Bullying significantly increases hyperactive, inattentive and emotional symptoms and reduces life satisfaction. Non-domestic bullying has a stronger adverse impact on all three mental wellbeing outcomes. Domestic sibling victimisation does not affect life satisfaction. Lower levels of family income increase adolescent hyperactive/inattentive symptoms and reduce life satisfaction. Females are more vulnerable to emotional symptoms while males report higher levels of life satisfaction. Initial conditions precondition hyperactive and inattentive symptoms.
I31|Effects of Maternal Work Incentives on Adolescent Social Behaviors|This study investigates the effects of welfare reform in the U.S. in the 1990s, which dramatically limited cash assistance for low-income families, on the next generation as they transition to adulthood. We estimate effects by gender and focus on behaviors that are important for socioeconomic and health trajectories and represent early observable consequences of the reforms for the next generation. Using two nationally-representative datasets, we exploit differences in welfare reform implementation across states and over time in a difference-in-difference-in-differences framework to identify plausibly causal effects of welfare reform on a range of prosocial and antisocial behaviors (volunteering, participating in clubs/teams/activities, skipping school, getting into fights, damaging property, stealing, hurting others, smoking, using alcohol, using marijuana, using other illicit drugs). We explore maternal employment, supervision, and child's employment when not in school as potential mediators. We find that: (1) Welfare reform had no favorable effects on any of the youth behaviors examined. (2) Welfare reform led to a decrease in volunteering among girls. (3) Welfare reform led to increases in skipping school, damaging property, and getting into fights among boys. (4) Welfare reform led to increases in smoking and drug use among both boys and girls, with generally larger effects for boys (e.g., approximately 6% for boys compared to 4% for girls for any substance use). (5) The mediators we are able to consider explain little of the observed effects of welfare reform. Overall, the results from this study suggest that the intergenerational effects of welfare reform on adolescent behaviors were unfavorable, particularly for boys, and do not support longstanding arguments that incentivizing maternal employment by limiting cash assistance leads to responsible behavior in the next generation. As such, the social gains of welfare reform for women found in previous studies may have come at a cost to the next generation, particularly to boys who have been falling behind girls in terms of high school completion for decades.
I31|Undoing Gender with Institutions. Lessons from the German Division and Reunification|"Social scientists have provided empirical evidence that ""gender trumps money"", meaning that gender norms can be more powerful than economic rationality in shaping daily arrangements between spouses. In particular, when they deviate from the ""male breadwinner"" norm, women react by ""doing gender"", i.e. overplaying their feminine role by increasing the number of housework hours that they accomplish. The risk of divorce also increases when a woman earns more than her husband. This paper shows that, however powerful, these norms are cultural and can be trumped by institutions. We use the 41-year division of Germany as a natural experiment and look at differences between East and West Lander in terms of gender behavior after the German reunification. As most countries of the socialist bloc, the former GDR had designed institutions that were much more gender equalizing than their counterpart in the former FRG. We show that these institutions have created a culture that keeps inuencing behavior up to the current period. In particular, East Germany differs from West Germany in the sense that a woman can earn more than her husband without ""doing gender"" and without putting her marriage at risk."
I31|The Effects of Exposure to Air Pollution on Subjective Well-being in China|This paper studies the impact of six main air pollutants on three key dimensions of subjective well-being (SWB) â€“ life satisfaction, hedonic happiness and mental health. We match a nationally representative survey in China with local air quality and rich weather conditions according to the exact date and county of each interview. By making use of variations in exposures to air pollution across similar respondents living in the same county, we find that PM2.5 reduces hedonic happiness and increases the rate of depressive symptoms, but does not affect life satisfaction. Our results show that the benefits of reducing air pollution would be higher if the hidden costs of air pollution on SWB in China are taken into account.
I31|Types of Institutions and Well-Being of Self-Employed and Paid Employees in Europe|This paper analyzes the role of different types of institutions, such as entre- preneurship-facilitating entry conditions, labor market regulations, quality of government, and perception of corruption for individual well-being among self-employed and paid employed individuals. Well-being is operationalized by job and life satisfaction of individuals in 32 European countries measured by data from EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). We find that institutions never affected both occupational groups in opposite ways. Our findings indicate that labor market institutions do not play an im- portant role well-being. The results suggest that fostering an entrepreneurial society in Europe is a welfare enhancing strategy that benefits both, the self- employed and paid employees.
I31|An Analysis of Beverage Size Restrictions|"Due to high levels of obesity, various government interventions have been proposed to curb the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). The New York City ""soda-ban,"" which proposed to limit the size of SSBs is among the most well-known and controversial. While public debates about beverage-size-restrictions tend to focus on how consumers are impacted, we use a nonlinear pricing model to show that, for all but extremely tight restrictions, consumer welfare would be unaffected by an enforceable restriction. However, sellers' profit would decline. While consumption is predicted to decline overall, the magnitude of the decline will vary by consumer segment."
I31|When Dad Can Stay Home: Fathers' Workplace Flexibility and Maternal Health|While workplace flexibility is perceived to be a key determinant of maternal labor supply, less is known about fathers' demand for flexibility or about intra-household spillover effects of flexibility initiatives. This paper examines these issues in the context of a critical period in family life — the months immediately following childbirth — and identifies the impacts of paternal access to workplace flexibility on maternal postpartum health. We model household demand for paternal presence at home as a function of domestic stochastic shocks, and use variation from a Swedish reform that granted new fathers more flexibility to take intermittent parental leave during the postpartum period in a regression discontinuity difference-in-differences (RD-DD) design. We find that increasing the father's temporal flexibility reduces the risk of the mother experiencing physical postpartum health complications and improves her mental health. Our results suggest that mothers bear the burden from a lack of workplace flexibility — not only directly through greater career costs of family formation, as previously documented — but also indirectly, as fathers' inability to respond to domestic shocks exacerbates the maternal health costs of childbearing.
I31|Child Socio-Emotional Skills: The Role of Parental Inputs|Informed by the psychological literature and our empirical evidence we provide new insights into the technology of socio-emotional skill formation in middle childhood. In line with economic evidence, increasing parental inputs that enrich the child home environment and reduce stress has larger returns for children with higher socio-emotional skills in early childhood (complementarity), but only for levels of inputs that are high. For low levels of inputs, i.e. levels implying a stressful home environment, an increase has a higher return for children with lower socio-emotional skills in early childhood (substitutability). Consequently, well targeted policies can reduce middle childhood socio-emotional gaps.
I31|Three Revolutions of the Modern Era|The emergence and evolution of modern science since the 17th century has led to three major breakthroughs in the human condition. The first, the Industrial Revolution, started in the late 18th century and is based chiefly on developments associated with the rise of the natural sciences. The second, the Demographic Revolution, began in the latter half of the 19th century and is largely the result of progress in the life sciences. The third is a Happiness Revolution that commenced in the late 20th century and is the outgrowth of the social sciences. The first two revolutions, both familiar concepts, are summarized briefly; this paper develops the rationale for the third, the Happiness Revolution. It also notes the implications of this perspective for the interpretation of international cross-section studies.
I31|The Impact of High-Performance Work Systems on Employees: A Sectoral Comparison|Using nationally representative linked employer-employee surveys of workplaces with 50 or more employees we find the adoption of High-Performance Work Systems (HPWS) in the private sector is largely positively correlated with employee job attitudes pre-recession. However, high intensity HPWS has partly adverse consequences for private sector employees in the post-recession period. In contrast, there are no indications of public sector employees responding positively or negatively to HPWS and HPWS is not associated with adverse effects post-recession. The sectoral difference in results is interpreted in terms of different employment relationships and different sources of employee motivation.
I31|Does It Pay to Bet on Your Favourite to Win? Evidence on Experienced Utility from the 2018 FIFA World Cup Experiment|This paper examined whether people gained significant emotional benefits from not engaging in emotional hedging – betting against the occurrence of desired outcomes. Using the 2018 FIFA World Cup as the setting for a lab-in-the-field experiment, we found substantial reluctance among England supporters to bet against the success of the England football team in the tournament. This decision not to offset a potential loss through hedging did not pay off in people's happiness following an England win. It was, however, associated with a sharp decrease in people's happiness following an England loss. Post-match happiness is relatively more stable among those who chose to hedge or were randomly allocated to hedge. We conclude that people do not hedge enough partly because they tend to overestimate the expected diagnostic cost of betting against their social identity, while underestimate the negative emotional impact from betting on their favourite to win when they did not win.
I31|Happiness and Public Policy: A Procedural Perspective|This article comments on the role of empirical subjective well-being research in public policy within a constitutional, procedural perspective of government and state. It rejects the idea that, based on the promises of the measurement, we should adopt a new policy perspective that is oriented towards a decision rule maximizing some aggregate measure of subjective well-being. This social engineering perspective, implicit in much reasoning about well-being policy, neglects i) important motivation problems on the part of government actors, such as incentives to manipulate indicators, but also on the part of citizens to truthfully report their well-being, and ii) procedural utility as a source of well-being. Instead, well-being research should be oriented towards gaining insights that improve the diagnoses of societal problems and help to evaluate alternative institutional arrangements to address them, both as inputs into the democratic process.
I31|Who Cares When You Close Down? The Effects of Primary Care Practice Closures on Patients|This paper investigates the consequences that patients face when their regular primary care provider closes down her practice, typically due to retirement. We estimate the causal impact of closures on patients’ utilization patterns, medical expenditures, hospitalizations, and health plan choice. Employing a difference-in-difference framework, we find that patients who experience a discontinuity of care persistently adjust their utilization pattern by shifting visits away from ambulatory primary care providers (-12%) towards specialist care (+10%), and hospital outpatient facilities (+5%). The magnitude of these effects depends considerably on the local availability of primary care. We also observe that patients with chronic conditions shift their utilization more strongly towards other providers. Our results have potential implications for health policy in at least two dimensions: practice closures may lead to an inefficient use of healthcare services and deteriorate access to primary care, particularly in regions where the supply of primary care doctors is low.
I31|El futuro verde de la electricidad: los casos de Uruguay y la Unión Europea<BR>[The green future of electicity: the cases of Uruguay and the European Union]|El objetivo de este trabajo es entender los cambios de política y regulación en Uruguay y la Unión Europea que llevaron a la adopción de fuentes de energía renovable no convencionales en un corto período de tiempo. Uruguay es uno de los 3 países del mundo con más del 90% de la electricidad proveniente de fuentes renovables (98% en Uruguay) y donde las renovables no convencionales aportan una contribución significativa. Uruguay también ha lanzado recientemente la primera ruta eléctrica de América Latina, con 500 km y estaciones de carga a intervalos de 60 km. La Unión Europea es una referencia internacional en la promoción del crecimiento económico sostenible y del desarrollo sostenible. Por lo tanto, también examinaremos la experiencia de la Unión Europea en el desarrollo de una agenda verde en la que las fuentes de energía renovables son una parte fundamental.
I31|Grandparents, Mothers, or Fathers? Why Children of Teen Mothers do Worse in Life|Women who give birth as teens have worse subsequent educational and labor market outcomes than women who have first births at older ages. However, previous research has attributed much of these effects to selection rather than a causal effect of teen childbearing. Despite this, there are still reasons to believe that children of teen mothers may do worse as their mothers may be less mature, have fewer financial resources when the child is young, and may partner with fathers of lower quality. Using Norwegian register data, we compare outcomes of children of sisters who have first births at different ages. Our evidence suggests that the causal effect of being a child of a teen mother is much smaller than that implied by the cross-sectional differences but that there are still significant long-term, adverse consequences, especially for children born to the youngest teen mothers. Unlike previous research, we have information on fathers and find that negative selection of fathers of children born to teen mothers plays an important role in producing inferior child outcomes. These effects are particularly large for mothers from higher socio-economic groups.
I31|Parental Leave and Life Satisfaction: The Dutch case|There is extensive literature on ambiguous effects of having children on life satisfaction. Although parenthood can provide a meaning of life, parenting may increase the amount of obligations and decrease leisure time, which in turn reduce life satisfaction. In the Netherlands, parental leave is a part-time work arrangement which allows parents with young children to reconcile better work and family commitments. Using data from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS), we analyzed the impact of taking parental leave on the life satisfaction of parents with young children. We found that the legal framework of Dutch parental leave offering job protected leave and fiscal benefits is crucial to enhance parents’ life satisfaction. Further, we estimated that short parental leave schemes are more conducive to life satisfaction than long parental leave schemes.
I31|Inflation, Unemployment and Happiness: empirical evidences of the contribution of Economic Growth|This paper improves the understanding of the trade-off between inflation and unemployment and its impact on Subjective Well-Being (SWB), considering the role of the (Growth Domestic Product) GDP Growth and the issue of heterogeneity/nonlinearity. Effects on SWB depends on the spread between observed and potential GDP growth. The results point out country heterogeneity and nonlinearity of the marginal effects of macroeconomic variables on SWB. Economic growth moderates the relationship between unemployment as well as inflation and SWB. Both unemployment and GDP per capita growth rates have an important impact on Europeans’ SWB. Fostering economic growth must be one of the priorities of European policy.
I31|A Social Cure for Social Comparisons|Social comparisons have severe negative consequences for happiness, health, and economic decisions. Is there a remedy? Some research suggests that social comparisons are intrinsic human characteristics rooted in the biology of the brain. We offer a different view based on approximately half a million interviews from nationally representative surveys. Specifically, we assess whether people with thriving social lives suffer less from social comparisons than others. Controlling for demographic factors, we find that isolated people are more likely to be concerned about whether they earn more or less than others. Conversely, the well-being of individuals with rich social lives does not depend on keeping up with the Joneses. This result is reflected at the country level: in countries that are socially flourishing, the differences in well-being between income groups are small, which is a consequence of the relatively small impact of income comparisons on well-being. This evidence suggests that social relations can be a cure for social comparisons. We discuss a few policies to promote social relations, relating to education reform, urban planning, and advertising regulation.
I31|Homeownership Investment and Tax Neutrality. A joint assessment of income and property taxes in Europe|Western countries’ income tax system exempts the return from investing in owner-occupied housing. Returns from other investments are instead taxed, thus distorting households’ portfolio choices, although it is argued that housing property taxation might act as a counterbalance. Based on data drawn from the Statistics of Income and Living Conditions and the UK Family Resources Survey, and building on tax benefit model EUROMOD, we provide novel evidence on the interplay of income and property taxation in budgetary, efficiency and equity terms in eight European countries. Results reveal that, even accounting for recurrent housing property taxation, a sizeable ‘homeownership bias’ i.e. a lighter average and marginal taxation for homeownership investment, is embedded in current tax systems, and displays heterogeneous distributional profiles across different countries. Housing property taxation represents only a partial correction towards neutrality.
I31|Occupational Achievements of Same-Sex Couples in the U.S. by Gender and Race|Using the 2010-2014 5-year sample of the American Community Survey, this paper investigates the roles that sexual orientation, gender, and race/ethnicity play in explaining occupational achievements and earnings. By combining the approach of Del Río and Alonso-Villar (2015) with the counterfactual method of DiNardo et al. (1996) and Gradín (2013), the authors offer a framework that allows for the simultaneous comparison of all sexual orientation–gender–race/ethnicity groups whereas controlling for characteristics. The analysis suggests that occupations matter in explaining earnings differences among groups. The sexual orientation wage premium of lesbians is quite small for blacks and much higher for Hispanics and Asians than for whites. The high magnitude of the gender wage gap in an intersectional framework is also displayed. For men, departing from the white heterosexual model involves a substantial punishment; the racial penalty is larger for heterosexuals whereas the sexual orientation penalty is greater for whites.
I31|Sustainability and Wellbeing: A Text Analysis of New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, Official Yearbooks and Ministerial Documents|Recent advances in natural language processing and semantic analysis methods are enabling scholars to analyse text extensively. These techniques have not only minimized the margins of error arising from missing data from a traditionally conducted discourse analysis but also permitted reproducibility of research results. In this paper, we use several text analysis methods to analyse the evolution of the terms ‘sustainability’ and ‘wellbeing’ (SaW) from parliamentary debates (Hansard), New Zealand Official Yearbooks (NZOYBs) and ministerial documents over 125 years. The term ‘welfare’ has existed in the NZOYBs and Hansard text since the start of our analysis (1893), with a steadily increasing trend until the mid-1980s. The term ‘wellbeing’ gained momentum in mid-1930s and has been linked strongly with ‘sustainability’ in the following decades. Our analysis re-emphasizes the importance of the Brundtland Report (‘Our Common Future’) which acted as a catalyst to the sustainable movement in late 1980s. ‘Sustainability’ and ‘wellbeing’ then began to appear in conjunction. Our analysis includes the finding that SaW differ significantly when political parties are considered.
I31|Subjective Well-being and Peaceful Uprisings|This study analyzes whether subjective well-being measures can explain variation in peaceful uprisings, in addition to the objective measures typically used in analyses of uprisings. Using a database combining data on uprisings and subjective well-being for 118 countries over the period 2007 to 2014, we find evidence of a positive effect of life dissatisfaction on the incidence of peaceful uprising, but not its violent counterpart. This effect does not depend on the type of political regime, nor the stage of development and reflects, to a large extent, changes to perceived satisfaction with living standards and the ability to have a purposeful and meaningful life.
I31|Are they coming for us? Industrial robots and the mental health of workers|We investigate how an increase in the robot intensity (the ratio of industrial robots over employment) affects the self-reported mental health of workers in Germany. To do so, we combine individual mental health data from the German Socioeconomic Panel with the deliveries of robots to 21 German manufacturing sectors provided by the International Federation of Robotics for the period 2002-2014 (every two years). Controlling for a range of individual and sectoral characteristics, and employing individual-, time- and sectoral fixed effects, we find that an increase in robot intensity of 10% is associated with an average decrease of 0.59% of the average mental health standard deviation. This suggests that in a fast automating sector (i.e. rubber and plastics), where the robot intensity increased by approximately 2000%, mental health would have decreased by 118% of one standard deviation. This effect seems to be driven by job security fears of individuals working in noninteractive jobs and the fear of a decline in an individual's economic situation. Moreover, further sample divisions into low, middle and high occupational groups shows that the negative effects are affecting mostly the middle-level occupational group. Splitting the sample according to different age groups shows that the mental health of younger workers is the most vulnerable to an increase in automation. Results are also robust to instrumenting the stock of robots, and to different changes in the sample.
I31|The effect of immigration on natives’ well-being in the European Union|Immigration is one of the most debated topics in Europe today, yet little is known about the overall effect of its multiple impacts. The analysis suggests natives need not worry. Increasing immigrant population shares have no statistically significant effects on natives’ well-being in 28 European Union countries over the years 1990- 2017 (EU12) and 2005-2017 (new member states) using macro data aggregated from Eurobarometer surveys. Immigration does not statistically affect natives’ well-being across all scenarios, such as: when observing the raw data or accounting for reverse causality and omitted variables using instrumental variable methods; accounting for whether or not immigrants are from the EU; and for population subgroups, notably the poorly educated and elderly. Refugees also do not statistically affect the well-being of natives. Any negative relations that are observed are not statistically significant and exhibit small magnitudes.
I31|‘More Children, More Happiness?’: New Evidence from Elderly Parents in China|In this paper, we test the conventional wisdom in developing countries of ‘more children, more happiness’ by exploiting the cohort and provincial variations of elderly parents exposed to the one-child policy in China. Using nationally representative survey data from the 2015 China Health and Retirement Longitude Survey, the results from both the ordinary least square and two-stage least square methods find that more children can enhance elderly parents’ subjective well-being (SWB) measured with either life satisfaction or depression mood. The effect is channelled by raising their satisfaction with children and receiving in-kind transfers from children. The heterogeneity analysis also shows that the effect of children on parents’ life satisfaction is heterogenous to sex composition, first-birth gender, and parents' age. Our study provides new causal evidence of the impact of fertility on elderly parents’ SWB from a developing economy.
I31|Labor market policy and subjective well-being during the Great Recession|Average subjective well-being decreased in Europe during the Great Recession, primarily among people with less than a college education and people younger than retirement age. However, some countries fared better than others depending on their labor market policies. More generous unemployment support, which provided income replacement or programs to assist unemployed workers find jobs, mitigated the negative effects for most of the population, although not youth. In contrast, stricter employment protection legislation exacerbated the negative effects. We present further evidence that suggests the exacerbating effects of employment protection legislation are due to greater rigidities in the labor market, which in turn affect perceived future job prospects. Our analysis is based on two-stage least squares regressions using individual subjective wellbeing data obtained from Eurobarometer surveys and variation in labor market policy across 23 European countries.
I31|Can Women's Self-Help Groups Contribute to Sustainable Development ? Evidence of Capability Changes from Northern India|This paper investigates a women's self-help group program with more than 1.5 million participants in one of the poorest rural areas of Northern India. The program has four streams of activity in micro-savings, agricultural enterprise training, health and nutrition education, and political participation. The paper considers whether there is any evidence that program membership is associated with quality of life improvement. Using new data on a variety of self-reported capability indicators from members and non-members, the paper estimates propensity score matching models and reports evidence of differences in some dimensions as well as significant benefits to those from the most disadvantaged groups?scheduled castes and tribes. The paper considers robustness and concludes that for some dimensions, there is evidence that the program has contributed to sustainable development through improvements in the quality of life.
I31|Depression in the House: The Effects of Household Air Pollution from Solid Fuel Use in China|While adverse health effects of ambient air pollution have been well documented, there is scarce evidence on the impact of household air pollution (HAP) on mental health. We investigated the causal link between HAP exposure from the use of solid fuel on depressive symptoms using a nationally representative dataset of middle-aged and older population in China. Employing the propensity match score method (PSM), matching and adjusting for potential confounders, we found significantly higher Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score and risk of depressive symptoms among solid fuel users than clean fuel users. These associations were especially stronger for older females who were less educated, of lower income, of higher body mass index, or had chronic diseases.
I31|Does microfinance have an impact on borrower's consumption patterns and women's empowerment?|This paper conducts a thorough data analysis using cross-sectional data from a study carried out in Mexico including over 16,500 observations. In the study, clusters were selected in areas Compartamos Banco, a Microfinance institution (MFI), has not lent in before. The clusters were randomly assigned to either the treatment or the control group. The analysis suggests that Microfinance has a significant positive effect on school and food expenditure but no apparent effect on entrepreneurship. Using regression analysis, a significant positive effect on women's empowerment and its positive effect on total consumption is found.
I31|Mieten, Modernisierung und Mieterstruktur - Vermietergruppen in Großstädten im Vergleich: Eine Analyse auf Basis des Sozio-oekonomischen Panels|Angesichts stetig steigender Mieten in den Großstädten stehen zunehmend Vermieter im Fokus öffentlicher und politischer Diskussionen. Selbst eine Enteignung großer privater Wohnungsgesellschaften in Berlin wird mittlerweile von einer Bürgerinitiative gefordert. Durch die Überführung der Unternehmen in staatliches Eigentum erwarten sich die Initiatoren geringere Mietpreisdynamiken und weniger kostentreibende Modernisierungen. In dieser Studie, die auf Daten des Sozio-oekonomischen Panels beruht, wurden Vermietergruppen in den Großstädten mit mehr als 500.000 Einwohnern miteinander verglichen. Bezogen auf den subjektiven Renovierungsbedarf und das Modernisierungsverhalten sind keine wesentlichen Unterschiede zwischen kommunalen, genossenschaftlichen und privaten Wohnungen erkennbar. Sowohl bei kommunalen als auch privaten Wohnungsgesellschaften sehen rund 40 Prozent der Mieter Handlungsbedarf, wobei 10 Prozent der Mieter kommunaler Wohnungsgesellschaften ihre Wohnungen sogar als vollständig renovierungsbedürftig ansehen - deutlich mehr als bei den anderen Wohnungsgesellschaften. Vergleichbar ist auch die Zahl der durchgeführten Modernisierungen, und auch bezüglich der Zufriedenheit der Mieter gibt es kaum Unterschiede. Lediglich am aktuellen Rand hat die Zufriedenheit der Mieter kommunaler Wohnungen etwas zugenommen, bei den übrigen Vermietergruppen sind die Werte seit 2013 relativ konstant. Unterschiede gibt es aber bei der Mietpreisdynamik. Während die Mieten in kommunalen Wohnungen seit 2013 kaum und bei Genossenschaften sehr moderat gestiegen sind, gab es starke Mietpreiszuwächse bei privaten Eigentümern und vor allem Wohnungsunternehmen. Private Vermieter reagieren daher stärker auf die anhaltende Wohnungsknappheit und die daraus resultierende stärkere Konkurrenz um Wohnungen. Aus dieser Perspektive ist es verständlich, dass Mieter sich von einem kommunalen / öffentlichen Eigentümer ein geringeres Mietpreiswachstum versprechen. Aus Sicht der Gesellschaft sind mit unterlassenen Mietpreissteigerungen aber Einnahmeverluste verbunden, was u. a. die Finanzierung von Sozialprogrammen oder Infrastruktur erschwert. Sozialpolitisch ist es daher wichtig zu prüfen, wer die Nutznießer sind. Im Fall der privaten Wohnungsunternehmen zeigt sich, dass 57 Prozent der Mieter über mehr als 80 Prozent des Median-Einkommens verfügen und 44 Prozent sogar mehr als 100 Prozent. Die unterlassenen Mietsteigerungen würden damit zu einem wesentlichen Teil Haushalten zu Gute kommen, die ansonsten keinen Rechtsanspruch und auch keinen Bedarf an staatlicher Unterstützung haben. Berücksichtigt man darüber hinaus die hohen Kosten einer Enteignung bzw. die Signalwirkung einer Enteignung ohne vollständige Kompensation, ist von einer Enteignung privater Wohnungsgesellschaften dringend abzuraten.
I31|Einsamkeit in Deutschland: Aktuelle Entwicklung und soziodemographische Zusammenhänge|In Deutschland fühlt sich etwa jede zehnte Person oft oder sehr oft einsam. Der Großteil von 60 Prozent hat dieses Gefühl nur selten oder nie. Das zeigen Auswertungen aktueller Daten des Sozio-ökonomischen Panels (SOEP) aus dem Jahr 2017. Entgegen der häufigen Annahme, dass die Einsamkeit in Deutschland zunimmt, zeigt der Ver-gleich von Daten aus den Jahren 2013 und 2017 einen leichten allgemeinen ückgang. Während sich im Jahr 2013 noch 10,5 Prozent aller Personen einsam gefühlt haben, sind es im Jahr 2017 noch 9,5 Prozent. Ein direkter personenbezogener Vergleich zeigt, dass in diesem Zeitraum etwa ein Viertel der Befragten einsamer geworden ist, fast ein Drittel ist im Jahr 2017 weniger einsam als vier Jahre zuvor. Einsamkeit tritt zwar häufiger bei älteren Personen auf, jedoch weist auch die mittlere Altersklasse der 30- bis 39-jährigen relativ hohe Werte auf. Am stärksten hat die Einsamkeit in diesem Zeitraum in den jüngeren Altersgruppen zugenommen. Die Daten weisen nicht auf eine deutliche Steigerung der Einsamkeit hin. Die gestiegene Auf-merksamkeit für das Thema und die Forderung nach Maßnahmen zur Verringerung und Präven-tion der Einsamkeit sind angesichts der starken negativen individuellen sowie gesamtwirtschaft-lichen Konsequenzen von Einsamkeit jedoch wichtig. Einige Zusammenhänge mit dem sozialen Umfeld sowie mit soziodemografischen Kriterien bieten Ansatzpunkte für die Ableitung von Maßnahmen. Dieser Report zeigt einige dieser Zusammenhänge auf: Eine häufigere Teilnahme an Freizeitaktivitäten ist mit geringerer Einsamkeit verbunden. Ein guter Gesundheitszustand sowie Erwerbstätigkeit sind tendenziell seltener mit Einsamkeit verbunden. Personen mit einem direkten Migrationshintergrund sind hingegen häufiger von dem Problem betroffen. Maßnahmen, die die identifizierten Faktoren Gesundheit, Erwerbstätigkeit sowie Verfügbarkeit und Erreichbarkeit von Freizeitaktivitäten betreffen, können daher indirekt positiv auf die Ein-samkeit wirken. Da Einsamkeit aber ein Problem mit vielschichten Ursachen und Zusammen-hängen ist, bedarf es für Deutschland weiterer Forschung. Dieser Report gibt daher einen Über-blick über den Stand und die Entwicklung und weist auf zukünftige Forschungsfelder hin.
I31|Integration von Geflüchteten und die Rolle der Aufnahmegesellschaft: Konzeptionelle Überlegungen und ihre Anwendung auf ländliche Räume|Dieses Working Paper thematisiert die Einstellungen der Aufnahmegesellschaft als wichtige Komponente des Integrationsverlaufs von Zugewanderten. Derzeit dominieren in der Betrachtung von Einstellungen gegenüber Zuwanderung Annahmen, die die Ablehnung von 'Fremden' stützen und empirisch nachweisen. Theorien zur Erklärung von toleranten oder zugewandten gesellschaftlichen Einstellungen werden hingegen in Bevölkerungsumfragen weniger stark berücksichtigt. In diesem Working Paper werden daher konzeptionelle Grundlagen zur Erforschung zugewandter Einstellungsmuster in der Bevölkerung vorgestellt, wobei der Begriff der 'Rezeptivität' dabei besonders im Vordergrund steht. Die Autorinnen geben zudem einen Überblick über den bisherigen Forschungsstand zur Integration von Zugewanderten in ländlichen Räumen und diskutieren Forschungsdesiderate. Auf dieser Basis wird ein Forschungskonzept entwickelt, das im Rahmen eines Forschungsprojektes zur Untersuchung der Einstellungsmuster und der lokalen Diskurse und ihrer Auswirkungen auf die Integration von Geflüchteten Anwendung finden wird.
I31|Associations of childhood health and financial situation with quality of life after retirement: Regional variation across Europe|Many studies have shown that childhood circumstances can have long term consequences that persist until old age. To better understand the transmission of early life circumstances, this paper analyses the effects of health and financial situation during childhood on quality of life after retirement as well as the mediating role of later life health, educational level, and income in this association. Moreover, this study is the first to compare these pathways across European regions. The analyses are based on data of 13,092 retirees aged > 60 and
I31|Types of Institutions and Well-Being of Self-Employed and Paid Employees in Europe|This paper analyzes the role of different types of institutions, such as entrepreneurship-facilitating entry conditions, labor market regulations, quality of government, and perception of corruption for individual well-being among self-employed and paid employed individuals. Well-being is operationalized by job and life satisfaction of individuals in 32 European countries measured by data from EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). We find that institutions never affected both occupational groups in opposite ways. Our findings indicate that labor market institutions do not play an important role well-being. The results suggest that fostering an entrepreneurial society in Europe is a welfare enhancing strategy that benefits both, the self-employed and paid employees.
I31|Fair Long-Term Care Insurance|The study of optimal long-term care (LTC) social insurance is generally carried out under the utilitarian social criterion, which penalizes individuals who have a lower capacity to convert resources into well-being, such as dependent elderly individuals or prematurely dead individuals. This paper revisits the design of optimal LTC insurance while adopting the ex post egalitarian social criterion, which gives priority to the worst-off in realized terms (i.e. once the state of nature has been revealed). Using a lifecycle model with risk about the duration of life and risk about old-age dependence, it is shown that the optimal LTC social insurance is quite sensitive to the postulated social criterion. The optimal second-best social insurance under the ex post egalitarian criterion involves, in comparison to utilitarianism, higher LTC benefits, lower pension benefits, a higher tax rate on savings, as well as a lower tax rate on labor earnings.
I31|The Day after the Bomb: Well-being Effects of Terrorist Attacks in Europe|We study the non-monetary costs of the terrorist attacks occurred in France, Belgium and Germany between 2010 and 2017. Using four waves of the European Social Survey, we find that individuals' well-being is significantly reduced in the aftermath of a terrorist attack. We explore possible mechanisms for this effect, finding that terrorist attacks determine a reduction in generalized trust, institutional trust, satisfaction with democracy and satisfaction with the government. Terrorist attacks are also found to increase negative attitudes towards migrants and perceived discrimination. However, contrary to expectations, the negative impact of terrorism on well-being is less strong for Muslim immigrants. We posit that this occurs because immigrants benefit more than natives from the institutional reaction following the attacks.
I31|The Welfare Effects of Social Media|The rise of social media has provoked both optimism about potential societal benefits and concern about harms such as addiction, depression, and political polarization. We present a randomized evaluation of the welfare effects of Facebook, focusing on US users in the run-up to the 2018 midterm election. We measured the willingness-to-accept of 2,743 Facebook users to deactivate their Facebook accounts for four weeks, then randomly assigned a subset to actually do so in a way that we verified. Using a suite of outcomes from both surveys and direct measurement, we show that Facebook deactivation (i) reduced online activity, including other social media, while increasing offline activities such as watching TV alone and socializing with family and friends; (ii) reduced both factual news knowledge and political polarization;(iii) increased subjective well-being; and (iv) caused a large persistent reduction in Facebook use after the experiment. Deactivation reduced post-experiment valuations of Facebook, but valuations still imply that Facebook generates substantial consumer surplus.
I31|Effects of Maternal Work Incentives on Adolescent Social Behaviors|This study investigates the effects of welfare reform in the U.S. in the 1990s, which dramatically limited cash assistance for low-income families, on the next generation as they transition to adulthood. We estimate effects by gender and focus on behaviors that are important for socioeconomic and health trajectories and represent early observable consequences of the reforms for the next generation. Using two nationally-representative datasets, we exploit differences in welfare reform implementation across states and over time in a difference-in- difference-in-differences framework to identify plausibly causal effects of welfare reform on a range of prosocial and antisocial behaviors (volunteering, participating in clubs/teams/activities, skipping school, getting into fights, damaging property, stealing, hurting others, smoking, using alcohol, using marijuana, using other illicit drugs). We explore maternal employment, supervision, and child’s employment when not in school as potential mediators. We find that: (1) Welfare reform had no favorable effects on any of the youth behaviors examined. (2) Welfare reform led to a decrease in volunteering among girls. (3) Welfare reform led to increases in skipping school, damaging property, and getting into fights among boys. (4) Welfare reform led to increases in smoking and drug use among both boys and girls, with generally larger effects for boys (e.g., approximately 6% for boys compared to 4% for girls for any substance use). (5) The mediators we are able to consider explain little of the observed effects of welfare reform. Overall, the results from this study suggest that the intergenerational effects of welfare reform on adolescent behaviors were unfavorable, particularly for boys, and do not support longstanding arguments that incentivizing maternal employment by limiting cash assistance leads to responsible behavior in the next generation. As such, the social gains of welfare reform for women found in previous studies may have come at a cost to the next generation, particularly to boys who have been falling behind girls in terms of high school completion for decades.
I31|Children, Unhappiness and Family Finances: Evidence from One Million Europeans|The common finding of a zero or negative correlation between the presence of children and parental well-being continues to generate research interest. We here consider over one million observations on Europeans from ten years of Eurobarometer surveys, and in the first instance replicate this negative finding, both in the overall data and then for most different marital statuses. Children are expensive, and controlling for financial difficulties turns almost all of our estimated child coefficients positive. We argue that financial difficulties explain the pattern of existing results by parental education and income, and country income and social support. Marital status matters. Kids do not raise happiness for singles, the divorced, separated or widowed. Last, we underline that all children are not the same, with step-children commonly having a more negative correlation than children from the current relationship.
I31|The Effects of Income Transparency on Well-Being: Evidence from a Natural Experiment|In 2001, Norwegian tax records became easily accessible online, allowing everyone in the country to observe the incomes of everyone else. According to the income comparisons model, this change in transparency can widen the gap in well-being between richer and poorer individuals. We test this hypothesis using survey data from 1985–2013. Using multiple identification strategies, we show that the higher transparency increased the gap in happiness between richer and poorer individuals by 29%, and it increased the life satisfaction gap by 21%. We provide suggestive evidence that some, although probably not all, of this effect relates to changes in self-perceptions of relative income. We provide back-of-the-envelope estimates of the importance of income comparisons, and discuss implications for the ongoing debate on transparency policies.
I31|The Impact of Parental Involvement Laws on Minor Abortion|In this article, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the effect of parental involvement (PI) laws on the incidence of abortions to minors across a span of nearly three decades. We contribute to the extant literature on this topic in several ways. First, we explore differences in estimates of the effect of PI laws across time that may result from changes in contraception, the composition of pregnant minors, access to confidential abortions in nearby states, or through judicial bypass, and the degree to which these laws are enforced. We find that, on average, PI laws enacted before the mid-1990s are associated with a 15% to 20% reduction in minor abortions. PI laws enacted after this time are not, on average, associated with declines in abortions to minors. Second, we assess the role of out-of-state travel by minors, estimating models that allow the effect of PI laws to differ by the distance to the nearest state without a PI law. We find that out-of-state travel is not a substantive moderating factor of the effect of PI laws. Third, we use a synthetic control approach to explore state-level heterogeneity in the effect of PI laws and find large differences in the impact of PI laws on minor abortions by state. These differences are unrelated to the type of law (consent versus notification) or whether contiguous states have enacted PI laws. Finally, we show that estimates of the effect of PI laws using data from either the Centers for Disease Control or the Alan Guttmacher Institute do not differ qualitatively once differences in coverage by state and year across these data are harmonized.
I31|When Dad Can Stay Home: Fathers' Workplace Flexibility and Maternal Health|While workplace flexibility is perceived to be a key determinant of maternal labor supply, less is known about fathers' demand for flexibility or about intra-household spillover effects of flexibility initiatives. This paper examines these issues in the context of a critical period in family life–the months immediately following childbirth–and identifies the impacts of paternal access to workplace flexibility on maternal postpartum health. We model household demand for paternal presence at home as a function of domestic stochastic shocks, and use variation from a Swedish reform that granted new fathers more flexibility to take intermittent parental leave during the postpartum period in a regression discontinuity difference-in-differences (RD-DD) design. We find that increasing the father's temporal flexibility reduces the risk of the mother experiencing physical postpartum health complications and improves her mental health. Our results suggest that mothers bear the burden from a lack of workplace flexibility–not only directly through greater career costs of family formation, as previously documented–but also indirectly, as fathers' inability to respond to domestic shocks exacerbates the maternal health costs of childbearing.
I31|Uninsured by Choice? A Choice Experiment on Long Term Care Insurance|We examine evidence from two unique discrete choice experiments (DCE) on long term care insurance and several of its relevant attributes, and more specifically, choices made by 15,298 individuals in the United States with and without insurance. We study the valuation of the following insurance attributes, namely daily insurance benefit, insurance coverage, the compulsory and voluntary nature of the insurance policy design, alongside the costs (insurance premium) and health requirements This paper investigates respondents' preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for these care insurance's attributes using a random parameter logit model, and assess the heterogeneity of choice responses using demographic, socioeconomic and attitudinal motivations to segment response to insurance choices. We find that an increase in the insurance premium by an additional 100US$ would reduce insurance uptake by 1pp. Insurance policy uptake is higher when it provides benefits for the lifetime (the monthly marginal WTP being $178.64), and voluntary (the monthly marginal WTP increases by an extra $74.71) as opposed to universal, and when it forgoes health checks (the monthly marginal WTP increases by an extra 28US$).
I31|Toward a Framework for Time Use, Welfare, and Household Centric Economic Measurement|What is meant by economic progress, and how should it be measured? The conventional answer is growth in real GDP over time or compared across countries, a monetary measure adjusted for the general rate of increase in prices. However, there is increasing interest in developing an alternative understanding of economic progress, particularly in the context of digitalization of the economy and the consequent significant changes Internet use is bringing about in production and household activity. This paper discusses one alternative approach, combining an extended utility framework considering time allocation over paid work, household work, leisure, and consumption with measures of objective or subjective well-being while engaging in different activities. Developing this wider economic welfare measure would require the collection of time use statistics as well as well-being data and direct survey evidence, such as the willingness to pay for leisure time. We advocate an experimental set of time and well-being accounts, with a particular focus on the digitally driven shifts in behavior.
I31|The social cost of unemployment in Spain: who are the losers?| The social cost of unemployment is an evaluation protocol proposed by Gorjón, de la Rica & Villar (2018) that integrates into a single indicator three different dimensions of this phenomenon: incidence (the conventional unemployment rate), severity (depending on the unemployment duration and the lost income) and hysteresis (the probability of remaining unemployed). This indicator corresponds to the aggregate disutility of unemployed workers and can thus be regarded as a measure of the social welfare loss due to unemployment. We apply here this evaluation protocol to the Spanish labour market, using the official register of unemployed workers compiled by the Public Employment Service, focusing on the differences among the types of unemployed workers that can be defined according to gender, age, level of studies, unemployment duration, and type of compensation received. Then we identify the population subgroups that suffer most the impact of unemployment.

I31|The Well-Being of Nations: Estimating Welfare from International Migration|The limitations of GDP as a measure of welfare are well known. We propose a new method of estimating the well-being of nations. Using gross bilateral international migration flows and a discrete choice model in which everyone in the world chooses a country in which to live, we estimate each country’s overall quality of life. Our estimates, by relying on revealed preference, complement previous estimates of economic well-being that consider only income or a small number of factors, or rely on structural assumptions about how these factors contribute to wellbeing.
I31|â€œComparison is the thief of joyâ€ . Does social comparison affect migrantsâ€™ subjective well-being?|This paper contributes to the growing strand of literature that investigates migrantsâ€™ subjective wellbeing by analysing how the social comparison with two reference groups (natives and other migrants) within the host country affects migrantsâ€™ life satisfaction. Using data from six rounds of the European Social Survey, we constructed two measures of economic distance that compare each migrantâ€™s situation with the average of the group of natives and the group of migrants with similar characteristics. Our results indicate that when the disadvantage between the migrant and the reference groups becomes smaller, migrantâ€™s life satisfaction increases. The effect of the social comparison with natives appears larger than the social comparison with migrants and, in both cases, it is stronger for individuals with higher levels of education. We also show that social comparison is stronger for second generation migrants than for first generation migrants and, within this latter group, it intensifies as length of stay in the host country increases. Overall, the role of social comparison seems crucial to understanding patterns of integration in an enlarged Europe.
I31|Optimism, Pessimism and Life Satisfaction: An Empirical Investigation|This empirical investigation into life satisfaction, using nationally representative German panel data, finds a substantial association with an individual’s thoughts about the future, whether they are optimistic or pessimistic about it. Furthermore, including individuals’ optimism and pessimism about the future substantially increases the explanatory power of standard life satisfaction models. The thoughts that individuals have about the future contribute substantially to their current life satisfaction. In particular, the reduction in life satisfaction experienced by individuals who report being pessimistic is greater than that for well-understood negative events like unemployment. These effects are attenuated but remain substantial after controlling for individual fixed effects, statistically matching on observable variables between optimistic and pessimistic individuals, and addressing the potential endogeneity of optimism and pessimism to life satisfaction. Moreover, these effects are robust to controlling for future life events that may be anticipated.
I31|"""Positional Views"" as the Cornerstone of Sen's Idea of Justice"|Our paper offers a novel reading of Sen’s idea of justice, beyond the standard prisms imposed by theories of justice – resting on external normative criteria – and formal welfarism – involving the definition of individual welfare and its aggregation. Instead we take seriously Sen’s emphasis on personal agency and focus on his original contribution to the issue of objectivity. Firstly, we demonstrate that Sen’s idea of justice, with at its core “positional views”, is more respectful of persons’ agency than would be a theory based on individual preference or capability. Secondly, we argue that Sen’s conception of objectivity considers that both information and sentiments are relative to a position. Such an alternative approach to subjectivity allows the formation of more impartial views through collective deliberation and a better consideration of justice by agents themselves.
I31|Long-Term Consequences of Group Work in Japanese Public Elementary Schools|Using original web survey data, this study investigates the long-term consequences of the experience of group work, which is a common teaching practice. We examined the convention in the context of Japanese public elementary schools, which are considered to be less susceptible to self-selection bias, in order to improve on the research conditions of previous studies. The regression results show that the experience of group work is negatively associated with annual income and financial assets. Furthermore, we find that the experience of group work does not relate to well-being and life satisfaction and that those who experienced group work attach higher satisfaction to human relationships and less satisfaction to household economic status. From the insignificant association between group work and well-being/whole life satisfaction, it may be interpreted that the positive association with satisfaction related to human relationships offsets the negative association with satisfaction regarding one fs present economic status. We also show that experience of group work is negatively associated with cognitive skills but is positively associated with altruistic and positive reciprocal behavior.
I31|The social cost of unemployment in Spain: who are the losers?|The social cost of unemployment is an evaluation protocol proposed by Gorjón, de la Rica & Villar (2018) that integrates into a single indicator three different dimensions of this phenomenon: incidence (the conventional unemployment rate), severity (depending on the unemployment duration and the lost income) and hysteresis (the probability of remaining unemployed). This indicator corresponds to the aggregate disutility of unemployed workers and can thus be regarded as a measure of the social welfare loss due to unemployment. We apply here this evaluation protocol to the Spanish labour market, using the official register of unemployed workers compiled by the Public Employment Service, focusing on the differences among the types of unemployed workers that can be defined according to gender, age, level of studies, unemployment duration, and type of compensation received. Then we identify the population subgroups that suffer most the impact of unemployment.
I31|Making economic growth and well-being compatible: evidence from Japan|Whether economic growth improves the human lot is a matter of conditions. We focus on Japan, a country where reforms in the mid-1990s shifted the country from a pattern of rampant economic growth and stagnant well-being, to one of modest growth and increasing well-being. We discuss the policy reforms and analyze the changes that explain the increase in well-being. In particular, we assess whether the factors that explain the increase are consistent with those expected from the reforms. We apply Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition to World Values Survey data. Results show that well-being increased due to improved conditions for elderly people, people with children, and women, in other words, the primary groups targeted by the reforms. We conclude that adopting a system of social safety nets contributes to make economic growth compatible with increasing well-being over time.
I31|Market mechanisms in conventional economics and Islamic Economics|This article describes the market as a meeting place between demand and supply for the type of goods or services. In a capitalist economic system, buyers and sellers bargain with each other to determine prices that give freedom to the market and the government must not intervene which can disrupt the market balance. While the socialist economic system has a view by eliminating the role of markets and the government plays an active role in resolving and regulating all economic problems. In Islamic economics, the market is left freely or the government distorts the existence of a market mechanism. Using a comparative approach to the existing economic system in the world, this article concludes that the Islamic economic system combines market freedom and the role of government that emphasizes the principle of maslahah (goodness), which is a condition of market justice that emphasizes the fulfillment of people's needs in achieving welfare (falah).
I31|An Unconventional Way to Support Health Expenditure|Here, we propose a taxation scheme towards the implementation of universal health care under Beveridge model. In our proposed framework, a small amount of health tax is imposed on each and every non-cash transaction including transactions through debit and credit card, credit transfer, direct debit and cheque which is found to be solely sufficient to cover up entire health expenditure of a nation. We have shown empirically that a $1.84$ USD levy on every non-cash transaction is enough to meet up the annual health expenditure in the CEMEA (Central Europe, Middle East and Africa) region. For Latin America (LA), Emerging Asia (EA), Mature Asia and the Pacific (MAP) and North America (NA) this value is found to be $4.51$, $2.04$, $15.93$ and $21.07$ USD respectively. Moreover, as the proposed levy is collectable electronically without any human intervention, no additional logistic support is required for the implementation of the scheme.
I31|Billionaires, millionaires, inequality, and happiness|The relationship between inequality and happiness is counterintuitive. This applies to both inequality in income and wealth distribution overall and also inequality at the very top of the wealth pyramid, as measured by billionaire intensity (the ratio of billionaire wealth to GDP). First, billionaire intensity appears to be higher in countries with low, not high, levels of income inequality. Second, happiness indices are higher in countries with high percentages of billionaire and millionaire wealth as a proportion of GDP, but with low levels of income inequality. This paper uses databases from the Forbes billionaires list, the Global Wealth Report (GWR), and the World Happiness Report, as well as from the World Database on Happiness. Using these datasets, I examine the relationship between income inequality and happiness for over 200 countries from 2000 to 2018. It turns out that in relatively poor countries – below $20,000-$30,000 per capita income – inequality raises happiness rather than lowers it, but inequality has a negative impact on happiness in rich countries. A certain degree of inequality of wealth and income distribution has a positive impact on happiness feelings, especially in countries with low levels of income. Furthermore, wealth inequalities, and especially the degree of concentration of wealth at the very top of the wealth pyramid, raise happiness self-evaluations even when income inequalities lower it.
I31|Structural changes in economic growth and well-being. The case of Italy's parabola|The controversies on the relationship (or `gradient') between GDP and subjective well-being oppose those who claim that the gradient is positive and stable around the world to those who argue that long-run trends of subjective well-being are flat despite economic growth. The possible existence of structural breaks of the gradient within the same country is a challenge to both views. By focusing on the case of Italy, we show that the long-run trends of GDP and of well-being turned from increasing to decreasing, and the gradient exhibits a rise through two structural breaks. Macro and micro analyses explain why the gradient changes, and we find evidence consistent with the `loss aversion' hypothesis. In addition, the gradient changed because the erosion of trust in others, the increase of financial dissatisfaction and worsened health hinder well-being independently from income.
I31|The nature of Public Interest in Muslim and Non-Muslim writers|Leading a comfortable life on this planet with few problems and worries is one of the aims and objective of human since the dawn of history. Defining and then achieving a prosperous and comfortable life has been the subject of intense discussion among philosophers and religious scholars since the dawn of history. In order to investigate whether the contemporary economic system better serves the wellbeing of the general population (public interest), then it is very important to know that what the public interest itself actually means? To accomplish this task, we started this essay with an examination of the idea of public interest from both Muslims and non-Muslims writers. After the emergence of enlightenment self-interest got prominence due to which public interest among non-Muslims writers is considered as a rule or concept serving to present something as suitable for long term approval or acceptance according to changing circumstances. In contrast Muslim writers think that public interest refers to the fulfilment of the objective of the Sharia which lies in safeguarding their faith (Din/Religion), their human self (Nafs), their intellect (Aql), their posterity (Nasl) and their wealth (Maal). There will be violence and corruption without these five basics purposes of Sharia.
I31|How Much Do We Save If We Move From Commercial to Social Insurance?|Commercial insurance system acts like a memoryless system in a way that the premiums paid by the policyholders in one accounting period will be of no avail to them during subsequent periods. Here, we argue that if the insurance scheme is implemented as a not-for-profit trust fund (social insurance) instead of a for-profit limited liability company (commercial insurance) then it will effectively and less expensively hedge against unforeseen losses. If the profit of the insurance company is retained instead of being distributed to the stockholders and there is no agency commission then after a certain number of years, all upcoming claims can be addressed from the interest income of the accumulated profit and the policyholders do not need to pay any premium afterwards. Here, we algebraically calculate the time period required to achieve such a perpetual insurance system as the policyholders after a certain period of time, do no longer need to pay any premium in order to get coverage from losses. In the next step, we empirically calculate the required time period to attain a perpetual zero premium insurance scheme for some 20 (twenty) general insurance companies incorporated in Bangladesh.
I31|Governance and Happiness in African countries|Using Ordinary Least Squares and the Generalized Method of Moments techniques, this paper analyses the effect of governance on happiness in a panel of 31 African countries over the period 2006-2017. We find that governance quality improves happiness.
I31|Have economic growth and the quality of governance contributed to poverty reduction and improved well-being in African countries?|This study examines the impact of economic growth and quality of governance on poverty and well-being in African countries for the period 1996-2016. The static panel estimation method is used to estimate the equations. Although economic growth does not seem to have an effect on poverty, the results confirm that this growth leads to improved well-being in West Africa. Although corruption and the quality of regulation have been found to increase poverty, improving government efficiency appears to reduce levels of poverty. Similarly, the results also show that corruption and government effectiveness are associated with a deterioration of welfare, but the rule of law and the way and responsibility seem to improve well-being. This study shows that governance indicators in African countries address the issues of poverty and improving well-being. Economic growth has been cited as one of the main drivers of poverty reduction, and the persistent problem of poverty in African countries has raised doubts about the effectiveness of economic growth. Recent evidence has shown that growth in Africa has been accompanied by an increase in poverty. Increasing poverty can slow the improvement of well-being and create social unrest. The quality of governance can also influence the extent to which economic growth reduces poverty. This study shows that improvements in these institutional (government efficiency) and legal (rule of law) measures tend to decrease levels of poverty and increase well-being.
I31|The impact of Foreign Direct Investment and the institutional quality on Welfare in Latin America and Sub-saharan Africa|This article examines the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) and institutional quality on well-being in Latin American and sub-Saharan African countries between 1996-2014. We use as key variables FDI, indicators of institutional quality (control of corruption and the rule of law) and the Human Development Index (HDI) as the main variables. Our analyzes confirm the positive and significant relationship between FDI and well-being in Latin America. Although the rule of law has been established to improve well-being. This result shows that legal variables of institutional quality play an important role in improving well-being. Nevertheless, this relationship between FDI, institutional quality and well-being is significantly different between Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. So legal indicators create a positive effect on well-being. This study shows that institutional quality indicators attack well-being in the Latin American region. In addition, the quality of institutions and the strengthening of governance tend to amplify the positive effects on well-being in the region. The result of the regression confirms the positive links between FDI, institutional quality and improved well-being. Regarding the impact of FDI and institutional quality on well-being, FDI and the rule of law have more impact on improving well-being in Latin American countries than in sub-Saharan African countries.
I31|Modern Democracy-Welfare State and Public Goods. A current consequence for Greece|People expect the state to create jobs and provide them with a social security net. Whatever its defects, whatever the virtues of the private sector, no structure other than the state can today provide citizens with the basic public goods. Under the present right-wing government of Nea Dimokratia in Greece, which is not particularly at odds with neoliberalism, a very active role of the state is not expected. Also is nor expected the introduction of a serious program of public investment and demand boosting to stimulate the national economy and enter into a virtuous circle of recovery. Greece, which has undergone the economic crisis with drastic cuts in its traditionally deficient social state, has to respond directly to the marked underinvestment in public goods (in key areas such as education, health, natural disasters, dealing with decent living conditions).The most important tool for inputting resources is the tax system.
I31|The Effect of Financial Inclusion on Household Welfare in China|Financial inclusion is one of the key factors contributing to household welfare. We explore this effect in China utilizing a unique household survey panel data. Financial inclusion is measured by owning a transaction account at formal financial institutions. We employ an innovative method of heteroscedasticity-based identification recently developed by Klein and Vella (2009a; 2010) to identify the causal effect of financial inclusion. We find that welfare effects of financial inclusion varied across urban and rural areas and income groups. Financial inclusion significantly increased overall consumption, but the impact was greater among urban than rural households. The effect was stronger in the case of food consumption. Financial inclusion also decreased consumption inequality but only among urban households. The uneven effect of financial inclusion across level of urbanization and commodity types have important policy implications for promoting financial inclusion not only in China but also in other developing countries.
I31|Economic growth and well-being beyond the Easterlin paradox|Recent studies suggest that economic growth and well-being can grow together in the long run in presence of generous social safety nets, increasing social capital and declining income inequality. We put these conditions to a test in an attempt to explain the absence of a relation between economic growth and well-being in Luxembourg. To this aim we apply an error correction model to a panel of 15 Western European countries, and we use the results to predict life satisfaction in Luxembourg between 1991 and 2015. We find that the flat trend of life satisfaction in Luxembourg is likely the result of four forces acting in opposite directions. This suggests that the available list of moderating conditions -- although not exhaustive -- is a promising starting point to design new policies to durably improve well-being.
I31|The economics of eudaimonia|Research in the Economics of Happiness has recently paid increasing attention to ‘eudaimonia’, which is a conception of happiness originated in ancient Greek philosophy, and in particular in Aristotle’s philosophy. Since ‘eudaimonia’ is a way of life rather than a circumscribed goal, its understanding requires a dynamic analytical structure. To this end, the paper provides two main contributions. First, in order to facilitate reading by the economists of Aristotle’s work, this is translated in modern economic terms, i.e. eudaimonia is described as an individual activity that transforms inputs into outputs. Second, this description is reformulated, with the help of studies in psychology and anthropology, in a modern ‘economic approach to eudaimonia’, which focuses on human development, i.e. on the development of the skills which are typically human. A number of implications are then discussed: about how some weaknesses of Aristotle’s conception of eudaimonia can be amended (e.g. the objective/subjective reconciliation); about the greater robustness of eudaimonia with respect to hedonism as two alternative pathways to happiness that people can choose; and about the advantages of the policy implications of eudaimonia.
I31|Estimating Demand for Long-term Care Insurance in Thailand: Evidence from a Discrete Choice Experiment|At present, the Thai public health insurance schemes cover medical care. However, the financial risk associated with long-term care needs is unprotected. The increasing likelihood of Thai elderly living longer and living alone has raised great concern about their quality of life. In the wake of the declining informal support capacity, a public long-term care insurance (LTCI) system has been considered as a potential alternative. Because the public will have to contribute to the LTCI fund, this paper explores whether the Thai people are willing to pay for such a provision. The LTCI demand is estimated based on the stated preference survey data. Our results show that most respondents are willing to pay to insure against their risk associated with long-term care expenditure, but their preferences are very heterogeneous. Gains and losses for different policy scenarios, measured by consumer surplus, are discussed.
I31|Social Value of Time for Investment Appraisal in Mozambique|This study aims to estimate social value of time for investment appraisal in Mozambique. In doing so, we estimate the social value of time for three categories of project that result in time savings. These include transportation sector (road), water supply and sanitation projects and social value of time for people using public services. The estimated social value of time savings in this study, reflects the average magnitude of the welfare improvement of passengers travelling by type of vehicles, welfare improvement of women and children hauling for water and sanitation project and welfare improvement of visiting public offices for commercial and non-commercial purposes in Mozambique. This welfare improvement comes about either through increased productivity of the individuals or through the increase in utility an individual would enjoy if waiting time is reduced by an hour in the Mozambique for immediate or future projects.
I31|The Impact of High-Performance Work Systems on Employees: A Sectoral Comparison|Using nationally representative linked employer-employee surveys of workplaces with 50 or more employees we find the adoption of High-Performance Work Systems (HPWS) in the private sector is largely positively correlated with employee job attitudes pre-recession. However, high intensity HPWS has partly adverse consequences for private sector employees in the post-recession period. In contrast, there are no indications of public sector employees responding positively or negatively to HPWS and HPWS is not associated with adverse effects post-recession. The sectoral difference in results is interpreted in terms of different employment relationships and different sources of employee motivation.
I31|El Sistema Pensional en Colombia|En el documento se describe el sistema pensional colombiano. Luego de la reforma de la Ley 100 mejoraron las afiliaciones, lo cual implica un aumento también de las cotizaciones y la cobertura de los pensionados en el futuro. En la actualidad la cobertura de las pensiones es apenas 23% y menos de 1,5 millones de personas. Esto se debe, en parte, a la existencia de un mercado laboral con un sector informal amplio (47,3%). Las mayores tasas de reemplazo del sistema público con respecto al privado ocasionan traslados del segundo al primero, lo que pone más presión en las finanzas públicas. Por lo anterior, se propone establecer un sistema de 3 pilares vigente en otros países como Chile. Actualmente, por nivel de ingreso, cerca de 80% de los cotizantes corresponde a personas con menos de 2 SMMLV; sin embargo, un alto monto de los subsidios del RPM se destina a la población con mayores ingresos. El gasto en transferencias con cargo a la Nación fue de 3,4% del PIB y el pasivo pensional fue cercano al 130% del PIB. Teniendo en cuenta las anteriores consideraciones, en este documento se plantea la necesidad de una reforma pensional que mejore la cobertura, aumente las transferencias a la población más pobre y no incremente los requerimientos de presupuesto de la Nación.
I31|Kia māia: Be bold, Improving the wellbeing of children living in poverty|Kiwis believe in giving people a fair go. Improving the wellbeing of children living in poverty fits with these values. Wellbeing is not just a trendy name for income or standard of living. Kia māia: Be bold shows how it is a powerful idea that goes to the heart of what “a fair go”' in life requires. We discuss how some people struggle to convert income and other resources into a good life. For those people, increasing income is not enough to increase their wellbeing. To address the negative effects of child poverty and give all Kiwi kids a fair go, additional support, often focussed on the needs of individuals and their families, will be required.
I31|The Impact of Bullying Victimisation on Mental Wellbeing|We investigate the impact of nine types of adolescent (verbal, physical, indirect) school/domestic bullying on life satisfaction, and two mental health outcomes (emotional symptoms and hyperactivity/inattention) using the Understanding Society dataset during 2009-13. Bullying significantly increases hyperactive, inattentive and emotional symptoms and reduces life satisfaction. Non-domestic bullying has a stronger adverse impact on all three mental wellbeing outcomes. Domestic sibling victimisation does not affect life satisfaction. Lower levels of family income increase adolescent hyperactive/inattentive symptoms and reduce life satisfaction. Females are more vulnerable to emotional symptoms while males report higher levels of life satisfaction. Initial conditions precondition hyperactive and inattentive symptoms.
I31|Flow specific capital controls for emerging markets|Policymakers need better information regarding wellbeing inequality to ascertain the contributing factors and to determine whether policy has been successful in improving the spread over time. In this paper, we construct a multidimensional composite wellbeing measure, at a micro level, which includes â€œeconomic and non-economicâ€ and â€œobjective and subjective measuresâ€ of wellbeing. We use NIDS data spanning the period 2008 â€“ 2015. We compare the results on measuring wellbeing inequality using the composite index and income. This allows us to gain insight into, which is a better measure of wellbeing inequality. Additionally, we investigate the determinants of cross-sectional wellbeing inequality in 2008 and 2015 using regressions of the recentered influence function. Lastly, we use the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to identify the role played by covariates in shaping the evolution in wellbeing inequality. This allows us to determine if the observed change in wellbeing inequality is mainly due to a coefficient â€“ or endowment effect. We focus on South Africa, as it is one of the most unequal societies in the world. Our results show a more equal distribution in multi-dimensional wellbeing than either income per person or life satisfaction and indicate that the spread in wellbeing has improved from 2008 to 2015. Factors that decrease wellbeing inequality are mostly demographic in nature. Factors that increase wellbeing inequality are (i) the gap in wellbeing between rural and urban areas (ii) the limited number of people that have access to computer literacy, credit and transport and (iii) relative income. Lastly, we find that improved wellbeing inequality is due to better efficiencies in the use of endowments, rather than increases in the endowments itself. Policies should not only endeavour to increase endowments but also to improve the efficient translation of these endowments into higher levels of wellbeing equality by improving institutions and limiting corruption.
I31|Love as a key element to wellbeing|This presentation is based on the new scientific book Love Around Us - The Role of Love in Education, Parenting and Romantic Relationships (Kaarina Määttä & Satu Uusiautti, eds.) published by Peter Lang in 2018, and also the previous book Many Faces of Love (Kaarina Määttä & Satu Uusiautti, authors), published by Sense Publishers. In the presentation it will be discussed research on love as a key element of health, wellbeing and positive human development. People live in a network of relationships and their ability to build and maintain realationships is an important strength. Love has many definitions and also many forms and faces. The presentation provides a comprehensive analysis on love in various areas of human beings? life ? the emergence and manifestation of romantic love in various phases of life, love in education, love for work, for fellow humans ? and in relation to other phenomena, such as friendship, play, and creativity. When dissecting love along the course of life, parental love and also grandparental love secures children's well-being and teachers´ pedagogical love trusts in pupils' learning. The first taste of falling in love can manifest itself in the form of the sweet poison of love and still is quite far from actual love. The ability to love is an important, yet difficult, skill. There are numerous theories that explain the phases of long-lasting marriages and divorces, too. Nevertheless, love does not retire and the fascination of love does not fade, not even in senior age. Other topical phenomena of love are, for example, love for work and the successful combination of work and family.Love in its whole gamut is connected to human wellbeing and development in different areas and phases of human life. Love, as its best, is manifested by the endeavor to make things develop, grow, and come forward, whether love falls on other people, art, science, ideas, or nature. A world where it is safe to love is a world where it is safe to live. The presentation concentrates on the best sides of love and I conclude that love, in its various forms, makes the best health insurance.
I31|Multigroup Causal Relationship Model of Health literacy and Behavior on Family Well-being among Thai Adults at Risk of NCDs|The 9th Global Conference on Health Promotion, 2016 focused on health risks and wellbeing for sustainable development. Study design: Multi-group structural equation model study aims to develop a causal model of family well-being by mediating health literacy (HL) and to compare models between spouses in men and women and in urban and rural communities Methods: The samples included 2,000 spouses at risk of NCDs by stratified random sampling. Data were collected by Likert questionnaires with reliability of 0.79-0.93, using to analyze via CFA, and Multi-group SEM Results: A causal model of social norm and psychology capital affected to health behavior and family well-being by mediating HL in overall group was consistent with an empirical data. Causal factors had direct effects on health behavior including social norm, positive attitudes, psychology capital, and HL (?=0.11, 0.14, 0.30, and 0.41, *p
I31|The paradox of the unhappy, growing city: reconciling evidence|This paper attempts to explain why large cities tend to score low on indices of happiness/life satisfaction, while at the same time experiencing population growth. Using Norwegian survey and register data, we show that different population segments are behind these seemingly contradictory attributes of large cities. A minority of highly mobile citizens are satisfied with life in Norway’s biggest city, Oslo, and exhibits positive net in-migration to the city. A majority of less mobile groups are dissatisfied and tend to move out of Oslo, but these flows are too small to determine the overall migration pattern. Our results indicate that the Rosen-Roback framework for analysis of regional quality of life, which builds on the assumption of perfect mobility, is appropriate only for the most mobile segments of the population.
I31|Troubled in school: does maternal involvement matter for adolescents?|We estimate the causal effect of motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involvement on the amount of trouble an adolescent experiences in school. We use multiple measures of school-trouble and factor analysis to construct a composite and then link this composite with non-cognitive skills. Our measure of motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involvement encompasses discussing school-related matters and providing help with school projects. Using an instrumental variable constructed from a suitably chosen peer group, our main finding is that an increase in maternal involvement leads to a significant decrease in school trouble. We find this result to be robust across a large number of sensitivity tests designed to account for possible selection effects, shocks at the peer group level, and further potential violations of the exclusion restriction. Additionally, we present evidence suggesting that the effect of maternal involvement may operate through its effect on adolescentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ college aspirations, mental health, and the perception of parental warmth.
I31|Bolivia: Los Avances Sociales y Laborales en el Periodo de Boom Económico y los Desafíos con el Fin de la Bonanza|Al inicio del siglo XXI, Bolivia presentó mejoras en los indicadores de pobreza y desigualdad monetaria siguiendo la tendencia de América Latina. El análisis de la evolución del Índice de Necesidades Básicas Insatisfechas (NBI) también muestra una tendencia positiva. Sin embargo, todavía persisten diferencias significativas por área geográfica - urbana y rural- y entre los departamentos. El período entre 2004 y 2014 se caracterizó por una bonanza económica excepcional debido, principalmente, al incremento de la demanda y los precios internacionales de las materias primas. A partir de 2014, la caída del precio de estaño, hidrocarburos y otras materias primas marcó la desaceleración del ciclo expansivo de la economía internacional y de los precios de las materias primas y el inicio de un ciclo de retracción económica en la región. Considerando la histórica dependencia de la economía regional a los booms y colapsos de los precios de los recursos naturales y, consecuentemente, de los negativos efectos económicos y sociales provocados por una marcada volatilidad de nuestros mercados, las siguientes interrogantes se imponen: ¿Cuáles fueron los factores más importantes para la mejora de los indicadores sociales en el periodo de boom económico? y ¿qué políticas se requieren para sostener la mejora de los indicadores sociales y seguir ampliando el bienestar de la población boliviana? El objetivo del documento es presentar los avances sociales y los problemas persistentes para lograr el bienestar social de todos y todas las bolivianas con base en los últimos indicadores oficiales disponibles y en estudios secundarios, y las explicaciones sobre los factores que incidieron en las mejoras sociales. El documento ofrece una síntesis de los principales desafíos que todavía enfrenta el país.
I31|Estimación del impacto de las TICS en el Bienestar: Una aproximación empírica mediante un modelo MIMIC|Actualmente no existe un consenso para medir el impacto que tienen las TICs en el bienestar de las personas. Para analizar su impacto primero se debe destacar que las TICs permiten acceso a información y que ésta debe analizarse por sí misma como una dimensión propia del bienestar. El presente trabajo combina las TICs para el Desarrollo y el enfoque de Capacidades de Amartya Sen para construir un marco de análisis. Luego se operacionalizan ambos enfoques y se propone la utilización de un modelo empírico mediante la aplicación del modelo MIMIC. Se utiliza la encuesta STEP del Banco Mundial realizada el 2012 para Bolivia. Entre los principales resultados se encuentra que las TICs son un componente importante y significativo de esta dimensión, en conjunto con el acceso, nivel de educación y habilidades de lectura y escritura. Existen variables exógenas que influencian esta dimensión. En especial que el padre y la madre hayan alcanzado una educación terciaria. También se encuentra que las personas indígenas y las mujeres son los grupos más privados de esta dimensión.
I31|Using Animation to Self-report Health: a Randomized Experiment with Children|The Child Health Utility-9D (CHU-9D) is the only generic preference based measure specifically developed to elicit health-related quality of life directly from children aged 7 to 11 years. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of animation on a touch screen device (tablet) is a better way of collecting health status information from children aged 4 to 14 years compared to a traditional paper questionnaire. The specific research questions were firstly, do young children (4 to 7 years) find an animated questionnaire easier to understand; secondly, independent of the child’s age, is completion of an animated questionnaire easier for sick children in hospital settings; and thirdly, do children’s preferences for the different versions of the questionnaire vary by the age of the child. Using a balanced cross-over trial we administered different versions of the CHU-9D to 221 healthy children in a school setting and 217 children with health problems in a hospital setting. The study tested five versions of the CHU-9D questionnaire: paper text, tablet text, tablet image, paper image and tablet animation. Our results indicate that the majority of the youngest children aged 4-7 years found the CHU-9D questions easy to answer independent of the type of questionnaire administered. Amongst children aged 7-14 with health problems the type of questionnaire was found to influence understanding. Children aged 7 to 11 years found tablet image and animation easier compared to text questionnaires while the oldest children in hospital found text based questionnaires easier compared to image and animation. Children in all three age groups preferred animation on a tablet to other methods of assessment. Our results highlight the potential for using an Animated Preference Based Measure to the health of children as young as 4 years.
I31|Georgian emigrants? online support groups: exploring self-presentation and social capital on Facebook|There is a clear evidence that emigration is associated with negative psychological outcomes, such as acculturation stress, depression, suicidal feelings, etc. Emigrants use various strategies to solve the psychological problems. Being a member of emigrants? Facebook supportive groups is common among Georgians mostly living in Europe and North America. They use Facebook groups to get acquainted with other Georgian emigrants, share their ideas and important information, get social support from other members and cope with their everyday hassles. This study examines how Facebook group membership experience (frequency of activity and using self-presentation tactics) is associated with accumulating online social capital among Georgian emigrants. 105 Georgian emigrants from 15 Facebook groups participated in the online survey. The results showed that frequent checking of notifications, writing posts, comments, and likes on emigrants? Facebook groups are positively associated with both bridging and bonding social capital. In addition, strategic self-presentation on Facebook groups is also positively related to online social capital variables.
I31|Psychological Outcomes of Unemployment in Young People in Georgia|Unemployment has a negative impact on people?s everyday lives. This study examined psychological outcomes of long-term unemployment on young people in Georgia who have already completed their initial education (vocational or higher). In this research 108 young people aged 18-29 were interviewed. The unemployed participants reported a high level of learned helplessness, which was related to the different types of stress coping strategies. This study also identified the high level of well-being associated with emotional oriented stress coping, high level of learned helplessness and the passive attempt to get a job, which also was predicted. The study results suggested that young people who already have got bachelor?s degree still consider themselves as not educated enough for employment. They use self-distraction coping strategy and prefer to attend seminars, training courses to increase their level of education instead of attempting to get a job. The results also showed that relationship between active coping and life satisfaction was positive as well as a denial and low level of well-being scale. Overall, people who have never been employed have better results of life-satisfaction scale than those people who lost their jobs.
I31|Case Study of Tsalka, Georgia: Social Identity and Adaptation to a New Living Environment|Migration is associated with adaptation problems and has a great impact on migrated people?s identity and quality of life. This case study explains how adaptation process is related to social identity transformation among eco-migrants settled in Tsalka, Georgia. Tsalka is a town in eastern Georgia with a multi-ethnic population (Georgians, Armenians, Greeks, and Azerbaijanis). It has been a location where eco-migrants from mountain regions of Georgia rushed into and settled in 1997-2006. 32 eco-migrants from 20 households participated in in-depth interviews. The results showed that there are two types of eco-migrants: with state shelter and private accomodation. Besides that initial ethnic conflicts between eco-migrants and host inhabitants ended up having a positive impact on the adaptation process. Eco-migrants who have the private property and stable jobs have a better chance for adaptation and in general, they described themselves as satisfied in their lives. Overall, the present study suggests that well-adapted eco-migrants have multiple identities, they perceive themselves as a part of a new community and at the same time, they can?t forget their old ??roots??, as they say, which is related to their welfare.
I31|Using Narrative to Enhance Students? Understanding of Challenging Life Events: A Conceptual Approach|The history of narrative analysis in psychology spans several decades and initially was fed by two distinctive streams, the psychoanalytic focus on life stories and the wide-ranging contributions of Bruner, who expanded the boundaries of what cognitive psychology could encompass. As the field developed, personality theory, developmental approaches, and neuroscience, for instance, all offered valuable perspectives on how persons construct identity and make meaning by visiting and revisiting their life stories. In an upper-level undergraduate course, students immerse themselves in narrative theory, analyze journal articles, view videos, listen to podcasts, and read fictional and non-fictional writing on language and metaphor, memory, friendship, immigration and asylum seeking, and suffering, among other themes. Each student chooses one film or memoir from a wide variety of disparate cultural perspectives, and then examines the protagonist?s struggles and accomplishments using narrative principles and dense reading of scientific works on racism, grief and loss, terminal illness, and other pertinent challenges and barriers the protagonist faces. Students report that this assignment, along with others embedded in the course structure such as a discussion board, help them see significant and often painful life events in a new way. It is hoped that the still-tentative use of narrative in psychology education will serve to enhance both empathy and critical judgment, a benefit that will redound to students and potentially to their communities.
I31|Classification of Life Mottos|Schwartz and colleagues (2012) identified 19 universal human values related to various beliefs, attitudes, and viewpoints. Peterson and Seligman (2004) categorized 24 character strengths to identify positive traits associated with attitudes, values, and behaviors. The primary motive for these two seminal studies tend to converge around the attempt to identify universal core human values and characteristics leading to attitudes and behaviors. Expanding the scope of focus, the present study sought to shed light on life mottos that are inherently intertwined with human values and traits and to classify them based upon Schwartz et al?s (2012) 19 human values and Peterson and Seligman (2004)?s 24 character strengths, as well as 27 newly created categories. The data in the present study included a sample of 10,311 adults (54.3% male, 45.3% female) who aged 19 to 86 (M = 33.73, SD = 7.46). The most commonly categorized life motto was perseverance (8.7%), followed by hope (6.0%) and zest (5.6%). Approximately 13% were not classified to a single category. Findings suggest that life mottos could be categorized in meaningful ways and they are heavily influenced and shaped by cultural background and socialization.
I31|Smart Cities Ability to Address Economic Challenges|Smart City is a multi-dimensional concept, which includes several disciplines such as social, economic, and technological sciences. By using smart city data, city authorities and stakeholders are able to explore opportunities to enhance quality of life, to improve economic conditions, and to provide better services. Smart city data and its indicators have been conventionally applied for three goals: (a) emphasizing current strengths of a community; (b) measuring smartness in existing cities; and (c) creating a new (smarter) city. This paper explores smart cities ability to overcome economic challenges within cities in three phases. The first phase studies the existing literature of smart cities, their criteria and indicators. The second phase reviews specific previous and ongoing projects in order to identify the multi-dimensional aspect of the concept. The last phase investigates a new practical perspective of smart cities, which addresses economic challenges. The outcome of this study is a unique conceptualization of smart cities in economic and social projects.
I31|Socio-economic differences of regions in Lithuania|Regional development differences in Lithuania are the result of various factors such as available natural resources, human capital, access to transport, public services etc.The aim of this paper is to assess socio-economic development of regions in Lithuania over the 2011-2016. The research has been focused on both aspects ? regional differences and changes over time. The research was based on the data of the Statistics Lithuania (http://www.stat.gov.lt). Study uses ten regional indicators which represent Lithuanian counties classified by NUTS 3 administrative unit. Kruskal-Wallis test (K-W) was used to determine if there are statistically significant differences among counties and years. The conducted analysis showed, that there was a statistically significant difference of the activity rate, the average disposable income and the number of households that have internet access, comparing by years. During the analysed period, these indices were increasing in all of the counties. It is possible to conclude that regional contrasts in Lithuania are still strong. Summing up the results of the analysis, there is a clear predominance of three regions ? Kaunas, Klaip?da and Vilnius counties. The highest GDP is in Vilnius County. The highest number of investments was in Vilnius and Klaip?da counties. The activity rate increased the most in Tel?iai County. The disposable income was growing unevenly in the counties. Comparing 2016 and 2011 years, the difference between the highest disposable income of Vilnius County and the lowest disposable income of another county has doubled. The research on regional differences in Lithuania has shown that present regional policy should be revised. The disparities in the level of regions contrasts in the population living standards can lead to social tension.
I31|Austerity, Life Satisfaction and Expectations|This paper examines the linkages between fiscal austerity and life satisfaction across sixteen European countries using a sample of repeated cross-sections of individuals from 1983 to 2013 (N=853,482). Austerity is identified using changes in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance. Our dataset allows us to control for several individual-specific characteristics that are known to affect life satisfaction. In our empirical framework, we account for the role of macroeconomic developments and expectations. We find that austerity is inversely associated with life satisfaction, with the effect operating through an economic channel. Specifically, it is only the part of austerity correlated with macroeconomic developments, that is shown to empirically matter. Moreover, we show that the negative effect of austerity is mediated by expectations. Individuals with positive expectations about their future prospects are less affected, in terms of falling life satisfaction, by contractionary fiscal policies.
I31|The Well-being Transition: Measuring what counts to protect what matters|"In this article we provide an analytical framework for a collective effort that we label ""the well-being transition"" away from growth and GDP towards human well-being and offer some insights as to what is needed to accelerate this dynamic, insisting on the need for a new positive narrative and institutional reforms. We first present the achievements and challenges of the well-being transition first by outlying why and how we can go beyond growth and GDP not just to see the world differently but to change it. We then spell out a possible narrative able to engage citizens and transform these new visions into social realities, linking sustainability and justice in a social-ecological approach of 21st century challenges. We finally propose specific institutional reforms to ground the well-being transition in public policy."
I31|Health Shocks and the Evolution of Consumption and Income over the Life-Cycle|This paper studies the effects of health on earnings dynamics and on consumption inequality over the life-cycle. We build and calibrate a life-cycle model with idiosyncratic health, earnings and survival risk where individuals make labor supply and asset accumulation decisions, adding two novel features. First, we model health as a complex multi-dimensional concept. We differentiate between functional health and underlying health risk, temporary vs. persistent health shocks, and predictable vs. unpredictable shocks. Second, we study the interactions between health and human capital accumulation (learning-by-doing). These features are important in allowing the model to capture the degree to which, and the pathways through which, health impacts earnings and consumption patterns. They are also very important in estimating the value of health insurance and social insurance. A key ﬁnding is that health shocks account for roughly half of the growth in offer wage inequality over the life cycle. Eliminating health shocks leads to a 5.5% decline in the variance of the present value of earnings across all individuals.
I31|Micro-insurance at Scale: Evidence on Impact from Rwanda|Health insurance protects households from costly health shocks, and by encouraging health seeking behaviour, can safeguard earnings and assets. We confirm that micro-insurance serves as a social safety net by increasing health seeking behavior and reducing out of pocket medical expenses. We find evidence for complementarity between health micro-insurance membership and formal savings activity, confirming positive spillovers between formal financial products. We find substitution between health micro-insurance and informal financial services, where microinsurance crowds out both informal savings and informal borrowings. In obtaining these results, we use instrument variable estimation to correct for the issue of self-selection, an issue that undermines many previous studies. The study uses nationally representative cross-sectional data from Rwandan Integrated Living Conditions Survey conducted in 2005-06 and 2010-11.
I31|Permanent Contracts and Job Satisfaction in Academia: Evidence from European Countries|Temporary contracts are increasingly used in academia. This is a major concern for non-tenured researchers, since weak job security may hamper job satisfaction. In spite of the relevance of this topic, scholarly research on the theme is scant. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the role of academic tenure for job satisfaction of researchers in European countries. The work uses data from the MORE2 survey, a recent large-scale representative survey of researchers in European countries. The results show that, ceteris paribus, academics with a permanent contract are on average more satisfied with their job than those that are employed on a temporary basis. We also show that academic tenure is a relatively more important factor of job satisfaction for researchers at an intermediate stage of the career. Finally, we point out some important differences in the working of the model among European countries. Our hypotheses receive significant empirical support for the groups of Continental EU and Nordic economies, which combine high job satisfaction and good working conditions, on the one hand, with relatively weak job security for younger academics, on the other.
I31|The Joy of Lottery Play: Evidence from a Field Experiment|We conducted a field experiment to increase our understanding of lottery participation. Using representative data for the Netherlands, we find that lottery participation increased the happiness of participants before the draw. Winning a small prize had no effect on happiness. Our results indicate that people may not only care about the outcomes of the lottery, but also enjoy the game. Accordingly, we conclude that lottery play has a utility value in itself and part of the lottery ticket is consumed before the draw.
I31|Unsuccessful subjective well-being assimilation among immigrants: The role of faltering perceptions of the host society|Immigrants in developed countries typically fail to assimilate in terms of subjective well-being, meaning that their happiness and life satisfaction do not substantially increase with their length of stay or across generations, and therefore their subjective well-being remains lower than that of natives. This contrasts with migrants’ own expectations and the predictions of straight-line assimilation theory, along with the general improvement of immigrants’ objective living conditions with their length of stay. Using European Social Survey data, we show that the subjective well-being assimilation of first-generation immigrants in developed European countries is impaired by the gradual development of less positive perceptions of the host country’s economic, political, and social conditions. These faltering societal perceptions particularly affect immigrants whose societal conditions strongly improved by migration and immigrants who arrived after childhood. Faltering societal perceptions continue to impair subjective well-being assimilation across generations. However, compared with natives, first-generation immigrants derive a subjective well-being advantage from their more positive societal perceptions. We attribute these findings to immigrants’ growing aspirations and expectations that follow from their habituation to better conditions in their host country and fewer (more) comparisons to inferior (better) conditions of the people in their home (host) country. Our findings suggest that delaying or decelerating the process of immigrants’ faltering societal perceptions is a promising pathway to improved subjective well-being assimilation and reduced frustration about their perceived lack of progress.
I31|Men. Roots and Consequences of Masculinity Norms|Recent research has uncovered the historical roots of gender norms about women and the persistent effect of such norms on economic development. We find similar long-term effects of masculinity norms: beliefs about the proper conduct of men. We exploit a natural historical experiment in which convict transportation in the 18th and 19th century created a variegated spatial pattern of sex ratios across Australia. We show that in areas that were heavily male-biased in the past (though not the present) more Australians recently voted against same-sex marriage, an institution at odds with traditional masculinity norms. Survey data show that this voting pattern is mostly driven by men. Further evidence indicates that these historically male-biased areas also remain characterized by more violence, excessive alcohol consumption, and occupational gender segregation. We interpret these behaviors as manifestations of masculinity norms that emerged due to intense local male-male competition and that persisted over time.
I31|A Gini Coefficient for Measuring Relative Distributional Inequality in a Collection of Distributions: A Note|In many situations a collection of distributions need to be compared and contrasted. International comparisons of all kinds, be it health, wealth, education, income etc. are essentially about comparing aspects of their respective distributions of those variates of interest. The convergence-polarization and equality of opportunity literatures are similarly concerned with comparing collections of distributions. An aid to such comparisons would be some measure of the extent to which those distributions are collectively different. Here a Gini-like coefficient recording the extent of relative distributional inequality of a collection of (potentially multivariate) distributions is proposed.
I31|The Great Recession and Mental Health: the Effect of Income Loss on the Psychological Health of Young Mothers|There is little consensus as to the effect of recessions on health, which may be due to the heterogenous nature of recessions, the choice of health outcome or the description of the independent variable involved. In contrast to previous work, which has predominantly studied labour market loss, I examine the relationship of income loss and health, and in particular focus on psychological rather than physical health. I study disposable income loss because disposable income is related to consumption expenditure, and therefore satisfaction. Psychological, rather than physical, health is important because younger populations are unlikely to manifest clinical evidence of recession-related disease in the short term. The Irish recession provides me with an opportunity to study the effect of changes in income, since households who remained in employment also experienced changes in disposable income. Using panel data from three waves of the Growing Up in Ireland study, I find that income loss is associated with an increase in depression, but not in parental stress. This effect of income loss is seen for those who are home owners, and subjective reports of being in mortgage or rent arrears is also associated with an increase in depression score.
I31|Subjective well-being and social comparison: A comparative study on rural Thailand and Vietnam|This paper analyzes the determinants of the households’ welfare perception using a survey database on rural areas in Thailand and Vietnam which have similar economic and social conditions. Welfare perception corresponds to the households’ subjective assessment of their general situations. We focus on the social comparison and take into account geographical isolation, relative poverty, harsh living conditions, economic and environmental risks as well as the households’ degree of risk acceptance. Our study shows that households, in both countries, are sensitive to income and relative poverty, but only Thai households are concerned with wealth comparison. In particular, this comparison is asymmetric. Environmental risks as well as households’ attitude to risks differently affect the households’ well-being in both countries. However, we observe a similarity in the effect of the risks’ monetary consequences.
I31|Push no one behind|One of the pillars of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is the pledge to ‘leave no one behind’. This paper argues that we must recognise that many people throughout the world are not just being left behind. They are being pushed even further behind, and their levels of well-being are falling, often in ways from which it is impossible to fully recover. Indeed, many are confronted with forces that lead to their avoidable premature deaths. Thus, development policies should have as their first priority to ensure that no one is pushed behind. The paper argues that this could be secured through a different way of framing economic policy, that focuses on the obligations of states to respect, protect and fulfil economic, social and cultural rights. The paper also highlights the ways in which deprived people are using the human rights system to claim their rights.
I31|Different versions of the Easterlin Paradox: New evidence for European countries|Richer people are happier than poorer people, but when a country becomes richer over time, its people do not become happier. This seemingly contradictory pair of findings of Richard Easterlin has become famous as the Easterlin Paradox. However, it was met with counterevidence. To shed more light on this controversy, we distinguish between five different versions of the paradox. These versions apply to either groups of countries or individual countries, and to either the long or the medium term. We argue that the long term is most appropriate for testing the paradox, and that tests of the paradox should always control for an autonomous time trend. Unfortunately, this requirement renders the long-term version of the paradox for individual countries untestable. We test all other versions of the paradox with Eurobarometer data from 27 European countries. We do so by estimating country-panel equations for mean life satisfaction that include trend and cyclical components of per capita GDP as regressors. When testing variants of the paradox that apply to groups of countries, we find a clear and robust confirmation of the long- and medium-term versions of the paradox for a group of nine Western and Northern European countries. Moreover, we obtain a non-robust rejection of the medium-term variant of the paradox for a set of eleven Eastern European countries. On the level of individual countries, the medium-term variant of the paradox clearly holds for the nine Western and Northern European countries, but is consistently rejected for Greece, Ireland, Italy, and Spain. In the case of the Eastern European countries, the medium-term version of the paradox is rejected for Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Poland. As the Western and Northern European countries have a high per capita GDP as compared to that of Southern and Eastern European countries, our results are in line with the finding of Proto and Rustichini (2013), who find a non-monotonic relation between per capita GDP and life satisfaction over time which is positive for poorer countries, but flat (or negative) for richer countries.
I31|Social capital as disease prevention|Increasing demand for healthcare in developed countries raises concerns about the sustainability of spending on healthcare. Building on epidemiological, medical, economic, sociological and psychological research, I argue that a well-being and social capital crisis largely explains rising healthcare demand. There is compelling evidence that increasing dissatisfaction has caused an increase in morbidity and mortality rates in the US. A main policy recommendation is to tackle declining connections and the spread of social isolation in order to increase well-being and health. I review literature suggesting three domains where policies for social capital can be implemented: urban planning, schooling and regulation of advertising. Moreover, a crisis of trust between physicians and patients underlies the increasing phenomenon of defensive medicine that weighs substantially on healthcare spending. Policies aimed at tackling defensive medicine are discussed
I31|Microsimulation Analysis of Optimal Income Tax Reforms. An Application to New Zealand|This paper examines the optimal direction of marginal income tax reform in the context of New Zealand, which recently reduced its top marginal income tax rate to one of the lowest in the OECD. A behavioural microsimulation model is used, in which social welfare functions are defined in terms of either money metric utility or net income. The model allows for labour supply responses to tax changes, in which a high degree of population heterogeneity is represented along with all the details of the highly complex income tax and transfer system. The implications of the results for specific combinations of tax rate or threshold changes, that are both revenue neutral and welfare improving, are explored in detail, recognising the role of distributional value judgements in determining an optimal reform.The potential impact of additional income responses is also examined, using the concept of the elasticity of taxable income. Results suggest, under a wide range of parameter values and assumptions, that raising the highest income tax rate and/or threshold, would be part of an optimal reform package.
I31|Some Links between Sustainability and Well-Being|Sustainability aims to ensure that people live their lives without compromising the well-being of future generations. Increasing well-being by providing more goods and services to consume is a sustainability challenge. There are two opposing schools of thought on the consumption of natural resources: strong sustainability and weak sustainability. Proponents of strong sustainability emphasize the preservation of natural capital in each period because they argue that it cannot be replaced with any other type of capital. By contrast, weak sustainability scholars argue that natural resource can be consumed to build other forms of capital in which case sustainability requires that the aggregated monetised value of all capital stocks is non-declining or preferably increasing over the time. In this paper, we propose to adopt a balanced approach instead of taking either of these extreme positions where critical natural capital (CNC) limits are defined by strong sustainability and, within that limit, substitutability between various types of capital is allowed for economic efficiency and growth in total wealth. In such frameworks, weak sustainability indicates the minimum sustainability requirement for an economy in which all types of capitals are substitutable under the limits of CNC.
I31|Top incomes and subjective well-being|We use data from the World Wealth \& Income Database, the European Values Surveys and World Values Surveys to estimate the relationship between top income shares and subjective well-being in a sample of 35 countries observed between 1980s and 2010s (139 surveys and more than 200,000 respondents). Results show that top 1\% income shares are positively associated with happiness, but not with life satisfaction. The effect is present in a subsample of Western countries. We discuss possible explanations for the positive association between top income shares and happiness.
I31|The Introduction of Wind Power Generation in a Local Community: An Economic Analysis of Subjective Well-Being Data in Choshi City|In this study, we analyze the external effects of wind turbines, which are often considered detrimental to the promotion of wind power generation. Understanding these externalities is essential for reaching a consensus with residents who live near the planned site of a wind turbine. We conducted a mail survey in Choshi City in Chiba Prefecture to examine the external effects of wind turbines, adopting a subjective well-being index to measure respondents f well-being. Regression analysis suggests that a view of wind power turbines has a positive effect on the subjective well-being of local residents. Moreover, results indicate that such well-being increases with increasing distance from wind turbines. In other words, except for scenic elements, we found that wind turbines are not always considered desirable by residents. As such, it is important to further clarify the external influence of wind turbines as well as other facilities in the neighborhood.
I31|Occupant Well-Being and House Values|"A difficulty in identifying the contribution of structure and neighborhood attributes to the market value of residential property is the lack of data on subjective characteristics of the neighborhood (friendliness of neighbors, proximity to friends and acquaintances) or difficult-to-observe subjective attributes of the structure itself (such as ""curb appeal"" or the presence of unpleasant odors). Concern may also arise from the understanding that the observed market price of most residential property is the result of a process of bargaining. A buyer who is optimistic by nature may assume that the quality of the neighborhood will be wonderful, or that the unusual odor will eventually go away, and therefore be willing to bid a higher price for the structure than a prospective buyer who is more nervous about all the ways that a house purchase can generate disappointment. Estimates of the value of structure or neighborhood attributes may tell us as much about the emotional affect of the buyer as they do about the actual costs or benefits of the attributes (or of cleaning or mitigating them). These observations suggest that incorporating data on the levels of subjective well being (SWB) and emotional affect of the buyers might be usefully applied to improve hedonic analysis of housing markets. The goal of this paper is to undertake such analysis and to explore the potential for improved analysis of the value of residential property. We make use of unique data collected as part of a multi-year analysis of health outcomes, matched with data on market transactions of residential property in three provinces of the Netherlands. We employ the spatial model developed by Kelejian and Prucha (2010) which allows us to incorporate a spatial error specification, as well explicitly control for possible endogeneity between the measure of SWB and the transaction price. By examining aggregate measures of SWB at different spatial scales, we obtain insights into whether these measurements are capturing subjective characteristics of the community, the neighborhood or the structure and the buyer who negotiateover the eventual price."
I31|The social value of information in economies with mandatory savings|We study the value of public information in a stochastic exchange economy where agents trade assets to reallocate risk and mandatory (retirement) savings imposes a lower bound on the market value of some agents' holdings of a nancial asset. Since equilibrium prices depend on the agents' beliefs about the states of nature, the arrival of information shifts the agents' mandatory savings constraints. We show that the arrival of public information can generate an ex-ante Pareto improvement relative to an uninformative equilibrium even when ex-post improvements are not possible.
I31|Unhappiness and Pain in Modern America: A Review Essay, and Further Evidence, on Carol Graham's Happiness for All?|In Happiness for All?, Carol Graham raises disquieting ideas about today's United States. The challenge she puts forward is an important one. Here we review the intellectual case and offer additional evidence. We conclude broadly on the author's side. Strikingly, Americans appear to be in greater pain than citizens of other countries, and most sub-groups of citizens have downwardly trended happiness levels. There is, however, one bright side to an otherwise dark story. The happiness of black Americans has risen strongly since the 1970s. It is now almost equal to that of white Americans.
I31|Is envy harmful to a society's psychological health and wellbeing? A longitudinal study of 18,000 adults|Nearly 100 years ago, the philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell warned of the social dangers of widespread envy. One view of modern society is that it is systematically developing a set of institutions -- such as social media and new forms of advertising -- that make people feel inadequate and envious of others. If so, how might that be influencing the psychological health of our citizens? This paper reports the first large-scale longitudinal research into envy and its possible repercussions. The paper studies 18,000 randomly selected individuals over the years 2005, 2009, and 2013. Using measures of SF-36 mental health and psychological well-being, four main conclusions emerge. First, the young are especially susceptible. Levels of envy fall as people grow older. This longitudinal finding is consistent with a cross-sectional pattern noted recently by Nicole E. Henniger and Christine R. Harris, and with the theory of socioemotional regulation suggested by scholars such as Laura L. Carstensen. Second, using fixed-effects equations and prospective analysis, the analysis reveals that envy today is a powerful predictor of worse SF-36 mental health and well-being in the future. A change from the lowest to the highest level of envy, for example, is associated with a worsening of SF-36 mental health by approximately half a standard deviation (p < .001). Third, no evidence is found for the idea that envy acts as a useful motivator. Greater envy is associated with slower -- not higher -- growth of psychological well-being in the future. Nor is envy a predictor of later economic success. Fourth, the longitudinal decline of envy leaves unaltered a U-shaped age pattern of well-being from age 20 to age 70. These results are consistent with the idea that society should be concerned about institutions that stimulate large-scale envy.
I31|Taking pleasure from neighboursâ€™ misfortune: Comparison effects, social norms and the well-being of the unemployed|The role of relative rank, or interdependent preferences, in explaining individual well-being is a rapidly emerging research area for economists. A typically overlooked issue in this literature is the extent of individual heterogeneity in the degree to which individuals are susceptible to comparison effects. In keeping with the idea that comparison effects are important in the labour market, we find that the well-being of the unemployed is positively correlated with the unemployment of others (neighbourhood unemployment rates), whereas the opposite is true for the population as a whole. The main novelty of this study is that we document significant individual heterogeneity in these effects. Specifically, unemployed males and those with relatively strong social ties in their neighbourhood appear to be much more likely to derive well-being benefits from the unemployment of others. We further show that there are significant differences according to personality traits. We suggest that neglecting to consider individual heterogeneity and focusing on â€˜averageâ€™ effects as is the norm in the literature to date will invariably lead to an incomplete, and perhaps superficial, understanding of the role of comparison effects for individual well-being.
I31|Immigration and self-reported well-being in the UK|Medical liability systems have been accused of increasing health expenditure insofar as they induce the practice of defensive medicine. Despite the large evidence on the role of medical malpractice liability, the identification of its causal effect on physiciansâ€™ treatment decisions is a difficult task. In this paper we study for the first time in a controlled laboratory setting the effect of introducing the risk of being sued for medical malpractice on the provision of physiciansâ€™ medical services. In our experimental sessions both medical and non-medical students choose how many medical services to provide for heterogeneous patients. We implement exogenous variations in the presence of medical malpractice liability and expected probability of being sued, and thus we exploit the within-subject variation in the provision of medical services to infer the causal effect of malpractice liability. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of malpractice liability under different physiciansâ€™ payment methods, which allows us to discuss the interplay between medical liability and payment systems. Our behavioral data show that introducing malpractice liability pressure does lead physicians to choose a higher amount of medical services, regardless of the physiciansâ€™ payment system. However, we also find that the payment system in which malpractice liability is implemented makes the difference under the societal perspective, with relevant implications for health policy.
I31|Giving to Varying Numbers of Others|"Within a modified N person dictator game, we test the extent to which giving behaviour changes as the number of recipients varies. Using a within-subject design, in an incentivised laboratory experiment, individual-level preference parameters are estimated within five alternative utility functions. Both goodness-of-fit and predictive accuracy of each model are analysed, with the ""best"" model identified for each individual. The Dirichlet distribution is proposed as a random behavioural model to rationalise noise; with parameters accounting for differential error arising from the complexity of decision problems. Results show that, on average, participants are willing to give more total payoffs to others as the number of players increase, but not maintain average payoffs to others. Extensive heterogeneity is found in individual preferences, with no model ""best"" fitting all individuals."
I31|The welfare state and liberal democracy: A political economy approach|This paper attempts to shed some light on the developments of welfare states in highly developed nations since WW2 within the context of a narrative which seeks to combine institutional distinctions, termed 'varieties of capitalism', with the historical regimes of regulation theory in a political economy perspective which puts interested political actors at centre stage. It will be argued that in a liberal democracy, the elite has the framing and agenda-setting power to 'manufacture a political will' according to its interests. The welfare state is not the result of a long social struggle on the part of the needy; rather, it results in its general features from the minimal state of meritocratic exigencies. Under the very peculiar circumstances of the post-WW2 era, this even translated into a rise in social welfare spending to more than a third of national income. The particular design of welfare state organisation was the subject-matter of political conflict, and a clear distinction between liberal and coordinated market economies can be attributed to cultural differences and institutional settings. Yet the core of the welfare state conception serves the interest of the meritocracy as much as those who benefit from social programmes and re-distribution. And the neoliberal attack on the welfare state since the 1980s is not a necessary re-calibration due to changing economic conditions or a growing lack of solidarity among the people but an expression of a modified cost-benefit analysis from the elite's perspective.
I31|Enfoque de las capacidades|El enfoque de las capacidades es un marco conceptual apropiado para identificar no la felicidad o satisfacción de las personas, sino más bien, lo que estas pueden o no ser o hacer. En consecuencia, el enfoque de las capacidades se centra en la libertad real de las personas y se aleja (sin excluir) de los medios que permiten la libertad (ingresos y recursos). Sobre la base de lo anterior, el presente documento se fija como objetivo proporcionar una aproximación al enfoque de las capacidades.
I31|The (short-term) individual welfare consequences of an alcohol ban|This paper provides the first empirical analysis of the (short-term) welfare consequences of an alcohol ban. Using subjective well-being data to proxy individual welfare, I apply a regression discontinuity design where the date of the implementation of the ban in the German federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg functions as discontinuity. I find that the ban reduces life satisfaction of the total population and the subpopulation of drinkers, while life satisfaction of nondrinkers is unaffected. My findings are well in line with the rational addiction model perspective.
I31|Financial Stress and Indigenous Australians|We examine the high levels of financial stress among Indigenous populations in Australia. We estimate separate models for the determinants of financial stress for Indigenous and non‐Indigenous households and show the importance of separately considering Indigenous disadvantage. We use these models to build equivalence scales for both groups. We find evidence consistent with financial stress being exacerbated by demand sharing (‘humbugging’). The evidence also suggests that financial stress is reduced by engagement in traditional hunting and gathering activities.
I31|The Long-Lasting Effects of Family and Childhood on Adult Wellbeing: Evidence from British Cohort Data|To what extent do childhood experiences continue to affect adult wellbeing over the life course? Previous work on this link has been carried out either at one particular adult age or for some average over adulthood. We here use two British birth-cohort datasets (the 1958 NCDS and the 1970 BCS) to map out the time profile of the effect of childhood experiences on adult outcomes, including life satisfaction. We find that the effects of many aspects of childhood do not fade away over time but are rather remarkably stable. In both birth-cohorts, child non-cognitive skills are the strongest predictors of adult life satisfaction at all ages. Of these, emotional health is the strongest. Childhood cognitive performance is more important than good conduct in explaining adult life satisfaction in the earlier NCDS cohort, whereas this ranking is inverted in the more recent BCS.
I31|Family matters: involuntary parental unemployment during childhood and subjective well-being later in life|We are the first to examine how parental unemployment experienced during early-, mid- and late-childhood affects adult life satisfaction. Using German household panel data, we find that parental unemployment induced by plant closures and experienced during early (0-5 years) and late (11-15 years) childhood leads to lower life satisfaction at ages 18-31. Nevertheless, parental unemployment can also have a positive effect depending on the age and gender of the child. Our results are robust even after controlling for local unemployment, individual and family characteristics, parental job loss expectations, financial resources, and parents’ working time when growing up. These findings imply that the adverse effects associated with parental unemployment experienced at a young age tend to last well into young adulthood and are more nuanced than previously thought.
I31|Microsimulation Analysis of Optimal Income Tax Reforms. An Application to New Zealand| This paper examines the optimal direction of marginal income tax reform in the context of New Zealand, which recently reduced its top marginal income tax rate to one of the lowest in the OECD. A behavioural microsimulation model is used, in which social welfare functions are defined in terms of either money metric utility or net income. The model allows for labour supply responses to tax changes, in which a high degree of population heterogeneity is represented along with all the details of the highly complex income tax and transfer system. The implications of the results for specific combinations of tax rate or threshold changes, that are both revenue neutral and welfare improving, are explored in detail, recognising the role of distributional value judgements in determining an optimal reform. The potential impact of additional income responses is also examined, using the concept of the elasticity of taxable income. Results suggest, under a wide range of parameter values and assumptions, that raising the highest income tax rate and/or threshold, would be part of an optimal reform package.
I31|What women want (their men to do): Housework and Satisfaction in Australian Households| The time allocated to household chores is substantial, with the burden falling disproportionately upon women. Social norms about how much housework men and women should do are likely to influence couples’ housework allocation decisions and satisfaction. Using Australian data spanning 2001–14, this study employs a two-stage estimation procedure to examine how deviations from housework norms relate to couples’ satisfaction. The study finds that satisfaction is negatively affected by predicted housework time and that women’s satisfaction, but not men’s, is robustly affected by their partners’ residual housework time. When he exceeds housework norms, she is happier with housework allocations, but less happy in broader dimensions. The study suggests several reasons for the results, including that housework is more salient in women’s lives than in men’s, that housework generally is not a preferred activity, and that some degree of gender-norm conformity in regard to housework can positively affect women’s life satisfaction.
I31|Unintended consequences of China's new labor contract law on unemployment and welfare loss of the workers|China's new Labor Contract Law, which intended to strengthen the labor protection for workers, went into effect on January 1, 2008. The law stipulated that the maximum cumulative duration of successive fixed-term (temporary) labor contracts is 10 years, and employees working for the same employer for more than 10 consecutive years are able to secure an open-ended (permanent) labor contract under the new law, which is highly desirable to employees. However, in order to circumvent the new Labor Contract Law, some employers may have dismissed workers, after the passage of the new law, who had worked in the same firm for more than 10 years. Using data from the 2008 China General Social Survey, we find strong evidence that firms did in fact dismiss their formal-contract employees who have been employed for more than 10 years. Additionally, using a regression discontinuity design based on this exogenous change in unemployment status for this particular group of workers, we show that the dismissed workers suffered significant welfare loss in terms of happiness. Our results are robust to various specifications and placebo tests.
I31|Does Female Breadwinning Make Partnerships Less Healthy or Less Stable?|Economists increasingly accept that social norms have powerful effects on human behavior and outcomes. In recent history, one norm widely adhered to in most developed nations has been for men to be the primary breadwinner within mixed-gender households. As women have entered the labor market in greater numbers and gender wage differentials have declined, female breadwinning has become more common in such nations. Has this been accompanied by worse outcomes in non-monetary realms, due to the violation of the male breadwinning norm? This would be evidence that norms act to slow the pace of social evolution. We use household data from two countries to examine whether female breadwinning makes partnerships less healthy or less stable. US data from the late twentieth century shows that female breadwinning is associated with significantly more partnership problems for older couples in cross-sections and for younger couples in fixed-effects specifications. Examining more recent US and Australian data, we find that female breadwinning is associated with a modestly higher dissolution risk and a fall in some measures of reported relationship quality, but mainly for young people in cohabiting partnerships and men in less educated partnerships. We interpret these results to reflect changing social norms, plus relationship market dynamics arising from differences in the ease of access to superior partnership alternatives for women who out-earn their partners. While gender-specific breadwinning norms may be fading with time, economic realities and marriage market dynamics continue to be drivers of behavior and outcomes.
I31|Younger and Dissatisfied? Relative Age and Life-satisfaction in Adolescence|This is the first study to investigate whether age gaps between classmates (that is, relative age) affect life-satisfaction gaps in adolescence. To this end, we analyse data from the multi-country Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) survey. We find evidence that relative age negatively impacts adolescents’ life-satisfaction. A twelve-month age gap decreases life-satisfaction, rated on a 0-10 scale, by 0.3 points. This negative effect is consistent across countries. Finally, this negative effect does not decrease with the increase in absolute age.
I31|Under Pressure? Assessing the Roles of Skills and Other Personal Resources for Work-Life Strains|Many working parents struggle to balance the demands of their jobs and family roles. Although we might expect that additional resources would ease work-family constraints, theory and evidence regarding resources have been equivocal. This study uses data on working mothers and fathers—as well as their cohabiting partners/spouses—from the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey to investigate how personal resources in the form of skills, cognitive abilities, and personality traits affect work-life strains. It considers these along with standard measures of economic, social, and personal resources, and estimates seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) models of work-life strains for employed mothers and fathers that account for correlations of the couple’s unobserved characteristics. The SUR estimates indicate that computer skills reduce work-life strains for mothers, that math skills reduce strains for fathers, and that the personality traits of extraversion, conscientiousness, and emotional stability reduce strains for both parents. However, the estimates also indicate that better performance on a symbol look-up task, which tests attention, visual scanning acuity, and motor speed, increases fathers’ work-life strains.
I31|Wasted! Resource recovery and waste management in Cuba|The collection of solid waste and the recovery of recyclable material from waste belong to the many challenges Cuba has been facing over the past years. In this paper, we give a short account of the actual waste situation and analyze the causes of the obvious deficiencies of the waste sector. We conducted a small survey in Havana city in order to assess peoples awareness of the garbage problem, their appraisal of the actual situation and their willingness to contribute personally to an improvement of the waste situation. Based on the insights gained from this survey and from our theoretical analysis of the Cuban waste management we develop suggestions for an improvement of the waste situation in Cuba. These suggestions take into account that the financial means available for a reform of the waste management system in Cuba are severely restricted. Therefore, our suggestions are more focused on organizational and motivational changes than on the introduction of high technology.
I31|Income inequality and saving in a class society: The role of ordinal status|This paper examines the impact of income growth and income inequality on household saving rates and payoffs in a non-cooperative game where each player's payoff depends on her present and future consumption and her rank in the present-consumption distribution. The setting is a pooling equilibrium with three clusters of successive income groups, each cluster having its own present-consumption standard and rank in the present-consumption distribution. In this way the analysis addresses the saving behaviour and welfare of three social classes: the lower, middle and upper class. The author finds explanations for the Easterlin paradox and the Kuznets consumption puzzle and concludes that rank concerns tend to weaken the standard effect of inequality on aggregate saving.
I31|Keeping up with the e-Joneses: Do online social networks raise social comparisons?|Online social networks such as Facebook disclose an unprecedented volume of personal information amplifying the occasions for social comparisons. We test the hypothesis that the use of social networking sites (SNS) increases people's dissatisfaction with their income. After addressing endogeneity issues, our results suggest that SNS users have a higher probability to compare their achievements with those of others. This effect seems stronger than the one exerted by TV watching, it is particularly strong for younger people, and it affects men and women in a similar way.
I31|Consumption smoothing and the welfare cost of uncertainty|Separating the effects of uncertainty from realised events, and identifying the welfare effects of uncertainty, present a number of empirical challenges. Combining individuallevel panel data from rural Ethiopia with high-resolution meteorological data, we introduce a new proxy for income uncertainty - mean-preserving rainfall variability - and estimate that an increase in income uncertainty is associated with reductions in objective consumption and subjective well-being (SWB). Furthermore, 86% of the effect on SWB is attributed to the direct effects of uncertainty, consistent with a model of optimal expectations (Brunnermeier and Parker, 2005). In addition, we find that farmers in more uncertain environments are more resilient to realised rainfall shocks, consistent with a trade-off between optimism about the future and risk-management investments today. These findings suggest that the gains from further consumption smoothing are likely greater than estimates based solely on realised consumption fluctuations.
I31|Behavior in reverse: reasons for return migration| Received research shows numerous motives for migration, but fewer reasons for return migration. This paper aims to correct this imbalance. Twelve reasons for return migration are presented and discussed briefly. The reasons listed are derived from research on migration conducted by the author in the course of the past three and a half decades. The purpose of the paper is to pull together the insights gained from that research so as to formulate a base for future inquiry, both analytical and empirical. In addition, just as research on motives for migration can help to establish the reasons for return migration, research on the latter can help to deepen understanding of the former. Moreover, in a great many circumstances and for a variety of reasons, countries that host migrants may want them to leave. In such circumstances, enacting policies that align with motives for return migration will be more efficient than devising measures that are independent of these motives.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
I31|The Effects of a Parenting Program on Maternal Well-Being: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial|This paper evaluates how the Triple P parenting program affects maternal well-being. We analyze data from a randomized controlled trial and a separate sample of mothers from a deprived neighborhood without a control group. For the latter, we generate a control group using SOEP survey data and evaluate the validity of this procedure. Overall, our results show a positive effect of Triple P on maternal well-being – with the largest effects appearing three years after treatment. Thus, we illustrate that maternal well-being is an additional channel through which parenting programs, as examples of early childhood interventions, benefit families.
I31|Smoking Bans, Leisure Time, and Subjective Well-being|During 2007 and 2008 smoking bans were gradually implemented in all of Germany’s sixteen federal states to prohibit smoking in bars, restaurants, and dance clubs. Aimed at reducing smoking and improving health, tobacco control policies are often controversially discussed as they entail potential side effects. We exploit regional variation to identify effects of smoking bans on life satisfaction and leisure time satisfaction. Difference-in-differences estimates reveal that predicted smokers who used to visit bars regularly are less satisfied with life and leisure time, following the enforcement of a smoking ban. We show that changes in use of leisure time likely explain these findings. On the contrary, predicted non-smokers who did not visit bars and restaurants frequently benefit from the smoking bans, as their satisfaction with leisure time increases. They show an increase in hours spent on free-time activities and are more likely to go out with smoking bans in effect.
I31|Prekarität in Deutschland?!|Vor dem Hintergrund der sozialen Marktwirtschaft wird Prekarität als eine Folge von arbeitsmarkt- und sozialpolitischen Veränderungen diskutiert. Es wird bilanziert, dass der soziale Zusammenhalt der Arbeitsgesellschaft in Deutschland gefährdet ist. Im Anschluss an diese Diskussion geht die vorliegende Studie empirisch der Frage nach, ob ein Prekariat existiert: Gibt es Personengruppen, die trotz Erwerbstätigkeit dauerhaft in Unsicherheit leben? Konzentriert sich Prekarität hauptsächlich auf geringqualifizierte Personen oder ist sie vor allem an bestimmte Lebensphasen und -übergänge gebunden? Damit Prekarität in ihren verschiedenen Facetten und Abstufungen erfasst werden kann, wird in dem vorliegenden Papier ein umfassendes Set an Indikatoren zur quantitativen, multidimensionalen Messung von (kumulativer) Prekarität vorgestellt. Auf Basis des Sozioökonomischen Panels (SOEP) werden je sieben Indikatoren operationalisiert, mit denen sowohl prekäre Beschäftigung als auch prekäre Haushaltslagen erfasst und im Zeitverlauf (1993-2012) analysiert werden können. Damit soll der Grundstein für eine quantitative Analyse von Prekarität gelegt werden, um vor diesem Hintergrund die Institutionen des Arbeitsmarkts und der sozialen Sicherung zukünftig neu bewerten zu können.
I31|Unemployment and social exclusion|This paper analyzes the economic and social consequences of job loss which contribute to exclusion from society based on German linked survey and administrative data. To study the causal relationship between unemployment and multiple dimensions of social marginalization, I combine inverse propensity score weighting with a difference-in-differences approach. The results suggest that job loss has particularly detrimental effects on the subjective perception of social integration, life satisfaction, the access to economic resources and mental health. Moreover, this paper shows that becoming unemployed hinders the fulfillment of psychosocial needs that are typically associated with working, such as social status and higher self-efficacy. The effects of job loss are long-lasting, growing more profound the longer the duration of unemployment and persisting following reemployment. Looking at effect heterogeneity, I find that having a partner and being highly educated reduces the negative effects of job loss.
I31|Looking for the Bright Side of the China Syndrome: Rising Export Opportunities and Life Satisfaction in China|"China's increased export capacity in recent decades has disrupted developed-country labor markets and the well-being of workers exposed to foreign competition. We here attempt to complete the assessment of the social and human consequences of globalization by exploring the other side of this ""China syndrome"". We evaluate the extent to which increased export opportunities have influenced well-being in China using panel data on approximately 25,000 adults across 122 Chinese localities in 2010, 2012 and 2014. The results show that perceived life satisfaction rises significantly as local export markets grow. This effect goes beyond higher local GDP per capita and individual incomes."
I31|Agencia y pobreza en la población económicamente activa mexicana|En esta investigación se subraya la importancia de la libertad de agencia para mejorar los niveles de pobreza en la población económicamente activa mexicana. Consideramos que la libertad de agencia es una condición básica para reducir la pobreza y mejorar el bienestar en nuestra sociedad. Hemos elegido un espacio particular en el cual se desenvuelven 54,696,638 personas en México, que conforman el mundo de la población económicamente activa. Tomamos como proxy de libertad de agencia a la responsabilidad, dentro de sus tres categorías: responsabilidad anterior (ex–ante), responsabilidad posterior (ex-post) y responsabilidad autrui (ex–aliud). Los resultados muestran que en México hace falta responsabilidad autrui por parte de las instituciones y empresas y responsabilidad posterior del trabajador. Los bajos niveles en estos dos tipos de responsabilidad no permiten avanzar ni en el mejoramiento de las condiciones de empleo ni en los niveles de pobreza de los trabajadores no cualificados.
I31|Financing the War on Cancer|We estimate the potential gains of life-extending treatments to life insurance companies and apply it to immunotherapy. These treatments promise to dramatically raise durable survival rates for a growing number of cancer patients but are often prohibitively expensive for patients and governments alike. Our main insight is that life insurance companies have a direct benefit from such treatments as they lower the insurer’s liabilities by pushing the death benefit further into the future and raise future premium income. Using detailed survival data from clinical studies, we quantify the insurers’ benefit from immunotherapy for melanoma patients. Extrapolating to 17 other cancer sites, we estimate the insurance sector’s benefit to equal $6.8 billion a year. We discuss various financing mechanisms that exploit this value creation, which depend on the relative bargaining power of insurers and consumers. Moreover, the potential gains for life insurers, which could only accrue if health insurers cover the cost of the treatments and households finance the out-of-pocket expenditure, may warrant some exploration of new boundaries between life and health insurance. We discuss the broader implications for medical innovation and long-term care insurance markets.
I31|Retirement concerns and planning of cooperative members: a study in the Dutch healthcare sector|Abstract Retirement planning is a key component in achieving goals and fulfilling expectations. Although several socioeconomic and psychological factors associated with retirement planning have been reported in the literature, little is known about the influence that specific retirement-related issues have on retirement planning. We examine the influence of five concerns—the individual’s financial situation, living situation, care provision, health condition, and loneliness—on retirement planning. In addition, we investigate the influence of these concerns on individuals’ perceptions of their ideal post-retirement situations in terms of financial standards. Our dataset is derived from a 2010 web-based survey of the care and well-being sector in the Netherlands.
I31|Ethnicity and risk sharing network formation: Evidence from rural Viet Nam|Ethnic inequality remains a persistent challenge for Viet Nam. This paper aims at better understanding this ethnic gap through exploring the formation of risk sharing networks in rural areas. It first investigates the differences in risk sharing networks between the ethnic minorities and the Kinh majority, in terms of size and similarity attributes of the networks. Second, it relies on the concept of ethnic homophily in link formation to explain the mechanisms leading to those differences. In particular, it disentangles the effect of demographic and local distribution of ethnic groups on risk-sharing network formation from cultural and social distance between ethnic groups, while controlling for the disparities in the geographical environment. Results show that ethnic minorities have smaller and less diversified networks than the majority. This is partly explained by differences in wealth and in the geographical environment. But ethnicity also plays a direct role in risk-sharing network formation through the combination of preferences to form a link with people from the same ethnic group (inbreeding homophily) and the relative size of ethnic groups conditioning the opportunities to form a link (baseline homophily). Inbreeding homophily is found to be stronger among the Kinh majority, leading to the exclusion of ethnic minorities from Kinh networks, which are supposed to be more efficient to cope with covariant risk because they are more diversified in the occupation and location of their members. This evidence suggests that inequalities among ethnic groups in Viet Nam are partly rooted in the cultural and social distances between them.
I31|Do Rich Parents Enjoy Children Less?|We investigate the role of individual labor income as a moderator of parental subjective well-being trajectories before and after the first childbirth in Germany, a very low fertility country. Analyzing German Socioeconomic Panel Survey data, we found that income matters negatively for parental subjective well-being after childbirth, though with important differences by education and gender. In particular, among better educated parents, the richer see the arrival of a child more negatively. These findings contribute to the debate on the relationship between income and fertility adding information on how parents perceive the birth of a child beyond the strict financial cost of childbearing and raising. Results are discussed in terms of preferences among different groups of parents, costs of children, and work and family balance. Results are robust to potential endogeneity between income and childbirth, as well as for alternative measures of income.
I31|The Impact of Minimum Wages on Well-Being: Evidence from a Quasi-Experiment in Germany|To analyze well-being effects of minimum wages, the introduction of a minimum wage in Germany in 2015 is used as a quasi-experiment. Based on the representative SOEP data, a difference-in-differences design compares the development of life, job, and pay satisfaction between those who are affected by the reform according to their pre-intervention wages and those who already have marginally higher wages so that they are not directly affected. The results show that the minimum wage has significantly positive effects on all considered dimensions of well-being, on average, with an increase in life satisfaction by 0.10 standard deviations (0.15 points on a ten-point Likert scale). Positive effects last at least until one year after the reform. Life satisfaction tends to increase particularly in the region that is overall economically less developed (East Germany). The results hold if those who are not employed anymore after the reform are included in the analysis.
I31|The (Short-Term) Individual Welfare Consequences of an Alcohol Ban|This paper provides the first empirical analysis of the (short-term) welfare consequences of an alcohol ban. Using subjective well-being data to proxy individual welfare, I apply a regression discontinuity design where the date of the implementation of the ban in the German federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg functions as discontinuity. I find that the ban reduces life satisfaction of the total population and the subpopulation of drinkers, while life satisfaction of nondrinkers is unaffected. My findings are well in line with the rational addiction model perspective.
I31|Are Retirees More Satisfied? – Anticipation and Adaptation Effects of Retirement on Subjective Well-Being: A Panel Analysis for Germany|Quality of life and satisfaction with life are of particular importance for individuals as well as for society concerning the “demographic change” with now longer retirement periods. This study will contribute to the life satisfaction discussion and quantifies life satisfaction and pattern of explanation before and after such a prominent life cycle event, the entrance into retirement. In particular, with the individual longitudinal data and 33 waves of the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and the appropriate microeconometric causal fixed effects robust panel methods we ask and quantify if actual life satisfaction indeed is decreasing before retirement, is increasing at the entrance into retirement, and is decreasing then after certain periods back to a fore-going level. Thus, we ask if such an anticipation and adaptation pattern– as known from other prominent events – is also to discover for life satisfaction before and after retirement in Germany. Main result: Individual and family situation lift life satisfaction after retirement for many years, the (former) occupational situation, however, absorbs this effect both for pensioners and civil service pensioners. It remains only one period of improvement with close anticipation and adaptation at entering retirement but no furthermore significant change compared to pre-retirement life satisfaction. This holds for pensioners (German pension insurance, GRV) but there is no significant effect at all for civil service pensioners.
I31|Income Distribution in Latin America. The Evolution in the Last 20 Years: A Global Approach|While Latin America has historically been considered a region of very high inequality, the performance of most Latin American countries in terms of reduction of income inequality has been remarkable good in the first decade of this century. Given that those improvements took place in a context of rising inequality in most of the world, the evolution of income inequality in the region has caught the attention of researchers and policy makers around the world. Taking advantage of a large database of comparable microdata from household surveys, this article updates the evidence on the trends of income inequality in all Latin American countries for the period 1992-2015. It also provides an analysis of how the distinctive evolution of income inequality in this century in Latin America has changed the position of the different countries of the region in both, the global distribution of income in the world and the global distribution of income in Latin America. Finally, the paper decomposes the evolution of income inequality in several countries of the region, discussing the role played by several factors on that evolution.
I31|Male Reproductive Health, Fairness and Optimal Policies|Based on epidemiological evidence, we consider an economy where agents differ through their ability to procreate. Households with impaired fertility may incur health expenditures to increase their chances of parenthood. This health heterogeneity generates welfare inequalities that deserve to be ruled out. We explore three different criteria of social evaluation in the long-run: the utilitarian approach, which considers the well- being of all households, the ex-ante egalitarian criterion, which considers the expected well-being of the worst-off social group, and the ex-post egalitarian one, which only considers the realized well-being of the worst- off. In an overlapping generations model, we propose a set of economic instruments to decentralize each solution. To correct for the externality and inequalities, both a preventive (a taxation of capital) and a redistributive policy are required.
I31|Early Lessons in Implementing the Sustainable Development Goals in India: The Example of Assam|Assam has made vigorous efforts since 2015 towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Cognizant of the state’s weak progress in development, its recent governments – irrespective of political affiliation– adopted the SDGs and Assam became the first state in India to do so. The paper discusses in detail the steps taken so far which include developing an overall vision of an SDG-fulfilled Assam in 2030; preparing a comprehensive strategy in a participatory fashion to achieve that vision; and steps taken to implement and monitor the strategy. The Assam experience has many important lessons. These include the criticality of motivating staff at all levels to instill the SDGs in every aspect of their work and the role of leadership in this respect; proactively forging partnerships with all stakeholders including the legislature and the judiciary and creating an environment for such partnerships to flourish; the general need for adopting a result and outcome-based development process that the SDGs represent abandoning narrow departmental and output-based activity and practice. These would require initiating institutional and organizational changes including to ensure that major improvements take place in project implementation processes. Also essential is inculcating a culture of innovation –including technological innovation–in every sphere of public service; and developing effective coordinating mechanisms to ensure that all concerned stakeholders work synergistically to achieve the SDG outcomes. Also, very critical is the role of national and global partners in supporting Assam’s earnest efforts as the resource, knowledge and capacity gaps that Assam faces are too large for it to fill through its own means –even with its best efforts.
I31|Social emotional learning in the classroom: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of PERSPEKT 2.0|Social emotional learning programs have been found to lead to immediate improvements in cognitive, social and emotional competences. Meanwhile, most evidence to date refers to the United States, and most other countries lack locally tailored teaching materials for socio-emotional learning. Further, there is a lack of knowledge about which subgroups benefit more. Such knowledge is important, because it could provide evidence relevant for both explaining and addressing inequality in educational achieving across subgroups of pupils. Knowledge about longer-term impacts on academic achievement is also called for. This protocol describes an experimental evaluation of a recently developed social emotional learning program implemented in Denmark. The evaluation combines survey data with register-based data, where the latter source allows for tracking of participant outcomes with minimal risk of attrition.
