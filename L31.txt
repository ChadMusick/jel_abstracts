L31|Activism and Trade|This paper studies the effect of activism on the imports of consumer products, by focusing on an event which generated massive consumer mobilization against neglecting firms, namely the collapse of the Rana Plaza building affecting the textile industry in Bangladesh. We hypothesize that this episode was a main shock in the perceived quality of clothing producers sourcing in Bangladesh. Using detailed import flows on textile goods from OECD countries, we analyze whether the imports of consumer products were affected by the disclosure of information, in countries differently exposed to the collapse. To proxy the amount of information received by individuals in different countries, we use the nationality of the firms involved in the Rana Plaza building: soon after the disaster, NGOs and the media insisted on the origin countries of the neglecting companies, publishing the list of misbehaving firms by nationality. We use a difference-indifference approach to compare the imports from Bangladesh of countries having been differently associated in the news to the Rana Plaza collapse. Results show a post-disaster decrease in imports for countries whose firms were directly involved in the Rana Plaza building. The effect has to be interpreted relatively to the evolution of imports of similar countries, however not linked to the collapsed Rana Plaza knitting factories. While aggregate imports from Bangladesh continue to increase during the whole period (2010-2016), there is a marked disruption that affects countries whose brands were named and shamed by activists and the media after the disaster. No such differential pattern is observed for non-textile goods. Our results are robust to a variety of checks.
L31|Market Segmentation by Certification: Quantity effects on tropical timber production|Eco-certification standards are increasingly used by industrial countries to impose import restrictions on goods produced by foreign suppliers. Import restrictions on eco-certified goods that prevent the trade of goods derived from unsustainable practices serve to segment global markets served by foreign producers into a conventional market and a certified market, altering market structure and equilibrium prices in a manner that potentially works against sustainability goals. In this paper, we examine the effect of forest certification on tropical timber production in Central Africa. Using panel data of timber production in Cameroon from 2003 to 2009, we show that conventional timber producers substantially increase harvest rates in response to eco-certification standards, and that this effect is strongest in less competitive timber markets. Moreover, we find eco-certification shifts production to forests with higher extraction costs and potentially higher marginal damages from timber extraction, exacerbating economic inefficiency.
L31|Rôle de l’Innovation Sociale dans le Développement Socioéconomique au Maroc : Premières Constatations à partir de la Littérature, et Etude de Cas de 4 Associations Socialement Innovantes|Role of Social Innovation in Socioeconomic Development in Morocco: First Findings from the Literature, and 4 Case Studies of Socially Innovative Associations Innovation has always been a concept related to science and technology. For Schumpeter, the founding father of innovation, it is a means at the service of economic performance in businesses. He also considers that any innovation, even scientific or technological, has a social character. This character has grown over the decades, as innovation has also become capable of addressing social, human and 5 environmental challenges. This “Socialization” process of innovation gave birth to Social Innovation in the 1970s in an environment characterized by new social demands and profound economic and political changes. The goal of Social Innovation is to find new ways (goods, services, ideas ...) to satisfy social needs unmet by the market and / or the State, for the benefit of disadvantaged individuals and groups. In Morocco, the situation is not better. The country is currently suffering from serious problems in all domains: growing social inequalities, progressive reduction of the State's efforts in some important social domains like education and health… which lead to several claims and citizens movements that sometimes express new social demands. These claims, if not taken seriously into consideration, can destabilize the country and put in danger its social cohesion already in a breakdown. Therefore, it is a question of appealing to new alternative models of territorial development, and to base them on principles and practices of Social Innovation. In this context, we will try to know what role Social Innovation plays in socio-economic development in Morocco, from the exploration of the existing literature, and the realization of 4 case studies of socially innovative associations in Morocco.
L31|Partnering with Civil Society Organizations. The role of volunteers and not for profit organizations in the provision of welfare services|The purpose of this article is to make a distinctive contribution to the emergence of a new form of partnership between municipalities and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs). These collaborations are articulated at the border between the public and the society as well as between the formal and the informal economy. We revise the Esping-Andersen paradigm about the three main welfare regimes, where the welfare state, the family and the market are seen as three sources of managing social risks (Esping-Andersen, 1999), and we illustrate how the collaboration between CSOs and local administrations might improve the connection between the state and the citizens. In the perspective of the Third Sector Reform, which is actually underway in Italy, the hybridization of different forms of organizations could bring innovative solutions to the new real social risks of the communities. Specifically, this form of collaboration between local public administrations and the CSOs is part of the theme of volunteering and social citizenship, which advocates citizens’ empowerment in the production of social welfare and services of general interest. This area of collaboration is positioned between social rights and social obligations and provides a contribution that fosters the redistributive capacity of the public sphere through a participatory policy making.
L31|Workers BuyOut: why employee-owned enterprises are more resilient than corporate business in time of economic and financial crisis? The case of Emilia-Romagna Region|The Workers BuyOut (WBO) is an economic and social phenomenon that has developed since the beginning of the 2008 financial and economic crisis and is still growing. In Italy, its roots can be traced back to the 1970s and today journalists and politicians are publishing reportages and books on this phenomenon. Inside the Italian scientific community, also some economists have dedicated accurate but rare studies to the topic. Nevertheless, the WBO has not yet become the focus of a precise and in-depth research by sociologists, despite its evident social relevance. The present paper is the result of a sociological investigation carried out by the authors and aims at illustrating this phenomenon through the lens of organizational analysis. It is structured in five sections: a general introduction; a description of the phenomenon at the national level, through the analysis of its normative grounds and its quantitative dimensions; a more detailed description of the WBO in EmiliaRomagna Region; a focus on the case study of one firm that turned into a successful WBO; a critical conclusion, highlighting the main incentives and obstacles for the full development of WBO experiences.
L31|Networks of relations in Migori County (Kenya). Some findings on health and nutrition topics|Are Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques useful to identify and map relations among key actors in development areas? In particular, is this technique able to disentangle the complexity of formal and informal actors involved in health and nutrition issues? Using this methodology we map relations among formal and informal actors living in Kenya, in Migori County. The analysis aims at detecting how different actors (i.e. institutions, community health workers and income generating activities groups) interact in order to share knowledge and information on health and nutrition projects. In this way we identify the main characteristics of the relations and understand how to enforce strengths and to reduce weaknesses, in order to enforce the projects implemented.
L31|Where Does the Fairtrade Money Go? How Much Consumers Pay Extra for Fairtrade Coffee and How This Value Is Split along the Value Chain|Fairtrade certification aims at transferring wealth from the consumer to the farmer; however, coffee passes through many hands before reaching final consumers. Bringing together retail, wholesale, and stock market data, this study estimates how much more consumers are paying for Fairtrade-certified coffee in US supermarkets and finds estimates around $1 per lb. I then assess how this price premium is split between the different stages of the value chain: most of the premium goes to the roaster's profit margin, while the retailer surprisingly makes smaller absolute profits on Fairtrade-certified coffee, compared to conventional coffee. The coffee farmer receives about a fifth of the price premium paid by the consumer, but it is unclear how much of this (quantity-dependent) benefit goes toward the payment of (quantity-independent) license fees.
L31|The number but not the variety of nonprofit organizations affects donations: evidence from an experiment|We provide experimental evidence on the effect of competition among nonprofit organizations on the total and the per capita amount of collected donations. We vary the number of organizations in competition, their type, i.e., nonprofit associations and community foundations, and their charitable purposes, i.e., to help people with economic difficulties or disabilities. We show that the number but not the variety of nonprofit organizations positively affects the total collected donations. Moreover, we find that the latter is inelastic to the increase in the number of organizations in the competition, which increases the total collected donations but reduces the per capita donations.
L31|The Human-Centred Business Model and Hybrid Business Forms: A Primer and a Roadmap|The paper was written as part of the preliminary research for the Human Centred Business Model Project, a project developed within the Global Forum on Law, Justice and Development and now supported by the OECD Development Centre. In a preliminary fashion, the paper skims the surface of â€˜socialâ€™ businesses, in the broadest sense, around the world, identifying some general trends and commonalities and some differences. The paper covers jurisdictions from North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia and describes the organisations that can be used to carry out social business.
L31|Escaping from the poverty trap with social innovation: a social microcredit programme in Hungary|This paper describes a Hungarian social microcredit programme, called Kiútprogram and discusses the major lessons drawn from its operation. It was launched some 10 years ago as an adaptation of the Grameen model to the Hungarian circumstances to decrease the level of prejudice and discrimination against the Roma and improve their living conditions in the most remote, deprived areas of Hungary; microlending has been understood and introduced as a device to achieve these aims –and not as a profit-seeking business activity.During the almost ten-year long learning process, from the simple adaptation of the Grameen model the Kiútprogram has arrived to the denial of the most important features of joint liability in group lending, namely the application of the devices of social collateral. Experience has also shown that a loan itself is not sufficient to assist escaping fromthe poverty trap. Without knowledge transfer and without inter-community connection building –at least in the case of discriminated minorities –the effect of the loan may even be detrimental. In a modern society not only physical, but also social and cultural capital is needed to run a successful business in the formal sector of the economy.In the Kiútprogram’s model the loan plays a crucial role in escaping from the aspiration trap, and thus helps overcome learned helplessness. Loans without any –financial or social –collateral signal that the lender trusts the client, not only in her honesty, but also in her abilities. This method of lending strongly suggests to the clients the conviction that she is able of achieving a business success. Neither financial aid, nor loan with (social) collateral is suitable to reach this effect.
L31|In and beyond the locality : policy and social responses to water pollution health hazards in China|This article investigates the interaction process between policy and social responses to water pollution health hazards in China, focusing on the case of the Huai River Basin. Since the 1970s, rural communities in the basin have suffered from persistent water pollution health hazards. Through a critical review of the interactions between policy and practices, this article reveals how these two approaches coevolved in the cooperative sphere, that is, a quasi-public sphere under fragmented authoritarianism in China supported by the state, media and environmental non-governmental organizations to address the ecological disaster in and beyond the basin. Additionally, a disconnect between practices in the locality and the policy beyond it can be observed as another side of fragmentation in the field of environment and health issues. Grassroots “micropolitics” such as dialogue, negotiation, cooperation with polluters and local authorities, and innovation as an alternative to the official public work based on social and ecological knowledge are examined to overcome this fragmentation.
L31|Fostering savings by commitment: Evidence from a quasi‐natural experiment at the Small Enterprise Foundation in South Africa|We study the effects of a pilot project that strengthened the saving incentive mechanisms set up by the Small Enterprise Foundation (SEF), a leading microfinance institution based in South Africa. The program aimed at introducing a stimulus to save in the form of the possession of “Goal Card” whereby clients owning this tool were asked to identify a saving goal and to commit to a regular saving amount. The experiment had quasinatural approach, as it has been implemented by SEF in selected locations starting from May 2015. Difference in differences estimates show an improvement in the savings performance of the SEF customers treated with the program, compared to the counterfactual. Besides the evaluation of the program’s main effects, we investigate the clients’ understanding of the pilot and their attitude towards saving, as well as the quality of the pilot’s administration and its operational challenges, through the administration and analysis of surveys conducted on both the treated and control groups of clients.
L31|Delegation and Coordination with Multiple Threshold Public Goods: Experimental Evidence|When multiple charities, social programs and community projects simultaneously vie for funding, donors risk miscoordinating their contributions leading to an inefficient distribution of funding across projects. Community chests and other intermediary organizations facilitate coordination among donors and reduce such risks. We explore such considerations by extending the threshold public goods framework to allow donors to contribute to an intermediary rather than directly to the public goods. We experimentally study the effects of the intermediary on contributions and successful public good funding. Results show that delegation increases overall contributions and public good success, but only when the intermediary is formally committed to direct funding received from donors to socially beneficial goods. Without such a restriction, the presence of an intermediary is detrimental, resulting in lower contributions, a higher probability of miscoordination, and lower payoffs.
L31|Boosting social entrepreneurship and social enterprise development in the Netherlands: In-depth policy review|This report provides an in-depth analysis of the Dutch policy ecosystem in place for socialentrepreneurship and social enterprises. It identifies the country’s key strengths andchallenges and provides policy recommendations to support the development of a strongerpolicy ecosystem for social entrepreneurship and social enterprises in the country. Keypolicy issues analysed include: clarifying the conceptual framework (Chapter 2); formallyrecognising social enterprises and boosting social entrepreneurship (Chapter 3);promoting social impact measurement and reporting (Chapter 4); developing socialentrepreneurial capacity and skills (Chapter 5); improving access to markets and finance(Chapters 6 and 7); and ensuring sustainable institutional support for socialentrepreneurship and social innovation (Chapter 8).
L31|Boosting social entrepreneurship and social enterprise development in Lithuania: In-depth policy review|This review provides an in-depth analysis of the Lithuanian policy ecosystem in place for social entrepreneurship and social enterprises. It identifies the country’s key strengths and challenges and provides policy recommendations to support the development of a stronger policy ecosystem for social entrepreneurship and social enterprises. Key policy issues analysed include: raising awareness and clarifying the conceptual framework (Chapter 2); coordinating policy and legal frameworks (Chapter 3); enhancing the role of social enterprises in public procurement (Chapter 4); promoting social impact measurement and reporting (Chapter 5); and improving their access to finance (Chapter 6).
L31|Enabling Civil Society: Select survey findings|Civil society and civil society organisations (CSOs) are important to development co-operation, both as implementing partners for members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), and as development actors in their own right. Agenda 2030 is clear on the necessity of mobilising CSOs to implement, and uphold accountability for, the Sustainable Development Goals. The Global Partnership for Effective Development Co operation has committed to ensuring effectiveness in relation to CSOs in development co-operation, inclusive of the provision of CSO enabling environments.Recognising that how DAC members work with CSOs is part of CSO enabling environments, in 2017 the OECD Development Co-operation Directorate (DCD) established a work stream on civil society to provide guidance on DAC member support for civil society and a strategy for engaging with civil society. Under the work stream, a study on how DAC members work with CSOs was launched to identify areas of DAC member support to and engagement with CSOs for which guidance is needed. This paper introduces a selection of key findings and recommendations from two 2018-2019 surveys complemented with DAC statistical data.The paper points to evidence of member effort to work with CSOs in ways that enable CSOs to maximise their contribution to development. However, evidence also shows that members need to continuously examine their practices to ensure coherence between objectives and the many advantages that CSOs are seen to bring to development, and the members’ means of support to and engagement with CSOs.
L31|Mapping the emergence of a new research field: an exploration of the intellectual structure of the B Corp research|The paper explores the emergence of a new research field, implementing a bibliometric analysis of the literature on the B Corp. We built a database including 82 articles collected by Scopus and published from 2009 to 2019 that discuss the B Corp, or the benefit corporation, or, more generally, social entrepreneurship. We performed descriptive and citation analyses, with the objective of identifying the roots and the evolution of the concept of B Corp. This emergent field is an important component of the structural change occurring in our society, which, in recent years, has seen the emergence of new for-profit organizational forms with a strong social consciousness. The bibliometric analysis reveals the foundational works and the historical evolution of the research field, which, while rooted in the corporate social responsibility literature, opened up into the analysis of how the legislation, the firmâ€™s strategy, the entrepreneurial orientation, and the policy interventions are intertwined in the concrete development of socially and environmentally conscious businesses.
L31|Corporate social responsibility and strategic trade policy: an endogenous timing game and its policy implications|This study incorporates the corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives of a domestic firm and analyzes strategic trade policy toward a foreign firm in a different market structure. We show that the tariff rate under a foreign (domestic) firm’s leadership is lowest when the degree of CSR is large (small). We also show that the foreign firm’s leadership yields the highest welfare when the degree of CSR is intermediate, while the domestic firm’s leadership yields the highest welfare otherwise. In an endogenous-timing game, we show that a simultaneous-move outcome is the unique equilibrium when the degree of CSR is small; thus, it is never socially desirable. We also show that the domestic firm’s leadership can be an equilibrium, which results in the highest welfare when the degree of CSR is large. Finally, when the degree of CSR is large, collusive behaviors between the domestic and foreign firms can increase welfare.
L31|Disincentive Effects of Evaluation|In a model of project design, evaluation, and selection, we explore how the incentives to improve the design of projects depend on the availability of funding and the process of evaluation. We show that project designers (researchers or NGOs) prefer to subject their projects to less-rigorous evaluations than donors or funding agencies would prefer, ex-post. We also show how an increase in either funding availability or the informativeness of evaluations tends to decrease investments in project quality. By implication, increased availability of funding or more-informative evaluations can lead to the implementation of fewer high-value projects.
L31|The financial and managerial problems of social enterprises and their optional solutions|The main problems in the social cooperative management are caused by the quality of available human resource and the marketability of products and services. The root of the problems can be found in the quality of labour force and the improper marketing. External specialists are required mostly for administrative duties (in field of book-keeping, taxation and application-writing). The assessment for improving the competitiveness has got less importance. Our questionnaire targeted the economic and financial problems of social enterprises. Based on the result of this survey we created the financing pecking order model for social cooperatives in Hungary. We adapted the traditional pecking order theory invented by Myers (1984) to the financing mix of Hungarian social enterprises. We found that public funds play a dominant role in the external financing of social enterprises (focusing on social cooperatives). State subsidies are most important, but the financial and managerial contribution of local governments is also essential for successful operation. To improve the marketing of products we recommend social cooperatives to use a managerial income statement to determine the most profitable products and markets.
L31|There's an app feature for that: Establishing user preferred mobile app features through asynchronous online interviews|A mobile application's (app) popularity and influence is determined by its users.These users download, use, review and support an app based on a myriad of requirements and needs. The aim of this paper is to showcase the results from asynchronous online interviews, which was focused on exploring the needs of potential users of a mobile blood donation app in South Africa.This paper specifically reports on the results of the 89 interviews conducted with existing and potential blood donors in South Africa during late 2017 and early 2018. As part of a larger, exploratory sequential mixed method research project, the interview schedule described in this paper was guided by the Leximancer analyses of app store reviews of existing blood donation apps, and the results from the interview informed a quantitative questionnaire. The results of the interviews, garnered from a Leximancer analyses, showed that the potential convenience afforded to blood donors by a blood donation app was important ? aspects such as reminders to donateand GPS functionality for finding blood donation events, among others, were mentioned as preferred features by respondents.Furthermore, several respondents noted that a question and answer feature with the blood donation organisation would be a value adding feature in an app of this kind.
L31|There's a Google Scholar Alert for that: An integrative review methodology exploring mobile app features through Leximancer|Mobile application (app) usage has become a universal trend. Paramount in most app designers' focus, is what mobile app users want in terms of features offered by an app. Forming part of a larger study which aims to determine the most desirable app features for a mobile blood donation app, this paper reports on one section of that study's exploratory sequential mixed method research strategy.The paper illustrates how the use of Google Scholar alerts, over a period of six months, was systematically employed to inform the researchers of the most current research on app features. Abstracts and keywords from 47 academic articles which were included in the alert emails, were analysed through the natural language analysis software Leximancer. The findings aimed at highlighting prominent concepts and themes related to the development, selection, and application of mobile app features. Findings showed a prevalence of research articles focused on mobile health apps, specifically apps that support self-management of various illnesses.
L31|What type of microfinance institutions comply with International Financial Reporting Standards?|What are the characteristics of microfinance institutions (MFIs) that choose to draft their financial statements according to international accounting standards? That is the question this article investigates. We study a pooled sample of 5,290 audited financial statements from 2007 to 2015 and find consistent evidence that the institutional framework, for-profit status, and maturity, are likely to drive the MFIs choice to comply with international financial reporting standards. Results are robust after controlling for whether MFIs operate in a country where IFRS are permitted or required.
L31|Das genossenschaftliche Identitätsprinzip: Anspruch und Wirklichkeit|No abstract is available for this item.
L31|Social preference and group identity in the financial cooperative|We model the financial cooperative as an optimal institution sharing liquidity risks among agents with social preference and group identity. Stronger social concerns imply objectively better (worse) conditions for borrowers (depositors). Testing the model, we find that, indeed, deposit and loan rates offered by U.S. credit unions between 1995 and 2014 co-moved with (i) the number of members, and (ii) the common bond. Our theory explains how cooperatives coexist with banks, and why they have tended to be more resilient. However, the analysis also suggests that financial inclusion and advantages in resilience might quickly evaporate as membership requirements get diluted.
L31|Impure Impact Giving: Theory and Evidence|The paper presents a new model of charitable giving where individuals regard out-of-pocket donations and the matches they induce as different. The paper shows that match-price elasticities combine conventional price effects with the strength of warm-glow, so that match-price elasticity alone is insufficient to characterize preferences for giving. Match- and rebate-price elasticities will typically be different, but together they lead to tests of underlying giving preferences. It estimates, for the first time, a match-price elasticity together with a real-world tax-based rebate elasticity in a non-laboratory high-stakes setting. The estimates reject extant models of giving, but are consistent with the new theory.
L31|Investment Returns and Distribution Policies of Non-Profit Endowment Funds|We present the first estimates of investment returns and distribution rates for U.S. non-profit endowment funds, based on a comprehensive sample of 29,762 organizations drawn from Internal Revenue Service filings for 2009-2017. Non-profit endowments badly underperform market benchmarks, with median annual returns 4.46 percentage points below a 60-40 mix of U.S. equity and Treasury bond indexes, and statistically significant alphas of -1.10% per year. Smaller endowments have less negative alphas than larger endowments, but all size classes significantly underperform. Higher education endowments, the majority of the $0.7 trillion asset class, do significantly worse than funds in other sectors. Distribution ratios are conservative, well below the funds’ long-run returns. Donors increase contributions when endowment returns are strong, with an elasticity of about 0.18 between net-of-market investment returns and new donations.
L31|The Role of Non-state Actors in the Integration of Refugees and Asylum Seekers|Significant variation across and within OECD countries reflects the diverse roles that non-state actors can play in the reception and integration of asylum seekers. This variation can be explained by the differences in the organisation of welfare service delivery, the various national schemes supporting employment and the specific legal frameworks allowing for the labour market access of asylum seekers, along with the inclination of local inhabitants to self-organise to face new challenges. Within the wide spectrum of non-state actors that provide assistance to refugees and asylum seekers, this paper focuses specifically on third sector organisations. Through a survey, it assesses the contribution of these organisations during the refugee crisis in Europe, from 2014 to 2016, in delivering reception and integration policies for refugees, protection holders and asylum seekers and in experimenting with innovative approaches. The paper concludes with a number of policy recommendations on the ways governments leverage the innovative capacity of third sector organisations in providing meaningful and effective initiatives to integrate refugees in the society, labour market and economy of host communities.
L31|Integration of Migrants, Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Remote Areas with Declining Populations|This paper examines whether immigration can operate as a counter-process of depopulation and economic recession. Based on the comparative analysis of four case studies in Belluno (Italy), Klagenfurt-Villach (Austria), Dalarna (Sweden), and Haßberge (Germany), it analyses the key socio-economic factors explaining the successful integration of migrants, refugees, status holders and asylum seekers and examines under which conditions the arrival of newcomers can turn into a local development opportunity for these territories. The case studies feature four remote territories with the following common characteristics: they have undergone significant socio-economic transformations over the past decade, they face a population decline with an alarming outmigration of youth combined with an increasing ageing population, and central governments have channelled recent immigration and asylum seekers to peripheral areas to counterbalance negative demographic trends. Results show that integration paths undertaken by recipients differ significantly across the four territories. However, all case studies suggest that stable jobs and accommodations render remote and mountain localities attractive for refugees and status holders, who are usually more inclined to move to urban centres. Lastly, results from the case studies highlight the importance of designing individualised integration paths backed by social inclusion initiatives that can incite spontaneous collaborations and work relations with local inhabitants.
L31|Endogenous Timing with a Socially Responsible Firm|This study considers a duopoly model in which a socially responsible (SR) firm competes with a private firm by incorporating environmental externality and clean technology. We analyze the endogenous market structure where both firms strategically, sequentially, or simultaneously decide quantities, which also affect abatement activities. We reveal that depending on the relative concerns on environment and consumer surplus, the SR firm can be less or more aggressive in production and abatement, and it may earn high profits. Thus, not only the significance of externality but also the instrumental conflict of social concerns are crucial factors in determining the equilibrium of endogenous timing game. Finally, we indicate that unless the concern for externality is high, the simultaneous and sequential move game with SR firm leadership are socially desirable.
L31|The Timing Of Environmental Tax Policy With A Consumer-Friendly Firm|This study considers a Cournot duopoly model with a consumer-friendly firm and analyzes the interplay between the strategic choice of abatement technology and the timing of governmentʼs commitment to the environmental tax policy. We show that the optimal emission tax under committed policy regime is always higher than that under non-committed one, but both taxes can be higher than marginal environmental damage when the consumer-friendliness is high enough. We also show that the emergence of a consumer-friendly firm might yield better outcomes to both welfare and environmental quality without the commitment to the environmental policy.
L31|Corporate Social Responsibility And Environmental Taxation With Endogenous Entry|This study considers Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in Cournot markets with endogenous entry and investigates the effects of CSR on environmental taxation and welfare consequences. We show that the optimal tax under free entry is higher than that under blockaded entry and also higher than marginal environmental damage. We then show that a higher taxation is socially excessive from the viewpoint of socially optimal CSR, which requires an appropriate regulatory framework for CSR promotion. Finally, we show that the environment is less damaged but social welfare deteriorates accompanied with CSR when the fixed cost is low, while pollution abatement activities will reduce the optimal tax and improves both environmental damage and social welfare.
L31|Time-inconsistent environmental policies with a consumer-friendly firm: Tradable permits versus emission tax|This study considers the timing of environmental policies with a consumer-friendly firm having abatement technology and compares two market-based regulatory instruments, tradable permits and emission tax regulations. When the government can credibly commit its policy, we show that the equilibrium outcomes under both policies are equivalent in terms of permits price and tax rate. Under the non-committed policy, however, the equivalence breaks down because firms have opposite incentives to induce time-consistent policy to be adjusted ex post. In particular, compared to pre-committed government, firms abate less emission to induce higher emission quotas under the permits policy while a consumer-friendly firm abates more emissions to reduce tax rate under the tax policy. Finally, we show that tax policy will result in higher welfare and lower environmental damage unless the concern on consumer surplus is large.
L31|Excess burden of taxation and environmental policy mix with a consumer-friendly firm|This study examines environmental policy mix of tradable emission permits and emission taxes in a duopoly model with a consumer-friendly firm. In the presence of excess burden of taxation, we analyze the interplay of the two policies in the non-equivalent conditions for welfare consequences. We show that emission tax can be redundant and thus policy mix is degenerated when both the excess burden of taxation and the degree of consumer-friendliness are insignificant. However, when the excess burden of taxation is significant, tradable permits policy with tax treatment should be accompanied to enhance welfare in the presence of a consumer-friendly firm. Finally, under the tax revenue-neutral case where the excess burden of taxation does not matter, environmental policy mix is also efficient if the degree of consumer-friendliness is sufficiently high.
L31|Challenges of Rural Economy and Women Economic Empowerment in Afghanistan: A Concept Note|This research paper has been developed with the intention of shedding light over the major challenges and remedies of rural economy in Afghanistan and also discussing explicitly about the women economic empowerment considering Afghanistan’s context. This paper has been prepared in two parts, where part one will be specifically and thoroughly encompassing the major challenges and remedies of rural economy in Afghanistan, however, the second part will be explicitly covering the issues related to women economic empowerment in Afghanistan. General topics and contents under each part of this paper are based on author’s findings and does not preferably follow a report or other person’s view, except secondary data sources which are quoted properly. Objective of this concept papers was to briefly discuss about the major and pivotal issues related to rural economy and how women economic empowerment can aid to it. Indeed, women contribution to economic activities in the rural area of Afghanistan is very rare, and thus, a great chunk of the human capital is not used toward inclusive growth. Author has given a thoughtful attention to women economic empowerment and thus discussed this issue on a separate section with respect to Afghanistan’s ground level realities as per common social norms and practices. This concept paper will be entirely based on academic and nonacademic secondary data from authentic sources. Moreover, at the end of each part, researcher’s recommendations and solutions will also be added for corrective action taking by the government and competent organizations in Afghanistan. As a whole, issues discussed in this paper will be concise and direct to the point. It’s very welcome by the author of this paper that any prospective researcher or an organization can expand the scope of this topic and discusses the major challenges and remedies with a vast set of knowledge, information, and ground level presence.
L31|An Enduring Platform For Public And Cooperative Economics Research: A Centennial Perspective|In this short introduction, after briefly remembering the exemplary role played by Edgard Milhaud for the birth and development of Annals, we describe the content of the current special issue devoted to the 110 years of the journal.
L31|A treatise on socioeconomic roles of waqf|Promotion of socioeconomic security peaks as state policy drive especially in developing and emerging economies. Waqf as a socioeconomic tool emphatically forms part of the ethical values of Islam and is seen as a primary vehicle for financing Islam as a society. This paper analyses the socioeconomic roles that Waqf institution in tackling social security challenges for upliftment of the Muslim Ummah. The paper employs a non-experimental qualitative research methodology based on deductive method of analysis of jurisprudential and literature based-evidences. A socioeconomic framework was intuitively developed by the paper for logical analysis. It was found that socioeconomically, Waqf institutions across the Islamic world have played immeasurable roles in the areas of provision of social and economic infrastructures, lessening the burden of tax and budget deficits, closing the short fall in tax revenues, tackling poverty and income inequality, boosting economic growth, promoting independent provision of public goods and development of active civil society bonded by spirit of compassion and communalism as against that apathy and individualism. The paper strongly urges the Muslim Ummah to reestablish and reassert the roles Waqf institutions to free itself from socioeconomic misadventures.
L31|Online fundraising, self-image, and the long-term impact of ask avoidance|We study an online fundraising campaign run on an opera ticket booking platform. After establishing a baseline, a first change doubled the donation grid. A second change altered the navigation of the website rendering the act of declining to donate more salient. The contribution of our paper is fourfold. First, we add to the literature on defaults by showing how donation grids can have dramatic impacts on giving. Second, we demonstrate that small, apparently superficial changes in the design of a campaign can have unexpectedly large consequences (offsetting the effects of changes in the choice architecture). Third, we provide the first field evidence for the role of self-image in charitable giving. Finally, we provide stark evidence on possible adverse long-run effects of fundraising campaigns for ticket selling entities. “Avoiding the ask,” non-frequent customers buy fewer tickets in the following opera season. Ticket sales per person fall by €35, while average charitable income from the same group during the campaign had been just under €0.12.
L31|Innovation capital|Abstract In this paper we compare the relationship between a firm’s innovation capital and the likelihood that a firm will commercialize an invention. Our index of innovation capital is the product of the firm’s human capital, social capital, and reputational capital. We find from our empirical experiment, which uses Small Business Innovation Research data, that innovation capital is a statistically more important entrepreneurial input to the innovation output of commercialization than any of its components.
L31|Obstacles For Academic Entrepreneurship in Turkey|Today, as a result of the knowledge economy, universities are focusing more on creating commercial knowledge along with their primary tasks ? education and research. Increasing demand for university-industry collaboration, universities? new roles in the economic development through technology transfer, and commercialization of knowledge are among the major factors that lead to concepts such as ?entrepreneurial university? and ?academic entrepreneur?. Academic entrepreneurship is actually a wider concept that covers all the efforts and activities toward the commercialization of the scientific research outputs of the universities and their industrial partners.In Turkey, Supreme Council for Science and Technology supports academic entrepreneurship activities and encourages potential academic entrepreneurs through various support mechanisms. However, there are many problems that academic entrepreneurs encounter and this study aims to discuss possible solutions for these problems and obstacles.
L31|Designing for user experience: Analysing app store reviews for app feature identification|South Africa's blood stock level is often categorised as alarmingly low, leaving blood donation organisations in constant need of voluntary, unpaid blood donations to ensure their ability to supply hospitals with safe blood. Globally, there are successful mobile blood donation apps facilitating blood donation by providing useful services to blood donors, however similar apps available in South Africa are new, and not popular when compared to global standards. An estimated 5.9 million South Africans download and use mobile applications (apps), and this paper explores the process and results from the first phase of a study, which employed a sequential mixed method research design, to identify user-preferred features for a mobile blood donation app. The findings of the study should serve as a roadmap to blood donation organisations in South Africa, regarding what users expect from a blood donation app, and which features may possibly stimulate a constant or increased frequency of blood donation instances. The two largest app stores, Google Play and Apple iOS, served as the sources of the eventual sample of blood donation apps, of which the user reviews were analysed. Commenting from a design science paradigm, this paper reports on the selection process that had been followed to sample the relevant apps, and further discusses the user insights gained from the analysis of these apps' reviews. The paper further reports on how the app review analysis findings informed the creation of an interview schedule, that was used to gain in-depth understanding of perceptions held by users of the blood donation apps, specifically regarding the users' preferred features in these types of apps.
L31|The future of accessing our past: collaboration and digitisation in libraries, archives and museums|Technological innovation has led to disruptions in the global economy. In South Africa, one such disruption has been the shift towards the digitisation of resources that were previously only available in hard copy. Institutions most notably affected by the digitisation drive, have been libraries, archives, and museums (LAMs), which serve as important cultural heritage organizations. Considering the significant financial implications of a digitisation project, this paper explores the possible benefits and challenges that are faced when LAMs collaborate with each other, when digitising content. This qualitative, cross sectional study compared results from the data of 21 interview transcripts, which were first analysed through thematic coding in ATLAS.ti, and then analysed in Leximancer, a software tool which applies natural language processing to text. The results discuss relevant themes and concepts, revealed during the interviews with digitising-focused employees, at various LAMs in South Africa. This paper aimed to illuminate which user-generated perceptions of concerns and opportunities should be noted when an organization considers a collaborative technological intervention, specifically in the context of LAMs in South Africa. Findings showed that the sharing of technology, skills and knowledge was prevalent when considering potential benefits of a collaborative digitisation project, while access to resources and the inefficient use of resources, were identified as significant challenges in collaborative digitisation projects. The novelty of this discussion lies within the triangulation of results by using different analysis tools, and the value of the research is the unique view given of the challenges and opportunities which arise when a collaborative digitisation project is deployed.
L31|Earning to Give: Occupational Choice for Effective Altruists|Effective altruists wish to do good while optimizing the social performance they deliver. We apply this principle to the labor market. We determine the optimal occupational choice of a socially motivated worker who has two mutually exclusive options: a job with a for-profit firm and a lower-paid job with a nonprofit. We construct a model in which a worker motivated only by pure altruism will work at a relatively high wage for the for-profit firm and then make charitable contributions to the nonprofit; this represents the “earning to give” option. By contrast, the occupational choice of a worker sensitive to warm glow (“impure altruism”) depends on her income level. While the presence of “warm glow” feelings would seem to clearly benefit charitable organizations, we show that impure altruism can create distortions in labor market choices. In some cases, warm glow feelings may push the worker to take a job with the nonprofit,even when it is not optimal for the nonprofit.
L31|Money and the Commons: An Investigation of Complementary Currencies and their Ethical Implications|The commons is a concept increasingly used with the promise of creating new collective wealth. In the aftermath of the economic and financial crises, finance and money have been criticized and redesigned to serve the collective interest. In this article, we analyze three types of complementary currency (CC) systems: community currencies, inter-enterprise currencies, and cryptocurrencies. We investigate whether these systems can be considered as commons. To address this question, we use two main theoretical frameworks that are usually separate: the “new commons” in organization studies and the “common good” in business ethics. Our findings show that these monetary systems and organizations may be considered as commons under the “common good” framework since they promote the common interest by creating new communities. Nevertheless, according to the “new commons” framework, only systems relying on collective action and self-management can be said to form commons. This allows us to suggest two new categories of commons: the “social commons”, which fit into both the “new commons” and the “common good” frameworks, and the “commercial commons”, which fit the “common good” but not the “new commons” framework. This research advances a new conceptualization of the commons and of the ethical implications of complementary currencies.
L31|The Well-being Transition: Measuring what counts to protect what matters|"In this article we provide an analytical framework for a collective effort that we label ""the well-being transition"" away from growth and GDP towards human well-being and offer some insights as to what is needed to accelerate this dynamic, insisting on the need for a new positive narrative and institutional reforms. We first present the achievements and challenges of the well-being transition first by outlying why and how we can go beyond growth and GDP not just to see the world differently but to change it. We then spell out a possible narrative able to engage citizens and transform these new visions into social realities, linking sustainability and justice in a social-ecological approach of 21st century challenges. We finally propose specific institutional reforms to ground the well-being transition in public policy."
L31|Non-profits and the Profit Non-distribution Constraint with Selfish Entrepreneurial Motivations|The profit non-distribution constraint (NDC) is the basic requirement for non-profit tax privileges all over the world. In donative non-profits it is justified by the need to prevent donors’ exploitation by firm owners. Donative non-profits, however, are not the only type of third-sector institution and in many of them the chief stakeholders are customers, not donors. In this paper we investigate the social value of the NDC in mutual non-profits where customers exert control over the firm. The main theme here is the exploitation of some customers by others, rather than the exploitation of donors by managers or owners. When customers are homogeneous, the NDC can never be beneficial. More complex is the case of customer heterogeneity. We show that in this case the NDC presents three issues. First, there are cases where intra-member exploitation occurs through the generation of accounting losses, and in such cases the NDC is ineffective from an allocative standpoint. Second, even when it prevents exploitation, the resulting allocations may be socially inferior to those that obtain in the presence of minority exploitation. We further show that non-members’ exploitation is of the same nature as minority members’ exploitation and it is just a variant of it, whereby the same results on the NDC’s effectiveness qualitatively hold in this case too. The upshot is that granting tax relief to all mutual non-profits adopting the NDC is unwarranted and a selective application of tax incentives based on the governance structure is instead needed.
L31|How Do Nascent Social Entrepreneurs Respond to Rewards? A Field Experiment on Motivations in a Grant Competition|We conducted a field experiment to identify the causal effects of extrinsic incentive cues on the sorting and performance of nascent social entrepreneurs. The experiment, carried out with one of the United Kingdom’s largest support agencies for social entrepreneurs, encouraged 431 nascent social entrepreneurs to submit a full application for a grant competition that provides cash and in-kind mentorship support through a onetime mailing sent by the agency. The applicants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: one group received a standard mailing that emphasized the intrinsic incentives of the program, or the opportunity to do good (Social treatment), and the other two groups received a mailing that instead emphasized the extrinsic incentives - either the financial rewards (Cash treatment) or the in-kind rewards (Support treatment). Our results show that an emphasis on extrinsic incentives strongly affects who applies for the grant and consequently the type of submissions received. The extrinsic reward cues “crowded out” the more prosocial candidates, leading fewer candidates to apply and fewer applicants targeting disadvantaged groups. Importantly, while the full applications submitted by candidates in the extrinsic incentives groups were more successful in receiving the grant, their social enterprises were less likely to be successful at the end of the one-year grant period. Our results highlight the critical role of intrinsic motives to the selection and performance of social enterprises and suggest that using extrinsic incentives to promote the development of successful social enterprises may backfire in the longer run.
L31|Verfremdung der Genossenschaften im Nationalsozialismus: Gemeinnutzvorrang und Führerprinzip|[Schlussbemerkungen] Aus heutiger Sicht mag die Spanne überlieferter Einstellungen der Genossenschaften und ihrer Leiter zum nationalsozialistischen Umbruch nur schwer verständlich sein. Reichten doch die Verhaltensweisen von vorauseilender Zustimmung über passiv abwartende Duldung bis hin zu offener Ablehnung der NS-Herrschaft. Letztere trotz der sich recht bald abzeichnenden Gewissheit, dass der geballten Energie eines totalitären Systems nichts entgegenzusetzen sein würde. Der Wandel lässt sich in wenige Sätze fassen: Erstens wurde dem Genossenschaftsgedanken ein ganz neuer Sinn befohlen. Er wurde in eine größere Form gegossen, indem er eine Ausweitung von der Genossenschaft der Mit-glieder zur Genossenschaft der Gemeinschaft aller Volksgenossen erfuhr (Kroll 1940: 103), die auch, ja in erster Linie dem Gemeinnutz zu dienen hatte. Was darunter genau zu verstehen war, blieb im praktischen Wirtschaften für viele der unter staatliche Kontrolle geratenen Genossenschaftsleiter unbestimmt und musste insoweit als ein Schlagwort der nationalsozialistischen Propaganda empfunden werden, für dessen Umsetzung allerdings eine zweckdienliche Anleitung fehlte. Zweitens blieb im Zuge einer Neuausrichtung der Genossenschaftspolitik auf den Staat und seine Organisationen (z. B. Reichsnährstand, Deutsche Arbeitsfront, Wirtschafts- und Fachgruppen) die Selbstverwaltung auf der Strecke (Kroll 1940: 104). Auch die Handlungsfreiheit der Geschäftsführung von Genossenschaftsunternehmen war durch die Mitwirkung der von der Partei „Beauftragten“ und aufgrund der verlangten Berücksichtigung des öffentlichen Interesses bei Entscheidungen stark eingeengt. Das Ende des Führerstaats und das Ende des Weges Deutschlands mit Hitler ist bekannt und wurde uns besonders in „runden“ zeitlichen Abständen zu seiner Ernennung zum Reichskanzler, die eine Zäsur in der deutschen Geschichte markierte (Frei 2007: 7), von den Medien nachdrücklich vor Augen geführt: Untergang des Deutschen Reiches, ein Land in Trümmern und von den Siegermächten besetzt. Es folgte der Wiederaufbau, auch des Genossenschaftssektors - aber das ist nicht mehr Gegenstand unseres Themas.
L31|Civil society in times of change: Shrinking, changing and expanding spaces and the need for new regulatory approaches|"The relationship between many G20 governments and organized civil society has become more complex, laden with tensions, and such that both have to find more optimal modes of engagement. In some instances, state-civil society relations have worsened, leading some experts and activists to speak of a ""shrinking space"" for civil society. How wide- spread is this phenomenon? Are these more isolated occurrences or indeed part of a more general development? How can countries achieve and maintain an enabling environment for civil society? The authors suggest that much of the current impasse results foremost from outdated and increasingly ill-suited regulatory frameworks that fail to accommodate a much more diverse and expanded set of civil society organizations (CSO). In response, they propose a differentiated model for a regulatory framework based on functional roles. Based on quantitative profiling and expert surveys, moreover, the paper also derives initial recommendations on how governments and civil society could find ways to relate to each other in both national and multilateral contexts."

L31|But What Does it Mean? Competition between Products Carrying Alternative Green Labels when Consumers are Active Acquirers of Information|Programs that certify the environmental (or other social) attributes of firms are common.But the proliferation of labeling schemes makes it difficult for consumers to know what each one mean – what level of `greenness' does a particular label imply? We provide the first model in which consumers can expend effort to learn what labels mean. The relationship between information acquisition costs, firm pricing decisions, the market shares obtained by alternatively-labeled goods and a brown `backstop' good, and total environmental impact prove complex.Consumer informedness can have perverse implications. In plausible cases a reduction in the cost of information damages environmental outcomes. Our results challenge the presumption that provision of environmental information to the public is necessarily good for welfare or the environment.
L31|Eliciting and Utilizing Willingness to Pay: Evidence from Field Trials in Northern Ghana|We demonstrate the benefits and feasibility of using the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) mechanism to elicit precise, individual-level willingness to pay and thereby enhance the information generated by randomized experiments. With a relatively small sample and minor modifications to a standard field experiment design, we can directly estimate demand, study the effect of prices on usage through screening and psychological (sunk-cost) effects, and compute heterogeneous marginal treatment effects. Applying the mechanism to a field experiment studying clean drinking water technology in northern Ghana, we show that even in an environment with low literacy and numeracy, BDM produces sensible results. We find that although willingness to pay for clean water technology is low relative to the cost, demand is surprisingly inelastic at low prices; prices do not generate significant sunk-cost effects; and treatment effects are heterogeneous with respect to valuation and consistent with outcomes being affected by effort expenditure.
L31|The International Organization of Production in the Regulatory Void|In recent decades, NGOs and consumers have heavily criticized a large number of leading firms and their suppliers in a diverse set of industries for exploiting cross-country differences in regulation to cut costs at the expense of workers and the environment. In line with a wide range of examples, our explorative empirical analysis links these features of globalization to the international organization of production: a high cost advantage of ‘unethical’ production in an industry favors international outsourcing (as opposed to vertical integration) and most strongly so for sourcing from low-regulation countries. We rationalize this pattern by introducing a cost-saving ‘unethical’ technology, consumer boycotts, and advocacy NGOs into a standard property-rights model of the international organization of production. Contracts are incomplete, limiting a firm’s control over both investment and (un)ethical technology choices of integrated as well as independent suppliers. We identify and analyze a novel unethical outsourcing incentive, which - in line with the empirical findings - links outsourcing to unethical production. We also contribute to the modeling of NGO-firm interactions by providing a microfounded model of investment and pricing under incomplete contracts and monopolistic competition when the production technology is a credence attribute of the final good.
L31|Corporate social responsibility and tax avoidance|We theoretically analyse the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and tax avoidance of an oligopolistic firm. The firm maximizes a weighted sum of profits and a CSR objective that depends on output and the firm's contribution to public good provision, that is, tax payments. Making one CSR element more important induces the firm to adhere less to the other and to reduce tax avoidance. Hence, simultaneously a substitutive and a complementary relationship between CSR and tax avoidance can be observed. Therefore, using composite indicators of CSR prevents an empirical identification of this linkage. Moreover, if tax avoidance declines, CSR activities will increase. Consequently, the overall link between CSR and tax avoidance is theoretically ambiguous.
L31|The Financial Performance, Restructuring and Privatisation of the Shipyards in the Republic of Croatia|The shipbuilding industry in Croatia has a long history. Positioned on the Adriatic sea, Dalmatia has had a long tradition of maritime commerce and shipbuilding as well as other supporting activities. Over time the Croatian shipbuilding industry has been accorded different levels of strategic importance and support by the government. However, over the period from 2011 to 2015 the industry has undergone significant restructuring and faced changes to its competitive environment. Furthermore, it has received enormous levels of state support especially as Croatia prepared for the accession to the EU. The main objective of the paper is to explain the main characteristics of the processes in which the shipyards have been restructured, of the liabilities that the state has assumed pursuant to restructuring contracts and the liabilities and responsibilities that the new owners have taken on. Explained in particular will be the impact of restructuring on employment, wages, orders and the value of jobs contracted and deliveries.
L31|Cooperative organizations and members’ role: A new perspective|The theoretical structure and management of a cooperative organization have not changed much during the last decades. Most importantly, the role of the members’ council in corporate governance remains neglected in the contemporary cooperative literature. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on how cooperative organizations can cope with future challenges by re-establishing the role of the members’ council and the members in cooperative organizations
L31|Samaritan Bundles: Clustering in NGO Projects|"We build a model with non-governmental organizations competing through fundraising for donations and choosing issues to focus their projects on. Donors have latent willingness-to-give that differs across issues, but need to be ""awakened"" to give. Raising funds focusing on the same issue creates positive spillovers across NGOs. Each NGO chooses whether to compete in the same market (clustering) with spillovers, or to face weaker competition under issue specialization. The resulting equilibrium configuration crucially depends on the donors’ baseline willingness-to-give and the cost of fundraising. We also develop variants of the model with donors’ asymmetric (issue-dependent) willingness-to-give, settings where NGOs can coordinate their fundraising activities and/or issue choices, the inter-temporal choices of NGOs, and illustrate the mechanisms of the model with several case studies."
L31|Offrir des biens publics et des communs et revitaliser l’action publique dans le cadre d’un processus de « destruction créatrice »|"Recent developments in the economic analysis about public goods and commons, initiated notably in relation to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and to the work of Elinor Ostrom, have highlighted the social utility of their production to meet societal expectations of democracy and of sustainable development. The production of public and social economy organisations is in this perspective of crucial importance for the future, as is the outline of public policies that help develop coproduction or joint production of public goods and services. Thus, Public and Social and Solidarity Economy Partnerships (PSSEP) are the subject of analyzes in the CIRIEC book Providing public goods and commons. Towards coproduction and new forms of governance for a revival of public action that highlights: the importance of these partnerships within the framework of the current paradigm of public action; the induced behavioral transformations of the organizations; the scope that these new forms of partnership can have in terms of co-construction of public action and of responses to expectations on the territories; and the place of these partnerships in a process called here ""creative destruction of public action""."
L31|La economía social ante los paradigmas económicos emergentes: innovación social, economía colaborativa, economía circular, responsabilidad social empresarial, economía del bien común, empresa social y economía solidaria|The social economy facing emerging economic concepts: social innovation, social responsibility, collaborative economy, social enterprises and solidarity economy. In the last two decades and prominently since the economic crisis and the crisis of legitimacy of the prevailing economic model based on for profit private businesses, a plurality of terms and notions have emerged in the academic field and in the economic and political world. They are concepts such as the social enterprises, the solidarity economy, the collaborative economy, the circular economy, the economy of the common good, the fourth sector, the social innovation and the corporate social responsibility. The objective of this paper is to explain this new wave of notions, to study their meanings and to identify their differences and commonalities in relation to the consolidated concept of social economy. This work is based on the 5 study carried recently for the European Economic and Social Committee (Monzón & Chaves, 2017). Within the framework of the Kuhn's theory of the scientific revolutions, in this paper we have proposed that in the social sciences, major changes in paradigms or scientific revolutions, and with them, changes in the language and concepts that generate a new worldview, are produced simultaneously to the great crisis and socio-economic transformations. In this framework, for the recent history, we have identified two periods of scientific revolutions in the field of the social economy / third sector, which we have called 'conceptual waves' and, between them, a period of normal science. The first wave of concepts appeared in the late seventies and eighties, with the oil crisis. During this first wave, the concepts of the social economy and of the nonprofit emerged. As rival approaches they coexisted as mainstream normal science until the second wave. The second wave of notions came out during the current economic crisis and the legitimization of the prevailing economic model. Other explanatory factors, linked to the sociology of the social scientist and of sociopolitical type, may also have influenced this proliferation of notions, such as the scientist pressure for differentiation and originality, and the positioning of some institutions in favor of some terms and against others. The social economy concept continues to be, with that of nonprofit organizations, the mainstream paradigm to refer to the 'space between the public economy and the private for profit economy'. It has a broad scientific and political consensus regarding its definition, it is well institutionalized and quantified and it has a strong scientific and social notoriety. It is a concept based on structural criteria, such as its social aims, its participatory and democratic decisional criterion and its profit distributive criterion based on the prevalence of people and labor factor over capital. Finally, it is not reduced to a few classical legal forms. Between these two main concepts of the “first wave” there are significant differences in terms of their scope and their structural criteria, as well as in terms of their systemic functions. Their main differences focus on the importance given to the social mission and the democratic criterion in the social economy approach and on the relevance of the distributive criterion, based on the non-distribution constraint, in the second approach. The following conclusions have been obtained from a detailed analysis of the different emerging concepts. First, given its novelty, there is still no broad consensus regarding their definitions. Terminological inflation is then joined by a semantic inflation. Secondly, these notions present are still in an incipient institutionalization process, if we attend their inclusion in official documents or position papers of the European institutions. Thirdly, they still present a low level of academic and social 6 notoriety, measured by their presence in specialized academic search engines, such as Dialnet and Google Scholar. From its semantic comparative analysis with that of the social economy, it can be seen that they are not rival concepts with the latter, but rather complementary and even revitalizing concepts of the social economy concept itself. This conclusion has been reached using the following typology of these concepts: Group 1, notions linked to the main challenges/fields of the system crisis and transformation; Group 2, notions linked to the reorientation of the objectives and governance of organizations and economies, both at the micro and macro level, with new assess and incentive mechanisms; and finally, Group 3, notions linked to new ways of understanding entrepreneurship. In the first group are included the concepts of social innovation, collaborative economy and circular economy, which refer to areas of system transformation such as, respectively, innovation, the digital revolution and the environment. They are transversal areas to the public, business private for-profit sector and third sector, and these paradigms constitute new approaches, both micro and macro, to face the challenges. In the second group are the notions of corporate social responsibility and the common good economy, which refer to the need to establish new mechanisms for evaluating economic performance and new incentive mechanisms that prioritize the social dimension. They are also transversal to the public, for-profit sector and third sector. Finally, the notions of social enterprise, social entrepreneurship, fourth sector and solidary economy are integrated in the third group. These last notions refer to specific entities and enterprises. In the case of social enterprises and the solidarity economy, their proximity to the social economy is maximum, to the point of being considered part of the latter. The importance of the participatory and deliberative dimension of the solidary economy concept has undoubtedly contributed to the emergence in Europe of another new term, integrating both: the 'social and solidarity economy'. In summary, the new notions that have emerged in the context of the crisis of legitimacy of the hegemonic economic model must be considered complementary and even revitalizing with respect to the concept of the social economy.
L31|The Economics of Missionary Expansion: Evidence from Africa and Implications for Development|One of the most powerful cultural transformations in modern history has been the dramatic expansion of Christianity outside Europe. Recent, yet extensive, literature uses Christian missions established during colonial times as a source of exogenous variation to study the long-term effects of religion, human capital and culture in Africa, the Americas and Asia. We argue that the endogeneity of missionary expansion may be underestimated, thus questioning the link between missions and economic development. Using annual panel data on missions from 1751 to 1932 in Ghana as well as cross-sectional data on missions for 43 sub-Saharan African countries in 1900 and 1924, we show that: (i) locational decisions were driven by economic factors, as missionaries went to healthier, safer, and more accessible and developed areas, privileging the best locations first; (ii) these factors may spuriously explain why locations with past missions are more developed today, especially as most studies rely on historical mission atlases that tend to only report the best mission locations. Our study identifies factors behind the spatial diffusion of religion. It also highlights the risks of omission and endogenous measurement error biases when using historical data and events for identification.
L31|Does market size matter for charities?|We analyze implications of market size for market structure in the charity sector. While a standard model of oligopolistic for-profit competition predicts a positive relationship between market size and firm size, our analogous model of competition between prosocially motivated charities predicts no such correlation. If charities are biased towards their own provision, a positive association between market size and provider size can arise. We examine these predictions empirically for six different local charity markets. Our empirical findings suggest that charities do not solely pursue prosocial objectives, and that increased competition in the charity sector can lead to rationalization in provision.
L31|Impure Impact Giving: Theory and Evidence|We present a new model of charitable giving where individuals regard out-of-pocket donations and the matches they induce as different. We show that match-price elasticities combine conventional price effects with the strength of warm-glow, so that a match-price elasticity alone is insufficient to characterize preferences for giving. Match- and rebate-price elasticities will typically be different, but together they lead to tests of underlying giving preferences. We estimate, for the first time, a match-price elasticity together with a real-world tax-based rebate elasticity in a non-laboratory high-stakes setting. The estimates reject extant models of giving, but are consistent with the new theory.

Importantly, while the full applications submitted by candidates in the extrinsic incentives groups were more successful in receiving the grant, their social enterprises were less likely to be successful at the end of the one-year grant period. Our results highlight the critical role of intrinsic motives to the selection and performance of social enterprises and suggest that using extrinsic incentives to promote the development of successful social enterprises may backfire in the longer run.
L31|The Emerging Civil Society-State Nexus in Putin’S Russia: A Case Study in Public Health|As of 2017, the main principles, values and goals of the Russian health care system are still under discussion, but the role of non-profit organisations in this sphere remains poorly defined and little understood, following the introduction of a controversial 2012 law restricting the role of foreign funding of Russian NGOs. We find that the evolution of civil society in Russia has given rise to a unique model of civil-state interaction, characterised as an uneasy union, in pursuit of scarce financial resources, between the most influential NGOs in the health sphere and the public authorities
L31|Can Social Information Affect What Job You Choose and Keep?|We show that the provision of social information influences a high-stakes decision and this influence persists over time. In a field experiment involving thousands of admits to Teach For America, those told about the previous year's matriculation rate are more likely to accept a teaching job, complete training, start, and return a second year. To show robustness, we develop a simple theory that identifies subgroups where we expect larger treatment effects and find our effect is larger in those subgroups. That social information can have a powerful, persistent effect on high-stakes behavior broadens its relevance for policy and theory.
L31|Impact Of Educational Csr On Regional Business|The research on business models that incorporates a variety of stakeholders is a recent trend in the field of management. This paper aims to add new insights to this research and analyses the implementation experience of two recent educational CSR projects facilitated by companies, business clubs and a university. This paper describes the underlying mechanisms during the layout phase of these projects and provides an implementation feedback based on a survey performed with executive managers of the regional business environment. Beyond regional considerations this paper is expected to have a general relevance for businesses and governmental institutions operating in regions transforming towards a knowledge driven economy.
L31|Coordination of Humanitarian Aid|We examine a setup where two agents allocate a fixed budget of humanitarian aid between two equally needy areas. The agents may be biased to one area which is their private information. Without communication aid is allocated inefficiently resulting in gaps and overlaps in response. Direct communication between the agents is ineffective and cannot resolve the coordination failure. We show that coordination can be improved by a mediator, such as an information management system, which filters the information communicated by the agents. Our results can throw light on how to improve the current disaster management systems.
L31|Competition in public service provision: The role of not-for-profit providers|With public services such as health and education, it is not straightforward for consumers to assess the quality of provision. Many such services are provided by monopoly not-for-profit providers and there is concern that for-profit providers may increase profit at the expense of quality. This paper explores the implications of entry by for-profit providers when there is unobserved quality. The model generates three key policy-relevant insights. First, by developing a novel approach to competition between different organizational forms, it frames the relevant trade-offs precisely. Second, it shows the value of keeping an incumbent not-for-profit as an active provider. Third, it characterizes the optimal payment (or voucher value) to an entrant for each consumer who switches in a way that can be applied empirically.
L31|Innovación social y microcrédito: ¿estamos financiando el statu quo de la pobreza?|Resumen Este documento busca identificar el papel de las políticas públicas que fomentan el microcrédito en Colombia mediante el estudio del caso de la Banca de las oportunidades. Para este fin, se relacionan los conceptos innovación social y microcrédito en cuanto a concepción y objetivo a partir de una visión crítica que incluya perspectivas tanto ortodoxas como alternativas que permitan ampliar la capacidad de análisis del problema. Así también, se explica, por medio de una descripción histórica de las políticas que fomentan el microcrédito, si el camino seguido por este en Colombia ha mantenido la propuesta original de ser una herramienta de lucha contra la pobreza. Finalmente, se hace un breve análisis cualitativo de dichas políticas intentando plantear una generalidad en cuanto a la política de microcrédito empleada por el gobierno nacional.
L31|Samaritan Bundles: Inefficient Clustering in NGO Projects|We build a model with non-governmental organizations competing through fundraising for donations and choosing their project types. Donors’ willingness to give differs across project types. Each NGO chooses whether to compete in the larger donation market or to monopolize the smaller one. The resulting equilibrium configuration crucially depends on the asymmetry in potential donation market size and on donors’ perceived substitutability or complementarity between giving to two different projects. We analyze the welfare properties of the decentralized equilibrum and characterize the conditions under which such equilibrium is inefficient. We also develop a variant of the model with inter-temporal choices of NGOs, analyze settings where NGOs can coordinate their fundraising activities and/or project type choices, extend the model to allow for spillovers between NGO fundraising activities, and illustrate the mechanisms of the model with several case studies.
L31|Les assureurs mutualistes actifs sur le marché de l’assurance municipale en Europe|This presented analysis sought to assess the potential of the European municipal insurance market by looking into its main features and market size. It also weighed the potential impact of new regulatory requirements, in particular the European Commission Directive on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of insurance and reinsurance (Solvency II). An overview of the insurance industry’s performance highlights a strong resilience of the mutual business model relatively to the competing capitalistic model. Mutual insurers in some European markets remain leaders in the market; a result attributable to innovative financial and legal arrangements that were decisive in overcoming challenges pertaining to capital requirements and market access while keeping their mutual DNA. Looking ahead, current macroeconomic imbalances ensure the mutual insurance model a positive outlook, despite headwinds stemming from regulation and other comparative legal disadvantages. As for the specific municipal insurance market, the research identified two major systems of policy issuance: the classical property & casualty (P&C) and life insurance contracts and the fully in-house managed contracts. In terms of outlook, the municipal insurance’s specific features and opportunities make it an area for business expansion where mutual insurers might play a key role
L31|The Design of IEP Sites: Aiming for an Inclusive Economic Participation of Urban Citizens in Flanders|In order to remedy the economic position of socially vulnerable citizens in Flemish cities, the University of Antwerp has launched the concept of an “Inclusive Participation (IEP) site”. According to the CIRIEC workgroup “SSE and territories”, an IEP site can be defined as a particular territorial network that accommodates partners who jointly try to resolve, under the environmental constraints of an urban setting, the challenge of an inclusive economic participation. On the basis of two explorative research projects, the working paper illustrates the fine-tuning of the concept and the development of strategic-spatial blueprints to successfully design and manage these IEP sites.
L31|Internal governance and performance: Evidence from when external discipline is weak|The effect of internal governance on performance is potentially economically significant but may be difficult to identify because of confounding external disciplinary mechanisms and the endogenous choice of internal governance. This study addresses those difficulties by using nonprofit hospitals as an economic environment with muted external disciplinary mechanisms and instrumenting for internal governance using governance spillovers of geographically local public firms. Using patient heart attack survival as a measure of performance, a one standard deviation increase in strength of internal governance reduces the probability of death by 0.89 percentage points after controlling for patient characteristics.
L31|Optimal ownership of public goods in the presence of transaction costs|A non-governmental organization (NGO) can make a non-contractible investment to provide a public good. Only ownership can be specified ex ante, so ex post efficiency requires reaching an agreement with the government. Besley and Ghatak (2001) argue that the party with the larger valuation should be the owner. We show that when transaction costs have to be incurred before the bargaining stage can be reached, ownership by the government can be optimal even when the NGO has a larger valuation. Our finding also contrasts with the standard private-good setup where the investing party (i.e., the NGO) should always be the owner.
L31|Fishing for complementarities: Research grants and research productivity|Academics are increasingly encouraged to acquire external grants to finance their research, and often hold grants from multiple funders concurrently to ensure the continuity of their work. However, there are concerns that inefficiencies occur when funding is received from multiple sponsors, especially when this originates from different sectors. This study investigates complementarities between public/non-profit and private sector sources of research funding with regard to academic output in terms of publications, research impact and research orientation. The empirical analysis is based on novel data on external public/non-profit research grants and industry funding for tenured engineering academics employed at fifteen UK universities. The results suggest that while research grants are generally associated with higher research outcomes, industry funding decreases the marginal utility of public/non-profit funding by lowering the increase in publication rate associated with public/non-profit grants. At the same time, for more commercially oriented research, measured as its patentability score, we find some support for complementarities between public and private-sector research funding. These results suggest that provision of public grants is crucial to the production of research that is distributed openly through publications and proceedings. Private sector grants are important as they may enable more applied research trajectories for those capable of combining publicly and industry sponsored research.
L31|Is there a first mover advantage in science? Pioneering behavior and scientific production in nanotechnology|This article investigates whether pioneers in a research field have a sustainable first mover advantage in publications. Combining bibliometric (publications, citations, co-authorship) with survey data on 495 nanotechnology researchers, we analyzed career attributes, professional context and production overtime. Our econometric estimates highlight two main results. First, pioneering behavior is not exogenous: it is more probable among scientists who are already established in their “mother-discipline” (before entering nanotechnology), have a strong collaboration network, and have easy access to field-specific resources. Second, even after controlling for the endogeneity of entry timing, we find a strong first mover advantage: pioneers in the emerging field exhibit significantly higher scientific production in that field in the long run.
L31|The effect of effectiveness: Donor response to aid effectiveness in a direct mail fundraising experiment|We test how donors respond to new information about a charity's effectiveness. Freedom from Hunger implemented a test of its direct marketing solicitations, varying letters by whether they include a discussion of their program's impact as measured by scientific research. The base script, used for both treatment and control, included a standard qualitative story about an individual beneficiary. Adding scientific impact information has no effect on average likelihood of giving or average gift amount. However, we find important heterogeneity: large prior donors both are more likely to give and also give more, whereas small prior donors are less likely to give. This pattern is consistent with two different types of donors: warm glow donors who respond negatively to analytical effectiveness information, and altruism donors who respond positively to such information.
L31|Do people donate more when they perceive a single beneficiary whom they know? A field experimental test of the identifiability effect|According to the identifiability effect, people will donate more to a single beneficiary rather than to many beneficiaries, holding constant what the donations are actually used for. We test the identifiability effect for two novel subject pools (the suppliers and beneficiaries of volunteer labor). We also test a refinement of the identifiability effect where we vary whether or not the single beneficiary is personally known to the solicitees. While the behavior of volunteers is consistent with the identifiability effect, we find that the identifiability effect is reversed for beneficiaries of volunteer labor. Moreover, we find that making the single beneficiary personally known to the solicitees lowers donations by a statistically insignificant amount, suggesting that it does not enhance donations.
L31|Can Community Development Improve Health? Emerging Opportunities for Collaboration between the Health and Community Development Sectors|The two sectors of community development and health have long worked in the same neighborhoods, but they have not always worked together. This is starting to change, due in part to a growing recognition among health experts of the social, economic, and environmental factors that drive health outcomes. These social determinants of health have become the basis for new collaborations between community development and health professionals. This paper introduces professionals in both sectors to this emerging area of practice through a series of case studies of innovators in the southeastern United States. Case studies look at ways to bring housing and health professionals together, opportunities to leverage community development finance tools, and efforts to use Pay for Success to improve Medicaid spending. This discussion paper reviews early lessons on how to build a successful health and community development partnership, including an examination of the incentives for community developers, health professionals, state and local governments, and philanthropy to participate in these collaborations.
L31|Divest, Disregard, or Double Down?|"How much, if at all, should an endowment invest in a firm whose activities run counter to the charitable missions the endowment funds? Endowments typically disregard the objectionable nature of or divest from such firms. However, if firm returns increase with activities the endowment combats, doubling down on the investment increases expected utility by aligning funding availability with need. I call this ""mission hedging."" This paper offers the first model that characterizes the endowment's investment decision on the objectionable firm, defines investment trade-offs, and examines related evidence. Bad actors provide good opportunities to hedge mission-specific risks."
L31|Small is Beautiful: Motivational Allocation in the Nonprofit Sector|We build an occupational-choice general-equilibrium model with for-profit firms, nonprofit organizations, and endogenous private warm-glow donations. Lack of monitoring on the use of funds implies that an increase of funds of the nonprofit sector (because of a higher income in the for-profit sector, a stronger preference for giving, or an inflow of foreign aid) worsens the motivational composition and performance of the nonprofit sector. We also analyze the conditions under which donors (through linking donations to the motivational composition of the nonprofit sector), nonprofits themselves (through peer monitoring), or the government (using a tax-financed public funding of nonprofits) can eliminate the low-effectiveness equilibrium. We present supporting case-study evidence from developing-country nongovernmental organization sector and humanitarian emergencies.
L31|Help not needed? Optimal host country regulation of expatriate NGO workers|Motivated by interventions in poor countries to increase the use of local labor in foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), we address the behavior of these organizations under host government regulation. We extend existing NGO models by distinguishing between local workers and expatriates. The model covers both NGO monopoly and competition in the market for donations. Assuming that NGOs maximize output, we show that regulations in the form of a quota on the number of expatriates or a work permit fee for foreigners reduces NGO output, but increases employment of locals. The optimal quota is more likely to bind in the market structure generating the highest total fundraising surplus. An optimal work permit fee is equivalent to an optimal quota in both the monopoly and duopoly cases. For both instruments, the optimal tightness of regulation is decreasing in the weight the government attaches to the public good relative to domestic incomes and in the importance of NGO output to the supply of the public good. Aggregate NGO output and the level of the public good produced could be higher with a monopoly NGO.
L31|Can Community Driven Care be integrated in the European Welfare System? Institutional Challenges and Historical Lessons|Parallel to the formal (health) care organizations in Europe, private or public, a number of community driven care projects have emerged. They may supplement the formal organizations by reducing costs or provide care to groups that for some reason do not have access to the formal sector. Drawing on Ostromian theory of commons, and on the previous theory and research on open software development (which share some of the characteristics of “open care”) we use cases of historical cases of community driven care to examine the prospects for such project to help remedy the cost crisis in the care sector. We explore under which institutional settings “open care” is likely to emerge and when open care projects have potential to scale. It is found that open care is more likely to emerge and prosper when they build on existing organizational structures; where the participants do not need to create new hierarchies or governance structures and where they share common values. The paper may serve policy makers aiming to design institutions or regulation, that facilitate, or at least not impede, the emergence of community based care.
L31|ICT-Enabled Social Innovation for Active and Healthy Ageing: Redesigning long-term care and independent living in Europe|This issue of JRC Insights presents results from the analysis of initiatives and case studies on ICT-enabled social innovations promoting social investment in the field of Active and Healthy Ageing (AHA) conducted as part of the JRC-led IESI research, in collaboration with DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. It highlights how over 70% of the initiatives in the field of AHA promote social investment by supporting the modernisation of social protection systems as well as by supporting investment in people throughout their lives. It also reveals that AHA initiatives are frequently characterised by radical innovation potential and higher integration at the service level, often combining funding, administrative and service delivery systems. Finally, the article illustrates how ICTs drive the organizational transformation of service delivery, by reducing overlaps and strengthening integration among service providers. In addition, they increase efficiency and reduce costs by improve targeting and personalisation of services.
L31|Group meeting frequency and borrowers’ repayment performance in microfinance: Evidence from a quasi-natural experiment in South Africa|A quasi-natural experiment has been carried out in which the Centre Meeting (CM) rules of some centres of a large Microfinance Institution (MFI) that offers microfinance services, in the form of group lending, were changed. The study has been carried out at the Small Enterprise Foundation (SEF), an MFI that operates in South Africa. The frequency of group meetings, organised as part of the “Monthly Centre Meetings” pilot programme, was reduced from bimonthly to monthly, and only one member per credit-group was asked to participate instead of all the group members. The purpose of these changes was to allow borrowers to save time to spend on their own economic activities. This new policy was put into force for one year, from May 2014 to the end of April 2015. After selecting a suitable control group of micro-borrowers, using Propensity Score Matching techniques, we ran difference-in-difference (DID) regressions to evaluate the impact of the policy changes on the client’s repayment and saving behaviour. The obtained estimates suggest that the change in the policy rules had led to a deterioration of the customers’ saving balances and had increased delayed repayments. Text mining techniques, applied to survey data, pointed towards a lack of trust within the groups, the members of which did not meet frequently outside the CMs, and this was found to be one of the main causes of failure of the pilot experiment. We have concluded that group meetings are an effective tool to stimulate the accumulation of social capital for some categories of clients, and that those MFIs that wish to implement similar interventions should be aware of the drawbacks pertaining to borrowers’ behaviour.
L31|Antitrust Treatment of Nonprofits: Should Hospitals Receive Special Care?|Nonprofit hospitals receive favorable tax treatment in exchange for providing socially beneficial activities. Extending this rationale would suggest that, insofar as suppression of competition would allow nonprofits to cross-subsidize care for needy populations, nonprofit hospital mergers should be evaluated differently than mergers of for-profit hospitals. However, this rationale rests upon the premise that nonprofit hospitals with greater market power provide more care to the needy. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model showing that the welfare implications of an antitrust policy that favors nonprofit hospitals depends on the link between market power and charity care provision. To test the link, we use three measures of charity care—two dollar-denominated and one based on service volume—to study charity care provision by for-profit and non-profit hospitals under different competition conditions. Using detailed California data from 2001 to 2011, we find no evidence that nonprofit hospitals are more likely than for-profit hospitals to provide more charity care, or to offer more unprofitable services, when competition falls. Overall, while some courts have given deference to defendants’ nonprofit status, our study finds no empirical evidence that such hospitals provide greater charity care as they have greater market power.
L31|Reproductive health care in Catholic-owned hospitals|Mergers that affiliate a hospital with a Catholic owner, network, or system reduce the set of possible reproductive medical procedures since Catholic hospitals have strict prohibitions on contraception. Using changes in ownership of hospitals, we find that Catholic hospitals reduce the per bed rates of tubal ligations by 31%, whereas there is no significant change in related permitted procedures such as Caesarian sections. However, across a variety of measures, we find minimal overall welfare reductions. Still, fewer tubal ligations increase the risk of unintended pregnancies across the United States, imposing a potentially substantial cost for less reliable contraception on women and their partners.
L31|Responding to Refugee Crises in Developing Countries: What Can We Learn From Evaluations?|Displacement is at a historic high, with over 65 million individuals currently displaced. The world is facing a refugee crisis that is unprecedented in scale. A large number of evaluations look at different aspects of programming in response to refugee crises in developing countries. This paper covers the key areas and priority topics related to forced displacement identified by the Development Assisstance Committee Temporary Working Group on Refugees and Migration. It draws from evaluation findings to highlight key lessons and recommendations for positive change going forward.Key topics covered in the paper include: lessons on bridging the gap between humanitarian and development programming; efforts to strengthen international response to protracted crises; lessons on whole-of-government approaches in refugee contexts; learning from work in urban settings; improving access to employment and quality education; new financing mechanisms for refugee crises in middle income countries; and lessons on financing in response to the Syria crisis. The paper highlights the evaluation work of DAC members and aims to help strengthen the evidence base to improve response to situations of displacement in developing countries.
L31|Responding to Refugee Crises: Lessons from evaluations in Ethiopia and Uganda as countries of destination|"This working paper is a case study on Ethiopia and Uganda as countries of destination for refugees. The case study looks at the approaches adopted in Ethiopia and Uganda to promote refugee self-reliance and enable refugees to work to earn income. It compares outcomes in the countries, with a specific focus on access to employment and business creation, including legal and socio-economic barriers. The case study draws from a number of evaluations of efforts by the international community to support Ethiopian and Ugandan initiatives. The case study was undertaken as part of a wider research project on learning from evaluations to improve responses to refugee crises in developing countries and supports the synthesis paper ""Responding to Refugee Crises in Developing Countries: What Can We Learn From Evaluations?"""
L31|Responding to Refugee Crises: Lessons from evaluations in South Sudan as a country of origin|"This working paper is a case study on South Sudan as an important refugee country of origin. The case study looks at issues of forced displacement in South Sudan and underscores the linkages between internally displaced persons and South Sudanese refugees. The case study highlights the importance of under­standing local contexts and root drivers of conflict and displacement. It reviews evaluations of programmes in South Sudan, including past efforts at state building and refugee resettlement to look at learning within the international community. The study was undertaken as part of a wider research project on learning from evaluations to improve responses to situations of forced displacement and supports the synthesis paper ""Responding to Refugee Crises in Developing Countries: What Can We Learn From Evaluations?"""
L31|Responding to Refugee Crises: Lessons from evaluations in Afghanistan as a country of origin|"This working paper is a case study on Afghanistan as a refugee country of origin. The case study looks at whole-of-government efforts by OECD member countries in Afghanistan, specifically looking at how states have co-ordinated development, diplomatic and defence resources in a refugee country of origin. The case study also examines efforts by the international community to promote stability and state building objectives. The case study was undertaken as part of a wider research project on learning from evaluations to improve responses to situations of forced displacement and supports the synthesis paper ""Responding to Refugee Crises in Developing Countries: What Can We Learn From Evaluations?"""
L31|Entwicklung und Stand von Bürgerenergiegesellschaften und Energiegenossenschaften in Deutschland<BR>[Development and State of Community Energy Companies and Energy Cooperatives in Germany]|In the paper, the authors describe an estimation of the number and development of community energy companies and energy cooperatives in Germany. The analysis is based on two databases that are maintained by the authors. An increase in the number of new community energy companies in Germany can be observed until 2014. In 2014 at the latest, the number of newly founded energy cooperatives decreased. The decline could only partly be compensated by an increase in the number of limited partnerships with a limited liability company as general partner (GmbH & Co. KG). This shift from the cooperative model to the limited partnership model is linked to a shift in the predominant electricity generation technology. An increase in onshore wind energy can be observed while photovoltaics had to struggle with a shrinking market. Moreover, more bankruptcies and liquidations have been observed since 2009 for community energy companies and energy cooperatives. The existing community energy companies are mostly producing electricity while only a smaller group runs energy grids, especially for heat distribution (small district heating networks). The main focus of community energy companies and energy cooperatives lays on the production of energy through onshore wind and photovoltaics. Bavaria, Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia are the regional core areas of these companies.
L31|Stimulating youth entrepreneurship in the public sector's organizations|An entrepreneurial education and work culture brings changes in the relation between the public sector’s organizations and its interested parties. More precisely, it is a question of changing managerial and organizational education practices towards self-direction, innovativeness, flexibility and responsibility. Understanding how public sector’s organizations operate in an entrepreneurial manner is also helpful for supporting growth within the business community. This article aims at presenting a framework on young people’s possibilities of becoming successful entrepreneurs within the public sector’s organizations, showing a literature review that concentrates on the entrepreneurship subject, with focus on youth and the public sector’s field. The results are the research made by using studies on this subject, thus leading to a proper use of entrepreneurial means, knowledge and start-up activities that allow an evolved education, self-responsibility and autonomy. We will see that the entrepreneurship concept has been expanded and a strong tendency is in favor of placing entrepreneurship in the center of attention, being regarded as natural in more contexts than the economic one. The wide understanding aims at developing abilities – power of initiative, energy, creativity, cooperation and responsibility, whereas the narrow understanding is more aimed at students obtaining business and self-engaging knowledge regarding personal growth activities.
L31|Inclusive local development: A strategy for Heraklion, Greece|Identifying opportunities to facilitate economic growth is a major challenge in local and regional development. Particularly for local or regional economies confronted with deep structural economic problems, unlocking growth differentials by targeting untapped potentials for employment and entrepreneurship can provide an opportunity to renew themselves. Therefore, it is logical that the “missing entrepreneurs” from among economically underrepresented or disadvantaged groups such as women, senior citizens, people with special needs, or youth as well as immigrants have recently gained attention by scholars and policymakers in local and regional development. Still, there is not yet a clear and comprehensive understanding on how to consider the needs of economically underrepresented or disadvantaged groups, both as entrepreneurs or as employees, in local and regional development strategy design. While women and youth entrepreneurship have been subject to an academic and policy debate for some time, the discourse on how to include other economically underrepresented or disadvantaged groups in local or regional economies is far less advanced. The present study reviews the state of literature on inclusive local development and, based on a preliminary analysis of the local economy, proposes a strategy for inclusive local development in Heraklion, Greece. As a locality suffering under the structural economic crisis that has afflicted Greece for almost a decade, a strategy for how to include economically underrepresented or disadvantaged groups in the local economy is both a social necessity and a way to unlock untapped potentials for economic growth.
L31|Endogenous Private Leadership under Subsidy Policy on the Social Enterprises|We investigate a mixed oligopoly model in which private enterprises compete with social enterprises under government subsidy policy, and examine the endogenous choice of private leadership. We show that private leadership is socially desirable, but the numbers of private and social enterprises affect endogenous choices and welfare consequences. We also show that the role of government in choosing the optimal subsidy will be significant when there are more than one private enterprises but its number is smaller than that of the social enterprises.
L31|Effects of globalizing a consumer-friendly firm into an asymmetric mixed duopoly|We study the effects of uniting two separated markets, each monopolized by a producer, into a single globalized duopoly market. When one of the firms is consumer-friendly before and after globalization, we examine certain conditions under which globalization turns out to be beneficial. Consumers in the local market which the consumer-friendly firm is from may have their surplus reduced under certain conditions. We also find conditions under which welfare of one market or the other can be reduced, even that of both simultaneously. If these conditions were met, it would be better, in a globalizing context, that the firm is friendly only with the consumers of its original market and not with those of the global market.
L31|The Impact of Telecommunication Regulatory Policy on Mobile Retail Price in Sub-Saharan African Countries|This paper examines the eect of regulatory policies on mobile retail prices. Using quarterly data for 8 African countries for the period 2010:Q4 to 2014:Q4 we estimate structural demand and supply equations. We nd that mobile termination rates (MTR) have significant positive impact on mobile retail prices. A decline in average MTR of 10% decreases average mobile retail prices by 2.5%. On the other hand, mobile number portability (MNP) has an insignicant eect on price and subscriptions in selected African countries. This may be due to inadequate implementation of MNP and consecutively low demand for porting numbers. The average market conduct in mobile telecommunications industry for selected African countries can be approximated by Cournot Nash equilibrium, while price elasticity of demand is on average -0.27.
L31|Samaritan Bundles: Inefficient Clustering in NGO Projects|We build a model with non-governmental organizations competing through fundraising for donations and choosing their project types. Donors' willingness to give differs across project types. Each NGO chooses whether to compete in the larger donation market or to monopolize the smaller one. The resulting equilibrium configuration crucially depends on the asymmetry in potential donation market size and on donors' perceived substitutability or complementarity between giving to two different projects. We analyze the welfare properties of the decentralized equilibrum and characterize the conditions under which such equilibrium is inefficient. We also develop a variant of the model with inter-temporal choices of NGOs, analyze settings where NGOs can coordinate their fundraising activities and/or project type choices, extend the model to allow for spillovers between NGO fundraising activities, and illustrate the mechanisms of the model with several case studies.
L31|Establishment and development of social economy concept in Slovakia - current situation and perspectives|Development of social enterprises in Slovakia is less supported. Legislation is adopted only as a social enterprise work integration (temporary employment), and it is an instrument of active labour market policies. The social economy is determined also by the new organizations or by the successfully operating entities of the third sector that are followed by a new business approach. The biggest problem is that there is no comprehensive legislation and a system of financial support for social economy entities. We focus on the identification of barriers of social economy development and on the definition of criteria of social entrepreneurship as a new area of business activities with an emphasis on social enterprise, which has different forms of organization.
L31|What is a fair profit for social enterprise? Insights from microfinance|Although microfinance organizations have typically been considered as inherently ethical, recent events have challenged the legitimacy of the sector. High interest rates and the exorbitant profitability of some market leaders have raised the question of what can be considered a fair, or ethical, level of profit for social enterprise. In this article, we construct a fair profit framework for social enterprise based on four dimensions: the level of profitability, the extent to which the organization adheres to its social mission, the pricing and the surplus distribution. We then apply this framework using an empirical sample of 496 microfinance institutions. Results indicate that satisfying all four dimensions is a difficult, although not impossible, task. Based on our framework, 13 MFIs emerge as true double-bottom-line organizations and tend to be relatively young, large MFIs from South Asia. Using our framework, we argue that excessive profits can be better understood relative to pricing, the outreach of the MFI and the organizational commitment to clients in the form of reduced interest rates.
L31|How Costly is Social Screening? Evidence from the Banking Industry|Social banks screen loan applicants by using both social and financial criteria, and social screening implies an extra workload. To check the costs involved in this type of screening we use balance-sheet information on European banks, and compare the operating costs of social banks with those of other banks. Surprisingly, our first results suggest that social banks' costs are not significantly higher than those of their mainstream counterparts. Next, we uncover that the extra costs of social screening are offset by a cheaper workforce. Despite their need for specific screening, social banks are financially sustainable in a market dominated by for-profit institutions.
L31|Public vs Nonprofit Incarceration: The Case of The Netherlands|Outsourcing of detention is a complex public task, due to quality risks from incomplete contracts, the public responsibility for sentencing and execution, and related social opinions. In the Netherlands, the debate about the outsourcing of prison services to the private profit sector has recently restarted. At the same time, in the Netherlands there is extensive experience of outsourcing prison services – in particular for juvenile detention and internal forensic psychiatric care – to nonprofit organizations. In the Dutch experience, we have not found differences between public and nonprofit execution, with respect to the type of contract with the prisons, costs and quality. The Dutch experience shows that outsourcing to nonprofit entrepreneurs in civil society can be an alternative to outsourcing to the private market.
L31|Crowdfunding public goods: An experiment|We assess the impact of different crowdfunding designs on the success of crowdfunded public goods using a lab-in-the-field experiment. Our design treatments aim to increase the efficiency of crowdfunding campaigns by raising aggregate contributions and decreasing possible coordination problems that may occur when potential donors are faced with a multitude of projects seeking contributions. Amongst others, we explore the potential of seed money and the impact of the attraction effect. Using a four-day time window we implement our crowdfunding experiment using a web-based user interface with multiple threshold public goods, similar in style to conventional crowdfunding websites. We find that such alternative crowdfunding designs affect efficiency via improving coordination, and not so much via affecting total contributions. These results are confirmed in a follow-up framed field experiment with actual nature conservation projects.
L31|Selected Aspects of Social Cooperatives in Poland|The paper describes the characteristics of social cooperatives in Poland, which constitute an important element of the national sector of social entrepreneurship. Social cooperatives are non-profit organizations that combine economic activity with the social and professional reintegration of their members. The paper puts particular emphasis on the presentation of the social and economic potential of the social cooperatives sector in Poland. The paper presents the results of the monitoring of social cooperatives in Poland, which was carried out in 2015. It is the most comprehensive study that has been carried out among social cooperatives so far, which facilitated the acquisition of the comprehensive statistical information concerning the aforementioned sector. Additionally, the study presents contextual information concerning the legal and institutional conditions in relation to the functioning of social cooperatives in Poland.
L31|The Comparative Advantages of Single and Multi-stakeholder Cooperatives|When cooperatives were first invented, it was assumed their membership would be limited to one type of user. The Rochdale Pioneers favoured consumers, and employee representation was deliberately limited to a set percentage of board members. Similarly, Schulze Delitsch and Raiffeisen privileged farmers, Buchez workers, insurance mutuals those who are insured, and so on. Recently, Italian social cooperatives have developed a different model in which all the relevant stakeholders become members: those who are cared for, the carers, the workers, and volunteers. Also, occasionally dual stakeholder cooperatives have been designed. Eroski, the big Spanish retailer, has both consumers and workers in membership, and iCoop in Korea has both consumers and farmers. This paper has two aims, to set out some of the theoretical arguments for and against multi-stakeholder governance, to look at examples of multi-stakeholder models in practice, and to generate from this a set of research questions.
L31|Social Enterprise in Italy: Typology, Diffusion and Characteristics|Italian social enterprises are not a new topic in literature. Several aspects e.g. theoretical frameworks, quality of work and job satisfaction, networking strategies, and the impact of the recent financial crisis, have been studied from many different perspectives in the last twenty years. Most of these contributions focus in particular on social cooperatives, as the most representative legal form of social enterprise in Italy. Therefore, the idea that has been spreading in literature and among scholars is that social cooperatives are the only example of social enterprise existing in Italy. Conversely, in recent years, new forms of non-profit organizations, that were traditionally based on volunteer and donor support, have started to operate as social enterprises, employing people and running commercial activities. This article, which is one of a very few works that explore this topic, is intended to answer the following research questions: �How many different types of SEs are there in Italy?�; �How many SEs of each type are there?�; �In what ways and to what extent do they differ from each other?�.
L31|Strategie di Riposizionamento dell�Economia Sociale e Solidale nei Modelli di Consumo della �Grande Contrazione�|Questo contributo si propone di riformulare lo statuto �critico� del consumo, andando a ricercarne le tracce all�interno di modelli che da alternativi sono diventati mainstream. In particolare si intendono analizzare gli effetti generati da nuove value chains rispetto a un utente/consumatore pi� consapevole e proattivo.

L31|Civil society challenged: Towards an enabling policy environment|"The roles of non-governmental or civil society organizations have become more complex, especially in the context of changing relationships with nation states and the international community. In many instances, state-civil society relations have worsened, leading experts to speak of a ""shrinking space"" for civil society nationally as well as internationally. The author proposes to initiate a process for the establishment of an independent high-level commission of eminent persons (i) to examine the changing policy environment for civil society organizations in many countries as well as internationally, (ii) to review the reasons behind the shrinking space civil society encounters in some parts of the world and its steady development in others, and (iii) to make concrete proposals for how the state and the international system on the one hand and civil society on the other hand can relate in productive ways in national and multilateral contexts."
L31|The impact of incentives on prosocial behavior: An experimental investigation with German and Chinese subjects|Economists believe in (monetary) incentives. However, in the specialized area of prosocial behaviours, (monetary) incentives could backfire because extrinsic motivation might crowd out intrinsic motivation. Moreover, national differences in the perception of incentives should also be considered, taking the cultural background of individuals into account. In this project, we ran a real effort experiment in Germany and in China. In addition to an extrinsic monetary incentive (personal payment) to the subjects, we made a donation to UNICEF, and the amount of the donation depended on the effort of the subjects, which served as an intrinsic motivation. The results indicate that with respect to activities with a prosocial element, Germans tended to exert a high level of effort, regardless of the alternation of the art and the level of their payoff; in contrast, the Chinese did react to extrinsic monetary incentives and exerted more effort with a linear payment or if the level of payment was high. Females exerted significantly more effort than males, and this was true for both the German and Chinese subjects. The last finding is that the Chinese were more motivated by a fixed non-monetary payment than a fixed monetary payment, if the level of payment was relatively low.
L31|Matching schemes and public goods: A review|Matching schemes, where a party matches the contribution of others, reduce the effective price of a good and aim to foster its demand. We review the empirical literature on the effectiveness of these schemes in the context of public goods, especially in the field of charitable giving. As different measures of effectiveness are used, we classify results according to (i) the level of public good provision, (ii) the amount of individuals’ contributions, (iii) the likelihood to give and (iv) the contribution conditional on contributing a positive amount. Generalizing results is challenging, since context specific factors matter. Predominantly, a match is found to create a significant increase in public good provision without crowding out individuals’ contributions, while the effect on the likelihood of giving and contribution condition on contributing a positive amount is nonnegative. The discussion reveals several avenues for future research, as putting stronger emphasizes on long term effects, public good competition or heterogeneity in responses.
L31|Public Goods, Private Consumption, and Human Capital: Using Boosted Regression Trees to Model Volunteer Labour Supply|Economists use three types of models to describe volunteer labour supply: the public-goods model, the private-consumption model, and the human-capital model. We used data from an online survey questionnaire of volunteers working for the German Red Cross to study the extent to which utility components representing these three types help to explain volunteer labour supply. We analysed the survey data using boosted regression trees, where we controlled for several other potentially important socioeconomic correlates of volunteer labour supply. We used measures of relative influence and partial dependence plots to analyse the strength and the direction of the correlation of the utility components and the other socioeconomic variables with volunteer labour supply.
L31|The Italian Post-World War II Experience in Human Relations and Corporate Welfare|"The relevance of interventions in welfare and social security systems in the twentieth century has become the subject of extensive historical research. In particular from a prevalent focus on State intervention to a more in-depth historiographic reconsideration of the work performed by private institutions, including an important role played by industry. The focus of this paper is precisely the Corporate Welfare in the context of action after IIWW, by addressing the transformation in practices in terms of welfare and social security for workers, the essence of which is capable of revealing the participatory and communal nature of companies. In specific, I concentrate my attention on the relevance of the Human Relations in Italy and their effects on the Corporate Welfare. The paper examines some cases of HR as OM, Pirelli, Falck and Unilever. Finally there is a specific attention on the job training of the ""leader"" and the ""social worker of the factory""."
L31|A Postmodern Employment Model on the Peripheries|A new employment model has been evolving in the advanced economies since the 1980s. A change in labour and labour force management has led to an extreme rise in unemployment and, hence, social exclusion. In order for labour to retain its function as a value driver, a societal organiser and an engine of individual development a new (let us say “postmodern”) employment model should be developed and strengthened.In Hungary, the most marked change to the employment model is an increase in the importance of the role of the state and local governments as employers and a growing reliance on public work as a means of employment. The question is how public work can be incorporated into a sustainable postmodern employment model and channelled towards forand non-profit undertakings. While seeking to find an answer to this question, we also provide an outline of the characteristics of the employment situation in Hungary.

L31|Transformation Without Paternalism| Human development is meant to be transformational in that it aims to improve people's lives by enhancing their capabilities. But who does it target: people as they are or the people they will become? This paper argues that the human development approach relies on an understanding of personal identity as dynamic rather than as static collections of preferences, and that this distinguishes human development from conventional approaches to development. Nevertheless, this dynamic understanding of personal identity is presently poorly conceptualized and this has implications for development practice. We identify a danger of paternalism and propose institutionalizing two procedural principles as side constraints on development policies and projects: the principle of free prior informed consent and the principle of democratic development.
L31|Open Access as a Crude Solution to a Hold‐Up Problem in the Two‐Sided Market for Academic Journals|We analyze a model in which journals cannot commit to subscription fees when authors (who prefer low subscription fees because this boosts readership) make submission decisions. A hold‐up problem arises, manifested as excessive subscription fees. Open access is a crude attempt to avoid hold up by eliminating subscription fees. We assess the profitability and efficiency of traditional relative to open‐access journals in a monopoly model (with extensions to nonprofit, bundled, hybrid, and competing journals). We apply the theory to understand the evolving market for academic journals in the Internet age and policies currently being debated such as an open‐access mandate.
L31|Hospital Competition, Quality, and Expenditures in the U.S. Medicare Population|Theoretical models of competition with fixed prices suggest that hospitals should compete by increasing quality of care for diseases with the greatest profitability and demand elasticity. Most empirical evidence regarding hospital competition is limited to heart attacks, which in the U.S. generate positive profit margins but exhibit very low demand elasticity – ambulances usually take patients to the closest (or affiliated) hospital. In this paper, we derive a theoretically appropriate measure of market concentration in a fixed-price model, and use differential travel-time to hospitals in each of the 306 U.S. regional hospital markets to instrument for market concentration. We then estimate the model using risk-adjusted Medicare data for several different population cohorts: heart attacks (low demand elasticity), hip and knee replacements (high demand elasticity) and dementia patients (low demand elasticity, low or negative profitability). First, we find little correlation within hospitals across quality measures. And second, while we replicate the standard result that greater competition leads to higher quality in some (but not all) measures of heart attack quality, we find essentially no association between competition and quality for what should be the most competitive markets – elective hip and knee replacements. Consistent with the model, competition is associated with lower quality care among dementia patients, suggesting that competition could induce hospitals to discourage unprofitable patients.
L31|An Economic Appraisal of MOOC Platforms: Business Models and Impacts on Higher Education|We use various economic and pedagogical concepts to understand the specificities of MOOC (Massive Online Open Courses) platforms. We discuss how the private provision of MOOCs can be sustained. Using the theory of multisided platforms, we analyze five ways to monetize the MOOC business. We then claim that MOOC platforms can play a key transformative role in the higher education sector by making teaching practices evolve, rather than by replacing incumbent institutions. Finally, we derive a number of directions for public policy.
L31|Business Associations and Private Ordering|We study the capacity of business associations—private, formal, noncommercial organizations designed to promote the common business interests of their members—to support contract enforcement and collective action. Inspired by recent empirical literature, our theoretical framework connects the organizational and institutional features of formal and informal business organizations with socioeconomic distance. We show how associations provide value to their members even if members are already embedded in social networks, and which players join an association. We propose explanations for empirical puzzles, put forward novel testable hypotheses, and relate business associations to alternative private ordering institutions. (JEL D02, D71, L14, L31).
L31|Traditional and Current Aspects Regarding Fairs and Exhibitions Organized by Constanta Chamber of Commerce|"Sometimes, in marketing theory and practice it is used the generic phrase ""manifestations or exhibition events"", which actually refers to fairs, exhibitions, economic and/or business conventions, currently appreciated as being the most effective marketing tools. We are witnessing the enhacement of the interest of companies or organizations to participate in exhibition events (as exhibitors and/or visitors) due to the benefits that can be obtained as a result of their participation. In a significant extent, the success of an exhibition event depends on the activity of the organizer. The Chambers of Commerce are institutions which, still since their establishment, set themselves to be involved in organizing fairs, due to the role played by them in supporting and stimulating the entire economic activity, locally, nationally, and internationally. In this work, we propose to present significant aspects of the history of fairs, presenting a case study on the activity of Constanta Chamber of Commerce."
L31|Choice and Competition in Public Service Provision|In spite of a range of policy initiatives in sectors such as education, health care and legal services, whether choice and competition is valuable remains contested territory. This paper studies the impact of choice and competition on different dimensions of quality, examining the role of not-for-profit providers. We explore two main factors which determine whether an alternative provider enters the market: cost efficiency and the preferences of an incumbent not-for-profit provider (paternalism). The framework developed can incorporate standard concerns about the downside of choice and competition when consumer choice is defective (an internality) or choice imposes costs on those who do not switch (an externality). The paper considers optimal funding levels for incumbents and entrants showing when the 'voucher' provided for consumers to move to the incumbent should be more or less generous than the funding for consumers who remain with the incumbent. Finally, the model also offers an insight into why initiatives are frequently opposed by incumbent providers even if the latter have not-for-profit objectives.
L31|A simple model for cash flow management in nonprofits|Cash flow management is one of the most significant challenges that face nonprofit organizations. A shortage is cash, even if it's temporary, is a major risk factor for the organization. Nevertheless the standard method for cash flow management – a cash flow projection - does not produce satisfactory results for nonprofits. The weak point of the cash flow projection method is that it ignores the inherent unpredictability of the income stream. This is a typical characteristic of the nonprofits sector, due to its reliance on income stream from donations and grants. In this article I present a simple simulation model that overcomes this problem. The simulation model connects between the cash flow and the accounting data. It enables the organization to assess its cash flow risk, and to analyze different scenarios that can eliminate the risk. The model was tested in several nonprofit organizations, and the article presents its implementation in one of them.
L31|Assessing the potential of social enterprises through social network analysis: Evidence from Albania|Organizations falling within the category of ‘social enterprises’ are rapidly expanding in developing and transition countries, representing an innovative instrument for poverty reduction and endogenous development. However, economic long-term sustainability remains a major problem. Acquisition of knowledge is then claimed as a key issue for their competiveness and survival in the market. A critical factor for implementing successful knowledge transfer relates to the creation of well-connected networks of relationships. Stable and collaborative contacts among social entrepreneurs also allow more effective coordination, reducing the risk of dispersed and fragmented initiatives. This paper investigates the Albanian social enterprise sector, focusing on their network of relationships (i.e. social enterprises’ networks and supporting actors’ networks) by means of a social network analysis. Results are based on empirical evidence collected at the firm level from organizations operating in the Tirana and Scutari regions, the heart of the country’s economic growth engine. Visual social network investigation along with networks’ correlation analysis have showed that Albanian social enterprises are poorly aware of advantages arising from their network of relationships, still showing low entrepreneurial attitudes.
L31|Organization And Governance In Social Economy Enterprises: An Introduction|In this introduction, we briefly overview the topics covered by the contributions included in this special issue which, from different angles, deal with the organization and governance of social economy enterprises. Three different approaches are taken by the contributions to the special issue: one is theoretical, another is empirical and the last one is a case- based, qualitative perspective.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L31|The Role of Nongovernmental Organizations in the Public Decision Making Process|The purpose of this paper is to analyse the role of NGOs in the public decision-making process in European countries as well as Romania and the extent to which their involvement passes beyond the formal stage. The first part of the paper describes the current relationship between NGOs and government and how it influences the public decision-making process in Romania. The second part of the paper comparatively analyzes the experience of some European countries regarding NGOs involvement in the public decision making process and identifies the theoretical and practical aspects that can be implemented in Romania. The end of the paper presents the final conclusions on the subject under discussion.
L31|Public Marketing: A Strategic Tool for Social Economy|Lately, social economy structures at European and national level have increased in number. The contribution of social economy at local economical development through jobs creation and solutions to social problems has been recognized at the European level making social economy a high interest research field. Concepts such as social entrepreneurship or social enterprise are often mistaken associated with the non-profit or non-governmental sector that has a considerable role in addressing social needs the public sector is not able to deal with, making imperious to clarify the differences and similarities between them. The social dimension of public sector and social economy gives the latter the posiblity to use marketing tools such as different forms of public marketing - positive marketing, social marketing, anti-marketing and de-marketing - to achieve its goals. Due to the diverse activities of social enterprises, managers might need to adapt classic marketing approaches to the specific institutional requirements. It is essential to understand how to make use of marketing instruments for achievement of institutional objectives, otherwhise they might have no impact. This paper approaches public marketing as a strategic tool for social economy structures emphasizing the main approach differences between classic marketing and public marketing in social economy in terms of marketing mix core elements.
L31|The concept of innovation in social economy. A review and a research agenda|"Current research provides evidence that traditional business and public sector organizations are not the only structures that encourage development through innovation. A more recent form of organization known under the name of ""social enterprise"" has a great potential to innovate services, products and processes which can create social value. We have reviewed an array of social economy literature incorporating into it the concept of innovation. Following the grounded theory procedure we have analysed 59 papers in the field of social economy published between 1990 and 2014 so as to see the current state of knowledge regarding the innovative dimension of social enterprises. The innovative dimension of the social enterprise has been found to have been rather neglected by the research field, which tend to adhere to a more theoretical rather than empirical direction. A future research agenda is proposed here, so as to address this issue."
L31|Corporate social responsibility, NGOs and business partnerships for social sustainability|This article provides information regarding the potential of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to bridge the gap between non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and businesses in order to create meaningful socially sustainable projects in specific community environments. Companies as well as NGOs have placed attention on this specific field of interest in the past but often fail to reach the primary goals of the desired community projects due to a lack of knowledge and resources in developing and integrating the projects. This article explains how NGOs and various businesses can benefit each other in a mutual way through a collaboration of reputation, knowledge and effective resources.
L31|On Social Economy Concept|We often find in the specialized works the claim that Social Economy, as we understand it today, has three main conceptual sources, namely: the works published in the XIX th century by economists like Dunoyer, Mill, Walras; the vision of certain theoreticians and practitioners such as Owen and Fourier and the cooperatives established in Europe about two centuries ago such as the Rochdale Pioneers. But there are fundamental differences between the XIXth century's acceptation with regards to the term and current definitions. The constancy which links all these concerns is the affiliation of the debates in the Social Economics field, a branch of economics that investigates the relationship between the economy and the society. At the same time, we can not deny the connections and similarities between the cooperatives and mutual associations of two centuries ago and of today. But, back in time, the concept of social economy, both theoretically and practically, was not limited to these types of organizations. The conclusion of the study is that today we can talk about a Neo Social Economy which gives up to utopian visions but is limited to the activity of a particular type of organization called Social Enterprises.
L31|Comments on the Law of Social Economy - no. 219/2015 from Economic Efficiency and Ethics Points of View|The Law on Social Economy was recently enacted in Romania (August 2015), followed by its related enforcement guidelines, one year later (august 2016). Hereinafter, I have analysed the way in which this legislative document defines the Third Sector compared to previous definitions given by national legislation and the directions set out by the European Union. Even though the law complies with European definitions and criteria, the impact of this legislative initiative will depend, in my opinion, on classic Social Economy aspects (which occurred in the 19th century) which are not, however, stressed by the Law no. 219/2015: economic efficiency of social enterprises, the significance of complying with moral values, not just social goals, in the practice of economy, the self-help and entrepreneurial spirit which must be developed among the members themselves of vulnerable groups involved. This article points out the possible traps of the adopted approach and proposes a wider view over the social purpose that Social Economy could serve.
L31|Commons-creating Society|The main purpose of this contribution is to give an insight into the radical German commons discourse. It rejects naturalist conceptualizations of commons and rather emphasizes the social dimensions. Combining free software and traditional commons, it builds on and goes beyond the Ostromâ€™s research. Commons are seen as an enabling form and potential foundation for a decentralized and needs-oriented post-capitalist society free of personal and structural domination and beyond the market and state.
L31|Strengthening business ecosystems by bridging social capital: An approach for social entrepreneurs|Social entrepreneurship has been defined as the generation of new ventures involving economic, social and environmental value. In that sense, social impact is aimed through the introduction of products, services, technologies or processes targeted for the improvement of the well-being of the poor, access to education, health services, water, energy, among others. However, social entrepreneurs usually lack the resources to sustain their ventures; thus, inter-firm alliances are often sought for resource provision. Although such alliances are a step towards the achievement of sustainability regarding the new social venture, the main argument of this study relays upon goal alignments among all the pertaining partners towards creating community value through a business ecosystem. Then, contributions of all actors involved could be focused around visions, ideas, volunteering, and resources exchanges. This study presents a conceptual model based on the development of a business ecosystem through bridging social capital with diverse key players (e. g. universities, government, Non-Governmental Organizations, Multinational Corporations, or institutions) in order to assure resource provision for social firms. The model proposes that greater transfer of resources among the players strengthens the sustainability of the new social venture.
L31|Non-governmental organisations in European Union and its role in consumer protection|The article is based on an analysis of the subject literature, the legal acts and information from the official web sites of European non-governmental organisations (NGO?s), the main purpose of which is to present the idea and the primary role of NGO?s, whose priority is to propagate and popularize consumer protection in the European Union.In addition an analysis is conducted of the systematics of Consumer non-governmental sector in European Union. Also the relation between non-governmental organisations and European Commission are indicated. The article includes a characterisation of the specific role of the European Economic and Social Committee, which consists of representatives of the various economic and social components of organised civil society, such as consumers in the development of consumer protection in the European market. Generally consumer protection policy was established after the year 1992. At that time, on 7 February 1992 in Maastricht, the Treaty on the European Union undertaken to integrate Europe was signed by the members of the European Community. The Treaty devoted to consumer protection is under a separate title, XI. From that time, the Community shall contribute to the attainment of a high level of consumer protection. One of the ways to achieve this aim is the development of NGO?s within the consumer sectors, which can be called the dedicated voice of the consumer at national and Community level.In the next section of the article the chosen European Union non-government organization and its role in consumer protection is analyzed. In particular the specific actions undertaken on that matter by the European Community of Consumer Co-operatives (Euro Coop), the European Farmers Organisation, the European Association for the co-ordination of Consumer Representation in Standardisation (ANEC) and the Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs ( BEUC ) are analysed.The final section of the article is the conclusion of the real role of consumer NGO?s both now and in the future in European Union policy. Those considerations are based on real European Union regulations such as Regulation (EU) No 254/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on a multiannual consumer programme for the years 2014-20, and the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal for the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Consumer Programme 2014-2020.
L31|Institutional Forms of Action against social exclusion in Poland|Negative social phenomena such as poverty, unemployment disabilities and social pathologies have been building up. Governments in many countries search for the new methods of governing in order to confine the processes or at least, to reduce their growth.Solutions based on the establishment of non ? governmental organizations as institutions compensating for the weaknesses of the public and private sector have turned out insufficient. It has become necessary to create jobs for persons exposed to discrimination and unequal treatment in labour market. Extention of the non-profit sector to include business organizations that can create jobs for the disadvantaged with State?s suport in one of the implemented measures. Theory has labeled this enlarged sector as a social economy. In addition to clasic nonprofit institutions, other components of the sector are social enterprises, social cooperatives and Social Integration Centers.The paper aims to value such organizations activity in the Polish circumstances. They were formaly set up in Poland in 2003-2006.The analysis takes advantage of relevant law and statistical data concerning the activity of the established and operating organizations.The analysis will show the tendencies of development of these institutions in Poland. Besides it allows to limit their weak points and to asses their usefulness to the economy.
L31|Social Entrepreneurship Research – Challenges, Explanations and Suggestions for the Field Development (Przedsiebiorczosc spoleczna – wyzwania, przyczyny i sugestie dla obszaru badawczego)|The aim of the paper is to examine the human resources management (HRM) in not-profit organisations in view of entrepreneurship theory and to identify some problems which could be crucial for future research and development of pro-entrepreneurial HRM practices in non-profit organizations. It was suggested that some solutions from business ventures can be implemented in non-profit organisations, but specific traits of them (as engagement of volunteers and their motivation and expectations) have to be taken into account. The pro-entrepreneurial HRM in non-profit organisations was analysed in relevance to different types of people’s involvement (employees, volunteers, members, social entrepreneurs) and selected HRM functions (job description, recruitment, training and rewarding).
L31|Nature of NGO Volunteers’ and Employees’ Motivation. Implications and Recommendations for Managerial Staff (Charakter motywacji wolontariuszy i pracownikow organizacji pozarz¹dowych. Implikacje i rekomendacje dla kadry kierowniczej)|The analysis presented below indicates different types of motivation of non-governmental organisations’ staff and involves the relationship between the type of motivation and other staff features. This allows not only for looking at the causes and characteristics of involvement in the activities of non-governmental organisations but also for describing the specific motivation of the various groups involved in the activities of the organisation and presenting profiles of these groups. Moreover, the analysis of motivations and characteristics correlated with them allows for drawing conclusions related to motivating rules of these groups, stimulating their commitment and selecting the management style appropriate for analysed organisations.
L31|Social Entrepreneurs Wanted: Quality of Life Approach as a Basis for Recruitment Practice in Beit Ekstein Schools in Israel (Poszukiwani przedsiebiorcy spoleczni – jakosc zycia jako podstawa praktyki rekrutacyjnej w szkolach Beit Ekstein w Izraelu)|The following paper examines the relationship between the Quality of Life approach and the recruiting practice of Beit Ekstein special education school managers. First, the paper explores three main fields: the Beit Ekstein Quality of Life model relative to quality of life concept; the role of school managers in general and specifically at Beit Ekstein; teachers as social entrepreneurs. Through a content analysis of data gathered in interviews with Beit Ekstein school managers, the article aims to identify the special characteristics that the school managers are looking for in their recruiting practice. Findings show that Beit Ekstein school managers have a specific perception of their teams and seek to hire people with the characteristics of social entrepreneurs, since the qualities held by such recruits will play a significant role in the development of their special needs pupils. Moreover, findings bring an understanding of the school manager’s perception of the Quality of Life model.
L31|Are Financial Cooperatives Crowded out by Commercial Banks in the Process of Financial Sector Development?|This paper investigates whether financial cooperatives are crowded out by commercial banks in the process of financial sector development. We use a self-constructed database based on World Council of Credit Unions data for the years 1990-2011 of cooperatives in 55 developing countries. Our empirical results are threefold. First, financial cooperatives tend to reach more members in countries where the commercial banking sector is weak. This validates their role as a banking market failure solution. Second, in the process of commercial bank expansion, financial cooperatives run the risk of being crowded out. Third, the relationship is actually complex, since financial cooperatives seem to benefit from some kind of bank presence, especially as far as savings mobilization is concerned.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L31|A meta-analysis examining the nature of trade-offs in microfinance|Increasingly, microfinance institutions must balance both social and financial objectives, the so-called double bottom line. A growing number of studies have investigated the ability of MFIs to achieve both objectives simultaneously. From an initial sample of 3,299 articles, I synthesize 274 empirical findings from 61 studies to perform a meta-analysis on the relationship between financial and social performance. Findings suggest that studies using the Mix Market database are less likely to confirm trade-offs while articles that use efficiency indicators, employ an economic frontier methodology or are published in development journals are more likely to confirm evidence of performance trade-offs.
L31|Microcredit in Industrialized Countries: Unexpected Consequences of Regulatory Loan Ceilings|Subsidized microfinance institutions (MFIs) provide affordable credit to small entrepreneurs. Many industrialized countries regulate MFIs. But in a market with accessible small business financing, regulatory loan ceilings can jeopardize the supply of microcredit to the most disadvantaged people. This is because small entrepreneurs in need of above-ceiling credit have the option to combine a ceiling-high microcredit with a supplementary loan from a regular bank. By reducing information asymmetry, this type of co-financing may prompt MFIs to divert credit away from entrepreneurs seeking below-ceiling loans. This study uses hand-collected data from a French MFI to test, and partly confirm, this theory.
L31|The influence of CEO power on agency costs in non-profit organisations: evidence from the global microfinance industry|This paper examines agency costs incurred by microfinance organisations. We argue that differences in agency costs not only stem from differences in ownership form but are also influenced by the amount of power wielded by the chief executive officer (CEO). We proxy for agency costs using operating expenses, asset utilisation, liquidity and tangible asset intensity. Using a sample of 374 microfinance organisations located in 76 countries, we find evidence that agency costs are higher in microfinance organisations set up as non-profits, but only if the CEO is powerful. Our empirical evidence illustrates the importance of installing proper governance mechanisms to minimise agency costs, in particular in the non-profit sector.
L31|Pro-social behavior after a disaster: parochial or universal? Evidence from a natural experiment in Belgium|In the midst of an ongoing nationwide campaign to collect funds for famine relief in Africa, a storm struck a locally famous outdoor music festival in Belgium. Five participants died, and several hundreds were wounded. We use this event to determine whether pro-social behavior, measured by donations to the campaign, can be affected by a local disaster. Applying a differences-in-differences identification strategy to campaign contributions at the municipality-day level, we show that, after the event, the municipalities affected by the disaster gave more money to the famine relief in Africa campaign than non-affected municipalities. We interpret this finding as evidence that donations to a faraway cause can be positively affected by a local disaster.
L31|Active Social Programs and Their Strategic Advantages in Labor Market Development|The active programs and measures on the labor market are the subject of increasing interest and comment not only because expectations for tangible effects, but also because of the relatively significant financial resources necessary for their implementation. The paper discussed the active social programs and their strategic advantages in labor market development considering the methodology of their development and accenting the role of human resources and innovative technologies.
L31|Change in access after digitization: Ethnographic collections in Wikipedia|The raison dâ€™Ãªtre of memory institutions revolves around collecting, preserving and giving access to heritage collections. Increasingly, access takes place in social networked markets characterized by communities of users that serve to select and rank content to facilitate reuse. Publication of heritage in such digital medium transforms patterns of consumption. We performed a quantitative analysis on the access to a museum collection and compared results before and after publication on Wikimedia. Analysis of the difference in access showed two main results: first, access to collections increased substantially online. From a selection of the most viewed objects, access grew from an average of 156,000 onsite visitors per year (or 15.5 million in a century) to over 1.5 million views online per year (or 7.9 million in five years). Second, we find a long tail in both mediums, where 8% of objects were exhibited onsite and 11% of available objects online were used in Wikipedia articles (representing 1% of the total collection). We further document differences in consumer preference for type of object, favouring 3D onsite and 2D online, as well as topic and language preference, favouring Wikipedia articles about geography and in English. Online publication is hence an important complement to onsite exhibitions to increase access to collections. Results shed light on online consumption of heritage content by consumers who may not necessarily visit heritage sites.
L31|What Causes the Positive Price-Turnover Correlation in European Housing Markets?|Abstract This paper examines what determines the correlation between prices and turnover in European housing markets. Using a panel vector autoregressive model, we find that there is a particularly strong feedback mechanism between prices and turnover. Momentum effects are another important reason why prices and turnover are correlated. Common underlying factors, such as GDP and interest rates, also explain part of the price-turnover correlation. The results in this paper imply that, to understand price and turnover dynamics, it is important to model prices and turnover as two interdependent processes. There is a considerable bias in the coefficient estimates of standard house price models if this dependency is not explicitly taken into account.
L31|A commercial gift for charity|Commercial firms are increasingly tying the sales of their products with donations to a charitable cause. Apart from a charitable motive, offering these charity-linked bundles could be a strategic instrument for firms to increase profits. We report the results of an experiment that investigates for different of these schemes whether they are able to increase profits net of the donation, and which donation scheme is most profitable. From a theoretical perspective, given rational agents, complete markets, and absent transaction cost, selling charity-linked bundles should not be profitable even when consumers are altruistic. We find however that sellers who donate 5% of their gross revenues or an equivalent absolute amount do attain significantly higher profits. No such effect is observed when the donation is limited to 2%. Offering charity-linked bundles considerably crowds out private donations by buyers.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L31|Il Ruolo Delle Istituzioni Non Profit Nelle Province a Maggiore Fragilit� Occupazionale|Le istituzioni non profit rappresentano il settore produttivo che � cresciuto di pi� nell�ultimo decennio intercensuario (+28 per cento tra il 2001 e il 2011 rispetto al +8,4 per cento delle imprese e al -21,8 per cento delle istituzioni pubbliche), in particolare sono pi� di 14 mila le istituzioni nate nel 2011, un anno che non � ritenuto tra i peggiori nell�ambito della pi� ampia fase di crisi economica internazionale, ma che � descritto comunque come un periodo di incertezza e di freno alle decisioni di investimento delle imprese (Istat, Rapporto annuale 2015). Il presente contributo, attraverso i dati del Censimento dell�industria e dei servizi e le principali statistiche sull�occupazione, cercher� di individuare le aree territoriali e/o settoriali pi� esposte alle fragilit� che la crisi ha evidenziato, per analizzare, proprio in questi ambiti, il ruolo e la capacit� innovativa del settore non profit.
L31|Governance for a �socialised economy�. A case study in preventive health and work integration|This work is motivated by the question of how organisational governance can address the needs of vulnerable groups. This paper offers a conceptual reflection on how the production of complex health-related services, such as aspects of preventive psychiatric illnesses, can be governed to the benefit of users and communities society more broadly. The analysis is applied to a consortium of twenty-two social enterprises (SEs), with worker membership, located in Italy. The governance model adopted by the consortium is of particular interest since it pioneered solutions based on the combination of preventive health and work integration services. The case, specifically, allows to illustrate and analyse interdependencies amongst multiple publics, and how these are reflected by the governance model. Specifically, the findings suggest that central to the success of the model in meeting such challenges are: a) the integration of different but complementary organisations and competencies, including health, social, and production competences; b) a mix of interdependent governance solutions, each activating different types of publics and social capital; c) membership, through which workers partake in decision-making; d) formal fiduciary duties between vulnerable publics and members complemented by bonding and bridging social relations; e) the integration of community assets as inputs into the process, and the creation of societal outputs in terms of employment, social integration and cohesion.
L31|Selectivity and Transparency in Social Banking: Evidence from Europe| How do social banks signal their social commitment to motivated funders? We hypothesize that two main channels are used: selectivity and transparency. We test these predictions using a rich dataset comprising balancesheet information on 5,000 European banks over the period from 1998 to 2013. The results suggest that social screening leads social banks to higher project selectivity compared to mainstream banks. Social banks also tend to be more transparent than other banks. However, combining selectivity and transparency can result in excess liquidity. Overall, the empirical findings not only confirm our theoretical hypotheses, but also raise challenging issues regarding the management of social banks.
L31|La incidencia de los valores culturales en el voluntariado: el caso de Europa<BR>[The influence of cultural values over volunteering: the case of Europe]|La realidad del voluntariado es sumamente compleja hasta el punto de que resulta complicado definir y caracterizar el trabajo voluntario, dada la gran variedad de interpretaciones, motivaciones, variables sociodemográficas y aspectos culturales que configuran el perfil de los voluntarios. El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar la influencia conjunta de algunas variables sociodemográficas, así como de los valores culturales de índole secular o tradicional, sobre el perfil de los voluntarios en Europa. Además, se investiga qué variables orientan a los voluntarios hacia un determinado tipo de voluntariado u otro. Para ello se ha aplicado principalmente una metodología de regresión logística a partir de la información disponible en la European Value Study. Los resultados obtenidos ayudan a establecer una caracterización del voluntariado en Europa, y confirman la influencia de los valores culturales, en primer lugar, en la realización o no de trabajos de voluntariado, y en segundo lugar, en la elección que hacen estas personas del tipo de actividad con la que están comprometidos. Al analizar dos tipos de voluntariado de motivación supuestamente muy diferente, se concluye que existe un grupo de valores que influyen en ambos, aunque el sentido y la intensidad en la que lo hacen sea diferente; por otra parte, algunos valores tienen influencia o no en la realización de trabajos de voluntariado, dependiendo del tipo específico al que nos refiramos.
L31|Entrepreneurship and Social Innovation in Training and Human Capital Development: the Case of the Bank Palmas|This study aimed to analyze an entrepreneurial experience, social innovation and human capital; the object of the study is the Bank Palmas, located in Fortaleza, in Ceará, Brazil. This bank was created to address the need to promote the income generation and job, making use of a corporate economic system, which allows to overcome the poverty axis located in a suburb called Conjunto Palmeiras, with a population of 30 thousand inhabitants. For this, we used the descriptive and exploratory research with fieldwork conducted in the locality of Bank Palmas. These actions serve as a benchmark for innovative practices and have meaningful participation and involvement of local inhabitants. A population sample consisted of 207 individuals, associates and employees of the Bank Palmas and was used to analyze the descriptive and inferential statistics. The data suggest that the entrepreneurship development concepts and social innovation and human capital are implemented by the Bank Palmas with relevant results in the local community. Members and employees of the Bank Palmas through these various actions felt themselves as active players in transforming their reality. Investment in human development is considered as a major source of innovation, the organizations of various sectors of the economy need to incorporate the strategic management of human capital, as recommended in the literature on this topic, which considers the human capital as the set of all the skills, knowledge and experience of employees or managers, involving also the creativity and innovation.
L31|Die soziale Funktion von Genossenschaften im Wandel|"In der Geschichte der deutschen modernen Genossenschaftsbewegung kam der Förderung sozialer Belange in Abhängigkeit von den Vorstellungen der Gründungsväter, vom Zustand der jeweiligen gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse und dem politischen System sowie von den vorrangigen Förderinteressen der Mitgliederkreise eine wechselnde Bedeutung zu. Entgegen der Ausgangslage traten Genossenschaften in der Folgezeit über mehrere Perioden als Wirtschaftsgebilde mit der nachrangigen Positionierung als Sozialgebilde in Erscheinung. Es stellte sich die Frage, ob ein Wirtschaften, das die soziale Mitverantwortlichkeit vernachlässigt oder zeitweise außer Acht lässt, langfristig erfolgreich sein kann. In der Gegenwart besteht im deutschen Sozial- und Wohlfahrtsstaat ein erheblicher ""Förderbedarf"" Geringqualifizierter, Langzeitarbeitsloser und Einkommensarmer. Darüber besteht weitgehende Einigkeit. Der Staat sieht sich jedoch nicht in der Lage, allen dringlichen und zudem ansteigenden sozialen Bedürfnissen gerecht zu werden. Nach und nach hat er sich in einigen Bereichen aus der gesellschaftlichen Verantwortung zurückgezogen. Zwecks Vermeidung sozialer Konflikte müssen die entstehenden Lücken durch außerstaatliches Handeln geschlossen werden. Eingedenk ihres Ursprungs sahen sich Genossenschaften in dieser Situation zu Aktivitäten herausgefordert, mit denen sie sich über die Förderung ihrer Mitglieder hinausgehend auf die Ebene der Gemeinwohlförderung begaben.

L31|That's my turf: An experimental analysis of territorial use rights for fisheries in Indonesia|We conduct a framed field experiment in Indonesian fishing communities, with an eye towards evaluating the potential of Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries (TURFs) to preserve coral reef fisheries. Conducted in three culturally distinctive sites, the study assembles groups of five fishers who participate in a common-pool resource game. We implement the game with randomly assigned treatments in all sites to explore whether the extraction decision varies according to three recommended non-binding extraction levels originating from (1) a democratic process, (2) a group leader or (3) an external source that recommends a socially optimal extraction level. In one of the sites - that having the highest levels of ethnic and religious diversity - we find that democratic decision-making as well as information originating from outside the community promotes the cooperative behavior that underpins TURFs, a result that is robust to regressions controlling for individual and community attributes.
L31|Online fundraising, self-deception, and the long-term impact of ask avoidance|"We study an online fundraising campaign run on an opera ticket booking plat-form. After establishing a baseline, a first change doubled the donation grid. A second change altered the navigation of the website rendering the act of declining to donate more salient. The contribution of our paper is fourfold. First, we add to the literature on defaults by showing how donation grids can have dramatic im-pacts on giving. Second, we demonstrate that small, apparently superficial chang-es in the design of a campaign can have unexpectedly large consequences (offset-ting the effects of changes in the choice architecture). Third, we provide the first field evidence for the role of self-image in charitable giving. Finally, we provide stark evidence on adverse long-run effects of fundraising campaigns for ticket selling entities. ""Avoiding the ask,"" non-frequent customers buy fewer tickets in the following opera season. Ticket sales per person fall by €16-32, while average charitable income from the same group during the campaign is just €0.26."

L31|The New Economics of Religion|The economics of religion is a relatively new field of research in economics. This survey serves two purposes--it is backward-looking in that it traces the historical and sociological origins of this field, and it is forward-looking in that it examines the insights and research themes that are offered by economists to investigate religion globally in the modern world. Several factors have influenced the economics of religion: (1) new developments in theoretical models including spatial models of religious markets and evolutionary models of religious traits; (2) empirical work that addresses innovatively econometric identification in examining causal influences on religious behavior; (3) new research in the economic history of religion that considers religion as an independent, rather than a dependent, variable; and (4) more studies of religion outside the Western world. Based on these developments, this paper discusses four themes--first, secularization, pluralism, regulation, and economic growth; second, religious markets, club goods, differentiated products, and networks; third, identification including secular competition and charitable giving; and fourth, conflict and cooperation in developing societies. In reviewing this paradoxically ancient yet burgeoning field, this paper puts forward unanswered questions for scholars of the economics of religion to reflect upon in years to come.
L31|Organizacje pozarządowe w subregionie leszczyńskim. Potencjał i bariery / The Non-Governmental Organisations in the Leszno Subregion. Their Potential and Constraints|Due to the growing importance of local pro-development attitudes and non-governmental organizations for development, it is important to look at their activities in different subregions. In this work the author presents the results of research carried out in the Leszno subregion on the presence of elements of social capital, the organizational and financial sustainability of NGOs, and their cooperation with public administration in the context of their impact on local development. In addition, through a comparative analysis of selected issues, it recalls the good practices of NGOs in Switzerland which, because of the long tradition of their operation and the experience gained, can also be used in Polish settings.
L31|Współpraca pomiędzy biznesem a organizacjami pozarządowymi na przykładzie województwa lubuskiego / Current Trends in Fostering Cooperation Between Business and NGO’s Supported by Examples from Lubusz Voivodeship|Non-governmental organisations in recent years have gained new possibilities to realise their initiatives, thanks to the strong need among corporations to maintain their socially-desired image, which translates into their greater openness towards possible cooperation with the third sector. Several representatives of NGOs, utilising the latest technological solutions, are improving both the extent of their influence and its effectiveness. As multiple examples from Lubusz Voivodeship illustrate, the strategy of cooperation between business and non-governmental organisations can take on many forms, not necessarily based on financial support. Currently, a bargaining chip in the case of both sides is their knowledge capital. Corporations striving to maintain a positive image in the surroundings they function within are more eager to support social initiatives, recognising in it a possible path to gaining a competitive edge. In my article, I intend to reflect the specificity of the business/NGO relation and its determinants on the basis of selected examples from Lubusz Voivodeship. By analysing case studies, I will try to indicate the most common mutual expectations and construct a vision of a “perfect partner”. The context of analysing the quality of relations between business and NGO’s is social capital, which is an important value determining its shape. This arises from the belief that an organisation’s social capital has a meaningful impact on its attractiveness in the eyes of a potential partner. In my paper I will also present the most recent data, depicting the level of trust among the local community.
L31|Key Factors for Success of Social Enterprises in Italy: Analysis of Financial and Operating Performance|Assessing social performance is one of the greatest challenges for practitioners and researchers in social entrepreneurship. Even though social enterprises (SEs) have the main goal of achieving social purposes, they should also be able to economically and financially survive to meet their aim and accomplish their tasks. To this purpose, we investigate if the key factors leading to the financial and operating performance are the same as those of for-profit firms, by using Italian data at a firm level during the period 2002-2013. We find that the standard financial and operating factors characterising for-profit firms¡¯ performance play a crucial role for SEs¡¯ results as well. Moreover, territorial and socio-economic variables seem to have a positive impact on financial performance. From a policy perspective, this may imply that further programs (e.g. safety-oriented and those promoting facilities in the territory) should be locally adopted to support the SEs¡¯ activity and development.
L31|Firms, Nonprofits, And Cooperatives: A Theory Of Organizational Choice|We formalize the difference between profit-maximizing firms, nonprofits, and cooperatives and identify optimal organizational choice in a model of quality provision. Firms provide lowest and nonprofits highest levels of quality. Efficiency, however, depends on the competitive environment, the decision making process among owners and technology. Firms are optimal when decision making costs are high. Else, firms are increasingly dominated by either nonprofits or cooperatives. Increased competition improves relative efficiency of firms and decreases relative efficiency of nonprofits.
L31|Racial Group Affinity and Religious Giving: Evidence from Congregation-Level Panel Data|Since giving to religious organizations constitutes a substantial portion of total charitable giving, an understanding of the determinants of religious giving is a vital policy concern. Drawing on a novel congregation-level panel dataset, we examine whether religious giving is driven by preferences for racial group affinity, that is, loyalty to one’s own racial group. To address endogeneity concerns, we combine a fixed effects estimation framework with an instrumental variable approach. We find robust evidence consistent with the racial group affinity motive: a decrease in the percent of whites in the local community is ceteris paribus associated with a decrease in the total giving receipts collected by predominantly white congregations. The magnitude of this effect does not vary with the extent of racial residential segregation in the community. The effect, however, is driven by the congregations in urban (as opposed to rural) communities. We offer a possible explanation for this result.
L31|Merchants of Doubt: Corporate Political Influence when Expert Credibility is Uncertain|A key role of science-based non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is to communicate scientific knowledge to policymakers. However, recent evidence has emerged showing that industry-backed groups often attempt to undermine the credibility of such NGOs and weaken their ability to influence policy. To investigate the mechanisms by which a firm can profitably create doubt about scientific information, we use a signaling model of interest-group lobbying in which the policymaker has fixed costs of taking action. We explore two mechanisms for the creation of doubt. The first involves using Bayesian persuasion to imply that the NGO may be a radical extremist whose lobbying is not credible. The second involves the creation of a think tank which can offer its own testimony on scientific matters. We show the firm prefers that the think tank does not act as a credible moderate, but instead sometimes takes radical, non-credible, positions. We identify conditions under which each mechanism is preferred by the firm.
L31|Retos de la Alcaldía de Medellín para la aplicación de la Política Pública de Economía Social y Solidaria|La Administración Municipal tiene grandes retos para la superación de problemáticas sociales y la generación de desarrollo equitativo e incluyente. Para ello busca aplicar la Política Pública de Economía Social y Solidaria, al igual que crear, fortalecer y consolidar Unidades Productivas Asociativas (UPA). La metodología utilizada se apoya en el enfoque de investigación cualitativa-interpretativa y usa como técnica entrevistas semiestructuradas a representantes legales de organizaciones sociales y solidarias intervenidas por la Alcaldía de Medellín. Los resultados muestran que no es suficiente proporcionar condiciones necesarias para el surgimiento de estas iniciativas, sino lograr su fortalecimiento y consolidación en el mercado.******The Municipal Administration faces great challenges in overcoming social problems and the generation of equal and inclusive development. In view of this, it seeks to apply the public policy for a social and solidarity-based economy, and to create, strengthen, and consolidate Associative Production Units (APU). The methodology used is supported by a qualitative and interpretive research method and uses semi-structured interviews with the legal representatives of social and solidarity-based organizations intervened by Medellín City Council. The results show that it is not enough to provide the necessary conditions for the emergence of such initiatives, but rather they have to be strengthened and consolidated in the market.
L31|Wolves in sheep’s clothing: Is non-profit status used to signal quality?|Why do many firms in the healthcare sector adopt non-profit status? One argument is that non-profit status serves as a signal of quality when consumers are not well informed. A testable implication is that an increase in consumer information may lead to a reduction in the number of non-profits in a market. We test this idea empirically by exploiting an exogenous increase in consumer information in the US nursing home industry. We find that the information shock led to a reduction in the share of non-profit homes, driven by a combination of home closure and sector switching. The lowest quality non-profits were the most likely to exit. Our results have important implications for the effects of reforms to increase consumer provision in a number of public services.
L31|Choice and Competition in Public Service Provision|"In spite of a range of policy initiatives in sectors such as education, health care and legal services, whether choice and competition is valuable remains contested territory. This paper studies the impact of choice and competition on different dimensions of quality, examining the role of not-for-profit providers. We explore two main factors which determine whether an alternative provider enters the market: cost efficiency and the preferences of an incumbent not-for-profit provider (paternalism). The framework developed can incorporate standard concerns about the downside of choice and competition when consumer choice is defective (an internality) or choice imposes costs on those who do not switch (an externality). The paper considers optimal funding levels for incumbents and entrants showing when the ""voucher"" provided for consumers to move to the incumbent should be more or less generous than the funding for consumers who remain with the incumbent. Finally, the model also offers an insight into why initiatives are frequently opposed by incumbent providers even if the latter have not-for-profit objectives."
L31|Heterogeneity and self-selection into nonprofit management|This paper presents a microeconomic model of self-selection into nonprofit management. First, we extend previous models by assuming that individuals are heterogeneous in multiple dimensions besides intrinsic motivation, including managerial ability, self-image concerns, and laziness at work. Second, we consider the public sector as an alternative to nonprofit sector employment, and assume that nonprofit, for-profit, and public sectors differ in the perceived level of red tape, and the potential levels of fixed pay and variable pay. We show that self-selection into nonprofit management is a complex process that depends on multiple factors, and formulate conditions that need to be fulfilled in order to have self-selection of heterogeneous individuals into nonprofit management. From this finding we derive a number of important avenues for future research.
L31|Efficience des institutions de microfinance en Bolivie et au Pérou:une approche data envelopment analysis en deux étapes|(VF)Cet article consiste, tout d’abord, à mesurer de plusieurs manières l’efficience de 61 institutions de microfinance (IMF) boliviennes et péruviennes avec la méthode Data Envelopment Analysis. Nos résultats indiquent que les IMF examinées observent des niveaux d’efficience financière élevés et des scores d’efficience sociale plutôt faibles. Les scores d’efficience sont ensuite régressés sur une série de facteurs explicatifs des caractéristiques des IMF. Nous montrons que le statut juridique, la méthode de prêt, l’âge et la zone d’opération déterminent l’efficience sociale. En revanche, ces facteurs influencent de manière beaucoup plus limitée les scores des efficiences financière et globale. (VA)In this paper, we first measure in various ways the efficiency of 61 Bolivian and Peruvian microfinance institutions (MFIs) via a Data Envelopment Analysis approach. Our results show the MFIs under scrutiny achieve a high level of financial efficiency and low scores of social efficiency. We then regress the efficiency scores on a series of factors capturing MFIs’ features. We report that governance, lending methodology, age and operational area are key drivers of social efficiency. However, these factors only have little influence on financial and global efficiency scores.
L31|Mass media effects on non-governmental organizations|Globalization has raised concerns that multinational firms develop commercial activities at the expense of the environment or human rights, especially in developing countries. As firms' practices are not fully observable by stakeholders, NGOs have applied pressure on firms by organizing information campaigns. This paper studies how media coverage affects how effective NGOs are in monitoring firms. We make use of large media shocks, generated by big sports events, that crowd out media coverage of firms' practices in event host and participant countries, and increase coverage of sponsors. We find NGOs to respond consistently. NGOs are more likely to disseminate critical coverage of firms sponsoring sports events, and are less likely to spotlight firms' practices in the event host and participant countries. We also find that NGOs take advantage of sports events to increase their impact on sponsors, since campaigns about sponsors trigger a significant negative reaction in the stock market.
L31|On the output and welfare effects of a non-profit firm in a mixed duopoly: A generalization|We study the output and welfare impacts of a non-profit firm in a mixed duopoly. In particular, we show that technical efficiency at the margin is crucial to determine whether the social responsibility of the non-profit firm increases or reduces welfare, assuming general demand and cost functions. This implies the paradoxical result that more social responsibility may reduce welfare. In addition, we introduce the concept of technical advantage in production and apply it to the study of a mixed duopoly considering convex-quadratic cost functions. Interestingly, a firm may have a technical advantage in production and at the same time be technically less efficient than its rival at the margin. We show that the paradox eventually occurs as the non-profit firm exhibits more social responsibility if firms have quadratic cost functions. This can happen even if the non-profit firm has a substantial technical advantage over its rival.
L31|Offshoring with endogenous NGO activism|The process of globalization is characterized by an impressive growth of global value chains, as well as the proliferation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) interacting with multinational firms. This paper presents a model of offshoring and NGO–firm interactions in which offshoring to a low-regulation country allows a monopolist to implement a “dirty” technology undesired by consumers. Consumers can reduce the incentive for dirty production by financing an NGO monitoring the firm. NGO emergence and offshoring can arise as joint and interacting outcomes. For a range of trade costs, NGO emergence allows firms to capture gains from globalization, which would otherwise be unattainable. Somewhat paradoxically, NGO emergence can be at the expense of consumers possibly leading to welfare losses through offshoring.
L31|Competition and screening with motivated health professionals|Two hospitals compete for the exclusive services of health professionals, who are privately informed about their ability and motivation. Hospitals differ in their ownership structure and in the mission they pursue. The non-profit hospital sacrifices some profits to follow its mission but becomes attractive for motivated workers. In equilibrium, when both hospitals are active, the sorting of workers to hospitals is efficient and ability-neutral. Allocative distortions are decreasing in the degree of competition and disappear when hospitals are similar. The non-profit hospital tends to provide a higher amount of care and offer lower salaries than the for-profit one.
L31|Dynamic efficiency in the English and Welsh water and sewerage industry|The English and Welsh water and sewerage industry is characterised by indivisible capital which has a long service life. Previous studies of efficiency for the English and Welsh water and sewerage industry take a static framework, assuming all inputs can be adjusted instantaneously. This paper measures dynamic efficiency by incorporating intertemporal links of capital within the production function for the English and Welsh water and sewerage industry for the period 1997–2011. Dynamic Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) considers capital as a quasi-fixed input and is modelled as a contemporaneous output into current production and an input from past production. The results show that the inadequate intertemporal allocation of quasi-fixed inputs is the largest contributor of inefficiency.
L31|Are PILOTs property taxes for nonprofits?|Nonprofit charitable organizations are exempt from most taxes, including local property taxes, but U.S. cities and towns increasingly request that nonprofits make payments in lieu of taxes (known as PILOTs). Strictly speaking, PILOTs are voluntary, though nonprofits may feel pressure to make them, particularly in high-tax communities. Evidence from Massachusetts indicates that PILOT rates, measured as ratios of payments to the value of local tax-exempt property, are higher in towns with higher property tax rates: a one percentage point higher property tax rate is associated with a 0.2 percentage point higher PILOT rate. PILOTs appear to discourage nonprofit activity: a one percentage point higher PILOT rate is associated with 0.8% lower real property ownership by local nonprofits, 0.2% lower total assets, and 0.2% lower revenues of local nonprofits. These patterns are consistent with voluntary PILOTs acting in a manner similar to low-rate, compulsory real estate taxes.
L31|The role of interpartner dissimilarities in Industry-University alliances: Insights from a comparative case study|Based on a comparative study of two alliances, this paper provides an in-depth examination of the role of interpartner dissimilarities in Industry-University (IU) alliances. We make a conceptual distinction between routine-based dissimilarities (differences in partners’ behavior) and orientation-based dissimilarities (differences in partners’ goals and expectations), illuminating their joint implications for collaborative processes and outcomes over time. Our findings reveal that interpartner dissimilarities might not be problematic at the start-up or honeymoon stage in IU alliances. In the post-formation alliance stages, however, they are likely to complicate the collaboration. Orientation-based dissimilarities might frustrate partners’ attempts to solve routine-based dissimilarities by impeding successful joint sensemaking. We conclude that different combinations of the two types of dissimilarities are likely to trigger particular coordination and cooperation patterns in IU alliances, eliciting different outcomes on both technological and relational levels.
L31|The effects of university rules on spinoff creation: The case of academia in Italy|The economics literature provides rich evidence on the convergence between the institutional factors and individual-level characteristics influencing the involvement of academia in knowledge transfer activities and spinoff creation. However, little is known about the effects of internal university regulations on academic entrepreneurship. In the last ten years, spinoff activity from academia in Italy has been intensive and most academic institutions have policies related to the regulation of academic entrepreneurship practices, known as ‘Regolamento Spinoff’. This paper investigates the impact of the set of university rules governing the creation of spinoffs, on institutional capability to generate new ventures. Based on panel-data analysis using detailed university-level data on academic spinoffs, we identify three classes of institutionally-defined rules that can motivate faculty members to establish a spinoff company. These are: general rules and procedures; rules regulating monetary incentives; rules related to the entrepreneurial risk. We find that at least some rules pertaining to each of these three classes have some effect on spinoff creation. In particular, we find that monetary incentives play a significant role in promoting academic spinoff activity, and that overly-restrictive university rules regarding contract research have a negative effect on spinoff creation.
L31|Ownership and exit behavior: evidence from the home health care market|In the US health care system a high fraction of suppliers are not-for-profit companies. Some argue that non-profits are “for-profits in disguise” and I test this proposition in a quasi-experimental way by examining the exit behavior of home health care firms after a legislative change considerably reduced reimbursed visits per patient. The change allows me to construct a cross provider measure of restriction in reimbursement and to use this measure and time-series variation due to the passage of the law in my estimates. I find that exits among for-profit firms are higher than those of not-for-profit firms, rejecting the null that these sectors responded to the legislation in similar ways. In addition, my results expand the view that “not-for-profit” firms are a form of “trapped capital.” There is little capital investment in the home health care market, so the higher exit rates of for-profit firms after the law change indicate the possible role of labor inputs in generating differences in exit behavior across sectors.
L31|Multiple Standards: the Case of the French Building Industry|The building sector is simultaneously characterized by regulation pervasiveness, by the superposition and overlapping of technical standards, and by a profusion of labels. This paper analyzes the rationale for such a multiplicity of mandatory and voluntary standards. The main consequences are the risk of confusion in the minds of buyers and the rise in prices due to the additional costs imposed by the continuous progression of requirements and the need to comply with many different standards. Both effects seriously hamper the penetration of the market by the products with the most demanding labels. The simplification of this regulatory and normative package would likely improve the economic efficiency of the sector.
L31|Merchants of Doubt: Corporate Political Influence when Expert Credibility is Uncertain|A key role of science-based non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is to communicate scientific knowledge to policymakers. However, recent evidence has emerged showing that industry-backed groups often attempt to undermine the credibility of such NGOs and weaken their ability to influence policy. To investigate the mechanisms by which a firm can profitably create doubt about scientific information, we use a signaling model of interest-group lobbying in which the policymaker has fixed costs of taking action. We explore two mechanisms for the creation of doubt. The first involves using Bayesian persuasion to imply that the NGO may be a radical extremist whose lobbying is not credible. The second involves the creation of a think tank which can offer its own testimony on scientific matters. We show the firm prefers that the think tank does not act as a credible moderate, but instead sometimes takes radical, non-credible, positions. We identify conditions under which each mechanism is preferred by the firm.
L31|Linking smallholder farmers to commercial markets: Evidence from nongovernmental organization training in Nicaragua:| Access to modern commercialization channels is key for smallholder farmers to be able to move away from subsistence farming and overcome poverty. However, achieving that goal is challenging for smallholders given their lack of appropriate managerial practices, production technology and infrastructure. This paper examines the effect of receiving training in two different entrepreneurial practices designed to link farmers to commercial markets: one direct aimed at the individual and farmer-association level and another indirect focused at the community level. We exploit an extensive panel dataset of staple bean farmers in Nicaragua who participated in a program run by a nongovernmental organization between 2007â€“2012. We find that the two market-linkage training activities had opposite effects on the commercialization of beans, especially on the intensive margin or volume of sales. While receiving direct training on entrepreneurial practices is positively associated with sales in commercial markets, training on municipality engagement (ME) activities is negatively associated. The market-linkage activities mainly affected entrant farmers as opposed to those already participating in commercial markets. We further find varying effects of the ME activities by plot size and leadership position. Additional results show that training activities that appear to work for bean producers do not necessarily work for other crop producers, and vice versa.
L31|A Commercial Gift for Charity|Commercial firms are increasingly tying the sales of their products with donations to a charitable cause. Apart from a charitable motive, offering these charity-linked bundles could be a strategic instrument for firms to increase profits. We report the results of an experiment that investigates for different of these schemes whether they are able to increase profits net of the donation, and which donation scheme is most profitable. From a theoretical perspective, given rational agents, complete markets, and absent transaction cost, selling charity-linked bundles should not be profitable even when consumers are altruistic. We find however that sellers who donate 5% of their gross revenues or an equivalent absolute amount do attain significantly higher profits. No such effect is observed when the donation is limited to 2%. Offering charity-linked bundles considerably crowds out private donations by buyers.
L31|The Establishment of Social Entrepreneurship Movements as A Response to The Transformation of Governments’ Social Policies (The Case of Four EAEU Countries)|"""Objective – This article summarizes research into the social entrepreneurship movement based on databases which include respondents from the following countries: the Kyrgyz Republic, Republic of Belarus, Republic of Kazakhstan and Russian Federation. This article tries to relate the efficiency of social policy to social issues. Methodology/Technique – We selected 180 acting social enterprises and 36 from 4 post-soviet countries and conducted interviews and observations to create a database. Based on defined key criteria, different types of social actors were classified and grouped. Findings – The findings indicate that state funding for social services and social protection has fallen dramatically due to a sharp decline in GDP and in the residual shares of GDP allocated for social policy. Our analysis indicates that countries which experienced a transformation of government social policy have a greater variety of social actors. Through the database, we were able to define and classify 8 typical groups of social actors. Two of them - social activists and social reformers - can help a nation to create a new stable system for target social groups. Novelty – Originality of the findings of this article."""
L31|Care, Commons and Entrepreneurship|Health care costs has increased significantly during the last decades, and despite rapid development in medical practices, little has been achieved compared to other sectors when it comes to cost cutting innovations. The entrepreneurship that flourish in retail, technology and logistics seems to be virtually absent from the care sector. In this pa-per we explore the state of research on health economics, collaborative (“open source”) development and on entrepreneurship and it applications to the care sector. We show that both the concept of evasive entrepreneurship and the Ostromian “commons” are useful tools when looking for solutions to mitigate escalating cost in this sector.
L31|Influence of Nongovernmental Organizations on Forming Country Image and Developing the Country Brand Using Public Diplomacy|Country image and nation branding provide a competitive advantage for small and medium-sized enterprises in their internationalization. This paper analyzes the influence of Turkish nongovernmental organizations on forming country image of Turkey and developing the country brand using public diplomacy in the African continent. The published interviews and statements of Turkish and African politicians, business people and intellectuals argue that these organizations are effectively using public diplomacy to create the country brand. This paper focuses on the most active organization, the Confederation of Businessmen and Industrialists of Turkey (TUSKON) which supports to its members in communicating with their potential customers in several occasions, and having a differentiating statement and a competitive advantage by promoting the brand image of the country. This civil society support is significant, especially for the small and medium enterprises of developing countries, when considered the weak international image and reputation of these countries.
L31|Do Pro-Poor Schools Reach Out to the Poor? Location Choice of BRAC and ROSC Schools in Bangladesh|"Non-formal schools play an increasingly important role in the delivery of educational services in poor communities, but little systematic evidence is available about their placement choices. We study location choice of ""one teacher, one classroom"" non-formal primary schools pioneered by BRAC vis-a-vis its first large scale replication under the government managed Reaching-Out-of-School (ROSC) project using school census data. Comparison is also made to another pro-poor educational institution – state recognized madrasas. We find that all three types of schools have a statistically significant presence in poor sub-districts within a district. However BRAC schools avoid pockets that lack public infrastructure and suffer from low female literacy rate while ROSC schools better target regions that have poor access to cities and roads, are less urbanized, more vulnerable to natural disasters, have fewer banks and working toilets. ROSC schools also have greater presence in regions that are under-served by government and government supported formal primary schools. On the contrary, the supply of BRAC schools and madrasas is significantly and positively linked to the presence of formal primary schools. Concerns over operational viability may explain why BRAC often leaves out remote regions where socio-economic circumstances are most likely to keep children out of school.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
L31|The support paradox in community enterprise experiments in the Netherlands| In many European countries, community-based entrepreneurship is increasingly considered as a means to initiate small-scale urban regeneration. However, residents in deprived neighbourhoods are often viewed to lack key entrepreneurial skills. Most research on community entrepreneurship support is based on cross-sectional studies and overly focussed on government support. This paper extends current knowledge by reporting a unique national experiment in the Netherlands with community enterprises receiving support from a private foundation. The paper aims to investigate how active citizens perceive the benefits and drawbacks of this support. Using a unique longitudinal approach, the paper analyses transcriptions of repeated semi-structured interviews (panel design) from community enterprises in several neighbourhoods. While positive feedback is found, the study provides strong evidence for a 'support paradox': the support that was intended to overcome a number of entry barriers and difficulties on the road to community entrepreneurship has significantly hampered progress among several community enterprises.
L31|Incentives for prosocial activities|Early studies often found that offering economic incentives for undertaking prosocial and intrinsically motivated activities can crowd out motivation to perform these activities. More recent work highlights nuanced and important features related to whether crowding out (or substitution) is likely to occur. In many cases, incentives succeed in encouraging more prosocial behavior and are also cost-effective. However, although the substitution of external incentives for intrinsic motivation may not be a concern in many contexts, the substitution of one prosocial activity for another or shifts in activities over time or location may warrant further attention.
L31|Does government spending crowd out voluntary labor and donations?|Private charitable contributions play an essential role in most economies. Despite the existence of welfare states, people contribute money and supply volunteer labor to charity. From a policy perspective, there is concern that comprehensive government spending might crowd out these private charitable donations. If perfect crowding out occurs, then every dollar spent by the government will lead to a one-for-one decrease in private spending, leaving the total level of welfare unaltered. Understanding the magnitude and causes of crowding out is crucial, as it represents a hidden cost to public spending and can thus have significant impacts on public welfare.
L31|Does social business link with the sustainable livelihoods of rural households?: Lessons from Bangladesh|The multidimensional approach in poverty research is dominating over the monetary based poverty approaches worldwide. The failure in millennium development goal in terms of reducing absolute poverty by its half lead United Nation Development Program to adopt Sustainable Development Goal. Social business is a new form of business concept put into practice firstly in Bangladesh to trigger poverty in such a multidimensional approach. Similarly, Sustainable livelihood, is a popular model of intervening poverty to the development agencies due to its design of participating people in the project policies, supports the multidimensionality too. The purpose of this study is to discuss about the conceptual explanation of social business and sustainable livelihood. Besides, this paper also portrays the conceptual linkages of social business with the sustainable livelihood framework. The present study is of qualitative in nature where extensive literature review has been conducted adopting an intensive desk research method using secondary data sources like published articles, working papers, brochures and companies official websites via internet. The study found that social business, in general, possess the feature of reducing vulnerability of people directly providing with an array of products and indirectly, with its innovative policy of making involve deprived people in the entire value chain as active participants. In addition, its integrative business approach helps in searching people’s deficiencies like knowledge, skills, affordability and taking remedial measures in the form of training, financial support, frequent surveillance and accumulation of resources. The study concluded that social business, driven by problems and pro-poor approach, could be a complementary model for superseding poverty via sustainable livelihood approach. As implication of the study, it will help policy makers to adopt or adjust their policy regarding bringing sustainability of people’s life with a new tools other than the existing state-run or philanthropy based programs. Besides, it will also broaden the interest of researchers for further empirical tests relevant to this sort of business and effectiveness of it in alleviating poverty and ensuring sustainability.
L31|Determining the context of an international development project|One of the most difficult aspects of international development project planning is determining what the context of a project is. This paper presents the Circles of Sustainability (Situated and Differentiated Project), or CoS (SDP) framework to assist development practitioners to more clearly identify and reflect on the essential socially driven context considerations of a community development project. This paper contends that the role of the NGO is often overlooked as a significant and critical project context factor. Therefore the concept of ‘the NGO Construct’ is explored as the basis for the framework presented. The final model presented is a sphere that is divided into two halves – the ‘situated context’ on one side and the ‘differentiated context’ on the other, the whole of which identifies eight major social domains that allow for the vibrancy and multifarious nature of communities to be more fully appreciated. This sphere depicts the eight domains as intricate and interrelating to one another. Rather than separate externalities, the domains are coherent analytical categories informing the larger holistic social entity. It is argued that only when the two halves of the context – the ‘situated and differentiated’ are established, can a project context be more comprehensively appraised. The model arises from utilizing RMIT Global Cities Research Institute’s original Circles of Sustainability framework as one half of the framework, as it clearly presents four local ‘situated’ context domains (Economics, Ecology, Politics and Culture). The other half of the framework consists of four ‘differentiated’ domains drawn from the NGO Construct, namely Presiding Conventions, Institutional (NGO), Project Operations and Personal (Project Staff). These four differentiated domains are further broken down and discussed to identify seven essential perspectives. By undertaking this detailed analysis of context factors, it is hoped that project planning will be more strategic and sustainable and will highlight that all the dynamics outlined in the framework occur at any one time. The model is designed to inspire debate and become a collaborative process tool for development practitioners to engage further reflection, discussion and creative project analysis. The final model is a visually stimulating heuristic representation of the array of complex, yet accessible macro and micro factors that intersect to create each unique project environment.
L31|The activities of university knowledge transfer offices: towards the third mission in Italy|Abstract Establishing deeper engagement with industry and society has recently become a key concern of universities. To pursue this goal, universities—as well as other public research organizations—have started to reorganize internal resources, to redefine their activities and policies, and to redesign their overall knowledge transfer (KT) business models. As a consequence, in several countries a wide heterogeneity exists in the types of KT models adopted and in the outcomes arising from KT activities. By performing a cluster analysis and a multinomial logit regression on an extensive dataset that almost covers the entire population of Italian universities, in this study we analyze (1) whether models of KT characterized by a broader engagement with society are gradually substituting models more focused on technology commercialization, and (2) which factors related to the availability of resources and universities’ strategic intention better explain existing differences. Insights from the study might help university managers to define the most appropriate actions to fully undertake the implementation of the university third mission.
L31|Soft Power as a Effect Instruments in Foreign Policy: Turkey's Soft Power Analysis and the Assessment of its Soft Power Capacity on Azerbaijan|"With the emergence of first political structures of the world, struggles between them gave rise to the concept of power. Since the ancient times, power has played an important role in the concept of international relations and made a significant contribution to the establishment of the discipline as an autonomous structure. The concept of power, which has always maintained its importance, has evolved in time and, for the time being, is known for its rather soft side. In this century, many academic studies that dealt with the soft side of the power have been published, however, while being mentioned in popular publications, the concept has not been favored in the academic publications in Turkey. With this dissertation that is the first study that deals with the soft power within the context of international relations, we intended to contribute to the filling of the void in the Turkish literature. For this purpose, we first discussed the concept of power and the soft power in every aspect. Afterwards, we analyzed the soft power potential of Turkey culturally, politically and within the frame of foreign affairs practices and essentially in the context of Middle East, Caucasus and Central Asia regions. As the soft power sources that may influence the national politics may vary for every country, we chose Azerbaijan as the model of this study and sought for an answer to the question, ""How Turkey can possibly/efficiently have the soft power influence over Azerbaijan?"". As the hypothesis of the study and the answer of the question, we considered the cultural link between these two countries would constitute the most important and effective soft power source. In the conclusion of the study, we interviewed a group of fifteen Azerbaijanis that consisted NGO members, journalists and academicians thus proved the hypothesis of the study."
L31|Tracing the Emergence of Broadening Marketing Proposition: A Thorny Path|The broadening marketing concept was introduced in 1969 and was initially well-received by marketing scholars. However, during the subsequent four decades, the concept has been increasingly questioned and has divided marketing scholars in to two opposing camps. This paper traces the evolution of the broadening marketing proposition and critically examines the arguments put forward against the broadening proposition.
L31|Comparing Charitable Fundraising Schemes: Evidence from a Natural Field Experiment and a Structural Model|We present evidence from a natural field experiment and structural model to shed light on the efficacy of alternative fundraising schemes. In conjunction with the Bavarian State Opera, we mailed 25,000 opera attendees a letter describing a charitable fundraising project organized by the opera house. Recipients were randomly assigned to treatments designed to explore responses to fundraising schemes varying in: the presence of a lead donor; and how individual donations would be matched using the lead donation. The structural model estimates extensive and intensive margin responses, and is then utilized to predict giving behavior in counterfactual fundraising schemes. (JEL C93, D64, L31, L82)
L31|A Pilot Profile of the Social Entrepreneur in the Constantly Changing Romanian Economy|Social economy and social entrepreneurship are concepts subject of much debate in the academic environment, as their importance is growing in the present times, when the public sector and business environment alike have demonstrated their incapacity to solve specific social problems, such as conserving local traditions and biodiversity or insertion into the labour market of people from vulnerable groups. This article focuses on social entrepreneurs, by aiming to identify their main motivations in the founding and development of a social enterprise, as well as the main challenges faced in their social entrepreneurial activity in a constantly changing business environment. The paper presents a qualitative research conducted on Romanian social entrepreneurs. The results, interpreted through content analysis, indicate that social entrepreneurs, unlike business entrepreneurs, are not profit-driven, but mission driven, their main objective being to make a difference in the society and have a positive impact in the local communities. Furthermore, the research revealed specific challenges faced by Romanian social entrepreneurs, as well as specific differences between social and business entrepreneurs, who aim strictly achieving economic performance. Considering the limitations and future research directions, the implications of the findings are discussed, the paper outlining a profile of the social entrepreneur that can be useful to the public sector for the development of policies aimed at enhancing this type of entrepreneurship, in a constantly changing social environment.
L31|The Impact of Social Information on the Voluntary Provision of Public Goods: A Replication Study|Abstract Shang and Croson (2009) found that providing information about the donation decisions of others can have a positive impact on individual donations to public radio. In this study, we attempted to replicate their results, but found no evidence that social information affected donation decisions. However, most of our donors were renewing members, a group which Shang and Croson also found was not influenced by social information.

L31|The current context of social economy in Romania|Through this study, I have intended to make a synthetized analysis of the social economy sector which, in the current economic context of Romania, has a strong influence on the public policies framework in the field of employment growth in social economy. A complex, scientific and relevant material for the issue discussed here has been used, along with a series of official statistical data in the field of social economy. The scientific approach taken has dwelt upon some conceptual distinctions which should correctly position the place and the role that the entitites may have within social economy and which will generate benefits for the entire society. The scientific approach of conceptual delimitations went on to correctly position the place and the role it may have in the social economy entities which will generate benefits for society.
L31|Spoleczna odpowiedzialnosc w relacjach miedzysektorowych/ Social Responsibility in Cross-Sector Relationships|The performance and development of an organisation depends not only on the organisation itself, but – to an increasing extent – on its relationships with its surroundings. This also refers to cross-sector relationships outside the world of business. Thus, the purpose of the article is to analyse the cross-sector collaboration between public administration and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and to highlight its fundamental terms and conditions, e.g. trust and social responsibility. The more honesty there is in such relations, the more trust and willingness to co-operate there arises in both parties. The analysed model of collaboration between public administration and NGOs seems to be a helpful tool for the development of collaboration based on social responsibility
