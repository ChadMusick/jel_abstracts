L39|Effect of organization identity and relationship quality on teacher loyalty in teacher education departments|This study explored the effects of organization identity and relationship quality on teacher loyalty in teacher education departments in Taiwan. Organization identity is an important aspect in management industries and in the education sector. The relationship quality in universities refers to teachers? engagement with their job. A high relationship quality can improve teacher loyalty. Data were collected from 120 teacher education departments and 192 university teachers in Taiwan. Structural equation modeling, confirmatory factor analysis, and path analysis were used to analyze and verify the relations among organization identity, relationship quality, and teacher loyalty. The analyses provided moderate support for the hypothesized model. The results indicated that both organization identity and relationship quality affect teacher loyalty in teacher departments. The relationship quality of departments serves as an influential mediator of the model.
L39|Technological Learning and Innovation Gestation Lags at the Frontier of Science: from CERN Procurement to Patents|This paper contributes to the literature on the impact of Big Science Centres on technological innovation. We exploit a unique dataset with information on CERN’s procurement orders to study the collaborative innovation process between CERN and its industrial partners, mostly European firms. Since 19 out of the 23 Member Countries of CERN belong to the EU, public procurement for innovation through CERN can be seen as factor contributing to European innovation policies. After a qualitative discussion of case studies, survival and count data models are estimated; the impact of CERN procurement on suppliers’ innovation is captured by the number of patent applications. The fact that firms in our sample received their first order over a long time span (1995-2008) delivers a natural partition of industrial partners into “suppliers” and “not yet suppliers”. This allows estimating the impact of CERN on the hazard to file a patent for the first time and on the number of patent applications, as well as the time needed for these effects to show up. We find that a “CERN effect” does exist: being an industrial partner of CERN is associated with an increase in the hazard to file a patent for the first time and in the number of patent applications. These effects require a significant “gestation lag” in the range of five to eight years, pointing to a relatively slow process of absorption of new ideas.

L39|Do public libraries impact local labor markets? Evidence from Appalachia|This paper investigates the effect of public library programs and participation on unemployment and labor force participation in Appalachia. Appalachia is an economically distressed area, mostly rural, and with a sustained lower level of labor force participation and a higher level of unemployment. As public library programs can be countercyclical to labor market outcomes, I use public library staff and the amount of print resources and computers available as instruments. The results show that neither adult nor children’s programs and participation affect local labor market outcomes. These results are robust across different specifications. Spatial econometric estimates corroborate the main results and provide evidence of spatial spillover effects, especially for children’s programs.

A case of distant refugees is attached to verify it.
L39|The Spirit of the Law over its Letter: The Role of Culture and Social Norms in Shielding Cooperative Banks from Systemic Shocks|The macroeconomic impact of banks� misconduct led users of financial services to be deterred from using the system to the detriment of market integrity and called upon policy makers and supervisors to turn to �culture� as a means to regain public trust and eventually guarantee the stability of the real economy. From this vantage point, the crisis showed that culture did indeed matter, as it can significantly influence the effectiveness of decision-making process and, thus, the risk appetite/profile of banks. Culture and behaviour have shown to be the main threat to financial stability policy makers and supervisors have currently to cope with. What is already clear is that culture is an important subject to focus on when supervising banks. Nevertheless, the problem is that current academic thinking lacks both clarity and expertise on what �culture� is all about and how it should be implemented by banks. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the illustrative case of cooperative banks. Extensive empirical evidence shows indeed that cooperative banks turned out to be more stable than commercial banks for several reasons related to the ownership structure and the business model. However, the extant literature lacks to take into account whether cooperative values (i.e. solidarity; mutualism; proximity; social commitment) contributed in motivating employees to do the right thing and to steer away from reckless behaviour. The investigation brings to the fore the main question of whether and how cooperative banks� values and culture played a role in ensuring the soundness and efficiency of risk-taking policies.
L39|Marco teórico y metodológico para la validación cualitativa de un modelo explicativo de las responsabilidad social en sociedades cooperativas<BR>[Theoretical and methodological framework for the qualitative validation of an explanatory model of social responsibility in cooperative societies]|En este trabajo se presenta un marco teórico y una propuesta metodológica para la validación cualitativa de un modelo explicativo de la Responsabilidad Social en las Sociedades Cooperativas. La variable central de análisis, la llamada Orientación a la Responsabilidad Social en Cooperativas (ORSCOOP), no es directamente observable, siendo necesario medirla a través de un conjunto de indicadores. Igualmente ocurre con el resto de variables estratégicas con las que la ORSCOOP está relacionada en el modelo que proponemos (satisfacción de los socios, innovación, calidad del servicio y resultado cooperativo o desempeño). Para la validación de los indicadores se recurre a una metodología cualitativa en base a la valoración y acuerdo de un grupo de profesionales expertos quienes, por aplicación de la técnica Delphi, colaborarán para lograr una definición única y consensuada. A partir de sus opiniones y recomendaciones se llevarán a cabo las modificaciones oportunas con el fin de unificar los criterios procedentes de los distintos expertos. Como resultado se obtendrá una escala consensuada para cada variable del modelo propuesto. Esta unanimidad de opiniones en el resultado final será la base para un posterior tratamiento cuantitativo del modelo conceptual propuesto.
L39|The role of rural producer organizations for agricultural service provision in fragile states| This article assesses the extent of external linkages and the provision of agricultural services by rural producer organizations in a post-conflict setting. Using new survey data collected by the International Food Policy Research Institute in three provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this study finds that various internal and external factors affect the capacity of organizations to interact with external organizations. External linkages, ability to collect financial support from their members, management capacity, and formal governance structures all contribute to explaining relative performance in agricultural service delivery. We also find that exogenous events affect the relative performance of rural producer organizations. Our results suggest that closeness to conflict reduces the capacity of producer organizations to provide agricultural services.
L39|Women?s Refuges as a Lifebuoy for Women Exposed to Domestic Violence in Turkey|From past until today, women have been exposed to many different types of poverty, deprivation, desperation and violence. The most dramatic one from all those destructive effects are the domestic violence and abuse of women. The domestic violence is a fact, which is mostly ignored and overpassed in many societies. When the lower chances of economic survival for women are also taken into account within this framework, the feeling of frustration worsens the dilemma between poverty and domestic violence for them. The solution search for this problem began in the last half of the twentieth century. Since then, the domestic violence is brought to the attention of mankind, regarded as violation of human rights and relevant legal and organizational arrangements have been made. One of these organizational arrangements is Women?s Refuges. Today, these Women?s Refuges have become an important part of the struggle strategies against domestic violence and women?s poverty. The idea of Women?s Refuge arose primarily in Europe, and then spread all over the world beginning from 1970s. In Turkey, Women?s Refuges started to serve in the 1990s. This study focuses on the existence of Women?s Refuges in Turkey as a struggle strategy against domestic violence and poverty. The concept of violence against women and the evolution of Women?s Refuges will be discussed from the beginning to the present. In this respect, the historical development process, the legal basis, organizational developments, implementations and the problems of Women?s Refuges in Turkey will be analyzed.
L39|Motivations for Corporate Social Responsibility: all talk and no walk?|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) can be defined as voluntarily going beyond what the law requires to achieve social and environmental objectives. Present work provides the profile of the firms adopting CSR strategies in Luxembourg focusing on intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for CSR. The analysis is performed using ICT 2011 data representative of the whole economy, including large, medium and small enterprises of the manufacturing and service sectors. Contingency analysis contrasted the adoption of CSR with a set of firms’ features (size, group, exports, sector of economic activity and perceived competition). The econometric analysis explores the link between firm’s features and CSR disclose. The typical firm that adopts CSR practices is a large market leader, part of an international group, with a strong international reputation and operating in the utilities sector. Looking at the reasons behind the CSR, both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations are strongly correlated with CSR. Firms choose CSR both as a tool to promote their image and as part of their corporate culture. Some policy implications conclude the research.
L39|A Hotelling model of spatial competition with local production|Local production is a central theme in sustainable development and is of increasing current interest in e.g. food and energy production. This paper extends the classical Hotelling duopoly model of spatial competition to allowing for local production at the household level. The model is applied to study the existence and efficiency of a price equilibrium in the presence of local production. The optimal solution to the corresponding planning problem minimizing the sum of the resource costs is derived. Assuming the duopolists are symmetrically located on a line, the equilibrium number of local producers (“ecological entrepreneurs”) exceeds the optimal number. However, local production implies a lower equilibrium price than the standard Hotelling model and may extend the range of the symmetric locations of the duopolists for which a price equilibrium exists.

L39|Transnationale Strategien der Gewerkschaften im europaeischen Metallsektor: Ansaetze zur Europaeisierung der Lohnpolitik (Transnational trade union strategies in the European metalworking sector: The Europeanisation of wage policy)|Dieser Artikel beschaeftigt sich mit transnationalen Gewerkschaftsstrategien im Feld der Lohnpolitik und adressiert zwei bislang in der Literatur ungeklaerte Fragen: (1) Wie kann grenzueberschreitende Kooperation zur Errichtung von Normen tariflicher Koordinierung unter wenig foerderlichen Bedingungen erklaert werden? (2) Warum verhalten sich Gewerkschaften in kleinen, exportorientierten Laendern kooperativ, obwohl Konkurrenz, das heisst eine Unterbietung der Lohnabschluesse in groesseren Laendern, die zweckrationale Strategie waere? Unter Bezugnahme auf neuere Ansaetze des soziologischen Neoinstitutionalismus wird ein theoretisch-konzeptioneller Rahmen vorgeschlagen und am Beispiel des europaeischen Metallsektors diskutiert. Die zentrale Schlussfolgerung lautet: Transnationale Gewerkschaftsstrategien in der Lohnpolitik erfordern neben beguenstigenden strukturellen und organisationsbezogenen Bedingungen, wie ein hoher Grad an Integration der Unternehmen in globale Produktions- und Wertschoepfungsketten sowie hohe gewerkschaftliche Organisationsgrade, zwei weitere Voraussetzungen: Erstens, ein Mindestmass an unterstuetzenden (trans)nationalen regulativen, normativen und/oder kulturell-kognitiven Institutionen und zweitens, sog. institutionelle entrepreneurs, die grenzueberschreitende Kooperation initiieren und dauerhaft mitzutragen bereit sind. (This article focuses on transnational trade union strategies in the field of wage policy by addressing two questions: (1) What explains cross-border cooperation aimed at the creation of common norms for the coordination of collective bargaining under the condition of international market competition? (2) Why do trade unions in small, export-dependent countries cooperate transnationally when the undercutting of wage increases in larger countries would be a more rational strategy? By drawing on newer accounts of sociological neo-institutionalism we propose a theoretical framework that is applied to the European metalworking sector. We conclude that transnational trade union strategies in wage policy require, besides favourable structural and associational conditions, such as a high degree of integration of companies in global production and value chains and high union densities, two further preconditions: First, a minimum of supportive (trans)national regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive institutions, and second, institutional entrepreneurs who initiate and maintain cross-border coordination.)

L39|Los modelos organizativos de traperos de emaús en el estado y su respuesta a la crisis<BR>[The organizational models of emaus rag pickers in the state and its response to crisis]|A pesar de su inspiración común en el movimiento impulsado por el Abbé Pierre en Francia en 1949, en la actualidad existen importantes diferencias entre los grupos de Traperos de Emaús. Este artículo pretende clasificar los diversos grupos presentes en el Estado español y analizar si sus características particulares les han llevado a plantear diferentes estrategias frente a la crisis. Para ello primero proponemos una tipología basada en el análisis de cinco variables (forma jurídica, existencia de vida en comunidad, liderazgo y participación, crecimiento, orientación de la acción) que ayuden a dibujar el modelo organizativo de los diversos grupos de Emaús en el Estado; lo que nos lleva a clasificarlos en cuatro categorías (Comunitaria, Fundación, Empresa Social, Mixta). En general, las diferencias entre estos modelos son previas a la crisis económica, pero hemos observado que también hay diferencias en las respuestas a la misma. Aunque todavía es pronto para poder establecer una tipología de respuestas a la crisis, sí podemos subrayar tentativamente algunas claves que parecen contrastar las diferencias entre los modelos propuestos. Creemos que es importante comprender estos diferentes modelos y sus estrategias de respuesta, ya que todas ellas están presentes en otras entidades o empresas sociales vinculadas a la Economía Social y al Tercer Sector, y por tanto, ayudan a comprender cuáles pueden ser las claves de futuro de este tipo de Economía Alternativa.
L39|El negocio fundacional en las sociedades cooperativas de participación pública<BR>[The foundational business in the cooperatives societies of public participation]|En este trabajo se analiza en que aspectos pueden verse alterados los elementos esenciales de consentimiento, objeto y causa del negocio fundacional de una sociedad cooperativa cuando participa como socio un ente público, así como la influencia que puede tener la naturaleza pública del socio en cada una de las clases de sociedad cooperativa previstas en la leyes de cooperativas y, cual sería la clase de socio de los concebidos legalmente más idóneo para participar los entes públicos en estas sociedades. Partimos del hecho de considerar que estas figuras organizativas son idóneas para la consecución de los fines propuestos por la acción Administrativa, dado que los valores que están en el sustrato de estas figuras jurídico privadas casan perfectamente con los objetivos de interés general perseguidos por las Administraciones públicas. No obstante, nuestro interés es concluir si fuera necesario reivindicar una categoría propia y específica para este subtipo, cuyo régimen jurídico previera las posibles peculiaridades que la naturaleza pública de uno de los socios puede plantear, a fin de garantizar de forma clara e indubitada, que la forma jurídica privada del tipo societario se corresponde con la atribución de personalidad jurídico privada que le es propia, para que ésta no pueda ser de hecho desplazada por la personalidad jurídico pública del ente administrativo que, entonces, a la postre, estaría actuando por persona jurídico privada interpuesta. Para ello nos hemos apoyado principalmente en la legislación jurídico pública que regula al ente público y la jurídico privada que regula a la sociedad, ambas convergen en estas figuras societarias de participación pública.
L39|MAPISER, the development of a social holding company. Seeking (and finding) social business opportunities|This paper presents the experience of the Work Integration Social Enterprise (WISE) named Manipulados y Servicios Picarral SL. (MAPISER). This social enterprise is focused on employment and social integration for people with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental illnesses. MAPISER has been seeking employment niches in several areas (industrial handling, cleaning graffiti and painting fa�ades, wooden packing, logistics and distribution, information and data services, etc.), becoming a social holding company whose enterprises complement each other in maintaining a balance between social objectives and the need to be economically viable. MAPISER demonstrates the benefits of maintaining a willingness to pursue business opportunities in the real market. These market opportunities suppose employment niches for the target population of the WISEs if these organizations are able to adapt the opportunities for satisfying the needs of these groups. Furthermore, collaboration and business cooperation are keys for creating and strengthening the networks serving these groups and gaining long-term viability.
L39|Diferencias territoriales en el concepto de cooperativa protegida y especialmente protegida<BR>[Regional differences in the concept of protected cooperative and specially protected cooperative]|Tras diversos estudios sobre las divergencias territoriales en materia de impacto fiscal que produce la aplicación de la legislación fiscal (ley 20/90) en las cooperativas españolas al conjugarse con una legislación sustantiva autonómica diversa, nos hemos planteado solo investigar en los requisitos para su aplicación. Estos requisitos, planteados en los artículos 6 y 13, remiten a la ley sustantiva, con importantes turbulencias y algunas diferencias importantes en la tributación, que permiten plantearse una mayor homogeneización futura en aras a una equidad legislativa. Incluso para la aplicación del régimen especial, los requisitos planteados en los artículos 8 al 12, aunque son independientes de la legislación sustantiva, son claramente obsoletos. Se analizan las enormes diferencias legislativas, cuantificando la presión fiscal de las mismas, en lo posible, y se destacan las similitudes, concordancias e incongruencias entre las diferentes legislaciones con resultados sorprendentes en algunos casos.

L39|Spatial patterns in the location decisions of US credit unions|Building on central place theory, we offer a series of simple location models for US credit unions. Credit unions are historically viewed as a community-based strategy designed to fill voids in spatial financial markets. Unlike banks and more traditional retail financial institutions, our results show that credit unions operate in areas with a low concentration of retail banks. This suggests that credit unions do not follow the “herd” mentality that dominates traditional retail banking institutions. Instead they cluster around common bonds of association. That is credit unions are fundamentally capturing a different market than traditional banks and do not behave in a pro-competitive manner with banks. In the spirit of Bitter et al. (J Geogr Syst 9:7–27, 2007 ), we compare the overall performance of geographically weighted regression with a set of both spatial and non-spatial estimators. We find that the spatial estimators generally performed better than the aspatial estimators, and there is significant spatial heterogeneity in some of the determinants of credit union concentrations. Results on individual variables of interest tend to be stable across the different estimators lending confidence to our hypothesis that credit unions serve niche markets.

L39|The non-government organizations in Slovakia and Austria and the current state of their self-financing|"In this paper we map the development of the NGO sector in Slovakia and Austria. In the context of a common historical development we assess the current state and economic strength of NGOs in both countries. Furthermore, the presented paper deals with the self-financing of non-government organizations and compares the current state and potential of self-financing in Slovakia and Austria. We focus on exploring the self-financing activities of NGOs in the context of maintaining a generally beneficial purpose for which they were founded. We draw on the comparable findings of primary research conducted in Slovakia and Austria, showing that self-financing must be understood in a broader context than a ""business"" of non-government organizations and that it can be in compliance with the general benefit as the primary purpose of organizations founded on a non-profit basis."

L39|Final Supplier Selection System in Military Critical Items|The financial plans of the Greek Ministry of Defense (MoD) for the year 2013 include a big amount of money in support of the national defense system. Nevertheless, comparing MoD’s annual budgets of the last two years, we can see that in 2013 less money than in 2012 were allocated to the MoD by the Government. This budgetary reduction could lead to the need for improvement in all phases of MoD’s function so that with limited resources, an even better result can be achieved. Supplier selection procedures could not be an exception, especially when it comes to critical supplies and services. Selecting Suppliers in military Critical Safety Items has multi-level features and many factors get involved. This paper develops a conceptual evaluation model based on Public Procurement Law in Defence (3978/2011), Analytic Hierarchy Process and Fuzzy Technique Order Performance by Similarity Ideal Solution. Multivariate Statistical Analysis (i.e. Principal Component Analysis, Factor Analysis and Cluster Analysis) and Quality tools are added to the model, while Business Intelligence/Competitive Intelligence is proposed as an additional tool to deal with the strong competitive environment of our days in a worldwide level. The use of Voronoi diagrams is also suggested as a technique that could affect criteria which are linked with the location of a potential supplier. We believe that the proposed model could end up in improving supplier selection procedures as it integrates contemporary approaches seen in the relevant academic literature with some of the particularities of the Armed Forces.
L39|New Study Group on European Cooperative Law: �Principles� Project|This paper presents both a new scientific network named �Study Group on European Cooperative Law� (SGECOL), and the �Principles of European Cooperative Law� (PECOL) project, which SGECOL has identified as its first research activity. SGECOL is a European group of cooperative law scholars, established in Trento (Italy), at the European Research Institute on Cooperative and Social Enterprises (Euricse), in November 2011. SGECOL�s general objective is to conduct comparative research on cooperative law in Europe, thus promoting increased awareness and understanding of cooperative law within the legal, academic and governmental communities at national, European and international level. SGECOL intends to achieve this objective through various research initiatives on cooperative law, beginning with the drafting of PECOL. PECOL will take the form of legal provisions accompanied by explanatory comments. They will be developed on the basis of the existing cooperative law in Europe, focusing in particular on six European jurisdictions (Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK). PECOL, however, will not simply summarize and describe the common core of European national cooperative laws. Going beyond that, the project aims to present the main general provisions through which � in the authors� view � cooperative law should be formulated to provide cooperatives with a definite and distinct legal identity vis-a-vis other business organizations. The PECOL project does not serve a single specific purpose, still less is its goal to impose harmonization on national cooperative laws. PECOL will be a scientific and scholarly work, capable of serving many potential functions, depending on the users� particular needs.
L39|Cooperative identity and the law|This paper deals with the legal identity of cooperatives. It is divided into three parts. The first part discusses the role and function of law and of comparative legal research on the topic of cooperative identity (sec. 2). The second part focuses on cooperative identity within the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) Principles and the ICA Statement on the Cooperative Identity at large (sec. 3). The third part compares the ICA Statement on cooperative identity with the legal identity that several European jurisdictions assign to cooperatives (sec. 4). Conclusions follow.

L’objectif de cet article est de tester le bien-fondé de ces normes en ana- lysant la production de l’ensemble des professeurs universitaires en sciences de gestion, sur la base des publications « influentes » dans Google Scholar. Les articles publiés dans les revues internationales ne représentent que 35 % des publications influentes et ne recueillent que 40,2 % des citations. Les livres con- servent une part très importante et l’influence des différents supports varie sensiblement selon les sous- domaines disciplinaires (finance, marketing, etc.). L’article met aussi en évidence que seules 76 publications atteignent les 100 citations et que le standing de la revue n’explique que très faiblement le nombre de citations recueillies. (VA)Standards for the evaluation of management scholars lead more and more to exclude forms of scientific production other than the articles published in international scientific journals. The aim of this paper is to test the validity of these norms by analyzing the production of all university professors in management science, based on the «influen- tial» publications in Google Scholar. The articles published in internation- al journals represent only 35 % of in- fluential publications and collect only 40.2 % of citations. Books still repre- sent a very important part and the in- fluence of the different media varies widely across sub-disciplinary fields (finance, marketing, etc.). This article also highlights that only 76 publica- tions obtain at least 100 citations and that the standing of the journal has only weak explanatory power in pre- dicting the number of citations ob- tained.

L’objectif de ce papier de recherche, qui repose sur des observations et sur un questionnaire, est de répondre précisément à cette question. Il met en évidence le fait que les cadres de santé, absorbés par les compromis quotidiens nécessaires à l’organisation des soins, ne sont que très peu impliqués dans le contrôle de gestion de leur unité.(VA)Since 2002, reforms in hospitals educate first line managers to the economic management of their care unit. These managers are they already absorbed by management control tasks or are they mainly occupied on daily organization of care?

It highlights the fact that managers of health, absorbed by the daily necessary compromises for care organization, are very little involved in the management control of their unit.

L39|L’évaluation de la performance des universitaires français en sciences de gestion avant et après la loi LRU:une lecture à partir de la théorie de l’architecture organisationnelle|L’objectif du présent article est de présenter les modalités de l’évaluation des universitaires en sciences de gestion en France. Après un rappel des caractéristiques de l’évaluation avant la mise en place des réformes en cours, une évaluation des conséquences possibles de ces dernières est conduite à la lumière de la théorie de l’architecture organisationnelle. Cette théorie fait notamment dépendre la performance des organisations de la cohérence entre allocation des décisions, systèmes d’incitation et modes d’évaluation de la performance. L’analyse effectuée suggère que les bénéfices attendus de la réforme risquent d’être compromis en raison d’une sous-estimation des coûts associés à la mise en place de la nouvelle architecture, de l’apparente ignorance des questions de complémentarité et de cohérence entre composantes de l’architecture et des phénomènes d’éviction entre motivations intrinsèques et extrinsèques.
L39|Evaluation of the performance of French academics in management sciences before and after the 2009 French university reform : a reading from the theory of organizational architecture|The aim of this paper is to present the procedures for the evaluation of academics in management sciences in France. After recalling the characteristics of the evaluation procedures before the implementation of ongoing reforms, an assessment of possible consequences of the latter is conducted in light of the theory of organizational architecture. This theory presumes a causal link between organizational performance and consistency between allocation of decision rights, incentive systems and performance evaluation. The analysis suggests that the expected benefits of reform may be compromised due to an underestimation of the costs associated with implementing the new architecture, the apparent ignorance of the issues of complementarity and coherence between components of the architecture and the possible crowding out effect between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.

L39|Hospital Scorecard – Strategic Management Instrument Of The Medical Sanitary Institutions|The basis of the paper was the syntagm “The hospital should begin to think as a lucrative enterprise not as a non-lucrative enterprise in which all the loss is covered by subsidies” It is well known that nowadays, in the sanitary institutions the new administration instruments put the financial motivation in opposition with the quality of medical services. It is really hard to find a common language to be understood by both the administrators of the sanitary institutions and the suppliers of the medical services. Therewith, having as a starting point the constructive research (literature review), we have proposed to demonstrate that Hospital Scorecard offers a more complete vision of the sanitary activity than that offered by financial situations, becoming this way both an appropriate instrument for a dialogue between health professional and administrative stuff, and an “improved” board panel which allows the placement of the quality in the centre of the strategic reflection.
L39|Business Method Patents In Europe And Their Strategic Use—Evidence From Franking Device Manufacturers| There has been a wide-spread misconception based on the imprecise wording of Art. 52 of the European Patent Convention that the protection of business methods by patents is prohibited in Europe. This article investigates the legal framework set by patent laws with respect to the patentability of business methods, contrasting the situation in lege in Europe and the situation in the US. It is shown that in praxi business methods have never been excluded from patentability in Europe. In the empirical part of the article, 1901 European patent applications relating to business methods are identified and major patent indicators are computed. Further, a case study from the franking device industry which is characterized by strong competition for intellectual property rights is conducted. It contains evidence for the strategic use of business method patents leading to opposition rates against granted patents of 44%.

Respondents to an extensive web-survey's (FLOSS-US 2003) questions about their reasons for beginning to work FLOSS are classified according to their distinct ""motivational profiles"" by hierarchical cluster analysis. Over half of them also are matched to projects of known membership sizes, revealing that although some members from each of the clusters are present in the small, medium and large ranges of the distribution of project sizes, the mixing fractions for the large and the very small project ranges are statistically different. Among developers who changed projects, there is a discernable flow from the bottom toward the very small towards to large projects, some of which is motivated by individuals seeking to improve their programming skills. It is found that the profile of early motivation, along with other individual attributes, significantly affects individual developers' selections of projects from different regions of the size range."
L39|Virtual Communities as Commons: Case Study Of “Connect”|In a world increasingly networked with the help of information technology, where face-to-face communities are more and more supported by computer-mediated communication, and some communities exist solely in virtual space, the perennial social dilemma of cooperation has resurged, intriguing social researchers’ attention with new elements brought about by technological advances, such as software applications enabling simultaneous communication of community members through public and private channels, easy access to a variety of documents, anonymous messaging, forums for potentially unlimited number of members who may join or observe, and a number of other IT-enabled community-building tools. In this paper the authors discuss the cooperation problem in virtual communities through the case-study of “Connect”, an online community of Croatian scientists. Starting point of the analysis is the observation that cooperation in virtual communities may be encouraged by implementing technological solutions that provide users with incentives to cooperate. With this in mind, the authors inspect the compliance of “Connect” to a set of design principles of robust common-pool resource institutions elaborated by Elinor Ostrom. The study demonstrates that the “Connect” satisfies the majority of Ostrom’s principles, with some room for improvement, and fails to satisfy two of them, mainly due to non-existence of technical prerequisites and due to relatively small size of the community. The analysis lays ground for further work aimed at obtaining more prescriptive guidelines that would point to possible improvements in management of common pool resources in virtual communities.

L39|Los procesos participativos en la sostenibilidad medioambiental. El caso del segmento turístico recreativo de Alta Montaña|High mountain tourism poses a dilemma for an increasing number of those concerned due to the conflict between recreational enjoyment of the area, its economic exploitation and conservation of the fragile areas that will inevitably be affected by it. This is a particularly important issue in the Pyrenees mountains. This paper looks at the impact on the environment of High Mountain Recreational Tourism Centres (CTRAM) and the concept of sustainability. We propose ways to improve the situation, describing the nature of the relationships between the different stakeholders and their differing degrees of bargaining power when taking decisions regarding the creation of sustainable value. Within this context, participation through Social Economy has a significant role, as it encourages and increases the involvement of the local population and different agents in the process.
L39|Human Rights and Human Development|This paper uses Sen's capability approach to explore whether there are inherent contradictions between human rights and development. Sen's capability and human development approach provides a conceptual framework within which human rights principles can be incorporated into development planning and action because his theory of development as capability expansion defines the ultimate purpose of development as the expansion of human freedom). The 'human rights based approach' has gained momentum as an idea and is being adopted by several international NGOs and donor agencies in their development work. Yet many development practitioners and economists remain sceptical of this approach and its implementation has been partial. To assess the spread of this approach in government policy, the paper analysed Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers for 55 countries and finds only a few substantially engages with human rights as a development objective or integrate human rights principles into development strategies. The paper reviews the theoretical critiques and concludes that the obstacles to further implementation do not lie with inherent contradictions between human rights principles and development but with gaps in practical approaches. In particular, it identifies interpretation of the principle of indivisibility as a major obstacle; the absolutist interpretation leads to positions that amount to little more than sloganeering that undermines the credibility of the approach. More work is needed to analyse norms of human rights that relate to the duty bearer to promote human rights in development in economic, social and governance policies.
L39|Financially advantageous products for nonprofit sector in the Czech Republic|In the Czech Republic (CR) there are about 60 100 nonprofit nongovernmental organisations (NPO). They present quite big amount of potential customers, making use of various services which are needed for their function. In this paper offers of various kinds of services for NPO in the Czech Republic were analysed. Special offers of banks, insurance companies, post, phone and others were looked for. Mostly all services are offered with some discount for NPO. EBanka, a. s. offers transparent account without monthly fees. Postovni sporitelna and its mother bank Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, a .s. offer account without monthly fees as well. Some companies have no special offers for NPO. Their offers are included in overture for companies and firms. They are not special financially advantageous for NPO. In case of Czech Post this can be caused by it’s monopol in the CR. On the other hand there are several telephone providers and none does offer anything special for NPO. It is possible to find some websites and internet domain providers, who offer their services with discount for NPO. They provide it without any tax allowance only for acquisition of more customers.

L39|Le privatizzazioni come mito riformista|This paper suggests that efficiency considerations do not explain why privatization policy is so appealing to the centre-left parties in Europe. Divestitures of state owned corporations in the UK and elsewhere were implemented by right wing parties with the over-arching objective to defeat trade unions. The productivity and welfare changes were modest or negligible, sometimes negative. Why reformers of the left support privatization? The paper suggests that efficiency motivations are weaker than usually said by a mostly biased privatization empirical literature and by free-market apologetics. The reason lies in nature of the privatized corporation, which is very far from a competitive enterprise. The paper conjectures that the centre-left seeks by its support to privatization to gain political rents. This implies to surrender financial rents to the globalized financial actors, to be paid out by political support or neutrality to centre-left government. This strategy is at high risk of be captured by the financial elites and poses a threat to democracy. A state without ownership, with a marginal role in service provision, becomes a tax, - and – transfer, law, - and – order state, with little democratic legitimacy. Public provision of service should be reformed as an explicit social inclusion mechanism, based on clearly stated policy goals and involvement of users. The EU should instead build on flexible tools to achieve common goals in terms of citizen’ access to those services that have a community-building content
L39|Balance y tendencias en la investigación sobre Tercer Sector no lucrativo. Especial referencia al caso español|This article provides a critical examination of the scientific literature published in Spain and internationally on the Non-Profit Third Sector. It focuses on three issues: firstly, the controversy regarding the name and conception of this social sector; secondly, the theories justifying this sector’s presence in economies; and finally, an assessment of this sector’s magnitude. The scope of the study is as follows: non-market sector (excluding all Social Economy enterprises that produce goods for the market) comprising non-profit enterprises that work with voluntary resources (volunteers and/or donations).

L39|La Comunicazione Integrata tra Uffici per le Relazioni con il Pubblico della Pubblica Amministrazione|"The hypothesis to start a collaboration between Public Relation Offices in relation to the institutional mission to create a system of integrated communication is the consequence of the existence of a ""cultural difficulty"" to enable the comprehension and acceptance of the role of the URP in their own structures and of the presence of an ""inner"" difficulty of communication. Therefore information flows become negative in relation to the needs of the customers whose satisfaction is instead the main objective of the new model of Public Administration. The definition of the proposal of a plan on a possible interaction between URP is the consequence of the reflection on art.8 item 2 letter e) of law 150/2000, ""Discipline of the activities of information and communication of Public Administration"": “Public Administration sees to the reorganization of the Public Relation Offices ... guaranteeing the mutual information between the Public Relation Offices of several Administrations"". The proposal to collaborate to the definition of the plan ""Integrated communication between URP"", is based on the following objectives: identification of joint interventions in order to optimize the actions of communication, creation of a system of permanent synergies between services, performance of communication at several levels and creation of one interactive net, creation of an active and integrated communication between Administrations and Agencies. The following set of researches refers to the activity of work group set up and management."
L39|La customer satisfaction dell’URP del CNR. I casi Lazio, Piemonte e Sicilia|Researches on the degree of customer satisfaction aimed at customers of the public communication have the objective to listen and to fully comprehend the needs expressed by the customers. They should lend constant attention to the customers’ judgment, to develop and to improve the ability to dialogue and relation between those who communicate and those who receive the service. The will of the Government to put into effect a radical process of change and modernization of the Public Administration implies that the Public Administrations promote, diffuse and develop surveying systems of the quality perceived by the customers, finalized at planning systems of distribution of the services based on the effective needs of the citizens, using at best the available resources. Evaluating customer satisfaction allows therefore the Offices Relations with the Public to get in touch with their own customers in order to understand better and better the needs to communicate of communication activities receivers and, consequently, to redesign the policies of public communication. In this framework the URP of the CNR has carried out a survey of customer satisfaction on the perceived and expected quality and on the level of gratification of their services to a sample of CNR workers with the objective to define new modalities of distribution of the services or to improve those already existing and to determine the proportions of the technical characteristics to the actual requirements of their own internal customers.
L39|Las nuevas tecnologías de la información y la comunicación en la economía social andaluza|This paper focuses on the effects of new information and communications technologies (NICT) on innovation and internationalisation in enterprises in the Social Economy. It begins by identifying strategic groups within enterprises by their functional choices of NICT. Extensive field work was carried out involving personal interviews with those responsible for 515 Andalusian enterprises. The results show that the positioning of enterprises with regard to NICT is linked to factors such as the size, location, sector of activity and time of first contact with IT. This positioning determines the commitment to innovation both now and in the future, and affects expectations for processes of internationalisation.
L39|Gobierno y papel de los cuadros directivos en las cooperativas brasileñas: Estudio comparativo|This study analyses the role played by management in Brazilian agricultural co-operatives in terms of how their objectives and their governance are focused. The analysis explores ways of running agricultural co-operatives, comparing traditional co-operatives, which focus on the economic side, and co-operative forms of financial solidarity, in which the social element is given priority. In analysing the role of management we used a number of concepts from the Theory of Agency, and a brief description is provided of the main concepts of this theory. The work concludes with an examination of the functions carried out by management, explaining that the managerial role depends on the financial or social focus of co-operative organisations, and that this focus in turn involves different functions and challenges for the managers of Brazilian co-operatives.

Finally, from a prescriptive perspective we analyse the possibilities and limitations of the different types of director control and selection.
L39|The Resilient Society: On volunteering, civil society and corporate community involvement in transition|Changes in the Dutch non-profit regime necessitate the direct participation of citizens and businesses in non-profit organisations. Dutch society must re-invent the commitment of citizens, businesses, foundations, universities and various other organisations by increasing both ‘community capacity’ and ‘management capacity’. ‘Community capacity’ and ‘management capacity’ are important building blocks in the arena of involvement. The resilient society: On volunteering, civil society and corporate community involvement in transition is an exploration of the arena of involvement with regard to research agendas: 1) corporate community involvement as a component of community capacity and 2) non-profit management as a component of ‘management capacity’. Community capacity represents the possibility of a society to make a contribution that must become more private and ‘voluntary’. The address outlines various means to this end, including corporate community involvement on the part of businesses, ‘service learning’ as an instructional tool in universities and the integration of ‘social internships’ as a component of the general high school curriculum. Management capacity represents the possibility of (non-profit) organisations to work with new forms of community capacity, for example by improving accountability and volunteer management. The address concludes by using the metaphor of a slot machine to present a new conceptualisation of volunteer management that can also be applied to other relations between non-profit organisations, civil society and corporations.
L39|Good governance in microcredit strategy for poverty reduction: focus on western Mindanao, Philippines|The study argues for the integration of good governance principles in developing financially viable, effective and social equity-laden microcredit strategy for the impoverished agrarian reform beneficiaries in Western Mindanao. It particularly examines the program design and implementation strategies of the Enterprise Development Credit (EDC) sub-component of the Western Mindanao Community Initiatives Project (WMCIP). The study aims to provide lessons and insights for the planning and implementation of comprehensive and integrated Official Development Assistance (ODA)-funded government programs for poverty reduction and rural development. The data and information were generated from combined descriptive and field studies covering a sample survey, group discussions, interviews, field visits and observations, official documents and other secondary sources. The respondents were officials and field personnel of WMCIP, line agencies, local government units (LGUs), and non-government organizations (NGOs); officers and members of cooperatives and people’s organizations (POs); religious leaders and informal moneylenders; and WMCIP beneficiaries. Overall, microcredit is applicable only to the enterprising poor. The application of microcredit to other poverty groups who actually need subsidies and social safety nets would be a mistake. Thus, the EDC sub-component should be reformulated and revitalized following the program design of the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC). Its graduated strategy for helping the poor should be applied to the poverty pyramid by categorizing the WMCIP beneficiaries into four poverty groups: (1) micro-enterprise operators or the less poor, (2) enterprising or moderately poor, (3) laboring or very poor, and (4) poorest of the poor and most vulnerable or the ultra-poor. The results further reveal that based on the poverty pyramid, the credit program designs of the Credit Assistance Program for Program Beneficiaries Development (CAP-PBD) and Quedan Rural Credit and Finance Corporation (QUEDANCOR) are readily applicable to the credit needs and financial capabilities of the enterprising poor. Beyond QUEDANCOR’s microcredit facility, the non- enterprising poor may actually opt for financial assistance from cooperatives or CAP- PBD to help finance their agriculture-and fishery-related production activities. On the other hand, the beneficiaries and their “not-so-strong” organizations that could not readily comply with the minimum credit standards should be provided with farm production subsidies, capability-building services and social safety nets under a special poverty alleviation project. This will enable them to pass minimum credit standards within a transition period of six months to one year. In view of WMCIP’s EDC sub-component, the study further identifies the factors that enable or limit successful design and implementation of microcredit program and the provision of public support services. The enabling factors are vital to planning and decision-making that will eventually make the program effective and appropriate. The limiting factors, on the other hand, facilitate the identification of strategies to manage and control credit risks and other circumstances that may hinder participation and adversely affect the attainment of objectives and desired outcomes. On the whole, the application of good governance will improve program design and will make the implementation strategies acceptable to all organized stakeholders and individual end-beneficiaries. This will also improve the administrative capabilities of partner organizations and enable them to be effective and responsive to the differentiated poverty conditions, credit needs, preferences and financial capabilities of the impoverished target beneficiaries. These are consequently geared towards the attainment of the long-term vision of sustainable human development for the impoverished WMCIP beneficiaries. The integration of good governance into microcredit intends to improve its program design, implementation strategies and processes. However, support services are actually necessary so as to simultaneously attain the desired social equity and financial viability objectives. The program should be orchestrated within a comprehensive and integrated approach to poverty reduction and rural development. The good governance of microcredit requires multiple organizational partnerships among the different government agencies, business sector and the civil society. Most importantly, the financial and technical support programs of the international donor community are absolutely necessary in the light of Philippine economic and fiscal challenges.
L39|Experimental Analysis of Neighborhood Effects on Youth|We examine the effects of moving out of high-poverty neighborhoods on the outcomes of teenage youth, a population often seen as most at risk from the adverse effects of such neighborhoods. The randomized design of the Moving To Opportunity demonstration allows us to compare groups of youth, initially similar and living in high-poverty public housing. An “experimental” group was offered vouchers valid only in a low-poverty neighborhood; a “Section 8” group was offered traditional vouchers without geographic restriction; and a control group was not offered vouchers. We study outcomes in four domains: education, risky behavior, mental health, and physical health. Females in the experimental group experienced improvements in education and mental health and were less likely to engage in risky behaviors. Females in the traditional voucher group experienced improvements in mental health. Males in both treatment groups were more likely than controls to engage in risky behaviors and to experience physical health problems. We adopt a multiple-testing framework to account for the large number of estimates considered. We show that the overall effects on females in the experimental group and the effects on mental health for females in both treatment groups were least likely to be due to sampling variation. Families with female children and families with male children moved to similar neighborhoods, suggesting that their outcomes differ not because of exposure to different types of neighborhoods but because male and female youth respond to their environments in different ways.
L39|Panorama actual de la contabilidad pública: Análisis de la situación española dentro de su entorno internacional|In the last years, international governmental accounting standards have been developed, with an especial relevance in the case of IFAC pronouncements. On the other hand, important experiences for reforming public sector accounting are in progress in different countries and entities, as in the case of the OECD, NATO and European Commission. Simultaneously, a new conceptual framework has been set up, in a parallel way to business accounting. During the first half of the nineties, many accounting innovations and reforms have been introduced in Spanish governmental accounting. However, the new international developments require a deep reform of our system, in order to adapt its principles and standards to the new micro and macroeconomic financial reporting requirements. The purposes of this paper are, on the one hand, to present the main features of international trends on governmental accounting reforms. On the other hand, it looks for an analysis of the most relevant policies for reforming the current Spanish system, considering our legal and political framework, as well as our administrative and cultural traditions.
L39|Cowards and Heroes: Group Loyalty in the American Civil War|What motivated men to risk death in the most horrific war in U. S. history when pay was low and irregular and military punishment strategies were weak? In such a situation creating group loyalty by promoting social capital is of paramount importance and in the Civil War was the cement of both armies. We find that individual and company socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, ideology, and morale were important predictors of group loyalty in the Union Army. Company characteristics were more important than ideology or morale. Soldiers in companies that were more homogeneous in ethnicity, occupation, and age were less likely to shirk.
L39|Características de los hospitales españoles|The aim of this article is to show the current situation of Spanish hospitals, as the result of research into both the public and private sector. The National Health System budget in 2002 was of over 28,000 million Euros. The bulk of the budget, over 90%, goes towards patient care and treatment, with specialised care, and specifically hospitals the main destination for funds. Hospitals constitute an important part of the tertiary sector with a series of specific characteristics, unknown to many, that make them different from the other companies in the services sector. The first, and fundamental difference of these enterprises is that their mission is illness prevention and the recovery of lost health.
L39|El Apagón en Buenos Aires 1999 Manejo de crisis en los sectores privados y públicos en la Argentina|In the City of Buenos Aires on the night to February 15, 1999, a cable fails in one of the Edesur substation tunnels, provoking a fire, which is followed by a power outage. Over 150.000 Edesur clients (approximately 600.000 individuals) in ten Buenos Aires quarters are affected in their homes, in offices, at banks, in the underground and in the street on the first day of the power outage. This would last for eleven days in Argentinean mid summer with temperatures over +30oC. What appeared to be a quickly solved technical problem soon developed into a social conflict and a political and economic crisis that would last for more than two months. This study analyses the social and political crisis that was produced in the wake of the power outage in Buenos Aires from a cognitive institutional perspective, in which decision making and communication are vital processes. Aspects such as problem framing, information processing, politicisation of crises and symbolic action are analysed within the Buenos Aires and Argentinean cultural, political and economic context. One central dimension of the analysis is the issue of privatisation of the public services; a particular feature of Argentinean political economy during the last decade. This is a case study on the Buenos Aires blackout but also a contribution to theoretical discussions on crisis management in the spheres of 'private' and 'public' of State and Market.
L39|Las redes de sociedades laborales. Un modelo de vinculación entre empresas de economía social en el marco de la cooperación empresarial|The present importance of network collaboration processes between Worker Cooperatives resides in the dual function they are called on to fulfil: A) Minimising the members’ extreme aversion to risk, - due in worker-partners to the abundance of risks, and in capitalists due to the impossibility of controlling their investment -, enabling both circulation of redundant labour among the member companies and creation of multiple separate funds for investment to finance new projects. B) Enabling the Worker Co-operative to access new market segments without losing thereby its nature as an integrating agent in its territorial aspect; that is, enabling delocalisation of business results, but not of the business activity, which remains linked to the community of origin of the workforce to which the Worker Co-operative concedes the status of majority partner.

In the first place, we show the growing economical importance of this field in Europe, based on the results obtained in the last transnational study. Secondly, we try to think about the concept of non-profit as well as about the position of co-operatives and associations within the Non-profit sector, introducing some criteria of analysis. Immediately after, we study this economical field under a “social” point of view. Finally, the paper analyses the place and content of Social Economy, both business and non-profit sectors, within the limits of European public policies.

The results are important but do not employ the most recent available data. This paper reproduces Hull and Bold's results using more contemporary 1990 data by United States county. This paper also compares 1980 and 1990 county data. Results are consistent with the earlier research. County crime rates are significantly negatively related to county church membership share. Other factors affecting county crime rates include unemployment, poverty, expenditures on police, population density, and income.

By doing so, we are able to make explicit most of the characteristics and functions that define musical societies’ activities. Finally, from the characterization of musical societies as non-assistance multiproductive unities, we offer some descriptive notes about the productive aspects of these societies.
