C23|Modelling time-varying income elasticities of health care expenditure for the OECD|Income elasticity dynamics of health expenditure is considered for the OECD and the Eurozone over the period 1995-2014. This paper studies a novel non-linear cointegration model with fixed effects, controlling for cross-section dependence and unobserved heterogeneity. Most importantly, its coefficients can vary over time and its variables can be non-stationary. The resulting asymptotic theory is fundamentally different with a faster rate of convergence to similar kernel smoothing methodologies. A fully modified kernel regression method is also proposed to reduce the asymptotic bias. Results show a steep increase in the income elasticity for the OECD and a small increase for the Eurozone.
C23|Re-examining the debt-growth nexus: A grouped fixed-effect approach|This paper uses panel data for 116 countries over the period 1995-2016 to investigate the heterogeneity of the debt-growth nexus across countries and the factors underlying it. In the first step, the grouped fixed effects (GFE) estimator proposed by Bonhomme and Manresa (2015) is used to classify countries into groups, with group membership being endogenously determined. In the second step, a multinomial logit model is used to explore the drivers of the heterogeneity detected, among them the quality of institutions, the composition of debt-funded public expenditure, the relative public and private indebtedness, and the maturity of debt. Finally, the underlying factors explaining the time-varying impact of public debt on growth in the country groups identified is also investigated.
C23|The effects of macroeconomic, fiscal and monetary policy announcements on sovereign bond spreads: an event study from the EMU|We assess the impact of announcements corresponding to different fiscal and monetary policy measures on the 10-year sovereign bond yield spreads (relative to Germany) of the 10 EMU countries during the period 01:1999 - 07:2016. Implementing pooled and country-fixed effects OLS regressions, we find that the European Commission’s (EC) releases of the excessive deficit procedure significantly affect the yield spreads. The EC releases of higher debt and better budget balance forecasts contribute to the rise and the decline of spreads, respectively. Moreover, we find that the announcements of the ECB’s key interest rates together with the longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) and the first covered bond purchase programme (CBPP1) negatively affect sovereign yield spreads in our sample of EMU countries.
C23|Sovereign Ratings and Finance Ministers’ Characteristics|This paper empirically assesses the effect of a newly-compiled set of finance ministers´ characteristics on the setting by rating agencies of the long-term sovereign rating notations. Using a sample of 26 EU countries between 1980-2012, we find that the existence of more focused delegation-oriented fiscal framework, the Minister of Finance being a woman, and the Minister of Finance having a degree in the areas of finance or “hard sciences” seems to contribute to a better sovereign rating notation, and the opposite in the case of a Law background.
C23|Measuring Gender Disparities in Unemployment Dynamics during the Recession: Evidence from Portugal|We research gender differences in unemployment incidence and persistence during the debt crisis in Portugal. A dynamic random effects probit model is estimated to control for unobserved individual heterogeneity and for the ‘initial conditions’ problem. The estimation uses data from four waves of the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (ICOR) between 2010 and 2013. We find strong evidence of persistence in unemployment, and an indication that men are more prone to endure the negative implications of previous unemployment. Simultaneously, we found evidence of higher probabilities of unemployment for women through a fixed effect that aimed to capture gender discrimination in an unstable labour market. Results suggest that policies to boost employment should accommodate a gender dimension and also have a special focus on the long-term unemployed.
C23|Taxation and Public Spending Efficiency: An International Comparison|This paper evaluates the relevance of the taxation for public spending efficiency in a sample of OECD economies in the period 2003-2017. First, we compute the data envelopment analysis (DEA) scores and the Malmquist productivity index to measure the change in total factor productivity, the change in efficiency and the change in technology. Second, we explain these newly computed public efficiency scores with tax structures using a reduced-form panel data regression specification. Looking at the period between 2007 and 2017, our main findings are as follows: inputs could be theoretically lower by approximately 32-34%; the Malmquist indices show an overall decrease in technology and in TFP. Crucial for policymaking, we find that expenditure efficiency is negatively associated with taxation, more specifically direct and indirect taxes negatively affect government efficiency performance, and the same is true for social security contributions.
C23|On the Cyclicality of Social Expenditure: New Time-Varying evidence from Developing Economies|This paper provides a novel dataset of time-varying measures of social spending cyclicality for an unbalanced panel of 45 developing economies from 1982 to 2012. More specifically, we focus on four categories of government social expenditure: health, social protection, pensions and education. We find that social spending has generally been acyclical over time in developing countries, with the exception of spending on pensions.However, sample averages high marked heterogeneity across countries with the majority showing procyclical behaviour in different social spending categories. In addition,by means of weighted least squares panel regressions with country and time effects, we find that the degree of social spending [pro]cyclicality is generally negatively associated with financial deepening, the level of economic development, trade openness, government size as well as political constraints on the executive.
C23|On Event Study Designs and Distributed-Lag Models: Equivalence, Generalization and Practical Implications|We discuss important features and pitfalls of panel-data event study designs. We derive the following main results: First, event study designs and distributed-lag models are numerically identical leading to the same parameter estimates after correct reparametrization. Second, binning of effect window endpoints allows identification of dynamic treatment effects even when no never-treated units are present. Third, classic dummy variable event study designs can be naturally generalized to models that account for multiple events of different sign and intensity of the treatment, which are particularly interesting for research in labor economics and public finance.
C23|Inter-City Spillover and Intra-City Agglomeration Effects among Local Labour Markets in China|We examine how city size affect wage levels of cities (agglomeration externality) and how it influence surrounding cities (spill-over effect) in China for the period between 1995 and 2009. Using spatial fixed-effect panel data models and allowing for endogenous and exogenous spatial dependence, we find strong positive city size effect on real wage levels, which confirms the existence of agglomeration economy within cities. We also find significant differences in both the direct and indirect effect of factors such as FDI between more and less population dense areas.
C23|Exploiting Information from Singletons in Panel Data Analysis: A GMM Approach|We propose a novel procedure, built within a Generalized Method of Moments framework, which exploits unpaired observations (singletons) to increase the efficiency of longitudinal fixed effect estimates. The approach allows increasing estimation efficiency, while properly tackling the bias due to unobserved time-invariant characteristics. We assess its properties by means of Monte Carlo simulations, and apply it to a traditional Total Factor Productivity regression, showing efficiency gains of approximately 8-9 percent.
C23|Running the Risk of an Injury in the NFL: Short-Run and Career Consequences|Similar to other workers in industrial settings NFL running backs can choose to provide additional work effort with possible negative health consequences. We find that the most informative measure for running backs is yards gained after contact, which not only increases total rushing yards but also increases injuries that can cause subsequent lost income due to future games missed. We econometrically examine the decisions running backs reveal in trading off injury risk against total yards gained and salary in the short run and how the tradeoff appears in the longer run where career length considerations come into play. Our estimates reveal subtle nonlinearities and interpersonal heterogeneity in risky effort and the associated short and long run injury risk and economic payoffs.
C23|Inference with Arbitrary Clustering|Analyses of spatial or network data are now very common. Nevertheless, statistical inference is challenging since unobserved heterogeneity can be correlated across neighboring observational units. We develop an estimator for the variance-covariance matrix (VCV) of OLS and 2SLS that allows for arbitrary dependence of the errors across observations in space or network structure and across time periods. As a proof of concept, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations in a geospatial setting based on U.S. metropolitan areas. Tests based on our estimator of the VCV asymptotically correctly reject the null hypothesis, whereas conventional inference methods, e.g., those without clusters or with clusters based on administrative units, reject the null hypothesis too often. We also provide simulations in a network setting based on the IDEAS structure of coauthorship and real-life data on scientific performance. The Monte Carlo results again show that our estimator yields inference at the correct significance level even in moderately sized samples and that it dominates other commonly used approaches to inference in networks. We provide guidance to the applied researcher with respect to (i) whether or not to include potentially correlated regressors and (ii) the choice of cluster bandwidth. Finally, we provide a companion statistical package (acreg) enabling users to adjust the OLS and 2SLS coefficient's standard errors to account for arbitrary dependence.
C23|Statistical Analysis and Evaluation of Macroeconomic Policies: A Selective Review|In this paper, we highlight some recent developments of a new route to evaluate macroeconomic policy effects, which are investigated under the framework with potential out- comes. First, this paper begins with a brief introduction of the basic model setup in modern econometric analysis of program evaluation. Secondly, primary attention goes to the focus on causal effect estimation of macroeconomic policy with single time series data together with some extensions to multiple time series data. Furthermore, we examine the connection of this new approach to traditional macroeconomic models for policy analysis and evaluation. Finally, we conclude by addressing some possible future research directions in statistics and econometrics.
C23|Testing Unconfoundedness Assumption Using Auxiliary Variables|In this paper, we propose an alternative test procedure for testing the conditional independence assumption which is an important identication condition commonly imposed in the literature of program analysis and policy evaluation. We transform the conditional independence test to a nonparametric conditional moment test using an auxiliary variable which is independent of the treatment assignment variable conditional on potential outcomes and observable covariates. The proposed test statistic is shown to have a limiting normal distribution under null hypotheses of conditional independence. Furthermore, the suggested method is shown to be valid under time series framework and thus the corresponding test statistic and its limiting distribution are also established. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to examine the finite sample performances of the proposed test statistics. Finally, the proposed test method is applied to test the conditional independence in real examples: the 401(k) participation program and return to college education.
C23|Job loss, disability insurance and health expenditures|We analyse the causal effect of job loss on disability insurance enrolment on a five-year horizon and the implications on health expenditures. Using individual level administrative panel data from Hungary, we follow individuals displaced due to a mass lay-off and compare their labour force status to non-laid-off individuals with similar employment and health history, chosen with propensity score matching. According to our estimates, being laid off increases the transition probability to disability by 50% (or 1.4% points) in four years, and half of the excess transitions occur within the first year. We find a greater than average effect among older individuals and those who were in worse health before. Outpatient, inpatient and pharmaceutical expenditure increases 3.5-4 times when a laid-off individual takes up disability benefit, and decreases slightly afterwards, but does not reach the pre-disability levels. This health expenditure pattern resembles that observed around the diagnosis of previously undetected chronic diseases, such as diabetes or hypertension, but genuine health shocks may also be present. The increase in health expenditure corresponds to 20-25% of the additional disability payments in the medium term.
C23|Spatial And Diversity Dynamics Of Producer Services: Growth Interdependences In Sweden 2007-2016|During the period 2007-2016 in Sweden we can observe how the share of business (producer) services gradually increases as an aggregate phenomenon. The service categories are partitioned into ordinary (OBS), knowledge-intensive (KIBS), and very knowledge-intensive business services (VKIBS). The growth is faster in local and regional economies that have large demand potentials. Other sectors grow faster when located in places where the business-service supply potential is larger. We outline a theoretical framework where service suppliers locate their capacity in response to the size of the service-demand potential, whereas other sectors of the economy, locate and expand in response to the service-supply potentials, for each of the three service categories OBS-services, KIBS-services and VKIBS-services. These model alternatives are assessed in a series of dynamic econometric exercises. A major assumption is that business-service firms operate in a context of monopolistic competition, which means that when the capacity to supply and deliver business services increases, then the number of service varieties also increases, and thus adds to the multiplicity of varieties in local economies (municipalities) that have a large demand potential. In the model framework the service suppliers are selling innovation-relevant information to customer firms in a region, and thereby also unintentionally spread information and knowledge among firms in the region. In this way, business-service suppliers become knowledge providers and important actors in the relevant regional innovation system.
C23|Determinants of International Consumption Risk Sharing in Developing Countries|Complete financial markets allow countries to share their consumption risks internationally, thereby creating welfare gains through lower volatility of aggregate consumption. This paper empirically looks at international consumption risk sharing and its determinants in a panel of 120 countries from 1970 to 2014. Contrary to some previous studies, I show that financial liberalization and financial integration has a significantly positive impact on international consumption risk sharing in poorer developing countries, whereas in emerging market countries only capital account openness has an impact. Moreover, there is some evidence that high income inequality or a high share of low income individuals reduces consumption smoothing in less developed countries. Lack of financial reforms, a lower degree of financial integration and higher inequality can thus partly explain why the degree of risk sharing is lower in developing countries than in advanced economies.
C23|The impact of international tax information exchange agreements on the use of tax amnesty: evidence from Norway|In this paper we develop a model for tax amnesty applications in a multi-period setting. One key insight from the model is that applying for amnesty becomes more attractive at the moment when stricter enforcement is announced, even if the implementation of the policy is in the distant future. We use our model to make sense of how international tax information exchange agreements affects voluntary disclosure of wealth and income previously hidden in tax havens. Our data is from Norway. In accordance with the dynamic amnesty model we observe a strong announcement effect of a tax information exchange agreement between Norway and Switzerland and Luxembourg, the two most important tax havens for Norwegian tax evaders. However, the effect levels off very quickly, much faster than our model predicts. We think this is because the initial announcement of the tax agreement exaggerated the risk the agreement imposed to those who had hidden taxable income and wealth in Switzerland. We also estimate and find significant effects of the press releases the Norwegian Tax Authority issues to inform taxpayers about new international tax agreements and the amnesty, or voluntary disclosure, option that exists in the Norwegian tax code.

C23|Determinants of Regional Fertility in Russia : A Dynamic Panel Data Analysis|The aim of this paper is to empirically examine the regional determinants of fertility rate in Russia using panel data for the period of 2005–2015. The estimation results of a system GMM dynamic model revealed that economic growth, employment opportunity, favorable local business conditions, educational opportunity, quality of social infrastructure, and housing supply serve to increase the fertility rate in Russian regions, while the presence of a Slavic population, migration inflow, poverty and ecological risks tend to suppress it. Furthermore, we found that combinations of factors that strongly affect the reproductive behavior of Russian women vary greatly among age groups and regions. To mitigate the declining trend of fertility in Russia, it is necessary to implement policies that take generational differences and regional heterogeneity into serious consideration.
C23|An Integrated Panel Data Approach to Modelling Economic Growth|"Empirical growth analysis has three major problems -- variable selection, parameter heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence -- which are addressed independently from each other in most studies. The purpose of this study is to propose an integrated framework that extends the conventional linear growth regression model to allow for parameter heterogeneity and cross-sectional error dependence, while simultaneously performing variable selection. We also derive the asymptotic properties of the estimator under both low and high dimensions, and furtherinvestigate the finite sample performance of the estimator through Monte Carlo simulations. We apply the framework to a dataset of 89 countries over the period from 1960 to 2014. Our results reveal some cross-country patterns not found in previous studies (e.g., ""middle income trap hypothesis"", ""natural resources curse hypothesis"", ""religion works via belief, not practice"", etc.)."
C23|Globalization and the fall of markups|This paper provides the evidence of a fall of markups of price over marginal costs in Poland over the last 15 years. Markups were calculated using a census of ﬁrms and the methodology proposed by De Loecker and Warzynski (2012). The fall of markups, by 18.6% for median and by 13.1% for weighted mean and experienced by 70% of ﬁrms, is robust to several empirical identiﬁcation strategies. Moreover, the decline of markups is not related to changes in a sectoral composition and ﬁrms demography and is most severe in exporting ﬁrms. Our empirical results relate the fall of markups to globalization and emergence of the Global Value Chains. We show that the increasing reliance on imported components in production, together with rising concentration of domestic ﬁrms on export markets are the main factors behind the observed compression of markups. We also document a hump-shaped (U-shaped) relationship between foreign value added in exports (distance from ﬁnal demand) and markups.
C23|Good Carry, Bad Carry|"We distinguish between ""good"" and ""bad"" carry trades constructed from G-10 currencies. The good trades exhibit higher Sharpe ratios and sometimes positive return skewness, in contrast to the bad trades that have both substantially lower Sharpe ratios and highly negative return skewness. Surprisingly, good trades do not involve the most typical carry currencies like the Australian dollar and Japanese yen. The distinction between good and bad carry trades significantly alters our understanding of currency carry trade returns, and invalidates, for example, explanations invoking return skewness and crash risk."
C23|Currency Factors|"We examine the ability of existing and new factor models to explain the comovements of G10- currency changes, measured using the novel concept of ""currency baskets"", representing the overall movement of a particular currency. Using a clustering technique, we find a clear two-block structure in currency comovements with the first block containing mostly the dollar currencies, and the other the European currencies. A factor model incorporating this ""clustering"" factor and two additional factors, a commodity currency factor and a ""world"" factor based on trading volumes, fits currency basket correlations much better than extant factors, such as value and carry, do. In particular, it explains on average about 60% of currency variation and generates a root mean squared error relative to sample correlations of only 0.11. The model also fits comovements in emerging market currencies well. Economically, the correlations between currency baskets underlying the factor structure are inversely related to the physical distances between countries. The factor structure is also related to the exposure of the corresponding pricing kernels with respect to the global pricing kernel and is apparent in cross-country retail sales growth data."
C23|Taming the Factor Zoo: A Test of New Factors|We propose a model-selection method to systematically evaluate the contribution to asset pricing of any new factor, above and beyond what a high-dimensional set of existing factors explains. Our methodology explicitly accounts for potential model-selection mistakes, unlike the standard approaches that assume perfect variable selection, which rarely occurs in practice and produces a bias due to the omitted variables. We apply our procedure to a set of factors recently discovered in the literature. While most of these new factors are found to be redundant relative to the existing factors, a few — such as profitability — have statistically significant explanatory power beyond the hundreds of factors proposed in the past. In addition, we show that our estimates and their significance are stable, whereas the model selected by simple LASSO is not.
C23|Two-way Fixed Effects Estimators with Heterogeneous Treatment Effects|Linear regressions with period and group fixed effects are widely used to estimate treatment effects. We show that they identify weighted sums of the average treatment effects (ATE) in each group and period, with weights that may be negative. Due to the negative weights, the linear regression estimand may for instance be negative while all the ATEs are positive. In two articles that have used those regressions, half of the weights are negative. We propose another estimator that solves this issue. In one of the articles we revisit, it is of a different sign than the linear regression estimator.
C23|Panel Data and Experimental Design|How should researchers design panel data experiments? We analytically derive the variance of panel estimators, informing power calculations in panel data settings. We generalize Frison and Pocock (1992) to fully arbitrary error structures, thereby extending McKenzie (2012) to allow for non-constant serial correlation. Using Monte Carlo simulations and real world panel data, we demonstrate that failing to account for arbitrary serial correlation ex ante yields experiments that are incorrectly powered under proper inference. By contrast, our “serial-correlation-robust” power calculations achieve correctly powered experiments in both simulated and real data. We discuss the implications of these results, and introduce a new software package to facilitate proper power calculations in practice.
C23|Local labor impact of wind energy investment: an analysis of Portuguese municipalities|Investment in wind power has grown remarkably in the past decades in Portugal. Although economic development is an argument for investment incentive policies, little evidence exists as to their net impact on local-level unemployment. Using a panel of all 278 Portuguese mainland municipalities for the years 1997-2017, we assess the existence, distribution and duration of local level labor impacts of wind power investment. Our results show there are short term effects during the construction phase. We estimate a decrease of 0.05 percentage points in the total unemployment rate for each KW per capita installed. These effects are confined to unskilled labor and male workers. Further analysis of spatial interaction finds positive spatial spillovers for municipalities that are 30km or less away but not farther, implying workers are willing to commute but not migrate. We find no evidence of sustained effects or impact during the operations and maintenance phase, despite both short and long term impacts in municipalities' revenues.
C23|Financialization, Corporate Governance and Employee Pay: A Firm Level Analysis|This study explores the link between financialization and employee wages. Using a panel of European banks from Bankscope we test whether banks use leverage strategically in order to refrain wage increases, focusing on the strategic use of banks’ capital structure as a disciplinary mechanism. The results indicate the existence of a negative and significant effect of leverage on average employee wages. In addition, considering that the effects of leverage could depend on individual bank risk, we extend our analysis to distressed banks, using the z-score as a measure to distinguish banks that are more prone to bankruptcy. We also observe that leverage is statistically significant when relating to average wages; however the impact does not differ in magnitude in comparison to non-distressed banks.
C23|Firms' Price, Cost and Activity Expectations: Evidence from Micro Data|Firms’ expectations play a central role in modern macroeconomic models, but little is known empirically about how these are formed or whether they matter for economic outcomes. Using a novel panel data set of manufacturing firms’ expectations about prices and wage rates, new orders, employment and unit costs for the United Kingdom, we document a range of stylized facts about the properties of firms’ expectations and their relationship with recent experience. There is wide dispersion of expectations across firms. Expected future price and wage growth are influenced by firm-specific factors but macroeconomic factors also matter. Expectations of employment and new orders are influenced by firm-specific measures of past orders while expected unit costs seem to be influenced more by firm-specific cost pressures and aggregate import prices. After controlling for a wide range of variables we find a significant connection between past expected price and wage increases and their out-turns. But there is also strong evidence that firms’ expectations are clearly not rational.
C23|Do sustainable energy policies matter for reducing greenhouse gas emissions?|Yes, they matter. To reply to this question, we assess the impact of energy efficiency and renewable energy policies on six different air pollutants: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (N2O), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) in the case of the Italian provinces in the decade 2005-2015. The empirical analysis is performed in a panel data context by means of propensity score matching with multiple treatment, since our framework is characterized by the presence of two treatments, corresponding to the two different energy policies analyzed, i.e. energy efficiency policy and renewable policy. These two policies can be applied by each province as mutually exclusive strategies or as joint strategies. Our results show that renewable policies are the most efficient in terms of climate goals especially when planned on a local scale, while energy efficiency policies alone are ineffective. Moreover, the success of these policies depends on the type of pollutant to be reduced. Finally, we note that the effect of these two policies was reinforced by the counter-cyclical fiscal policies implemented to contrast the Global Financial Crisis in 2008.
C23|Launch of a product and patents: evidence from the US cardiovascular pharmaceutical sector|Recent literature on the role of patents in shaping competition between incumbents and new entrants shows mixed evidence, as patents can discourage entry into markets but may also encourage potential entrants by increasing profitability from research and development. The increasing use of patents as strategic weapons motivates this investigation of the impact of innovation on competition. In a case study of US pharmaceutical cardiovascular submarkets over the period 1988-1998, we use a panel probit model to study the impact of a firm’s patents and rivals’ patents in the firm’s decision to launch new products. Our results show that the number of a firm’s lagged patents encourages the firm’s entry with new products, while rivals’ initial stock of patents discourages entry, but more recent patents promote entry by opening new technological opportunities.
C23| El sistema de Madrid y la reducción los costos de transacción. Una evaluación econométrica| Desde el año 1993 cuando se marca el fin de la GATT[1] los aspectos relacionados a la propiedad intelectual se convierten en un elemento clave en el acceso a nuevos mercados. Simultáneamente, se produce un cambio en la estrategia de negociaciones comerciales desde una de enfoque multilateral hacia una que enfatizara las negociaciones de gobierno a gobierno. Estos dos cambios condujeron a que los aspectos relacionados a los derechos de propiedad intelectual se constituyan en un elemento clave en la estrategia de acceso a mercados, en ese sentido, El llamado Sistema de Madrid (SM) es un mecanismo administrativo que reduce tanto el costo de registro de marcas así como el costo de mantenimiento del valor contractual de las mismas, y por lo tanto permite a las empresas utilizar las marcas de manera globalizada y así diferenciar sus productos (servicios) y enfrentar la competencia en los mercados con mejor chance. En ese sentido, el SM ofrece una ventana de oportunidades para las potenciales exportaciones de bienes y servicios producidas principalmente para las pequeñas y medianas empresas, en particular; en el caso peruano, el sector gastronómico es el sector que potencialmente podría beneficiarse de la adopción del SM por parte del Perú. Los resultados de nuestro estudio muestran que las solicitudes de los residentes crecen en promedio de 29% a 34% anual lo que potencialmente genera un fenómeno multiplicador de producción y empleo que puede resultar muy significativo, especialmente si está asociado con sectores intensivos en mano de obra como es el caso del sector servicios que presenta características muy atrayentes de desarrollo significativo, y donde la adopción al SM facilitaría el crecimiento de dicho sector al ampliarle el acceso a los mercados de una manera costo eficiente. EL SM cuenta actualmente con 117 miembros, siendo particularmente resaltante que el grueso de los países latinoamericanos no participe en dicho sistema, lo que pone en discusión el rol que pueden jugar los grupos de interés en la adopción de reformas institucionales reductoras de costes de transacción y, en consecuencia, profundizando el rol de los mercados.

C23| Peru's Regional Growth and Convergence in 1979-2017: An Empirical Spatial Panel Data Analysis| This paper analyzes the process of spatial convergence of growth in Peru’s 24 regions over 1979-2017. We perform an exploratory analysis of spatial data with global and local statistics, such as Moran I, to provide empirical evidence of spatial dependencies in regional per capita GDP. We then estimate the convergence equation using spatial panel models that control for spatial heterogeneity and spatial interdependence, as well as other structural economic features at the regional level. The empirical results show that spatial convergence is a very reliable conclusion over this period, and prove that spatial regional per capita GDP spillovers play an essential role in determining growth at the local level. Furthermore, the Spatial Durbin model is preferred in the formation of four clusters of convergence. The first cluster is highly productive and dynamic; the second cluster is composed by Jungle and negative-productivity regions; the third cluster is formed by moderately productive and Coast regions; and the fourth cluster is composed by stagnating and Highland regions. Finally, these results may be instrumental in giving greater focus to long-run government policies targeting stagnant and poor regions. JEL Classification-JEL: C21, C23, R11

C23|Measuring the Services of Durables and Owner Occupied Housing|This paper provides an update to the chapter on the treatment of durables in the Consumer Price Index Manual (2004). The most important durable is housing, which typically accounts for approximately 20% of total consumption services. A large fraction of total housing services consists of the services of Owner Occupied Housing (OOH). The main approaches to measuring the services of OOH are (i) the acquisitions approach; (ii) the rental equivalence approach and (iii) the user cost approach. Two other approaches are sometimes used: (iv) the opportunity cost approach and (v) the payments approach. A main purpose of this paper is to present the main approaches to the treatment of OOH and to discuss the benefits and costs of the alternative approaches. The paper also discusses the problems associated with forming imputations for the services of â€œordinaryâ€ consumer durable goods.
C23|Residential Property Price Indexes: Spatial Coordinates versus Neighbourhood Dummy Variables|The paper addresses the following question: can satisfactory residential property price indexes be constructed using hedonic regression techniques where location effects are modeled using local neighbourhood dummy variables or is it necessary to use spatial coordinates to model location effects. Hill and Scholz (2018) addressed this question and found, using their hedonic regression model, that it was not necessary to use spatial coordinates to obtain satisfactory property price indexes for Sydney. However, their hedonic regression model did not estimate separate land and structure price indexes for residential properties. In order to construct national balance sheet estimates, it is necessary to have separate land and structure price indexes. The present paper addresses the Hill and Scholz question in the context of providing satisfactory residential land price indexes. The spatial coordinate model used in the present paper is a modification of Colwellâ€™s (1998) spatial interpolation method. The modification can be viewed as a general nonparametric method for estimating a function of two variables.

C23|Re-examining the debt-growth nexus: A grouped fixed-effect approach|This paper uses panel data for 116 countries over the period 1995-2016 to investigate the heterogeneity of the debt-growth nexus across countries and the factors underlying it. In the first step, the grouped fixed effects (GFE) estimator proposed by Bonhomme and Manresa (2015) is used to classify countries into groups, with group membership being endogenously determined. In the second step, a multinomial logit model is used to explore the drivers of the heterogeneity detected, among them the quality of institutions, the composition of debt-funded public expenditure, the relative public and private indebtedness, and the maturity of debt. Finally, the underlying factors explaining the time-varying impact of public debt on growth in the country groups identified is also investigated.
C23|Nonparametric Estimation of Marginal Effects in Regression-spline Random Effects Models|We consider a B-spline regression approach towards nonparametric modelling of a random effects (error component) model. We focus our attention on the estimation of marginal effects (derivatives) and their asymptotic properties. Theoretical underpinnings are provided, finite-sample performance is evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation, and an application that examines the contribution of different types of public infrastructure on private production is investigated using panel data comprising the 48 contiguous states in the US over the period 1970-1986.
C23|Simple Methods for Consistent Estimation of Dynamic Panel Data Sample Selection Models|We analyse the properties of generalised method of moments-instrumental variables (GMM-IV) estimators of AR(1) dynamic panel data sample selection models. We show the consistency of the first-differenced GMM-IV estimator uncorrected for sample selection of Arellano and Bond (1991) (a property also shared by the Anderson and Hsiao,1982, proposal). Alternatively, the system GMM-IV estimator (Arellano and Bover, 1995, and Blundell and Bond, 1998) shows a moderate bias. We perform a Monte Carlo study to evaluate the finite sample properties of the proposed estimators. Our results confirm the absence of bias of the Arellano and Bond estimator under a variety of circumstances, as well as the small bias of the system estimator, mostly due to the correlation between the individual heterogeneity components in both the outcome and selection equations. However, we must not discard the system estimator because, in small samples, its performance is similar to or even better than that of the Arellano-Bond. These results hold in dynamic models with exogenous, predetermined or endogenous covariates. They are especially relevant for practitioners using unbalanced panels when either there is selection of unknown form or when selection is difficult to model.
C23|Intergenerational Precautionary Saving in Europe|This paper examines the interaction between altruism towards offspring and precautionary savings. It investigates whether increased uncertainty in children labor income fosters savings of parents. We first construct a two-periods and two-generations model, to underline which are the mechanisms behind the intergenerational precautionary motive for savings. Second, we exploit two micro datasets to test the main theoretical implications. Parents’ consumption turns out to respond to the offspring’s income risk. This result is robust to the presence of family fixed effects and to many alternative empirical specifications.
C23|Autonomy of profit rate distribution and its dynamics from firm size measures: A statistical equilibrium approach|This paper presents an empirical analysis of the distributional and dynamic properties of firm profit rates, measured by returns on assets, using panel data on 1095 long-lived Japanese (non-financial) listed firms over the 1971-2012 period. In particular, this paper tests the validity of statistical equilibrium approach of Alfarano et al. (2012), by investigating whether the two representative firm size measures of total assets and total sales are the significant determinants of key parameters ruling over the distributional outcome and stochastic motion of firm profit rates: a system-wide aver- age rate of profit, a system-wide dispersion measure of profit rates, and an idiosyncratic noise factor reecting individual firm characteristics. Employing information-theoretic model selection approach and standard panel data econometric techniques which control for both unobserved individual firm heterogeneity and time effects, this paper finds: (i) under the various levels of aggregation using the two size measures as firm classification instruments, the empirical density of profit rates is well described by the Laplace distribution; (ii) the key parameters characterizing the profit rate distribution and its dynamics are independent of the movements in firm size measures. These findings confirm the fundamental predictions from statistical equilibrium approach and the finding (ii) implies that firm competition is an autonomous system, immune to the size of individual firms.
C23|Equilibrium real exchange rate estimates across time and space|Equilibrium real exchange rate and corresponding misalignment estimates differ tremendously depending on the panel estimation method used to derive them. Essentially, these methods differ in their treatment of the time-series (time) and the cross-section (space) variation in the panel. The study shows that conventional panel estimation methods (pooled OLS, fixed, random, and between effects) can be interpreted as restricted versions of a correlated random effects (CRE) model. It formally derives the distortion that arises if these restrictions are violated and uses two empirical applications from the literature to show that the distortion is generally very large. This suggests the use of the CRE model for the panel estimation of equilibrium real exchange rates and misalignments.
C23|“Re-examining the debt-growth nexus: A grouped fixed-effect approach”|This paper uses panel data for 116 countries over the period 1995-2016 to investigate the heterogeneity of the debt-growth nexus across countries and the factors underlying it. In the first step, the grouped fixed effects (GFE) estimator proposed by Bonhomme and Manresa (2015) is used to classify countries into groups, with group membership being endogenously determined. In the second step, a multinomial logit model is used to explore the drivers of the heterogeneity detected, among them the quality of institutions, the composition of debt-funded public expenditure, the relative public and private indebtedness, and the maturity of debt. Finally, the underlying factors explaining the time-varying impact of public debt on growth in the country groups identified is also investigated.
C23|Immigration and unemployment in Europe: does the core-periphery dualism matter?|In this paper, we assess the impact of immigration and unemployment for a sample of 15 EU countries between 1997 and 2016. We test for the existence of a core-periphery dualism based on differences in macroeconomic fundamentals and labour market characteristics. We use a Panel Error Correction Model to assess the direction and persistence of the impact of immigration on domestic unemployment in the short and in the long run. In the long run, immigration is found to reduce unemployment in all peripheral-countries. In core countries, we find no long-run impact of immigration on unemployment due to substantial heterogeneity. As for short-run dynamics, we find a confirmation of the result that immigration reduces unemployment for the whole sample. Based on differences in employment protection and activity rates, larger impacts are found for Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon countries, while lower and less significant impacts are found for Italy, Greece and Portugal.
C23|The Effect of Unemployment on the Smoking Behavior of Couples|Although unemployment likely entails various externalities, research examining its spillover effects on spouses is scarce. This is the ﬁrst paper to estimate effects of unemployment on the smoking behavior of both spouses. Using German Socio-Economic Panel data, we combine matching and difference-in-differences estimation, employing the post-double-selection method for control-variable selection via Lasso regressions. One spouse’s unemployment increases both spouses’ smoking probability and intensity. Smoking relapses and decreased smoking cessation drive the effects. Effects are stronger if the partner already smokes and if the male partner becomes unemployed. Of several mechanisms discussed, we identify smoking to cope with stress as relevant.
C23|Bootstrap Methods for Inference in the Parks Model|The Parks (1967) estimator is a workhorse for panel data and seemingly unrelated regression equation systems because it allows the incorporation of serial correlation together with heteroskedasticity and cross-sectional correlation. It is efficient both asymptotically and in small samples. Kmenta and Gilbert (1970) and more recently Beck and Katz (1995) note that estimated standard errors are biased downward, often severely. Instead of fixing the Parks standard errors, Beck and Katz abandon the efficient estimator in favor of a Prais-Winston estimator together with “panel corrected standard errors” (PCSE), a procedure that only partially reduces the standard error bias. In this paper we develop both parametric and nonparametric bootstrap approaches to inference that avoid the need to use biased standard errors. We then illustrate the effectiveness of our procedures using Monte Carlo experiments that show that the bootstrap gives rejection probabilities close to the nominal level chosen by the researcher.
C23|Persistent zeros: The extensive margin of trade|The extensive margin of bilateral trade exhibits a high level of persistence that cannot be explained by geography or trade policy. We combine a heterogeneous firms model of international trade with bounded productivity with features from the firm dynamics literature to derive expressions for an exporting country's participation in a specific destination market in a given period. The model framework asks for a dynamic binary choice estimator with two or three sets of high-dimensional fixed effects. To mitigate the incidental parameter problem associated with nonlinear fixed effects models, we characterize and implement suitable bias corrections. Extensive simulation experiments confirm the desirable statistical properties of the bias-corrected estimators. Empirically, taking two sources of persistence - true state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity - into account using a dynamic specification, along with appropriate fixed effects and bias corrections, changes the estimated effects considerably: out of the most commonly studied potential determinants (joint WTO membership, common regional trade agreement, and shared currency), only sharing a common currency retains a significant effect on whether two countries trade with each other at all in our preferred estimation.
C23|Rent control and rental prices: High expectations, high effectiveness?|This paper evaluates the rent control policy implemented in Germany in 2015. Like many countries around the world, German cities and metropolitan areas have experienced a strong increase in rental prices during the last decade. In response, the politicians aimed to dampen the rise in rental prices by limiting the landlords' freedom to increase rents for new contracts. To that end, the rent control was introduced. To evaluate the effectiveness of the rent control with respect to rental prices, we take advantage of its restricted scope of application. First, it is applied only in a selected number of municipalities, thereby generating regional variation. Second, the condition of rental objects generates an additional dimension of variation since new and modernised objects are exempt from rent control. Based on data for rental offers in Germany, we apply a triple-differences framework with region-specific time trends as well as flat type-specific ones. Despite the high political expectations, our estimates indicate that the German rent control dampens rental price growth by only 2.5 %. This effect varies across object characteristics and seems to be larger for lower-quality, smaller-sized dwellings and in the lower price segment. Nevertheless, the application of an event-study indicates that these effects are not persistent over time.

C23|Revisiting Intangible Capital and Labour Productivity Growth, 2000-2015: Accounting for the Crisis and Economic Recovery in the EU|This paper aims to revisit the relationship between intangible capital and labour productivity growth using the largest, up-to-date macro database (2000-2015) available to corroborate the econometric findings of earlier work and to generate novel econometric evidence by accounting for times of crisis (2008-2013) and economic recovery (2014-2015). To achieve these aims, this paper employs a cross-country growth accounting econometric estimation approach using the largest, up-to-date database available encompassing 16 EU countries over the time-period 2000- 2015. The paper accounts for times of crisis (2008-2013) and of economic recovery (2014-2015). It separately estimates the contribution of three distinct dimensions of intangible capital: i) computerized information, ii) innovative property and iii) economic competencies. First, when accounting for intangibles, the paper finds that these have become the dominant source of labour productivity growth in the EU, explaining 56 percent of growth. Second, when accounting for times of crisis (2008-2013), in contrast to tangible capital, the paper detects a solid positive relationship between intangibles and labour productivity growth. Third, when accounting for the economic recovery (2014-2015), the paper finds a highly significant and remarkably strong relationship between intangible capital and labour productivity growth. This paper corroborates the importance of intangibles for labour productivity growth and thereby underlines the necessity to incorporate intangibles into today's national accounting frameworks in order to correctly depict the levels of capital investment being made in European economies. These levels are significantly higher than is currently reflected in official statistics.
C23|Testing the binomial fixed effects logit model; with an application to female labor supply|Regression models for proportions are frequently encountered in applied work. The conditional expectation function is bounded between 0 and 1 and therefore must be non-linear, requiring nonstandard panel data extensions. One possible approach is the binomial panel logit model with fixed effects (Machado, 2004). We propose a new and simple implementation of the conditional maximum likelihood estimator for standard software. We investigate the properties of the estimator under misspecification and derive a new test for overdispersion. Estimator and test are applied in a study of contracted working volumes, measured as proportion of full-time work, for women in Switzerland.
C23|Do sustainability policies finance local economies?|We evaluate whether adopting a well-known transition management instrument in the tourism industry can support a combined goal of sustainability and economic growth. We create a detailed dataset at the municipality level and use a recently developed policy evaluation technique to investigate the causal impact of the Blue Flag program on the local economies of coastal destinations. Estimates show that this eco-label is not effective at enhancing the local economy; findings are homogeneous across destinations. This empirical result is in line with the recent theoretical literature arguing that the transition towards growing a sustainable economy is particularly complex and a single policy does not suffice.
C23|The growth effect of trade openness on African countries: evidence from using an Instrumental Variable Panel Smooth Transition Model|This paper assesses the relationship between trade openness and economic growth in Africa by accounting for the heterogeneity of African countries. In addition, the paper contributes to the literature of trade openness and economic growth nexus by applying the instrumental variable panel smooth transition regression (IVPSTR), a methodology that accounts for nonlinearity and endogeneity in the relationship between the two variables. The results of the empirical analysis reveal that the level of investment is a channel through which trade openness affects economic growth in the African continent. In addition, the relationship between trade openness and economic growth varies according to the degree of a country’s development in Africa. For low-income countries, the study finds no significant relationship between openness and growth. Conversely, for middle and upper-income countries, the coefficients of trade indicators are positive and statistically significant. The results indicate that African countries are not homogenous, especially with regard to trade openness and economic growth nexus.
C23|Complémentarité Banque islamique du Sénégal/institutions de microfinance : un modèle de financement inclusif et durable des PME sénégalaises<BR>[Complementarity Islamic Bank of Senegal/microfinance institutions: an inclusive and sustainable financing model for Senegalese SMEs]|The purpose of this article is to analyze the complementary relationship between the Islamic Bank of Senegal (BIS) and microfinance institutions (MFIs) and their contributions to the inclusive and sustainable financing of Senegalese SMEs. Indeed, in Senegal, the SMEs that make up almost the entire productive sector, 99.8% of the economic fabric, 3450.3 billion FCFA of turnover and more than 45% of the active population in 2016 (ANSD / RGE, 2016), have great difficulty in obtaining external and formal financing. The Senegalese financial system, which is predominantly dominated by banks and MFIs, gives SMEs a very limited chance to access financing. This is because the financing needs of SMEs are too important for MFIs but too low for banks to respond optimally to their needs. In addition, the banking sector, which has sufficient liquidity, is struggling to obtain financing mechanisms that are appropriate to the needs of SMEs. On the side of MFIs that have the appropriate financing tools, they are unable to find significant resources to meet the demand for funding of large SMEs. In this momentum, the complementarity between Islamic banking and MFIs seems to be the most appropriate and effective solution to address the financial difficulties of SMEs. Indeed, the research hypothesis of this article is that the refinancing partnership between these two financial structures favorably affects the financing of SMEs. Our panel data estimates confirm our main research hypothesis because they show positively and decisively the role of the complementarity relationship between these two financial institutions on the financing of SMEs.
C23|Partial effects estimation for fixed-effects logit panel data models|We develop a multiple-step procedure for the estimation of point and average partial effects in fxed-effects logit panel data models that admit suffcient statistics for the incidental parameters. In these models, estimates of the individual effects are not directly available and have to be recovered by means of an additional step. We also derive a standard error formulation for the average partial effects. We study the finite-sample properties of the proposed estimator by simulation and provide an application based on unionised workers.
C23|Microeconometric Dynamic Panel Data Methods: Model Specification and Selection Issues|A motivated strategy is presented to find step by step an adequate model specification and a matching set of instrumental variables by applying the programming tools provided by the Stata package Xtabond2. The aim is to implement generalized method of moment techniques such that useful and reasonably accurate inferences are extracted from an observational panel data set on a single microeconometric structural presumably dynamic behavioral relationship. In the suggested specification search three comprehensive heavily interconnected goals are pursued, namely: (i) to include all the relevant appropriately transformed possibly lagged regressors, as well as any interactions between these if it is required to relax the otherwise very strict homogeneity restrictions on the dynamic impacts of the explanatories in standard linear panel data models; (ii) to correctly classify all regressors as either endogenous, predetermined or exogenous, as well as being either effect-stationary or effect-nonstationary, implying which internal variables could represent valid and relatively strong instruments; (iii) to enhance the accuracy of inference in finite samples by omitting irrelevant regressors and by profitably reducing the space spanned by the full set of available internal instruments. For the various tests which trigger the decisions to be made in the sequential selection process the relevant considerations are spelled out to interpret the magnitude of p-values. Also the complexities to establish and interpret the ultimately established dynamic impacts are explained. Finally the developed strategy is applied to a classic data set and is shown to yield new insights.
C23|Is Tourism a Sustainable Haven for Economic Growth in North African Countries? An Evidence From Panel Analysis|Efforts have been made by scholars to analyse the ability of tourism to promote sustainable development. This study therefore adds its voice to the already existing studies by evaluating the relationship between economic growth (GDP) and tourism receipts in North African countries between the years 1995-2016. For robustness, the study includes merchandise exports, inflation and dummy variable which captures the Arab spring of 2011. The study adopts the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimate to anlayse this relationship. It shows that tourism has the capacity to drive economic growth both in the short run with a coefficient of (6%) and in the long run with a coefficient of (29%), hence, the study joins the tourism led growth school of thought.
C23|Convergence or divergence in finance journal ranking?|In this paper, we apply the Phillips and Sul (2007; 2009) methodology to investigate the convergence pattern of finance journals across thirteen established academic journal lists. The results reveal that the majority of sample journals do converge across the academic lists. The estimated transition paths confirm the empirical analysis, revealing a “focal” point for the research institutions to minimize the discrepancies appeared by the journal lists proliferation.
C23|Inference in Differences-in-Differences: How Much Should We Trust in Independent Clusters?|We analyze the conditions in which ignoring spatial correlation is problematic for inference in differences-in-differences (DID) models. Assuming that the spatial correlation structure follows a linear factor model, we show that inference ignoring such correlation remains reliable when either (i) the second moment of the difference between the pre- and post-treatment averages of common factors is low, or (ii) the distribution of factor loadings has the same expected values for treated and control groups, and do not exhibit significant spatial correlation. We present simulations with real datasets that corroborate these conclusions. Our results provide important guidelines on how to minimize inference problems due to spatial correlation in DID applications.
C23|Ethnic Diversity and Inequality in sub-Saharan Africa: Do Institutions Reduce the Noise?|Studies on the causes of income differences between the rich and the poor have received an extensive attention in the inequality empirics. While ethnic diversity hasalso been identified as one of the fundamental causes of income inequality, the role of institutions as a mediating factor in the ethnicity-inequality nexus has not received the scholarly attention it deserves. To this end, this study complements the existing literature by investigating the extent to which institutional framework corrects the noisy influence originating from the nexus between â€œethnic diversityâ€ and inequality in 26 sub-Saharan African countries for the period 1996-2015. The empirical evidence is based on pooled OLS, fixed effects and system GMM estimators. The main findings reveal that the mediating influences of institutional settingsaredefective, thus making it extremely difficult to modulatethe noisy impacts of ethno-linguistic and religious heterogeneity on inequality. In addition, the negative influencesorchestrated by ethnolinguistic and religious diversities on inequality fail toattenuate the impact of income disparityeven when interacted with institutions. On the policy front, institutional reforms tailored toward economic, political and institutional governances should be targeted.
C23|Determinants of global capital volatility in the BRICS grouping|This paper assesses the determinants of capital flow volatility in the BRICS economies by differentiating between foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio capital flow volatilities. Moreover, the paper distinguishes between external variables, policy variables and control variables among the important drivers of capital flow volatiltiy in these economies. Use is made of the general method of moment (GMM) estimation in panel regression for this end. The findings of the empirical analysis show, among other things, the importance of global volatility spillover in driving capital flow volatility in the BRICS countries.
C23|Productive Performance and Technology Gaps using a Bayesian Metafrontier Production Function: A cross-country comparison|Growth theory argues on the role of heterogeneity that can lead to multiple regimes examining countries’ performance. A meta-production stochastic function under a Bayesian perspective has been developed to estimate technical efficiencies across countries over a time period. The metafrontier model is used to highlight heterogeneity among cluster of countries revealing catch up phenomena. The estimation procedure relies on the solution of an optimization problem and on the concept of the upper orthant order of two multinormal random variables. The proposed models are applied in a real dataset consisting of 109 countries for a 20-year period from 1995-2014. The productive performance differential and the associated technology gaps were investigated using two distinct frontiers (OECD vs non-OECD countries). Empirical results reveal that heterogeneity indeed plays a significant and distinctive role in determining technological gaps.
C23|Do institutions and good governance affect inward FDI? Empirical evidence from emerging countries|This study seeks to strengthen the existing literature by investigating the relationship between governance indicators and FDI inflows for the emerging countries (ECs) using a dynamic panel gravity model approach over the period 1996~2014. The empirical results reveal that among the six indicators of good governance, political stability, government effectiveness and regulatory quality are found to be robust determinants for FDI attractiveness in Emerging countries. The remaining three indicators, i.e. voice and accountability, rule of law, and control of corruption are found significantly and negatively associated with FDI inflows. The empirical results show also that larger per capita GDP difference between the investing partner and host country, high level of trade openness, low level of inflation rate, and better infrastructure are crucial factors to speed-up FDI inflows in ECs. However, this study provides strong evidence that ECs depict a large gap with regard to the quality of institutions and other macroeconomic factors and thereby their ability to attract FDI. To conclude, policymakers are required to improve the quality of institutions and business climate in order to attract more FDI in these countries.
C23|The human capital-economic growth nexus in SSA countries: What can strengthen the relationship?|The World Bank has recently placed increasing emphasis on the role of human capital development in facilitating economic development in the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) region. Our study examines the impact of human capital on economic growth for a selected sample of 9 SSA countries between 1980 and 2016 using a panel econometric approach. Interestingly enough, our empirical analysis shows an insignificant effect of human capital on economic growth for our selected sample. These findings remain unchanged even after adding interactive terms to human capital which are representative of government spending as well as foreign direct investment. Nevertheless, we establish a positive and significant effect of the interactive term between urbanization and human capital on economic growth, a result which emphasizes the importance of developing urbanized, ‘smart’, technologically-driven cities within the SSA region as a platform towards strengthening the impact of human capital- economic growth relationship.
C23|The influence of misperceptions about social norms on substance use among school‐aged adolescents|Individuals often have biased perceptions about their peers' behavior. We use an economic equilibrium analysis to study the role social norms play in substance use decisions. Using a nationally representative dataset, we estimate the effect of misperception about friends' alcohol, smoking, and marijuana use on consumption of these substances by youths in grades 7–12. Overestimation of friend's substance use significantly increases adolescent's own use approximately 1 year later, and the estimated effect is robust across specifications including individual‐level fixed effects regression. The effect size is bigger for boys than for girls. The estimates for those who initially underestimated the norm suggest the possibility of a rebound/boomerang effect.
C23|The dynamic causality between ESG and economic growth: Evidence from panel causality analysis|The relationship between Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance and economic growth is a controversial topic in economic literature. This paper applies the Granger causality test developed by Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) with an optimal lag length selection technique proposed by Han et al. (2017) to examine the causality relationship between ESG performance and economic growth for a set of 118 countries over the period 1999-2015. The empirical results show the presence of a bidirectional relationship between environmental and social performance and economic growth, while a unidirectional relationship from governance to growth for all countries. Unlike the clear overall pattern of the full sample results, the empirical evidence for different income groups of countries is mixed.
C23|El Efecto de la Mediterraneidad sobre el Flujo Comercial Internacional: Evidencia Empírica Internacional y para América del Sur (1990-2016)<BR>[The Effect of Landlocked Country Status on International Trade Flow: International and South America Empirical Evidence (1990-2016)]|El objetivo del presente documento es analizar la relación entre la condición de país sin litoral y el flujo comercial internacional, considerando la importancia de la calidad institucional, la política comercial, la calidad de infraestructura y la calidad logística. Para tal propósito estimamos dos modelos estructurales de gravedad de comercio mediante el método de estimación denominado “Poisson Pseudo Maximun Likelihood”. Uno de nuestros modelos es estimado usando una muestra de datos de panel de más 130 países que son exportadores e importadores durante el periodo 1996-2016. El segundo modelo es estimado usando una muestra de 10 países importadores de América del Sur y más de 130 países exportadores durante el periodo 1996-2016. Los resultados del primer modelo sugieren que los países sin litoral por el lado exportar tienden, en promedio, a tener entre 24.91% y 33.29% menor flujo comercial en comparación a los países costeros. Asimismo, los resultados de este modelo con datos internacionales sugieren que el flujo comercial de los países sin litoral por el lado importador es 24.17% a 32.96% menor en comparación al flujo comercial de los países costeros. Los resultados del segundo modelo sugieren que el nivel de importaciones de los países de América del Sur sin litoral, Bolivia y Paraguay, es 19.93% a 28.11% menor en comparación al resto de países de América del Sur que tienen costa. También, los resultados de este segundo modelo sugieren que las importaciones de los países de América del Sur son 25.54% y 36.14% menores cuando los países que exportan no tienen litoral en comparación a los países exportadores que tienen costa. Por último, en ambos modelos hemos encontrado que los efectos de la condición de país sin litoral tanto por el lado exportador como por el lado importador disminuyen cuando se consideran la calidad institucional, la política comercial, la calidad de infraestructura y la calidad logística.
C23|Fostering innovation in South Asia: Evidence from FMOLS and Causality analysis|Innovation is at the core of fourth industrial revolution which is already under way. Both Sustainable growth and development depend on technological innovation. Traditional economic models/theories are now undermined because of new technologies like AI, automation,3D printing, robotics etc. Lack of innovation creates major socio-economic problems such as inequality, unemployment, poverty and many more. Therefore, in this competitive world, a country needs innovative people with innovative ideas to go forward. The aim of this study is to explain and critically examine the determinants of technological innovation across 5 South Asian countries using yearly data for 1980-2015 period. This paper employs several econometric techniques such as Cross sectional dependence to see if shocks that occur in one country affect another, Panel unit root test to check the stationary of the data and Panel Cointegration test to check long run relationship among the variables. This study also applies Fully Modified OLS to estimate long run coefficients and Dumitrescu and Hurlin panel causality test (2012) to see the causality between the variables. The findings suggest that democracy and human capital are negatively related to innovation, contrary to popular belief. The analysis also reveals that trade openness positively and significantly affects innovation and there exists a nonlinear, in particular an inverted U shaped relationship between innovation and financial development in South Asia. Findings from the Causality test reveals that there is bidirectional causality between total patent application and trade openness and also between financial development and human capital. This study, therefore, has several policy implications for South Asian countries.

C23|The Relationship between Economic Uncertainty and Corporate Tax Rates|This paper investigates the relationship between economic uncertainty and corporate tax rates in the panel dataset of 126 countries over the period 2003–2018. We use the new index so-called the “World Uncertainty Index” to measure the level of economic uncertainty. We utilise various estimation techniques and find that a one-way causality that runs from economic uncertainty to corporate tax rates. Specifically, a rise in economic uncertainty leads to higher corporate tax rates. We also discuss potential implications.
C23|Giant Oil Discoveries and Conflicts|This study investigates the impact of oil discoveries on conflict. We argue that rents from resources are only part of the resource curse story, with discoveries of natural resources being just as prominent. Using a new measure for oil discoveries for a global panel of countries between 1960 and 2012, we find a positive correlation between oil discoveries and conflict, controlling for regional effects and other conflict determinants. Further analysis by type of conflict reveals that the discovery of oil deposits increases intrastate conflict in relation to interstate conflict, more so ethnic violence within countries. These effects are evident within a year of discovering the oil, and are persistent for over ten years after the discovery. The results also indicate that North Africa and Middle East countries are the most affected by oil discoveries in relation to other global regions. We find similar positive effects on conflict with quantity of oil discovered, as well as the expectation of oil discoveries. Interestingly, while institutions have a significant non-linear effect on conflict, they appear to have no significant mitigating effect when interacted with oil discoveries. The implication of this result may allude to countries with natural resources needing more transparent institutions to alleviate the resource curse. Overall, we believe the results from this study will provide some further understanding to the complex nature involving natural resources and incidences of conflict.
C23|Threshold Effects of Inequality on Economic Growth in the US States: The Role of Human Capital to Physical Capital Ratio|Theory suggests that the effect of inequality on growth varies with the level of economic development, as captured by the ratio of human capital to physical capital. In particular, the effect is shown to be positive at lower levels of this ratio, and turns negative beyond a threshold in such models. Using a comprehensive panel of annual data for the 48 contiguous US states over the period 1948 to 2014, we find overwhelming evidence in support of this theory, unlike prior work on this topic. Hence, our paper highlights the importance of accurately measuring the process of economic development using data on human capital and physical capital, instead of using proxies that are not theoretically consistent. Understandably, if not done so, policymakers would end up undertaking incorrect decisions.
C23|A Reconsideration of Kuznets Curve across Countries: Evidence from the Co-summability Approach|This study re-examines the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between economic growth and income inequality using advanced time series techniques, which enable analyzing nonlinear long-run relationships among stochastic processes. Applying the concept of summability, balancedness, and co-summability on a sample of 55 countries from 1980 to 2010, we find no evidence in support of the nonlinear long-run relationship economic growth and income inequality.
C23|Alternative Boomerang Kids, Intergenerational Co-residence, and Maternal Labor Supply|This study investigates the boomerang phenomenon among adult children in Thailand. We estimate the effect of having children on co-residence between parents and adult children using Socio-Economic Survey panel data. We find that adult children who have moved out tend to move back in with their parents after having children to save time and money on childcare. The presence of young children increases the likelihood of intergenerational co-residence by over 30%. This study is the first to provide empirical evidence of boomerang kids in an Asian context, which is distinctive compared with Western countries. The relationship between intergenerational co-residence and the maternal labor supply is also examined using the instrumental variable approach based on the cross-sectional Labor Force Survey, which has data covering over 30 years. Our results show that co-residence increases the female labor supply by 21% and also extends women's working hours by 10 hours.
C23|"""Gold Miss"" or ""Earthy Mom""? Evidence from Thailand"|"This paper investigates the impact of Thai women's education on their marriage behavior and fertility. It first uses the panel data set from the Socio-Economic Survey to estimate the effect of education on the marriage market. The result from applying the individual fixed effect estimation indicates that obtaining a university degree decreases the probability of women's marriage, emphasizing the rise of the ""Gold Miss"" phenomenon in Thailand. The cross-sectional data set from the Labor Force Survey examines the effect of education on fertility. By applying both the instrumental variable using the compulsory education reform as an instrument and pseudo-panel approaches to take into account the endogeneity of schooling, the result shows that education causally reduces fertility, which provides a convincing sequential explanation for the dramatic decline in fertility in Thailand."
C23|Wild Bootstrap and Asymptotic Inference with Multiway Clustering|We study two cluster-robust variance estimators (CRVEs) for regression models with clustering in two dimensions and give conditions under which t-statistics based on each of them yield asymptotically valid inferences. In particular, one of the CRVEs requires stronger assumptions about the nature of the intra-cluster correlations. We then propose several wild bootstrap procedures and state conditions under which they are asymptotically valid for each type of t-statistic. Extensive simulations suggest that using certain bootstrap procedures with one of the t-statistics generally performs very well. An empirical example confirms that bootstrap inferences can differ substantially from conventional ones
C23|When and How to Deal with Clustered Errors in Regression Models|We discuss when and how to deal with possibly clustered errors in linear regression models. Specifically, we discuss situations in which a regression model may plausibly be treated as having error terms that are arbitrarily correlated within known clusters but uncorrelated across them. The methods we discuss include various covariance matrix estimators, possibly combined with various methods of obtaining critical values, several bootstrap procedures, and randomization inference. Special attention is given to models with few treated clusters and clusters that vary in size, where inference may be problematic. Two empirical examples and a simulation experiment illustrate the methods we discuss and the concerns we raise.
C23|Roles of Agricultural Transformation in Achieving Sustainable Development Goals on Poverty, Hunger, Productivity, and Inequality|This paper examines the role of the transformation of the rural agricultural sector in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 2 and 10 drawing upon the cross-country panel data over the past four decades for 105 developing countries. We define agricultural transformation by three different indices, namely, (i) the agricultural openness index – the share of agricultural export in agricultural value added of the country, (ii) the commercialization index - the share of processed agricultural products, fruits, green vegetables, and meats in all primary and processed agricultural products, and (iii) the product diversification index to capture the extent to which the country diversify the agricultural production. Drawing upon the dynamic panel model, we have found that transformation of the agricultural sector in terms of agricultural openness has dynamically increased the overall agricultural productivity and its growth and has consequently reduced national, rural and urban poverty significantly. We have also found that agricultural openness tends to significantly alleviate child malnutrition, namely underweight and stunting, and improve food security in terms of energy supply adequacy, protein supply, lack of food deficit and reduction of the prevalence of anaemia among pregnant women. The agricultural openness is found to be negatively associated with the Gini coefficient at both national and subnational levels (for both rural and urban areas). Except for Latin America, product diversification reduces agricultural productivity, implying the efficiency gains from economies of scale of fewer crops. On the other hand, we argue that the commercialisation does not generally increase the agricultural productivity and this may be related to a positive effect of the higher share of cereal production on productivity observed in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. It has been suggested that policies improving the efficiency of agricultural production, for example through better rural infrastructure, or promoting agricultural exports, through regional economic integrations or reducing transaction costs such as tariff and non-tariff barriers, would help to achieve SDGs 1, 2 and 10 indirectly through the productivity improvement. However, a separate policy to support the poorest below the US$1.90 a day poverty line is also necessary for achieving SDG 1.
C23|House Prices, (Un)Affordability and Systemic Risk|This is the first paper to examine the role of the real estate sector and housing unaffordability in the determination of systemic risk. We measure the systemic risk of the UK by employing the CoVaR method developed by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011, 2016), and we explore both its cross-sectional and time series behaviour. Regarding the former, we show that when the real estate sector is under distress the tail risk of the entire financial system increases significantly. With respect to the latter, the findings of our dynamic model suggest that sustainable house prices positively contribute to the stability of the financial sector; whilst house price exuberance and rapid increases in housing unaffordability amplify systemic risk. Finally, we examine the conjecture that the banking sector comprises a transmission channel from the housing market to the systemic risk of the financial system. Our empirical results are in line with this argument and highlight the key role of housing unaffordability.
C23|Euro Area Growth and European Institutional Reforms|Euro area countries have experienced profound economic, financial and institutional changes over the last three decades. GDP growth has been very volatile, and very uneven, across countries. Which factors played a role in stirring growth and/or reducing it? We provide an atheoretical toolkit looking at a large set of real, financial, monetary and institutional variables, as possible factors behind fluctuations and differences in growth rates among euro area countries since 1990. The main outcome stresses the key positive role for long-run growth of higher European institutional integration, overall and for the periphery in specific. This result is robust across specifications and setups. If we split the European institutional integration in its main components, we can see a significant positive role for financial and political integration in the long-run. However the first seems to have beneficial effects for the core only while the opposite holds for the political integration which influences positively the periphery.
C23|Euro Area Government Bond Yield and Liquidity Dependence during different Monetary Policy Accommodation Phases|In this paper, we analyze the relationship between various risk factors and euro area government bond yield spreads, focusing particularly on the monetary policy stance. Our results show that credit and common risk factors are consistently priced in government bond yield spreads, while liquidity differentials are relevant especially during periods of stressed market conditions. We demonstrate that the liquidity component has been more prominent during periods of declining interest rates and increasing reserves, while it has diminished on announcement days of monetary policy decisions related to PSPP. Overall, the liquidity component has been statistically insignificant since the announcement of accommodative non-standard monetary policy measures.
C23|Exchange rate pass-through to import prices in Europe: A panel cointegration approach|This paper takes a panel cointegration approach to the estimation of short- and long-run exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to import prices in the European countries. Although economic theory suggests a long-run relationship between import prices and exchange rate, in recent empirical studies its existence has either been overlooked, or it has proven dicult to establish. Resorting to novel tests for panel cointegration, we nd support for the equilibrium relationship hypothesis. Exchange rate pass-through elasticities, estimated by two di erent techniques for cointegrated panel regressions, give insight into the most recent development of the ERPT.
C23|Revenue decoupling and energy consumption: Empirical evidence from the U.S. electric utilities sector|Energy efficiency provides a substantial opportunity to tackle increasing greenhouse gas emissions. However, in traditionally regulated energy markets, energy providers maximize their profits by selling electricity or heat as long as their marginal revenue exceeds their marginal costs of production. This so called ’throughput incentive’ fundamentally restricts the motivation of utilities to invest in energy efficiency. This paper therefore investigates the relation between the regulatory policy revenue decoupling, that separates utilities’ revenue from sales fluctuations, and electricity customers’ energy demand and efficiency in the U.S. To address the research question at hand, we follow recent developments in energy demand function modeling and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) estimation techniques that allow to account for persistent as well as transient efficiency. The estimation results show a significant negative correlation between revenue decoupling and electricity consumption patterns.Furthermore, we find electricity customers have small transient inefficiency. However, results indicate an underlying persistent inefficiency across the entire electric sector.
C23|Testing for Shifts in a Time Trend Panel Data Model with Serially Correlated Error Component Disturbances| This paper studies testing of shifts in a time trend panel data model with serially correlated error component disturbances, without any prior knowledge of whether the error term is sta- tionary or nonstationary. This is done in case the shift is known as well as unknown. Following Vogelsang (1997) in the time series literature, we propose a Wald type test statistic that uses a fixed effects feasible generalized least squares (FE-FGLS) estimator derived in Baltagi, et al. (2014). The proposed test has a Chi-square limiting distribution and is valid for both J(O) and J(l) errors. The finite sample size and power of this Wald test is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations.
C23|Structural Changes in Heterogeneous Panels with Endogenous Regressors| This paper extends Pesaran (2006) common correlated e¤ects (CCE) by allowing for endogenous regressors in large heterogeneous panels with unknown common structural changes in slopes and error factor structure. Since endogenous regressors and structural breaks are often encountered in empirical studies with large panels, this extension makes the Pesaran’s (2006) CCE approach empirically more appealing. In addition to allowing for slope heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence, we find that Pesaran’s CCE approach is also valid when dealing with unobservable factors in the presence of endogenous regressors and structural changes in slopes and error factor loadings. This is supported by Monte Carlo experiments.
C23|Technological Learning and Innovation Gestation Lags at the Frontier of Science: from CERN Procurement to Patent|"This paper contributes to the literature on the impact of Big Science Centres on technological innovation. We exploit a unique dataset with information on CERN's procurement orders to study the collaborative innovation process between CERN and its industrial partners. After a qualitative discussion of case studies, survival and count data models are estimated; the impact of CERN procurement on suppliers' innovation is captured by the number of patent applications. The fact that firms in our sample received their first order over a long time span (1995-2008) delivers a natural partition of industrial partners into ""suppliers"" and ""not yet suppliers"". This allows estimating the impact of CERN on the hazard to file a patent for the first time and on the number of patent applications, as well as the time needed for these effects to show up. We find that a ""CERN effect"" does exist: being an industrial partner of CERN is associated with an increase in the hazard to file a patent for the first time and in the number of patent applications. These effects require a significant ""gestation lag"" in the range of five to eight years, pointing to a relatively slow process of absorption of new ideas."
C23|Hedonic house price indices for Malta: A mortgage-based approach|This paper makes use of a novel dataset derived from mortgage contracts granted by the major lending institutions in Malta. This contains information about house prices and a number of important property characteristics. Together with geographic and sociodemographic variables, this information allows the computation of a range of hedonic house price indices for Malta for the period 2010-2017. In general we find that growth in house prices remained relatively muted over the period 2011-2014, ranging between 1.0% and 2.0%. House prices picked-up markedly after 2015, averaging between 4.5% and 7.5%. In particular, house price growth peaked in 2017, at between 10.1% and 11.0%. Although the general evolution of the hedonic house price indices calculated in this study are broadly similar to the indices computed by the contract-based index produced by the National Statistics Office and the advertised-based index produced by the Central Bank of Malta, there are some divergences. These differences can be attributed to changes in property characteristics.
C23|Is export diversification or export specialization responsible for economic growth in BRICS countries?|Is it export diversification or export specialization that is more useful towards promoting economic growth in the BRICS economies? To answer this query, we estimate a growth model augmented with trade activity to capture the diversification-concentration trade-off with economic growth over the period of 1995 to 2017. Our baseline Fully-Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) regressions confirm a negative effect of diversification on growth whereas concentration has a positive effect on growth. We further estimate panel quantile regressions for the growth specifications and find that i) moderate levels of concentration are best for economic growth ii) diversification adversely affects growth across all quantiles though the effect diminishes as one approaches higher levels of diversification. This points to a semi inverted U-shaped diversification schedule, of which the BRICS countries have crossed their ‘inflexion point’ of development and need to re-specialize their export baskets.
C23|Estimating Heterogeneous Reactions to Experimental Treatments|Frequently in experiments there is not only variance in the reaction of participants to treatment. The heterogeneity is patterned: discernible types of participants react differently. In principle, a finite mixture model is well suited to simultaneously estimate the probability that a given participant belongs to a certain type, and the reaction of this type to treatment. Yet often, finite mixture models need more data than the experiment provides. The approach requires ex ante knowledge about the number of types. Finite mixture models are hard to estimate for panel data, which is what experiments often generate. For repeated experiments, this paper offers a simple two-step alternative that is much less data hungry, that allows to find the number of types in the data, and that allows for the estimation of panel data models. It combines machine learning methods with classic frequentist statistics.
C23|Going with your Gut: The (In)accuracy of Forecast Revisions in a Football Score Prediction Game|This paper studies 150 individuals who each chose to forecast the outcome of 380 fixed events, namely all football matches during the 2017/18 season of the English Premier League. The focus is on whether revisions to these forecasts before the matches began improved the likelihood of predicting correct scorelines and results. Against what theory might expect, we show how these revisions tended towards significantly worse forecasting performance, suggesting that individuals should have stuck with their initial judgements, or their ‘gut instincts’. This result is robust to both differences in the average forecasting ability of individuals and the predictability of matches. We find evidence this is because revisions to the forecast number of goals scored in football matches are generally excessive, especially when these forecasts were increased rather than decreased.
C23|What is the Investment Loss due to Uncertainty?|We investigate the effect of uncertainty on investment. We employ a unique dataset of 25000 Greek firms' balance sheets for 14 years covering the period before and after the eurozone crisis. A dynamic factor model is employed to proxy uncertainty. The investment performance of 14 sectors is examined within a dynamic investment model. Robust GMM estimates of the investment rate model reveal a high degree of heterogeneity among these sectors. Overall uncertainty affects negatively investment performance and this effect substantially increased in the years of crisis. Agriculture and Mining are the least affected and the most affected ones include Manufacturing, Real Estate and Hotels. Focusing on the response of investment to uncertainty, it emerges that (relative) smaller firms are affected more compared to larger ones.
C23|Testing for information asymmetry in the mortgage servicing market|Our main objective is to test for evidence of information asymmetry in the mortgage servicing market. Does the sale of mortgage servicing rights (MSR) by the initial lender to a second servicing institution unveil any residual asymmetric information? We analyze the originator’s selling choice of MSR using a large sample of U.S. mortgages that were privately securitized during the period of January 2000 to December 2013 (more than 5 million observations). Our econometric methodology is mainly non-parametric and the main test for the presence of information asymmetry is driven by kernel density estimation techniques (Su and Spindler, 2013). We also employ the non-parametric testing procedure of Chiappori and Salanié (2000). For robustness, we present parametric tests to corroborate our results after controlling for observable risk characteristics, for econometric misspecification error, and for endogeneity issues using instrumental variables. Our empirical results provide strong support for the presence of second-stage asymmetric information in the mortgage servicing market.
C23|La mediterraneidad como determinante del flujo bilateral de inversión extranjera directa|El documento analiza las principales variables que explican el comportamiento del flujo bilateral de inversión extranjera directa. Se pone especial énfasis en la mediterraneidad, una variable geográfica la cual caracteriza a casi el 25 por ciento de la totalidad de los países en el mundo. Mediante la construcción de un panel de datos compuesto por 9.312 flujos bilaterales correspondientes a 97 países en el período 2001-2012, se contó con 111.744 observaciones. A partir de dicho panel, se realizó la estimación en el marco de la ecuación de gravedad y el paradigma ecléctico de Dunning. Los resultados contaron con los signos esperados teóricamente. En el caso específico de la mediterraneidad, se encontró que los países sin litoral pierden cerca del 60 por ciento de su flujo de inversión extranjera directa. La causa de esa pérdida puede encontrarse en el aislamiento que genera dicho atributo geográfico. Finalmente, en un estudio específico sobre Bolivia, un país enclaustrado y no mediterráneo, se calculó que, en el período analizado, la pérdida anual debido al enclaustramiento representó, en promedio, el 2,22 por ciento de su Producto Interno Bruto.
C23|On Factor Models with Random Missing: EM Estimation, Inference, and Cross Validation|We consider the estimation and inference in approximate factor models with random missing values. We show that with the low rank structure of the common component, we can estimate the factors and factor loadings consistently with the missing values replaced by zeros. We establish the asymptotic distributions of the resulting estimators and those based on the EM algorithm. We also propose a cross validation-based method to determine the number of factors in factor models with or without missing values and justify its consistency. Simulations demonstrate that our cross validation method is robust to fat tails in the error distribution and significantly outperforms some existing popular methods in terms of correct percentage in determining the number of factors. An application to the factor-augmented regression models shows that a proper treatment of the missing values can improve the out-of-sample forecast of some macroeconomic variables.
C23|Specification Tests for Temporal Heterogeneity in Spatial Panel Models with Fixed Effects|We propose score type tests for testing the existence of temporal heterogeneity in slope and spatial parameters in spatial panel data (SPD) models, allowing for the presence of individual-specific and/or time-specific fixed effects (or in general intercept heterogeneity). The SPD model with spatial lag effect is treated in detail by first considering the model with individual-specific effects only, and then extending it to the model with both individual and time specific effects. Two types of tests (naive and robust) are proposed, and their asymptotic properties are presented. These tests are then fully extended to an SPD model with both spatial lag and spatial error effects. Monte Carlo results show that the robust tests have much superior finite and large sample properties than the naive tests. Thus, the proposed robust tests provide reliable tools for identifying possible existence of temporal heterogeneity in regression and spatial coefficients. Empirical illustrations of the proposed tests are given.
C23|Panel threshold regressions with latent group structures|In this paper, we consider the least squares estimation of a panel structure threshold re-gression (PSTR) model where both the slope coeﬃcients and threshold parameters may exhibit latent group structures. We study the asymptotic properties of the estimators of the latent group structure and the slope and threshold coeﬃcients. We show that we can estimate the latent group structure correctly with probability approaching 1 and the estimators of the slope and threshold coeﬃcients are asymptotically equivalent to the infeasible estimators that are obtained as if the true group structures were known. We study likelihood-ratio-based inferences on the group-speciﬁc threshold parameters under the shrinking-threshold-eﬀect framework. We also propose two speciﬁcation tests: one tests whether the threshold parameters are homogenous across groups, and the other tests whether the threshold eﬀects are present. When the number of latent groups is unknown, we propose a BIC-type information criterion to determine the number of groups in the data. Simulations demonstrate that our estimators and tests perform reasonably well in ﬁnite samples. We apply our model to revisit the relationship between capital market imperfection and the investment behavior of ﬁrms and to examine the impact of bank deregulation on income inequality. We document a large degree of heterogeneous eﬀects in both applications that cannot be captured by conventional panel threshold regressions.
C23|Inference in partially identiﬁed panel data models with interactive fixed eﬀects|This paper develops methods for statistical inferences in a partially identiﬁed nonparametric panel data model with endogeneity and interactive ﬁxed eﬀects. We consider the case where the number of cross-sectional units (N) is large and the number of time series periods (T).as well as the number of unobserved common factors (R) are ﬁxed. Under some normalization rules, wecan concentrateout thelarge dimen-sional parameter vector of factor loadings and specify a set of conditional moment restriction that are involved with only the ﬁnite dimensional factor parameters along with the inﬁnite dimensional nonpara-metric component. For a conjectured restriction on the parameter, we consider testing the null hypothesis that the restriction is satisﬁed by at least one element in the identiﬁed set and propose a test statistic based on a novel martingale diﬀerence divergence (MDD) measure for the distance between a conditional expectation object and zero. We derive the limiting distribution of the resultant test statistic under the null and show that it is divergent at rate-N under the global alternative based on the U-process theory. To obtain the critical values for our test, we propose a version of multiplier bootstrap and establish its asymptotic validity. Simulations demonstrate the ﬁnite sample properties of our inference procedure. We apply our method to study Engel curves for major nondurable expenditures in China by using a panel dataset from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS).
C23|Estimation of Stochastic Frontier Panel Data Models with Spatial Inefficiency|"This paper proposes a stochastic frontier panel data model in which unit-specific inefficiencies are spatially correlated. In particular, this model has simultaneously three important features: i) the total inefficiency of a productive unit depends on its own inefficiency and on the inefficiency of its neighbors; ii) the spatially correlated and time varying inefficiency is disentangled from time invariant unobserved heterogeneity in a panel data model à la Greene (2005); iii) systematic differences in inefficiency can be explained using exogenous determinants. We propose to estimate both the ""true"" fixed- and random-effects variants of the model using a feasible simulated composite maximum likelihood approach. The finite sample behavior of the proposed estimators are investigated through a set of Monte Carlo experiments. Our simulation results suggest that the estimation approach is consistent, showing good finite sample properties especially in small samples."
C23|Changing supply elasticities and regional housing booms|Recent developments in US house prices mirror those of the 1996-2006 boom, but the recovery in construction activity has been weak. Using data for 254 US metropolitan areas, we show that housing supply elasticities have fallen markedly in recent years. Consistent with this, we ?nd that monetary policy shocks have a stronger e?ect on house prices during the recent recovery than the previous boom. At the same time, building permits respond less. Finally, we ?nd that housing supply elasticities have declined more in areas where land-use regulation has tightened the most, and in areas that experienced the sharpest housing busts.
C23|The Impact of Food Prices on Conflict Revisited|Studies that examine the impact of food prices on conflict usually assume that (all) changes in international food prices are exogenous shocks for individual countries or local areas. By isolating strictly exogenous shifts in global food commodity prices, we show that this assumption could seriously distort estimations of the impact on conflict in African regions. Specifically, we show that increases in food prices that are caused by harvest shocks outside Africa raise conflict significantly, whereas a “naive” regression of conflict on international food prices uncovers an inverse relationship. We also find that higher food prices lead to more conflict in regions with more agricultural production. Again, we document that failing to account for exogenous price changes exhibits a considerable bias in the impact. In addition, we show that the conventional approach to evaluate such effects; that is, estimations that include time fixed effects, ignores an important positive baseline effect that is common for all regions.
C23|Fiscal reaction functions for the advanced economies revisited|We revisit the evidence on the relationship between the Primary Balances/GDP and Debt/GDP ratios (Fiscal Reaction Function, FRF), in the advanced economies, showing that taking carefully into account the stochastic properties of the data leads to question the validity of the current consensus. More precisely, we find that before the 2008 financial crisis long-run FRF's existed only in a small number of advanced economies, and that they were more likely in countries characterized by higher sovereign spreads. Finally, we also find limited evidence of non-linearities leading to fiscal fatigue.
C23|Electoral Reform and Public Sector Efficiency. Some Evidence From Italian Municipalities|We study the effect of Law 81/1993, which introduced a different electoral rule for the election of the mayor, on the technical efficiency of Italian cities. Since 1993, municipalities below 15,000 inhabitants vote with a single-ballot system, whereas cities above 15,000 inhabitants threshold are subject to a double ballot. We first estimate the technical efficiency in 1994 (taken as a pre-change year), and 1999 and 2004 for a sample of Italian municipalities, through a non-parametric DEA, and then we perform on both input and output oriented efficiency scores a difference-in-differences analysis, through various panel techniques. We find evidence that, after the reform, municipalities voting under a double-ballot show low levels of efficiency compared to cities voting under a single-ballot, by about 16 (input oriented) and 4 percentage points (output oriented). We speculate that the difference in the level of efficiency among cities voting under a different electoral rule is essentially driven by a lower average quality of politicians elected under a double ballot compared to those elected with a single ballot.
C23|Out-of-Sample Analysis of International Reserves for Emerging Economies with a Dynamic Panel Model|Using data on 70 emerging countries for 1990-2011, we re-examine the validity of both traditional and recently proposed determinants of international reserves. The dynamic panel model considers panel unit root, endogeneity, and country heterogeneity and reveals that not only traditional determinants but also new financial variablesâ€”M2/GDP and foreign capital inflows through over-the-counter marketsâ€” have significant effects on reserves hoarding. More importantly, out-of-sample forecasts show that the dynamic model yields the best goodness-of-fit, and its predicted values successfully account for the recent patterns in reserve accumulations.
C23|Theoretical Analysis of Heterogeneous Hospital Response to a Per Diem Prospective Payment System|Motivated by the Japanese PPS reform, aimed at curbing high length of stay in Japanese hospitals, we develop a theoretical model to study how hospitals¡¯ ?nancial incentives differ between the two reimbursement systems: a pre-reform fee-for-service (F F S); and a post reform length-of-stay-dependent stepwise decreasing per diem rate (SDR). First, we show that hospitals with shorter (longer) average length of stay under F F S have longer (shorter) average length of stay under SDR. Second, we show that hospitals with longer stay under the F F S reimbursement system are more likely to use planned readmission in order to decrease the length of stay associated with a single admission. Finally, we show that profit-wise, it is hospitals with the shortest pre-reform length of stay who gain from a change to the SDR reimbursement rule. The theoretical predictions of our model closely match empirical evidence from the literature.
C23|Modeling temporal treatment effects with zero inflated semi-parametric regression models: the case of local development policies in France|A semi-parametric approach is proposed to estimate the variation along time of the effects of two distinct public policies that were devoted to boost rural development in France over a similar period of time. At a micro data level, it is often observed that the dependent variable, such as local employment, does not vary along time, so that we face a kind of zero inflated phenomenon that cannot be dealt with a continuous response model. We introduce a conditional mixture model which combines a mass at zero and a continuous response. The suggested zero inflated semi-parametric statistical approach relies on the flexibility and modularity of additive models with the ability of panel data to deal with selection bias and to allow for the estimation of dynamic treatment effects. In this multiple treatment analysis, we find evidence of interesting patterns of temporal treatment effects with relevant nonlinear policy effects. The adopted semi-parametric modeling also offers the possibility of making a counterfactual analysis at an individual level. The methodology is illustrated and compared with parametric linear approaches on a few municipalities for which the mean evolution of the potential outcomes is estimated under the different possible treatments.
C23|An Analysis on the Domestic Sales and Exports: A Dynamic Model for the Turkish Manufacturing Firms|This study examines the relation between real domestic sales and real exports for Turkish manufacturing firms. Dynamic panel data estimations based on firm level data for the period 2004 to 2014 suggest that the two variables are substitutes. Holding other factors constant, we estimate that a 10 percent decline in real domestic sales increases the real exports by about 2.6 percent, on average. However, this correlation differs among manufacturing sub-sectors, which are defined according to 2-digit NACE classification. Results indicate that substitutability between domestic and foreign sales is stronger for export-oriented, low-leveraged and younger firms. In addition, we observe that the degree of substitution between real domestic sales and exports strengthens significantly when the domestic demand conditions are weak. This shows that exporter firms in manufacturing industry have the elasticity to shift from domestic to international markets as a response to domestic demand shocks.
C23|Macroprudential Policies, Persistence of Uncertainty and Leverage Dynamics: Evidence from a Major Developing Economy|This paper investigates the impact of macroprudential policies and uncertainty of economic environment on corporate leverage dynamics over the last decade. This is the first study to investigate the impact of macroprudential policies and uncertainty on leverage dynamics of Turkish non-financial firms using firm-level data. We argue in this paper that persistence of uncertainty should be a more appropriate factor affecting credit dynamics rather than uncertainty. In that sense, we construct a measure of uncertainty by using principal component analysis and a measure of persistence of uncertainty for Turkey. Results from the dynamic panel models with a large set of control variables, provide significant evidence in support of the argument that leverage decisions are affected from the persistence of uncertainty rather than the uncertainty itself. Moreover, both the share of the financial debt in total liabilities and the leverage of Turkish non-financial firms decrease significantly when uncertainty increases persistently and when macroprudential policy tools are tightened. Most strikingly, this is the case only for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises but not for large firms.
C23|Crude oil futures trading and uncertainty|This paper examines the effect of different dimensions of uncertainty on expectations of WTI crude oil futures momentum traders at a daily level. We consider two concepts of uncertainty and two momentum trading indicators based on technical analysis. In addition, we also use wavelet techniques to decompose crude oil futures prices into different frequencies accounting for investors' sentiment at various horizons. To allow for different effects on the propagation mechanism of uncertainty shocks, we apply a time-varying Bayesian VAR approach. Our findings indicate that both measures of uncertainty affect momentum trading on the crude oil futures market in several periods, especially during the great recession between 2007 and 2009. For the decomposed futures prices our results also show that the reaction to uncertainty differs substantially across frequencies. High frequencies exhibit a very short-lived reaction to uncertainty while low frequencies show a persistent reaction to uncertainty shocks.
C23|Assessing predictive accuracy in panel data models with long-range dependence|This paper proposes tests of the null hypothesis that model-based forecasts are uninformative in panels, allowing for individual and interactive fixed effects that control for cross-sectional dependence, endogenous predictors, and both short-range and long-range dependence. We consider a Diebold-Mariano style test based on comparison of the model-based forecast and a nested nopredictability benchmark, an encompassing style test of the same null, and a test of pooled uninformativeness in the entire panel. A simulation study shows that the encompassing style test is reasonably sized in finite samples, whereas the Diebold-Mariano style test is oversized. Both tests have non-trivial local power. The methods are applied to the predictive relation between economic policy uncertainty and future stock market volatility in a multi-country analysis.
C23|Asymptotic Theory And Wild Bootstrap Inference With Clustered Errors|We study asymptotic inference based on cluster-robust variance estimators for regression models with clustered errors, focusing on the wild cluster bootstrap and the ordinary wild bootstrap. We stateconditions under which both asymptotic and bootstrap tests and confidence intervals will be asymptotically valid. These conditions put limits on the rates at which the cluster sizes can increase as the number of clusters tends to infinity. To include power in the analysis, we allow the data to be generated under sequences of local alternatives. Under a somewhat stronger set of conditions, we also derive formal Edgeworth expansions for the asymptotic and bootstrap test statistics. Simulation experiments illustrate the theoretical results, and the Edgeworth expansions explain the overrejection of the asymptotic test and shed light on the choice of auxiliary distribution for the wild bootstrap.
C23|Forecasting Causes of Death using Compositional Data Analysis: the Case of Cancer Deaths|Cause-specific mortality forecasting is often based on predicting cause-specific death rates independently. Only a few methods have been suggested that incorporate dependence among causes. An attractive alternative is to model and forecast cause-specific death distributions, rather than mortality rates, as dependence among the causes can be incorporated directly. We follow this idea and propose two new models which extend the current research on mortality forecasting using death distributions. We find that adding age, time, and cause-specific weights and decomposing both joint and individual variation among different causes of death increased the forecast accuracy of cancer deaths using data for French and Dutch populations
C23|Longevity forecasting by socio-economic groups using compositional data analysis|Several OECD countries have recently implemented an automatic link between the statutory retirement age and life expectancy for the total population to insure sustainability in their pension systems when life expectancy is increasing. Significant mortality differentials are observed across socio-economic groups and future changes in these differentials will determine whether some socio-economic groups drive increases in the retirement age leaving other groups with fewer years in receipt of pensions. We forecast life expectancy by socio-economic groups and compare the forecast performance of competing models using Danish mortality data and find that the most accurate model assumes a common mortality trend. Life expectancy forecasts are used to analyse the consequences of a pension system where the statutory retirement age is increased when total life expectancy is increasing
C23|Ethnic Diversity and Inequality in sub-Saharan Africa: Do Institutions Reduce the Noise?|Studies on the causes of income differences between the rich and the poor have received an extensive attention in the inequality empirics. While ethnic diversity hasalso been identified as one of the fundamental causes of income inequality, the role of institutions as a mediating factor in the ethnicity-inequality nexus has not received the scholarly attention it deserves. To this end, this study complements the existing literature by investigating the extent to which institutional framework corrects the noisy influence originating from the nexus between “ethnic diversity” and inequality in 26 sub-Saharan African countries for the period 1996-2015. The empirical evidence is based on pooled OLS, fixed effects and system GMM estimators. The main findings reveal that the mediating influences of institutional settingsaredefective, thus making it extremely difficult to modulatethe noisy impacts of ethno-linguistic and religious heterogeneity on inequality. In addition, the negative influencesorchestrated by ethnolinguistic and religious diversities on inequality fail toattenuate the impact of income disparityeven when interacted with institutions. On the policy front, institutional reforms tailored toward economic, political and institutional governances should be targeted.
C23|Reconsideration of a simple approach to quantile regression for panel data: a comment on the Canay (2011) fixed effects estimator|Estimation of individual effects in quantile regression can be difficult in large panel datasets, but a solution is apparently offered by a computationally simple estimator by Ivan Canay (2011, The Econometrics Journal) for quantile-independent individual effects. The Canay estimator is widely used by practitioners and is often cited in the theoretical literature. However, our paper discusses two fallacies in Canay's approach. We formally prove that Canay's assumptions can entail severe bias or even non-existence of the limiting distribution for the estimator of the vector of coefficients, leading to incorrect inference. A second problem is incorrect asymptotic standard error of the estimator of the constant term. In an attempt to improve Canay's estimator, we propose a simple correction which may reduce the bias. Regarding the constant term, we focus on the fact that finding a sqrt(nT) consistent first step estimator may be problematic. Finally, we give recommendations to practitioners in terms of different values of n=T, and conduct a meta-review of applied papers, which use Canay's estimator.

C23|The Importance Of Punishment Substitutability In Criminometric Studies|This study investigates the role of punishment substitutability in the empirical estimation of the economic model of crime. Using a dynamic panel data model fitted to a panel of Local Government Areas in New South Wales, Australia, we evaluate the effects of financial penalties and imprisonment on the crime rate. Our results show that crime is clearly a dynamic phenomenon, and that failure to incorporate both financial penalties and imprisonment can lead to a misspecified model. Furthermore, our results vary significantly for different crime categories, highlighting the importance of analysing specific crime categories separately.
C23|Natural disasters and mental health: A quantile approach|This article investigates heterogeneity in the effect of experiencing natural disasters on mental health. Using Australian longitudinal data, we find that home owners generally show a reduction in mental health score after a disaster. There is a strong negative effect in the lowest two quantiles of the distribution for non-owners.
C23|Soda Wars: The Effect Of A Soda Tax Election On University Beverage Sales|We examine how soda sales changed due to the campaign attention and election outcome of a local excise tax on sugar‐sweetened beverages. Using panel data of beverage sales from university retailers in Berkeley, California, we estimate that soda purchases relative to control beverages significantly dropped immediately after the election, months before the tax was implemented in the city of Berkeley or on campus. Supplemental scanner data from off‐campus retailers reveal this result is not unique to the university setting. Our findings suggest soda tax media coverage and election outcomes can have larger effects on purchasing behavior than the tax itself. (JEL D12, H20, C23, I38, Q18)
C23|Growing in the Womb: The Effect of Seismic Activity on Fetal Growth|We study how prenatal maternal stress, caused by sustained seismic activity, affects birth outcomes in Chile during the period 2011-2015. A mother-fixed-effect model together with the spatiotemporal variation of earthquakes in Chile allow us to deal with identification issues that have obscured previous estimates. Our findings show that prenatal maternal stress seems to affect fetal growth, because infants born to mothers exposed to earth tremors in early and/or mid gestation are more likely to be large for gestational age. The estimates suggest that relatively poorer Chilean mothers are more vulnerable to earthquakes, because their babies seem to drive the reported impacts on fetal growth. We discuss and provide evidence that suggests a possible mechanism that explains the varying results across socioeconomic status. Mothers with diabetes and/or hypertension are more likely to have large-for-gestational-age babies. Exposure to earth tremors seems to increase the incidence of these afflictions among the affected population, with the observed impact on diabetes being relatively higher among women with lower socio-economic status.
C23|Technological Learning and Innovation Gestation Lags at the Frontier of Science: from CERN Procurement to Patents|This paper contributes to the literature on the impact of Big Science Centres on technological innovation. We exploit a unique dataset with information on CERN’s procurement orders to study the collaborative innovation process between CERN and its industrial partners, mostly European firms. Since 19 out of the 23 Member Countries of CERN belong to the EU, public procurement for innovation through CERN can be seen as factor contributing to European innovation policies. After a qualitative discussion of case studies, survival and count data models are estimated; the impact of CERN procurement on suppliers’ innovation is captured by the number of patent applications. The fact that firms in our sample received their first order over a long time span (1995-2008) delivers a natural partition of industrial partners into “suppliers” and “not yet suppliers”. This allows estimating the impact of CERN on the hazard to file a patent for the first time and on the number of patent applications, as well as the time needed for these effects to show up. We find that a “CERN effect” does exist: being an industrial partner of CERN is associated with an increase in the hazard to file a patent for the first time and in the number of patent applications. These effects require a significant “gestation lag” in the range of five to eight years, pointing to a relatively slow process of absorption of new ideas.
C23|Inference in Differences-in-Differences: How Much Should We Trust in Independent Clusters?|We analyze the conditions in which ignoring spatial correlation is problematic for inference in differences-in-differences (DID) models. Assuming that the spatial correlation structure follows a linear factor model, we show that inference ignoring such correlation remains reliable when either (i) the second moment of the difference between the pre- and post-treatment averages of common factors is low, or (ii) the distribution of factor loadings has the same expected values for treated and control groups, and do not exhibit significant spatial correlation. We present simulation results with real datasets that corroborate these conclusions. Our results provide important guidelines on how to minimize inference problems due to spatial correlation in DID applications.
C23|Employment Protection, Employment and Unemployment Rates in European Union Countries During the Great Recession|For mainstream economics, rigidities in the labour market are the primary determinants of high and persistent long-term unemployment rates, leading to the need to reform labour market institutions and make them more flexible. Flexible labour markets would not only help to smooth normal business cycle fluctuations (implying a small impact of these fluctuations on employment and unemployment) but also to reduce the negative impacts on labour market of structural shocks. If we focus on the labour market performances in the European Union during the Great Recession, we can easily detect the existence of significant differences in the impact of this common structural shock on the domestic labour markets. For mainstream economics, the countries with the best results in terms of unemployment and employment would have been those that had a more flexible labour market at the beginning of the crisis and/or those having implemented reforms to increase this flexibility. The aim of this paper is to determine the validity of this argument, that is, whether labour reforms making the labour market more flexible effectively ensure macroeconomic stability by reducing the impact on the labour market of economic shocks. Using panel data techniques, we investigate whether, as mainstream studies argue, the evolution of employment and unemployment in the EU labour markets is explained, and to what extent, by the levels and changes registered in the indicators of employment protection legislation. Conversely, we examine whether, as heterodox and post-Keynesian studies suggest, this evolution is explained by the changes registered in economic activity (i.e., GDP growth).
C23|Composite Likelihood Estimation of an Autoregressive Panel Probit Model with Random Effects|Modeling and estimating persistent discrete data can be challenging. In this paper, we use an autoregressive panel probit model where the autocorrelation in the discrete variable is driven by the autocorrelation in the latent variable. In such a non-linear model, the autocorrelation in an unobserved variable results in an intractable likelihood containing high-dimensional integrals. To tackle this problem, we use composite likelihoods that involve much lower order of integration. However, parameter identification becomes problematic since the information employed in lower dimensional distributions may not be rich enough for identification. Therefore, we characterize types of composite likelihoods that are valid for this model and study conditions under which the parameters can be identified. Moreover, we provide consistency and asymptotic normality results of the pairwise composite likelihood estimator and conduct Monte Carlo simulations to assess its finite-sample performances. Finally, we apply our method to analyze credit ratings. The results indicate a significant improvement in the estimated transition probabilities between rating classes compared with static models.
C23|Llegadas de turistas internacionales a Colombia durante 2001-2017: evolución, características y determinantes|En este documento se estudian las llegadas de turistas internacionales a Colombia. Se identifica el origen geográfico de los viajeros y se dividen en dos subgrupos: los colombianos residentes en el exterior y los extranjeros. Se encuentra que los arribos de turistas internacionales: i) se concentran en 20 países emisores, ii) se componen, mayoritariamente, de colombianos no residentes, iii) se aceleraron en los últimos 5 años debido al incremento notable de las llegadas de extranjeros, y iv) explican la dinámica de los ingresos externos por viajes. Se estiman ecuaciones de gravedad con modelos de datos panel para el periodo 2001- 2017, hallando que las llegadas dependen positivamente del tamaño de la economía de los países emisores de turistas, del volumen de comercio, de la población colombiana residente en el exterior y de la infraestructura en los establecimientos de alojamiento, y negativamente de la distancia hasta Colombia y de la percepción de inseguridad interna. Además, se encuentra que los determinantes de las llegadas son diferentes entre los colombianos no residentes y los extranjeros. **** ABSTRACT: We study international tourist arrivals to Colombia. We identify the travelers’ geographical origin and divide them into two subgroups: Colombians living abroad and foreigners. We find that the inflows of international tourists: i) are concentrated in 20 emitting countries, ii) are composed mostly of Colombians living abroad, iii) accelerated in the last 5 years due to the remarkable increase in foreigners’ arrivals, and iv) explain the evolution of international travel receipts. We estimate gravity equations using panel data models for the period 2001-2017, finding that arrivals depend positively on the size of the economy of emitting countries, the volume of trade, the Colombian population living abroad and the infrastructure in hotels and accommodation establishments, and negatively on the distance to Colombia and on the perception of internal security. In addition, we find that the determinants of arrivals are different for Colombians living abroad and foreigners.
C23|Simple methods for consistent estimation of dynamic panel data sample selection models|We analyse the properties of generalised method of moments-instrumental variables (GMM-IV) estimators of AR(1) dynamic panel data sample selection models. We show the consistency of the first-differenced GMM-IV estimator uncorrected for sample selection of Arellano and Bond (1991) (a property also shared by the Anderson and Hsiao,1982, proposal). Alternatively, the system GMM-IV estimator (Arellano and Bover, 1995, and Blundell and Bond, 1998) shows a moderate bias. We perform a Monte Carlo study to evaluate the finite sample properties of the proposed estimators. Our results confirm the absence of bias of the Arellano and Bond estimator under a variety of circumstances, as well as the small bias of the system estimator, mostly due to the correlation between the individual heterogeneity components in both the outcome and selection equations. However, we must not discard the system estimator because, in small samples, its performance is similar to or even better than that of the Arellano-Bond. These results hold in dynamic models with exogenous, predetermined or endogenous covariates. They are especially relevant for practitioners using unbalanced panels when either there is selection of unknown form or when selection is difficult to model.
C23|Changing supply elasticities and regional housing booms|Recent developments in US house prices mirror those of the 1996-2006 boom, but the recovery in construction activity has been weak. Using data for 254 US metropolitan areas, we show hat housing supply elasticities have fallen markedly in recent years. Housing supply elasticities have declined more in areas where land-use regulation has tightened the most, and in areas that experienced the sharpest housing busts. A lowering of the housing supply elasticity implies a strengthened price responsiveness to demand shocks, whereas quantity reacts less. Consistent with this, we find that an expansionary monetary policy shock has a considerably stronger effect on house prices during the recent recovery than during the previous housing boom. At the same time, building permits respond less.
C23|Identification of Dynamic Panel Binary Response Models|We analyze identification in dynamic econometric models of binary choice with fixed effects under general conditions. This class of models is often used in the literature to distinguish between state dependence (invariably referred to in the recent literature as switching costs, inertia or stickiness) and heterogeneity. We first characterize the sharp set for parameters in a dynamic panel of binary choice under conditional stationarity. The identified set can be characterized by a union of convex polyhedrons. We conduct the same exercise under the stronger assumption of conditional exchangeability, and establish its incremental identifying power. We extend our identification approach to study models with more time periods as well. We also provide sufficient conditions for point identification. For inference in cases with discrete regressors, we provide an approach to constructing confidence sets for the identified sets using a linear program that is simple to implement. The paper then provides simulation based evidence on the size and shape of the identified sets in varying designs to illustrate the informational content of different assumptions. We also illustrate the inference approach using a data set on women’s labor supply decisions.
C23|Inference on Semiparametric Multinomial Response Models|In this paper we explore inference on regression coefficients in semi parametric multinomial response models. We consider cross sectional, and both static and dynamic panel settings where we focus throughout on point inference under sufficient conditions for point identification. The approach to identification uses a matching insight throughout all three models and relies on variation in regressors: with cross section data, we match across individuals while with panel data we match within individuals over time. Across models, IIA is not assumed as the unobserved errors across choices are allowed to be arbitrarily correlated. For the cross sectional model estimation is based on a localized rank objective function, analogous to that used in Abrevaya, Hausman, and Khan (2010), and presents a generalization of existing approaches. In panel data settings rates of convergence are shown to exhibit a curse of dimensionality in the number of alternatives. The results for the dynamic panel data model generalizes the work of Honoré and Kyriazidou (2000) to cover the multinomial case. A simulation study establishes adequate finite sample properties of our new procedures and we apply our estimators to a scanner panel data set.
C23|Sources of Bias in Inflation Rates and Implications for Inflation Dynamics|Official statistics measuring the cost of living are known to suffer from several biases because they often do not accurately capture substitution patterns, product entry/exit, and preference shifts. In particular, the latter two biases have been shown to be large on average. This paper shows that the size of the biases can also vary with economic conditions. Using AC Nielsen homescan data for Switzerland around the 2015 appreciation of the CHF against the EUR, which resulted in a substantial shift in relative prices, it is first shown that official price indexes can be tracked using homescan data when applying the same methodology as that of the statistical office. Then, the often-acknowledged traditional substitution bias arising from lagged expenditure weights is shown to be relatively small. Based on an approach that allows for preference shocks and product entry/exit (unied price index), the two further biases, that is, the consumer valuation bias and the variety adjustment bias, are evaluated. Both are large on average and of similar size, together resulting in a 3.7 percentage point bias in the annual in ation rate. Furthermore, the bias is particularly large in the aftermath of the 2015 appreciation, increasing to 5.3 percentage points. In particular consumer valuation is shown to contribute signicantly to the increase in the bias after the exchange-rate shock. The unified price index declines by 2.4 times more than the traditional Fisher index, suggesting that taking into account the time-variation in the bias is important.
C23|Testing for Correlation in Error-Component Models|This paper concerns linear models for grouped data with group-specific effects. We construct a test for the null of no within-group correlation beyond that induced by the group-specific effect. The approach tests against correlation of arbitrary form while allowing for (conditional) heteroskedasticity. Our setup covers models with exogenous, predetermined, or endogenous regressors. We provide theoretical results on size and power under asymptotics where the number of groups grows but their size is held fixed. In simulation experiments we find good size control and high power in a wide range of designs. We also find that our test is more powerful than the popular test developed by Arellano and Bond (1991), which uses only a subset of the information used by our procedure.
C23|Fixed-effect regressions on network data| This paper studies inference on fixed eff ects in a linear regression model estimated from network data. We derive bounds on the variance of the fixed-e ffect estimator that uncover the importance of the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the (normalized) Laplacian of the network and of the degree structure of the network. The eigenvalue is a measure of connectivity, with smaller values indicating less-connected networks. These bounds yield conditions for consistent estimation and convergence rates, and allow to evaluate the accuracy of first-order approximations to the variance of the fixed-eff ect estimator.

C23|Inference on a Distribution from Noisy Draws|We consider a situation where the distribution of a random variable is being estimated by the empirical distribution of noisy measurements of that variable. This is common practice in, for example, teacher value-added models and other fixed-effect models for panel data. We use an asymptotic embedding where the noise shrinks with the sample size to calculate the leading bias in the empirical distribution arising from the presence of noise. The leading bias in the empirical quantile function is equally obtained. These calculations are new in the literature, where only results on smooth functionals such as the mean and variance have been derived. Given a closed-form expression for the bias, bias-corrected estimator of the distribution function and quantile function can be constructed. We provide both analytical and jackknife corrections that recenter the limit distribution and yield confidence intervals with correct coverage in large samples. These corrections are non-parametric and easy to implement. Our approach can be connected to corrections for selection bias and shrinkage estimation and is to be contrasted with deconvolution. Simulation results confirm the much-improved sampling behavior of the corrected estimators.
C23|Atividade econômica e inovação na indústria brasileira: uma análise com dados em painel (2010-2016)|The aim of the present work is to analyze the relationship between the level of economic activity and technological innovation in Brazilian industry from 2010 to 2016. The central hypothesis of the paper is that the greater the economic activity, the higher the positive impact on the innovation rate, through channels such as the increase in investments in fixed capital and the improvement in the financing conditions for innovation activities. The analysis is based on a database of the first six years of the survey called Innovation Survey in which it was possible to obtain a panel segmented by four blocks of industrial sectors. These data were analyzed by means of panel data regression model that reveals the temporal evolution of the relation between the level of industrial activity and the rate of innovation of firms. The main result suggests that the overcoming of the current crisis and the consequent recovery of economic activity are important elements for the increase of innovation rates in the Brazilian industry.
C23|Functional Coefficient Panel Modeling with Communal Smoothing Covariates|Behavior at the individual level in panels or at the station level in spatial models is often influenced by aspects of the system in aggregate. In particular, the nature of the interaction between individual-specific explanatory variables and an individual dependent variable may be affected by `global’ variables that are relevant in decision making and shared communally by all individuals in the sample. To capture such behavioral features, we employ a functional coefficient panel model in which certain communal covariates may jointly influence panel interactions by means of their impact on the model coefficients. Two classes of estimation procedures are proposed, one based on station averaged data the other on the full panel, and their asymptotic properties are derived. Inference regarding the functional coefficient is also considered. The finite sample performance of the proposed estimators and tests are examined by simulation. An empirical spatial model illustration is provided in which the climate sensitivity of temperature to atmospheric CO_2 concentration is studied at both station and global levels.
C23|Optimism, pessimism and life satisfaction: an empirical investigation|This empirical investigation into life satisfaction, using nationally representative German panel data, finds a substantial association with an individual’s thoughts about the future, whether they are optimistic or pessimistic about it. Furthermore, including individuals’ optimism and pessimism about the future substantially increases the explanatory power of standard life satisfaction models. The thoughts that individuals have about the future contribute substantially to their current life satisfaction. In particular, the reduction in life satisfaction experienced by individuals who report being pessimistic is greater than that for well-understood negative events like unemployment. These effects are attenuated but remain substantial after controlling for individual fixed effects, statistically matching on observable variables between optimistic and pessimistic individuals, and addressing the potential endogeneity of optimism and pessimism to life satisfaction. Moreover, these effects are robust to controlling for future life events that may be anticipated.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C23|The effect of unemployment on the smoking behavior of couples|Although unemployment likely entails various externalities, research examining its spillover effects on spouses is scarce. This is the first paper to estimate effects of unemployment on the smoking behavior of both spouses. Using German Socio-Economic Panel data, we combine matching and difference-indifferences estimation, employing the post-double-selection method for control-variable selection via Lasso regressions. One spouse's unemployment increases both spouses' smoking probability and intensity. Smoking relapses and decreased smoking cessation drive the effects. Effects are stronger if the partner already smokes and if the male partner becomes unemployed. Of several mechanisms discussed, we identify smoking to cope with stress as relevant.
C23|Social policy or crowding-out? Tenant protection in comparative long-run perspective|In the shadow of homeownership and public housing, social policy through the regulation of private rental markets is a neglected and underestimated eld of social policy. This paper, therefore, presents unique new data on the development of private tenancy legislation through the binary coding of rent control, the protection of tenants from eviction, and rental housing rationing laws across more than 25 countries and 100 years. This long-run perspective reveals the dynamic eects of rent control on the rise of homeownership as the dominant tenure during the 20th century. We nd that both rent regulation and rationing legislation eectively increased homeownership, but only up to a certain threshold. We suggest that the short-term lure of an inexpensive social policy for tenants has led to the long-term marginalization of rental markets in many countries
C23|The Impact of Population, Affluence, Technology, and Urbanization on CO2 Emissions across Income Groups|This paper analyzes the impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions within the STIRPAT framework over the period 1971 to 2014 for a panel of 76 countries clustered into income groups. Using dynamic panel estimations techniques, the empirical results robustly show an inverted N-shaped relationship between urbanization and CO2 emissions in the long-term associated with the ecological modernization theory in particular for the lower- and middle-income panel: increasing levels of urbanization tend to reduce CO2 emissions in the long-term. The estimated turning point for the urbanization ratio after which CO2 emissions decline is almost identical and around 54% both for the lower- and middle-income panel. The long-term relationship for CO2 emissions and its relevant impact factors tends to be similar across groups. The impact of population determines CO2 emissions significantly only in the long-term within any panel. Different from previous studies, the results robustly indicate that GDP per capita does impact CO2 emissions greater than population in any panel. This suggests, that it is rather the growth in consumption than the number of people leading CO2 emissions to increase. Energy efficiency reductions most harmfully effect CO2 emissions within the high-income panel in the long- and short-run.
C23|Impact of targeted credit easing by the ECB: Bank-level evidence|The interest rate in the second series of ECB targeted longer-term refinancing operations is conditional on a participant-specific lending benchmark. The restrictiveness of this benchmark varies between banks. We employ fixed effects estimations on a unique micro-dataset and investigate the relationship between the benchmark restrictiveness and net bank lending. We find that a more restrictive benchmark is associated with more total net lending and net lending to non-financial corporates by relatively large banks. Banks that are relatively large and face the most restrictive benchmark increase their lending to the real economy with 9 to 17 percent. We find no significant effects on net lending by relatively small banks. Furthermore, the restrictiveness of the benchmark does not affect net lending to households. Our findings suggest that the design of targeted lending benchmarks influences bank credit flows and that a more binding benchmark would have been even more effective in stimulating bank lending.
C23|Measuring trends and persistence in capital and labor misallocation|We analyze trends and persistence in the misallocation of labor and capital using firm-level panel data for the Netherlands in the period 2001-2017. We use the dispersion in marginal revenue products of labor and capital to measure the extent of misallocation. Compared to a counterfactual efficient allocation we find that misallocation has had a sizable negative impact on aggregate productivity. Especially capital misallocation has increased over time. The relatively high and rising capital misallocation is caused by a combination of small, highly productive firms facing relatively high capital wedges and large and unproductive firms facing relatively low capital wedges. Exploiting a panel data error components model we find that capital misallocation has a much more permanent character than labor misallocation. Moreover, it is the permanent component of capital misallocation that has increased over time. Finally, we show that in our sample the measurement of misallocation is largely insensitive to capital adjustment costs and alternative specifications of the production function. The contribution of heterogeneous markups to observed misallocation, however, is non-negligible.
C23|Physician’s altruism in incentive contracts: Medicare’s quality race|The paper analyzes the impact of physicians' altruism and motivation on the outcomes of pay-for-performance schemes in healthcare, where a fixed price contract on quantity is supplemented with a relative performance contract on quality. Our theoretical model forecasts crowding out of most altruistic types. In an empirical application to the Medicare's nationwide natural experiment with a relative performance contract on quality for acute inpatient care since 2013, we observe the proof of this prediction. Namely, the quality dimensions, which are linked to patient's benefit, demonstrate higher deterioration among top-performing hospitals than other incentivized dimensions.
C23|Time-Varying Risk Premia in Large International Equity Markets|We use an estimation methodology tailored for large unbalanced panels of individual stock returns to address key economic questions about the factor structure, pricing performance of factor models, and time-variations in factor risk premia in international equity markets. We estimate factor models with time-varying factor exposures and risk premia at the individual stock level using 62,320 stocks in 46 countries over the 1985-2018 period. We consider market, size, value, momentum, profitability, and investment factors aggregated at the country, regional, and world level. We find that adding an excess country market factor to world or regional factors is sufficient to capture the factor structure for both developed and emerging markets. We do not reject asset pricing restriction tests for multifactor models in 74% to 91% of countries. Value and momentum premia show more variability over time and across countries than profitability and investment premia. The excess country market premium is statistically significant in many developed and emerging markets but economically larger in emerging markets.
C23|The cost-efficiency and productivity growth of euro area banks|We use an industrial organisation approach to quantify the size of Total Factor Productivity Growth (TFPG) for euro area banks after the crisis and decompose it into its main driving factors. In addition, we disentangle permanent and time-varying inefficiency in the banking sector. This is important because lack of distinction may lead to biased estimates of inefficiency and because the set of policies needed in both cases is different. We focus on 17 euro area countries over the period 2006 to 2017. We find that cost efficiency in the euro area banking sector amounted to around 84% on average over the 2006 to 2017 period. In addition, we observe that Total Factor Productivity growth for the median euro area bank decreased from around 2% in 2007 to around 1% in 2017, with technological progress being the largest contributor, followed by technical efficiency. Given the need to boost productivity and enhance profitability in the euro area banking sector, these findings suggests that bank’s efforts in areas such as rationalisation of branches, digitalisation of business processes and possibly mergers and acquisitions should be intensified.

C23|Estimation of Industry-level Productivity with Cross-sectional Dependence by Using Spatial Analysis|We examine aggregate productivity in the presence of inter-sectoral linkages. Cross-sectional dependence is inevitable among industries, in which each sector serves as a supplier to the other sectors. However, the chains of such interconnections cause indirect relationship among industries. Spatial analysis is one of the approaches to address cross-sectional dependence by using a priori a specified spatial weights matrix. We exploit the linkage patterns from the input-output tables and use them to assign spatial weights to describe the economic interdependencies. By using the spatial weights matrix, we can estimate the industry-level production functions and productivity of the U.S. from 1947 to 2010. Cross-sectional dependencies are the consequences of indirect effects, and they reflect the interactions among industries linked via their supply chain networks result in larger output elasticities as well as scale effects for the networked production processes. However, productivity growth estimates are reportedly comparable across various spatial and non-spatial model specications.
C23|The foreign direct investment-institution nexus in oil-abundant countries|The present work reassesses the link between natural resources, institutional quality and foreign direct investment (FDI). In particular, we focus on the impact of good governance and democracy on foreign direct investment in oil-abundant countries. To this end, we estimate the effect of host countries’ institutions on the extensive margin (number of bilateral greenfield investment projects), using a gravity equation for a dataset that covers 182 countries during 2003-2012. Our findings confirm that compliance to rule of law, lack of corruption, political stability and democracy could boost new FDI links through the extensive margin. Our results could not rule out the “oil curse”, meaning that oil producers attract fewer new greenfield projects than similar countries without oil. Unlike other studies, we show that the impact of institutions is not necessarily undermined by the presence of natural resources.
C23|Estimation and inference for spatial models with heterogeneous coefficients: an application to U.S. house prices|This paper considers the problem of identification, estimation and inference in the case of spatial panel data models with heterogeneous spatial lag coefficients, with and without (weakly) exogenous regressors, and subject to heteroskedastic errors. A quasi maximum likelihood (QML) estimation procedure is developed and the conditions for identification of spatial coefficients are derived. Regularity conditions are established for the QML estimators of individual spatial coefficients, as well as their means (the mean group estimators), to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Small sample properties of the proposed estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo simulations for Gaussian and non-Gaussian errors, and with spatial weight matrices of differing degrees of sparsity. The simulation results are in line with the paper's key theoretical findings even for panels with moderate time dimensions, irrespective of the number of cross section units. An empirical application to U.S. house price changes during the 1975-2014 period shows a significant degree of heterogeneity in spill-over effects over the 338 Metropolitan Statistical Areas considered.
C23|Government ideology and monetary policy in OECD countries|We examine the extent to which government ideology has influenced monetary policy in OECD countries since the 1970s. In line with important changes in the global econ-omy and differences across countries, regression results yield heterogeneous infer-ences depending on the time period and the exchange rate regime/central bank de-pendence of the countries in the sample. Over the 1972-2010 period, Taylor rule speci-fications do not suggest a relationship between government ideology and monetary policy as measured by the short-term nominal interest rate or the rate of monetary expansion minus GDP trend growth. Monetary policy was, however, associated with government ideology in the 1990s: short-term nominal interest rates were lower under leftwing than rightwing governments when central banks depended on the directives of the government and exchange rates were flexible. Very independent central banks, however, raised interest rates when leftwing governments were in office. We describe the historical evidence for several individual countries.
C23|Estimation and inference in spatial models with dominant units|Estimation and inference in the spatial econometrics literature are carried out assuming that the matrix of spatial or network connections has uniformly bounded absolute column sums in the number of cross-section units, n. In this paper, we consider spatial models where this restriction is relaxed. The linear-quadratic central limit theorem of Kelejian and Prucha (2001) is generalized and then used to establish the asymptotic properties of the GMM estimator due to Lee (2007) in the presence of dominant units. A new Bias-Corrected Method of Moments estimator is also proposed that avoids the problem of weak instruments by self-instrumenting the spatially lagged dependent variable. Both estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, depending on the rate at which the maximum column sum of the weights matrix rises with n. The small sample properties of the estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments and shown to be satisfactory. An empirical application to sectoral price changes in the US over the pre- and post-2008 financial crisis is also provided. It is shown that the share of capital can be estimated reasonably well from the degree of sectoral interdependence using the input-output tables, despite the evidence of dominant sectors being present in the US economy.
C23|Political donations, public procurement and government efficiency|Firms’ political donations can induce distortions in the allocation of public procurement contracts. In this article, we employ an advanced non-parametric efficiency model to study the public sector (cost) efficiency implications of such distortions. Using a unique dataset covering the Czech regions over the 2007-2014 period, we find that the efficiency of public good provision is lower when a larger share of public procurement contracts is awarded to firms donating to the party in power (‘party donors’). We link this efficiency difference to two underlying mechanisms: i.e. shifts in procurement contract allocations from firms with previous procurement experience to party donors, and the use of less restrictive allocation procedures that benefit party donors.
C23|Style consistency and mutual fund returns: the case of Russia|This paper carries out style analysis for Russian mutual funds using monthly data from the National Managers’ Association over the period January 2008-December 2017; specifically, it applies the RSBA method developed by Sharpe (1992) for evaluating the impact of style on returns, and uses the Style Drift Score (SDS) introduced by Idzorek (2004) as a measure of a fund’s style drifting activity. The main findings can be summarised as follows. In the Russian case there is a significant positive relationship between style consistency and profitability of funds. Further, Russian funds are characterised by a high level of style drift, namely deviations from the investment strategy declared at the time of registration as required by Russian law.
C23|Kalòs kai agathòs? Government quality and cultural heritage in the regions of Europe|This paper uses panel data on over 200 regions of Europe to study the spatial distribution of UNESCO sites and the capacity of regional governments to conserve heritage, using new designations in the World Heritage List as a proxy. We test whether the location of a region matters by controlling for the stock of World Heritage in the surrounding regions, and if low regional government quality is an obstacle to inclusion of sites into the List. We find some evidence of within-country regional competition for inscription, and of a positive impact of government quality on the chances of having a UNESCO designation.
C23|Fiscal Performance of Minority Governments: New Empirical Evidence for OECD Countries|I use new data on central and general governments for 23 OECD countries over the period 1960-2015 (unbalanced panel) to examine fiscal performance under minority governments. The results do not suggest that minority governments had higher fiscal deficits and public expenditure than majority governments – corroborating many previous studies. An innovation of my study is to examine fiscal policies of minority governments that enjoy organized support of opposition parties. The results do not show that minority governments that enjoy organized support of opposition parties increased public expenditure to a larger extent than majority governments. If anything, fiscal deficits were somewhat higher under single-party minority governments with organized support of opposition parties than under majority governments especially. Minority and majority governments had quite similar fiscal performance in OECD countries.
C23|Corruption and Economic Growth: New Empirical Evidence|The nexus between corruption and economic growth has been examined for a long time. Many empirical studies measured corruption by the reversed Transparency International’s Perception of Corruption Index (CPI) and ignored that the CPI was not comparable over time. The CPI is comparable over time since the year 2012. We employ new data for 175 countries over the period 2012-2018 and re-examine the nexus between corruption and economic growth. The cumulative long-run effect of corruption on growth is that real per capita GDP decreased by around 17% when the reversed CPI increased by one standard deviation. The effect of corruption on economic growth is especially pronounced in autocracies and transmits to growth by decreasing FDI and increasing inflation.
C23|Taxation and the Superrich|This paper addresses the modern optimal tax progressivity literature, which clarifies the key role of the behavioral response to taxation and accounts for the incomes of the superrich being qualitatively different than others. Some may be “superstars,” for whom small differences in talent are magnified into much larger earnings differences, while others may work in winner-take-all markets, such that their effort to climb the ladder of success reduces the returns to others. We stress that pivotal tax-rate elasticities are not structural parameters, and will be smaller the broader and less plastic is the tax base and the more effective is the enforcement of tax evasion. For this reason, normative analysis of tax rates should be accompanied by attention to the tax base, with special attention to capital gains, which comprise a large fraction of the taxable income of the superrich.
C23|The Effects of Macroeconomic, Fiscal and Monetary Policy Announcements on Sovereign Bond Spreads: An Event Study from the EMU|We assess the impact of announcements corresponding to different fiscal and monetary policy measures on the 10-year sovereign bond yield spreads (relative to Germany) of the 10 EMU countries during the period 01:1999 - 07:2016. Implementing pooled and country-fixed effects OLS regressions, we find that the European Commission’s (EC) releases of the excessive deficit procedure significantly affect the yield spreads. The EC releases of higher debt and better budget balance forecasts contribute to the rise and the decline of spreads, respectively. Moreover, we find that the announcements of the ECB’s key interest rates together with the longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) and the first covered bond purchase programme (CBPP1) negatively affect sovereign yield spreads in our sample of EMU countries.
C23|Government ideology and monetary policy in OECD countries|We examine the extent to which government ideology has influenced monetary policy in OECD countries since the 1970s. In line with important changes in the global economy and differences across countries, regression results yield heterogeneous inferences depending on the time period and the exchange rate regime/central bank dependence of the countries in the sample. Over the 1972-2010 period, Taylor rule specifications do not suggest a relationship between government ideology and monetary policy as measured by the short-term nominal interest rate or the rate of monetary expansion minus GDP trend growth. Monetary policy was, however, associated with government ideology in the 1990s: short-term nominal interest rates were lower under leftwing than rightwing governments when central banks depended on the directives of the government and exchange rates were flexible. Very independent central banks, however, raised interest rates when leftwing governments were in office. We describe the historical evidence for several individual countries.
C23|Fiscal Performance of Minority Governments: New Empirical Evidence for OECD Countries|I use new data on central and general governments for 23 OECD countries over the period 1960-2015 (unbalanced panel) to examine fiscal performance under minority governments.

C23|Arms Production, National Defense Spending and Arms Trade: Examining Supply and Demand|Scholars have estimated demand functions for national defense spending and investigated international arms trade for a long time. The relationship between supply and demand for military goods has, however, only been examined on aggregate level or in formal models yet. I investigate how the supply of military goods by arms-producing companies and the demand for military goods by both the national government and foreign governments are related by using a panel of up to 195 arms-producing companies in 21 countries for the period 2002-2016. The results show that if the demand for national defense spending increases by 1%, the arms sales by a country’s largest arms-producing companies increase by up to 1.2%. If exports of major conventional weapons increase by 1%, sales increase by up to 0.2%. Arms imports do not affect domestic arms sales because imported and domestically produced arms are complements, and countries mainly import those arms they do not produce themselves. Country-specific estimation results suggest that differences among countries in geopolitical conditions and international relations determine whether a country’s arms industry serves economic rather than security purposes.
C23|Firms' Price, Cost and Activity Expectations: Evidence from Micro Data|Firms' expectations play a central role in modern macroeconomic models, but little is known empirically about how these are formed or whether they matter for economic outcomes. Using a novel panel data set of manufacturing firms' expectations about prices and wage rates, new orders, employment and unit costs for the United Kingdom, we document a range of stylized facts about the properties of firms' expectations and their relationship with recent experience. There is wide dispersion of expectations across firms. Expected future price and wage growth are influenced by firm-specific factors but macroeconomic factors also matter. Expectations of employment and new orders are influenced by firm-specific measures of past orders while expected unit costs seem to be influenced more by firm-specific cost pressures and aggregate import prices. After controlling for a wide range of variables we find a significant connection between past expected price and wage increases and their out-turns. But there is also strong evidence that firms' expectations are clearly not rational.
C23|Reconsideration of a simple approach to quantile regression for panel data: a comment on the Canay (2011) fixed effects estimator|The paper discusses two errors in the approach proposed in Canay (2011) for constructing a computationally simple two-step estimator in a quantile regression model with quantile-independent fixed effects. Firstly, we show that Canay's assumption about n/T^s --> 0 for some s>1 is not strong enough and can entail severe bias or even non-existence of the limiting distribution for the estimator of the vector of coefficients. The condition n/T --> 0 appears to be closer to the required set of restrictions. These problems are likely to cause incorrect inference in applied papers with large n/T, but the impact is less in applications with small n/T. In an attempt to improve Canay's estimator, we propose a simple correction which may reduce the bias. The second error concerns incorrect asymptotic standard error of the estimator of the constant term. We show that contrary to Canay's assumption, the within estimator has an influence function that is not i.i.d. and this affects inference. Moreover, the constant term is unlikely to be estimable at rate sqrt{nT}, so a different estimator may not be available. However, the issue concerning the constant term does not have an effect on slope coefficients. Finally, we give recommendations to practitioners and conduct a meta-review of applied papers that use Canay's estimator.
C23|Saddlepoint Approximations for Spatial Panel Data Models|We develop new higher-order asymptotic techniques for the Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator of the parameters in a spatial panel data model, with fixed effects, time-varying covariates, and spatially correlated errors. We introduce a new saddlepoint density and tail area approximation to improve on the accuracy of the extant asymptotics. It features relative error of order O(m to the power of -1) for m = n(T -1) with n being the cross-sectional dimension and T the time-series dimension. The main theoretical tool is the tilted-Edgeworth technique. It yields a density approximation that is always non-negative, does not need resampling, and is accurate in the tails. We provide an algorithm to implement our saddlepoint approximation and we illustrate the good performance of our method via numerical examples. Monte Carlo experiments show that, for the spatial panel data model with fixed effects and T = 2, the saddlepoint approximation yields accuracy improvements over the routinely applied first-order asymptotics and Edgeworth expansions, in small to moderate sample sizes, while preserving analytical tractability. An empirical application on the investment-saving relationship in OECD countries shows disagreement between testing results based on first-order asymptotics and saddlepoint techniques, which questions some implications based on the former.
C23|Estimation of Large Dimensional Conditional Factor Models in Finance|This chapter provides an econometric methodology for inference in large-dimensional conditional factor models in finance. Changes in the business cycle and asset characteristics induce time variation in factor loadings and risk premia to be accounted for. The growing trend in the use of disaggregated data for individual securities motivates our focus on methodologies for a large number of assets. The beginning of the chapter outlines the concept of approximate factor structure in the presence of conditional information, and develops an arbitrage pricing theory for large-dimensional factor models in this framework. Then we distinguish between two different cases for inference depending on whether factors are observable or not. We focus on diagnosing model specification, estimating conditional risk premia, and testing asset pricing restrictions under increasing cross-sectional and time series dimensions. At the end of the chapter, we review some of the empirical findings and contrast analysis based on individual stocks and standard sets of portfolios. We also discuss the impact on computing time-varying cost of equity for a firm, and summarize differences between results for developed and emerging markets in an international setting.
C23|Firm Ownership And Green Patents. Does Family Involvement In Business Matter?|This paper investigates how family and non-family firms differ in terms of their capability to introduce environmental innovation, which is measured by green patents. The analysis is carried out using a large patenting data set related to the inventions produced by about 4200 Italian manufacturing firms over the period 2009–2017. The results show that family firms are less likely than non-family firms to implement innovations in green technologies. Moreover, the role played by the stock of knowledge and the environmental management system certification differs across firm type.
C23|Cultivos de Coca y Violencia: El cambio después de iniciados los diálogos de paz|Con la salida de las FARC, el grupo guerrillero que monopolizó el mercado de la cocaína y el mayor causante de violencia en el país, se vuelve relevante estudiar el comportamiento del mercado de las drogas y los cambios en las dinámicas de violencia. El propósito de este trabajo es analizar el impacto que tiene ser un municipio cocalero en la violencia regional y ver cómo dicho impacto se comporta después de empezados los Diálogos para la Paz en 2012. Los modelos empleados demuestran que la presencia de cultivos de coca entre los años 2000 y 2017 incrementa en 11,1% el índice de violencia, y que el impacto es 2,35% más fuerte después de 2012.
C23|La dinámica espacial de la coca en Colombia: ¿cómo una hidra?|Una aproximación empírica para 2012-2016 a la eficacia y eficiencia de las políticas de control de los cultivos de coca. Lo primero según un modelo espacial de datos de panel, desagregando la expansión según las contribuciones del contagio espacial, de las políticas de control y su efecto balón, así como de factores exógenos. Mientras lo segundo, mediante la simulación de réplicas espaciales o efectos de largo plazo sugiere diferencias de eficiencia entre los instrumentos de política.
C23|Determinantes de la productividad agrícola|Uno de los grandes desafíos que enfrenta el país es disminuir la desproporción en el desarrollo social y económico de las zonas urbanas y rurales. Para entender los retos detrás de este desafío es necesario tener una mirada comprensiva de las diferencias en las condiciones urbanas y rurales, tanto en términos de inclusión social, como productiva. En términos sociales los datos parecen mostrar la existencia de un círculo perverso que limita la acumulación de educación en las zonas rurales que, junto con unas bajas opciones de inserción productiva, conduce a un mercado de trabajo con unas condiciones precarias de empleabilidad, que se ve reflejado en bajos ingresos y pobreza. En cuanto al sector productivo, se observa que el acervo de condiciones naturales del país se encuentra en un nivel bajo de utilización, al mismo tiempo aquellos recursos que se utilizan no responden a su verdadera vocación productiva. En esa vía, se indago por los niveles de productividad agrícola y sus determinantes para varios cultivos (agroindustriales, frutales y cereales), teniendo en cuenta los diferentes niveles de la actividad agrícola: las características propias de los productores y de sus unidades productivas; de los aspectos institucionales con los que se cuenta (acceso a crédito, instrumentos de fomento, etc.), así como los aspectos las características geográficas (distancia a los centros principales de acopio, facilidad de acceso a los mercado, etc.).
C23|Good Carry, Bad Carry|We distinguish between ”good” and ”bad” carry trades constructed from G-10 currencies. The good trades exhibit higher Sharpe ratios and sometimes positive return skewness, in contrast to the bad trades that have both substantially lower Sharpe ratios and highly negative return skewness. Surprisingly, good trades do not involve the most typical carry currencies like the Australian dollar and Japanese yen. The distinction between good and bad carry trades significantly alters our understanding of currency carry trade returns, and invalidates, for example, explanations invoking return skewness and crash risk.
C23|Currency Factors|We examine the ability of existing and new factor models to explain the comovements of G10- currency changes, measured using the novel concept of “currency baskets”, representing the overall movement of a particular currency. Using a clustering technique, we find a clear two-block structure in currency comovements with the first block containing mostly the dollar currencies, and the other the European currencies. A factor model incorporating this “clustering” factor and two additional factors, a commodity currency factor and a “world” factor based on trading volumes, fits currency basket correlations much better than extant factors, such as value and carry, do. In particular, it explains on average about 60% of currency variation and generates a root mean squared error relative to sample correlations of only 0.11. The model also fits comovements in emerging market currencies well. Economically, the correlations between currency baskets underlying the factor structure are inversely related to the physical distances between countries. The factor structure is also related to the exposure of the corresponding pricing kernels with respect to the global pricing kernel and is apparent in cross-country retail sales growth data.
C23|On Event Study Designs and Distributed-Lag Models: Equivalence, Generalization and Practical Implications|We discuss important features and pitfalls of panel-data event study designs. We derive the following main results: First, event study designs and distributed-lag models are numerically identical leading to the same parameter estimates after correct reparametrization. Second, binning of effect window endpoints allows identification of dynamic treatment effects even when no never-treated units are present. Third, classic dummy variable event study designs can be naturally generalized to models that account for multiple events of different sign and intensity of the treatment, which are particularly interesting for research in labor economics and public finance.
C23|Education and Conflict: Evidence from a Policy Experiment in Indonesia|This paper studies the impact of school construction on the likelihood of conflict, drawing on a policy experiment in Indonesia, and collecting our own novel dataset on political violence for 289 districts in Indonesia over the period 1955-1994. We find that education has a strong, robust and quantitatively sizeable conflict-reducing impact. It is shown that the channels of transmission are both related to economic factors as well as to an increase in inter-religious trust and tolerance. Interestingly, while societal mechanisms are found to have an immediate impact, economic channels only gain importance after some years. We also show that school construction results in a shift away from violent means of expression (armed conflict) towards non-violent ones (peaceful protests).
C23|Which Sanctions Matter? Analysis of the EU/Russian Sanctions of 2014|In this paper we use a natural experiment of reciprocal imposition of trade sanctions by Russia and the EU since 2014. Using UNCTAD/BACI bilateral flows data we take this unique opportunity to analyse both sanctions. In particular, we study the effectiveness of narrow versus broadly defined sanctions, and differences in the effectiveness of sanctions imposed on exports and imports. We show that the Russian sanctions imposed on European and American food imports resulted in about 8 times stronger decline in trade flows than those imposed by the EU and the US on exports of extraction equipment. These results do not appear to be driven by diversion of trade flows via non-sanctioning countries. Hence the difference in sanctions' effectiveness can be attributed to the broader range of sanctioned goods and potentially to a stronger position of enforcement of sanctions on imports rather than exports.
C23|Do high‐quality local institutions shape labour productivity in Western European manufacturing firms?|We investigate the extent to which regional institutional quality shapes firm labour productivity in Western Europe, using a sample of manufacturing firms from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain, observed over the period 2009–2014. The results indicate that regional institutional quality positively affects firms' labour productivity and that government effectiveness is the most important institutional determinant of productivity levels. However, how institutions shape labour productivity depends on the type of firm considered. Smaller, less capital endowed and high‐tech sectors are three of the types of firms whose productivity is most favourably affected by good and effective institutions at the regional level. Se investiga en qué medida la calidad institucional regional determina la productividad laboral de las empresas en Europa Occidental, para lo cual se utiliza una muestra de empresas manufactureras de Alemania, Austria, Bélgica, España, Francia, Italia y Portugal, observadas durante el período 2009–2014. Los resultados indican que la calidad institucional regional afecta positivamente la productividad laboral de las empresas y que la efectividad del gobierno es el determinante institucional más importante de los niveles de productividad. Sin embargo, la forma en que las instituciones determinan la productividad laboral depende del tipo de empresa considerada. Los sectores más pequeños, los menos dotados de capital y los de alta tecnología son tres de los tipos de empresas cuya productividad se ve afectada de manera más favorable por instituciones buenas y eficaces a nivel regional. 本稿では、オーストリア、ベルギー、フランス、ドイツ、イタリア、ポルトガル、スペインの製造業企業のサンプルデータを用いて、2009~2014年の間の西欧の企業の労働生産性は、どの程度、地方制度の質により決定されたのかを検討する。結果は、地方制度の質は企業の労働生産性に正の影響を与えること、生産性のレベルを決める制度的決定要因の中では政府の効率性 (government effectiveness)が最も重要であることを示している。しかし、制度がどのように労働生産性を決めるのかは企業のタイプに依存する。小規模、小資本、ハイテク、以上の3つのタイプのセクターの生産性が、地域レベルで優良かつ効率的な制度から最も好ましい影響を受けている。
C23|Economic Growth, Energy Intensity and the Energy Mix|This paper explores how changes in energy intensity and the switch to renewables can boost economic growth. To do so, we implement a dynamic panel data approach on a sample of 134 countries over the period 1960 to 2010. We incorporate a set of control variables, related to human and physical capital, socio-economic conditions, policies and institutions, which have been widely used in the literature on economic growth. Given the current state of technology, improving energy intensity is growth enhancing at the worldwide level. Moreover, conditional to energy intensity, moving from fossil fuels to frontier renewables (wind, solar, wave or geothermic) is also positively correlated with growth. Our results are robust to the specification of the dynamic panel with respect to alternative approaches (pooled OLS, within group or system GMM), and to alternative specifications (accounting for heterogeneity across countries, a set of institutional factors, and other technical aspects).
C23|Investment Climate Effects on Alternative Firm-Level Productivity Measures|Developing countries are increasingly concerned about improving country competitiveness and productivity. Investment Climate surveys (ICs) at the firm level, are becoming the standard way for the World Bank to identify key obstacles to country competitiveness. This paper develops a general to specific econometric methodology, based on firm level observable fixed effects that generate robust investment climate effects (elasticities) on total factor productivity (TFP). By robust IC elasticities on TFP we mean elasticity estimates with equal signs and of similar magnitudes for several competing TFP measures. We apply this econometric methodology to the IC survey of Costa Rica showing how robust the investment climate effects are for several measures of TFP when conditioning on relevant plant-level information that is usually unobserved. For the economic evaluation we estimate the marginal effects of each IC variable on TFP as well as their IC impacts on average TFP obtaining important economic differences. These IC estimates are obtained from five blocks of IC variables, (i) infrastructure, (ii) red tape, corruption and crime, (iii) finance and corporate governance, (iv) quality, innovation and labor skills and (v) other control variables, could be used as benchmarks to assess cross-country IC assessments of TFP.
C23|The Impact of EU Funds on Regional Economic Growth of the Czech Republic|This research paper aims to estimate the impact of European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) on economic growth of the Czech Republic during the period 2004-2015 using panel data regression techniques. ESIF are instruments of European economic and social cohesion policies. The primary goal of these policies is to foster economic growth and convergence among the member states of the European Union through the reallocation of financial resources from ESIF. During 2004-2015, the Czech Republic was involved in three programming periods in which projects of an approximate value of 939 billion CZK were supported and implemented. The contribution from ESIF was approximately 757 billion CZK while 182 billion CZK were allocated from national resources. Besides the standard panel data regression techniques like pooled OLS or FE, a spatial panel data econometric method is employed. Evidence of this research shows a positive relationship between ESIF and economic growth of NUTS3 regions of the Czech Republic. Furthermore, the results also suggest economic convergence among NUTS3 regions of the Czech Republic.
C23|What Drives the Distributional Dynamics of Client Interest Rates on Consumer Loans in the Czech Republic?|We study determinants of the bank-level distributional dynamics of client interest rates on consumer loans in the Czech Republic in the recent period 2014–2019 when banks started to provide new consumer loans at very low interest rates. We build on the relevant literature in terms of the selected explanatory variables as well as the methodological approach and use regulatory data that enable us to work with the mean, median and the mode of the distribution of client interest rates on consumer loans. We show that development of the market rate, the NPL ratio as well as the unemployment rate facilitated the observed distributional dynamics. Further, using a variety of variables on market competition/market concentration, our analysis reveals that the role of this determinant is limited at best. Our results, especially regarding the pass through from market rates to consumer loan rates, are mostly in line with the international literature but are novel in the Czech context.
C23|Open or Closed? How List Type Affects Electoral Performance, Candidate Selection, and Campaign Effort| What effect does using open (as opposed to closed) lists in proportional representation elections have on party performance and the quality of candidate selection? We provide novel evidence by studying local elections in Colombia, where parties have discretion to field either open or closed lists. Using panel data covering the 1,100 Colombian municipalities for the 2003â€“2015 period, we leverage within-party, within-municipality, and over-time variation to identify the effect of ballot structure. We find that the adoption of open list dramatically increases partiesâ€™ vote and seat shares. Semi-structured interviews with a representative sample of candidates reveal that parties that use closed list struggle to attract high-quality candidates and to incentivize them to campaign. Consistent with these mechanisms, our statistical analyses confirm that open-list candidates are more experienced, more engaged in their constituencies and campaigns, and less likely to have committed election fraud in the past.
C23|Equilibrium real exchange rate estimates across time and space|Equilibrium real exchange rate and corresponding misalignment estimates differ tremendously depending on the panel estimation method used to derive them. Essentially, these methods differ in their treatment of the time-series (time) and the cross-section (space) variation in the panel. The study shows that conventional panel estimation methods (pooled OLS, fixed, random, and between effects) can be interpreted as restricted versions of a correlated random effects (CRE) model. It formally derives the distortion that arises if these restrictions are violated and uses two empirical applications from the literature to show that the distortion is generally very large. This suggests the use of the CRE model for the panel estimation of equilibrium real exchange rates and misalignments.
C23|Duration Dependence, Monetary Policy Asymmetries, and the Business Cycle|We produce business cycle chronologies for U.S. states and evaluate the factors that change the probability of moving from one phase to another. We find strong evidence for positive duration dependence in all business cycle phases but find that the effect is modest relative to other state- and national-level factors. Monetary policy shocks also have a strong influence on the transition probabilities in a highly asymmetric way. The effect of policy shocks depends on the current state of the cycle as well as the sign and size of the shock.
C23|Pre-event Trends in the Panel Event-study Design|"We consider a linear panel event-study design in which unobserved confounds may be related both to the outcome and to the policy variable of interest. We provide sufficient conditions to identify the causal effect of the policy by exploiting covariates related to the policy only through the confounds. Our model implies a set of moment equations that are linear in parameters. The effect of the policy can be estimated by 2SLS, and causal inference is valid even when endogeneity leads to pre-event trends (""pre-trends"") in the outcome. Alternative approaches perform poorly in our simulations."
C23|Housing uncertainty and the transition to parenthood among Britainâ€™s â€œGeneration Rentâ€|The literature suggests a positive link between homeownership and transition to parenthood. However, couplesâ€™ preferences to become homeowners before having their first child have been undermined by rising housing uncertainty and housing unaffordability over recent decades. Britain is an archetype example: homeownership rates have fallen markedly among young adults as a result of low wages, precarious employment, reductions in the availability of mortgage credit, and rising house prices, generating a housing crisis. Using longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey (1991-2008) and the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (2009-2016), and applying multilevel discrete-time event-history techniques on a sample of women aged 18-42, we investigate whether and how the link between housing tenure and first birth has changed over recent decades in Britain. We find that, in comparison to the 1990s, the likelihood of becoming a parent has declined among homeowners in recent years, whereas childbearing rates among private renters have remained stable. Thus owner occupiers and private renters have become more similar in terms of their likelihood of entering parenthood. Overall, our findings question the classical micro-level assumption of a positive link between homeownership and transition to parenthood, at least among Britainâ€™s â€œGeneration Rentâ€ .
C23|Optimism, Pessimism and Life Satisfaction: An Empirical Investigation|This empirical investigation into life satisfaction, using nationally representative German panel data, finds a substantial association with an individual’s thoughts about the future, whether they are optimistic or pessimistic about it. Furthermore, including individuals’ optimism and pessimism about the future substantially increases the explanatory power of standard life satisfaction models. The thoughts that individuals have about the future contribute substantially to their current life satisfaction. In particular, the reduction in life satisfaction experienced by individuals who report being pessimistic is greater than that for well-understood negative events like unemployment. These effects are attenuated but remain substantial after controlling for individual fixed effects, statistically matching on observable variables between optimistic and pessimistic individuals, and addressing the potential endogeneity of optimism and pessimism to life satisfaction. Moreover, these effects are robust to controlling for future life events that may be anticipated.
C23|Hit them in the Wallet! An Analysis of the Indian Demonetization as a Counter-Insurgency Policy|In this paper, we study empirically how a policy targeting the cash-funding system of armed groups affects criminal activities, focusing on the 2016 Indian Banknote Demonetization as a natural experiment. We take advantage of a unique dataset on daily surrenders of the Maoist insurgents in India between 2006 and 2018. In order to measure the exposure of the conflict to the policy in different districts, we use three sources of access to funding for Maoists, namely mineral resources, public works’ contractors and forest products. Our results suggest that there is a positive and significant impact of the demonetization on surrenders of Maoist extremists. We find a lower increase in surrenders where insurgents have higher abilities to raise new cash through mineral resources and public works, while we find a sharper increase in districts that rely on subsistence agriculture. This paper provides evidence that policies that curb illicit cash flows have the desired impact of deterring illegal and violent activities.
C23|Employment Protection Legislation Impacts on Capital and Skills Composition|[eng] The article investigates the effects of Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) on capital and skills according to the intensity of international competition. Grounded on a panel data sample for 14 OECD countries and 18 industries from 1988 to 2007, and a difference-in-difference approach, we find that strengthening EPL: (i) leads to a capital-labour substitution in favour of non ICT non R&D capital to the detriment of employment, this effect being mitigated in industries highly exposed to international competition; (ii) lowers ICT capital and, even more severely, R&D capital relatively to other capital components; and (iii) works at the relative disadvantage of low-skilled workers. Strengthening EPL can therefore be an impediment to organizational and so technological change and risk taking on globalized markets. An illustrative simulation suggests that structural reforms weakening EPL could have a significant favorable impact on firms’ ICT and R&D investment and on hiring low-skilled workers.
C23|Threefold policies for bank development: Do independence and transparency matter?|A well-developed banking sector is crucial to achieve a sustained economic growth. To attain this goal, both central banks and government have embraced operational and institutional arrangements. In this paper, I offer an empirical lookup on how monetary independence and transparency of macroprudential and fiscal policies are linked to bank development. Drawing upon a panel dataset for the period 1998-2014, I find that both macroprudential transparency (proxied by central bank financial stability transparency) and fiscal transparency are positively related to the share of credit granted by banks to the private sector, implying that more transparency enhances bank development. More independence from central banks seems, however, to decrease the ratio of bank credit to GDP. By considering interactions, the marginal effect of central bank financial stability transparency on bank credit/GDP, conditional on the levels of independence, is positive but decreases under a particular range of independence values. If central bank independence interacts with fiscal transparency, the marginal effect of fiscal transparency is positive and significant over a specific range of the degree of central bank independence but there is no statistical support that the marginal effect decreases within the same range unless I use the independence index of Garriga (2016).
C23|Rent Creation And Rent Sharing: New Measures And Impacts On Total Factor Productivity|This analysis proposes new measures of rent creation and rent sharing and assesses their impact on productivity on cross‐country‐industry panel data. We find first that: (1) anticompetitive product market regulations positively affect rent creation and (2) employment protection legislation boosts hourly wages, particularly for low‐skill workers. However, we find no significant impact of this employment legislation on rent sharing, as the hourly wage increases are offset by a negative impact on hours worked. Second, using regulation indicators as instruments, we find that rent creation and rent sharing both have a substantial negative impact on total factor productivity.

C23|Non-linear relationship between real commodity price volatility and real effective exchange rate: The case of commodity-exporting countries|The aim of this paper is to contribute to the existing literature by exploring the relationship between the real commodity price volatilities and the real effective exchange rate (REER) of commodity-exporting countries, taking into account the transition variable of financial market integration. To this end, we consider a sample of 42 commodity-exporting countries subdivided into 4 panels: food and beverages, energy, metals, and raw materials. Our results highlight that the relationship between real commodity price volatility and REER is non-linear and depends on the degree of financialization of the commodity market. Specifically, when a country is poorly integrated financially, the volatility of the real commodity price has a strong and negative impact on the variation in REER. However, for periods when a country is better integrated financially, we observe a decrease in the impact of real commodity price volatility on REER, especially for the two panels of food and beverages as well as energy. Our findings also highlight the growth of financialization of commodities post-2000, particularly in the case of the energy sector.
C23|From residential energy demand to fuel poverty: income-induced non-linearities in the reactions of households to energy price fluctuations|The residential energy demand is growing steadily and the trend is expected to continue in the near future. At the same time, under the impulse of economic crises and environmental and energy policies, many households have experienced reductions in real income and higher energy prices. In the residential sector, the number of fuel-poor households is thus expected to rise. A better understanding of the determinants of residential energy demand, in particular of the role of income and the sensitivity of households to changes in energy prices, is crucial in the context of recurrent debates on energy efficiency and fuel poverty. We propose a panel threshold regression (PTR) model to empirically test the sensitivity of French households to energy price fluctuations Ð as measured by the elasticity of residential heating energy prices Ð and to analyze the overlap between their income and fuel poverty profiles. The PTR model allows to test for the non-linear effect of income on the reactions of households to fluctuations in energy prices. Thus, it can identify specific regimes differing by their level of estimated price elasticities. Each regime represents an elasticity-homogeneous group of households. The number of these regimes is determined based on an endogenously PTR-fixed income threshold. Thereafter, we analyze the composition of the regimes (i.e. groups) to locate the dominant proportion of fuel-poor households and analyse their monetary poverty characteristics. Results show that, depending on the income level, we can identify two groups of households that react differently to residential energy price fluctuations and that fuel-poor households belong mostly to the group of households with the highest elasticity. By extension, results also show that income poverty does not necessarily mean fuel poverty. In terms of public policy, we suggest focusing on income heterogeneity by considering different groups of households separately when defining energy efficiency measures. We also suggest paying particular attention to targeting fuel-poor households by examining the overlap between fuel and income poverty.

C23|Euro Area Sovereign Yields and the Power of Unconventional Monetary Policy|We assess the determinants of long-term sovereign yield spreads, vis-a-vis Germany, using a panel of 10 Euro area countries over the period 1999.01–2016.07 notably regarding the ECB’s conventional and unconventional monetary policies. Our findings indicate that the international risk, the bid-ask spread and real effective exchange rate increased the 10-year sovereign bond yield spreads, while sovereign ratings’ improvements decreased the spreads. Moreover, Longer-term Refinancing Operations and the Securities Market Program decreased the yield spreads. The overall announcements of the unconventional policies also significantly decreased the yield spreads, notably in the periphery countries.
C23|Why Did EU Banks Change Their Business Models in Last Years and What Was the Impact of Net Fee and Commission Income on Their Performance?|This paper contributes to the current literature dealing with the drivers of bank business model changes by analyzing the relationship between fee and commission income share and banks’ performance in terms of profitability, risk and risk-adjusted profitability in the European Union. We apply System Generalized Method of Moments on a unique data set of 329 EU banks in 2005-2014 period. We did not find any diversification benefits by increasing the fee income share based on which we conclude that increase in fee income share observed during last years in EU banks was driven mainly by external factors like increased competition rather than by internal reasons. As expected higher reliance on equity financing and better quality of provided loans enhance banks’ performance. Finally, bank business strategy and macroeconomic factors are crucial in the determination of banks’ performance.
C23|Victorian Voting: Party Orientation and Class Alignment Revisited| Much of what we know about the alignment of voters with parties comes from mass surveys of the electorate in the postwar period or from aggregate electoral data. Using individual elector level panel data from the 19th century UK poll books, we reassess the development of a party-centred electorate in the United Kingdom. We show that (i) the electorate was party-centred by the time of the extension of the franchise in 1867; (ii) a decline in candidate-centred voting is largely attributable to changes in the behaviour of the working class and (iii) the enfranchised working class aligned with the Liberal left. This early alignment of the working class with the left cannot entirely be explained by a decrease in vote buying. The evidence suggests instead that the alignment was based on the programmatic appeal of the Liberals. We argue that these facts can plausibly explain the subsequent development of the party system.
C23|Effects of Municipal Mergers on Voter Turnout| We study the effects of municipal mergers on voter turnout in a difference-in-differences framework, using data from a wave of municipal mergers in Finland in 2009. Analysing two pre-merger elections and three post-merger elections, spanning a total of 17 years, we find that municipal mergers decrease voter turnout by 4 percentage points in the long run in the relatively small municipalities compared to similar small municipalities that did not merge. As the average turnout rate prior to merging in this group was around 69%, this is a substantial effect. We also find that virtually nothing happens to turnout in the municipalities that were relatively large within their merger. Furthermore, mergers are associated with a decrease in votersâ€™ political efficacy and turnout decreases more in those municipalities that experience larger decreases in efficacy.
C23|Public Procurement versus Laissez-Faire: Evidence from Household Waste Collection| We document that switching from laissez-faire production to public procurement in residential waste collection in Finland reduces the number of firms active in the local market, but induces a statistically significant and large decrease in unit prices on average. While public procurement, thus, seems to be desirable from the citizensâ€™ perspective, not all municipalities adopt public procurement. We provide descriptive evidence that municipal council composition is associated with the chosen regime. This suggests that local politics may be one obstacle for the efficient provision of local public goods.
C23|A Closer Look at the Behavior of Uncertainty and Disagreement: Micro Evidence from the Euro Area|This paper examines point and density forecasts of real GDP growth, inflation and unemployment from the European Central Bank’s Survey of Professional Forecasters. We present individual uncertainty measures and introduce individual point- and density-based measures of disagreement. The data indicate substantial heterogeneity and persistence in respondents’ uncertainty and disagreement, with uncertainty associated with prominent respondent effects and disagreement associated with prominent time effects. We also examine the co-movement between uncertainty and disagreement and find an economically insignificant relationship that is robust to changes in the volatility of the forecasting environment. This provides further evidence that disagreement is not a reliable proxy for uncertainty.
C23|Mean group estimation in presence of weakly cross-correlated estimators|This paper extends the mean group (MG) estimator for random coefficient panel data models by allowing the underlying individual estimators to be weakly cross correlated. This can arise, for example, in panels with spatially correlated errors. We establish that the MG estimator is asymptotically correctly centered, and its asymptotic covariance matrix can be consistently estimated. In contrast with the homogeneous case, the random coefficient specification allows for correct inference even when nothing is known about the weak cross-sectional dependence of the errors.
